The contributors (moderators, speakers, discussants and participants) provided invaluable information. The programme for the seminar had been drawn up by Eurostat, high-level Tacis statistical advisers, the State Committee of the Russian Federation on Statistics (Goskomstat), and the Inter-state Statistical Committee of the CIS. The administrative and financial aspects of the seminar were dealt with by CESD-Communautaire and Eurostat, and the logistics and organisational aspects were handled by the Goskomstat of Russia and the St. Petersburg Committee of State Statistics, which provided all the conditions necessary for a fruitful discussion and a pleasant stay with the support of the Tacis Technical Office of St. Petersburg. The Russian version of the proceedings of the seminar was drawn up by the Interstate Statistical Committee of the CIS and the English version by Eurostat A5. ",

CHERNOMYRDIN TO THE SEMINAR PARTICIPANTS SL Petersburg, Russia To the participants of the international seminar on \"An appraisal of and the outlook for statistics in the transitional period in countries participating in the Tacis programme since 1991: where we were, where we are and where we are going\" Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation I would like to welcome the participants to the high-level international seminar on statistics: the heads of the statistical offices of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Mongolia, the Baltic countries, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Great Britain, Sweden, Finland and also the statistical departments of international organisations: UN, Eurostat, UN ECE, UN ESCAP, IMF, the World Bank, OECD and ILO. The seminar will see a summing-up by the statistical offices of the CIS countries of the work completed in the Tacis programme and will analyse what has been achieved in improving statistical recording to meet the requirements of a market economy. Just a few days ago, the Government of the Russian Federation approved a draft special federal programme for reforming statistics from 1997 to 2000. We are expecting that the combined effect of completing the transition to an internationally accepted system of accounts and reporting, introducing advanced methods of data collection, modernising equipment and processes and consistently aiming to satisfy the demand for information will ensure a qualitative improvement in the statistical basis and a radical expansion of its potential to objectively and comprehensively reflect the socio-economic phenomena and transformations in society. I hope that the experience gained in the course of this international seminar will serve to accomplish this task better and more fully. I wish all the participants success in their work. I am sure that the results will assist in combining efforts to further develop statistics, thus contributing to economic reforms and social progress. The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Mr V. CHERNOMYRDIN ",

        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go FOREWORD This volume contains the papers, discussants' comments and audience discussions relating to the seminar \"Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis countries since 1991: Where we were, Where we are, Where we go\", held on 2-6 September 1996 in St. Petersburg. The seminar was organised by Eurostat and CESD-Communautaire for the Presidents of the Statistical Offices of the New Independent States (NIS), with the assistance of the State Committee of the Russian Federation on Statistics (Goskomstat), Statistical Committee of the City of St. Petersburg and the Interstate Statistical Committee of the CIS. It built on the dialogue which began in December 1992 through meetings devoted to discussing the main issues to be faced by these countries in reforming their statistical systems. The previous seminars dealt with: statistical information systems in a market economy; strategy for statistical computing; experience of statistical transition by Central European countries. This time the floor was given primarily to the Presidents of the statistical offices of the NIS and Mongolia, who presented their work over the last five years, thus allowing the western partners to assess the impact of the first co-operation period and consider new prospects for future joint work. Apart from representatives from all the NIS and Mongolia, the seminar was also attended by representatives of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, and representatives from the regional statistical offices of Russia and Russian training institutes. The moderators of the seminar were representatives of international organisations, the International Monetary Fund, the UN-Economic Commission for Europe, the World Bank, the OECD and the European Commission, and the discussants were representatives of the EU Member States. The venue was the Mariynskiy Dvoretz, the St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly, which was kindly offered by the Vice-Governor of the City. These proceedings are structured in accordance with the seminar presentation. Each session, chaired by a different moderator, presents papers, followed by comments by the discussants and discussion from the floor. Session I is devoted to legislation on statistics, the current situation in Tacis countries and the prospects of the legal framework and its practical application, including statistical confidentiality. Session II deals with the organisation and management of statistical activities: organisation of central and regional departments and relations between them, situation in terms of staff (quantity, qualification, organisation of internal training), strategy and organisation for the use of information technology in statistical work. In Session III the discussion focuses on relations and co-ordination among national administrations (in particular concerning business registers, business statistics, foreign trade statistics and the balance of payments). In Session IV the participants report on progress made and plans to conform to international standards. Session V is devoted to the modernisation of data collection: survey methods, use of sampling techniques, use of registers, and use of administrative sources. ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Session VI focuses on dissemination policy and relations with the users of statistics: government, citizens and media, the private sector, research agents and international organisations. Conclusions are drawn and recommendations are given by high-level statistical advisers on co operation with Tacis countries. 10 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go WELCOME DMITRY SERGEEV - FIRST DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF ST. PETERSBURG Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of the Government of St. Petersburg and Governor Vladimir Anatolevich Yakovlev, welcome to our city! It was with great interest that we learned of the proposal by Eurostat, Mr Franchet and the Chairman of Goskomstat Russia, Yury Alexeyevich Yurkov, and consented to this High-Level Tacis seminar on Statistics being held in St. Petersburg. The topic of this seminar is \"Evaluation and Prospects for Transition in Statistics in Countries Participating in the Tacis Programme since 1991: where we were, where we are, and where we are going.\" We believe that this is highly significant for the Russian economy at its present stage of development. The City of St. Petersburg occupies a prominent position in all areas of Russia's active economic and political life. It is very important to us that the primary information which is obtained using statistical methods and has to be correctly used, is appropriate to modern times. We in Russia are in a transitional period, when economic structures are changing and there are no standard, ready-made solutions for obtaining final results from our activities. It is therefore crucially important at this stage that the measures and special solutions designed to alleviate the present situation and secure future development should be based on accurate, well-processed primary information. The City of St. Petersburg is experiencing change: for example, in forms of ownership and budgetary resources. The structure of the city, with its scientific and technical potential, is now leaning more and more towards the development of service industries. There is a qualitative change in the city's economy. It is crucial for us to understand these trends and evaluate the effects of change. It is proving difficult to set our industrial complex on a new course. State orders have fallen considerably: whereas, 10 years ago, 80% of industry worked to strict state orders, today, the figure is 10%. It is proving difficult to change the structure of the budget. All these factors and qualitative changes have to be taken into account and correctly evaluated so that the right conclusions can be drawn. This can be achieved with the help of modern statistical methods, which will give us a clear orientation. This is why we are so pleased that this High-level seminar is being held in our city, and we will be following its results with the utmost interest. We hope that you will like our city. In addition to the meetings which you will be holding with specialists, we shall be laying on a sight-seeing trip. We want you to take home some favourable impressions of St. Petersburg. On behalf of the Government of St. Petersburg, I should like to thank Mr Franchet and Yury Alexeyevich Yurkov for their decision to hold this seminar in our city. It is of great significance for statistical science in Russia, the CIS and other countries. Thank you. 1 1 ",

I think you will all be aware ofthat Committee, formerly called the Ripert Committee after its first Chairman from 1991 to 1995. At a Eurostat/Tacis seminar on statistics in Luxembourg in 1993, Mr Ripert referred to the objectives and work of that committee. This meeting in St. Petersburg offers an opportunity to update you briefly on the activities of this Committee. The purpose of the Committee has mainly been as a mechanism to co-ordinate the technical assistance activities of international donor agencies and, through them, the activities of bilateral donor agencies in their member countries. Of course the Steering Committee recognised that the responsibility for co ordinating the efforts of donor agencies must ultimately lie with the recipient countries. It meets about 6 monthly. Now let me mention the recent and some proposed future activities of the Committee. First, obviously my Russian colleagues will be aware, but some others may not know that the Steering Committee held a joint meeting with the Goskomstat of Russia in Moscow in April 1995 as a means of improving the dialogue between donor and recipient organisations. I know the Steering Committee considered that joint meeting to be valuable. The second of such meetings is proposed to be held in Kiev early next year. Another activity under way is to prepare the Second Report of the Committee to the heads of international organisations which, among other matters, will discuss the proposed future role and work of the committee. I understand the report will be completed in the few months and distributed to the authorities of member countries of international organisation - including of course FSU countries. I feel sure the Committee will be seeking to further advance the development of statistics in FSU countries * * * SPEAKER: YURI YURKOV - CHAIRMAN, STATE COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS The question on the agenda of this seminar: where we were, where we are now and where we are going, does, of course, require serious consideration, and not from the point of view of an evaluation, as it was done in the past: first and foremost we must plan the course of future work. Every country in the transitional period undoubtedly has its own problems and reforms are primarily carried out at national level, but nevertheless there are obviously problems we have in common which can be more suitably, effectively and economically tackled jointly. I would like to say that in the Russian Federation, as a result of nearly four years' work, we have succeeded, at federal level, in introducing many methodologies which are used in countries with 15 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go market economies. Basic national accounts have been introduced, and price statistics have been established and are being further developed. We are working together with the Central Bank to publish the balance of payments. Work has been carried out in other areas too. The first stage has thus been completed and fairly successfully at that. However, Russian statistics have run up against an extremely complex situation where traditionally developed methods, including those in countries with market economies, cannot always be used to good effect in our country. There are very many factors involved here, but the main one from an economic point of view is the extremely serious problem of the black economy, a part of the economy which produces gross product but does not officially participate in economic relations between states. And in this connection, of course, many statistical indicators which we receive on the basis of business data, require serious analytical interpretation and, not to put too fine a point on it, without prior adjustment these data are unable to provide worthwhile information. I do not know what the situation is in other states, but in Russia the commonly agreed estimate of gross domestic product in the black economy, as we say, is in the order of 25%. We have been criticised in that this figure is said to be too low; some experts put it at around 40-50%, but they can only actually confirm, albeit by indirect data, a figure of 25%. But this gross domestic product, and, for example, the volume of commodity circulation, is already 50%, and in the large cities it is already approaching 70%. And if we take any sector of the economy, then practically all the data require analytical reinterpretation. And in this connection, I am always very mistrustful of indicators which are based on or which are given with the comment \"specially registered enterprises\" or some group of enterprises, because it is quite clear that the market economy in our states, or let us say Russia, is at the initial stage. The rules of the game have not been clearly established, and there is no normal, detailed legislative base. Moreover, the normative documents which are adopted by Parliament on the one hand, and on the other through presidential decrees or governmental decisions, often contradict one another. And there are still problems in establishing standards and legislation at regional level, in Russia at least. And that is why the state statistical bodies are working in conditions of extremely serious legal uncertainty, not from the point of view of their status but from that of the economy itself. Under these conditions we have analysed the situation as we found it. Working together with other economic departments we have prepared a draft comprehensive federal programme called the Federal Programme of Statistical Reform. Last Thursday the Government considered and approved it. The cost of the programme is very high. But the main task which we set out in this programme (as you can see, the words \"transitional principles of accounting and statistics\" are not used) is further reform of Russian statistics, essentially on the basis of principles commonly accepted in the world statistical community, but nevertheless taking account of the actual legal, economic and political situation in Russia. And one of the main thrusts of this programme is to develop as far as possible the methodology and organisation for receiving information on the black economy and on its structure and in other areas. Apart from that, the federal programme also envisages the overhaul of the whole system of monitoring, especially in the social sphere, together with the corresponding ministries and departments we propose carrying out monitoring of health, the family, the environment and many other areas. What is special about monitoring today? It is not only statistical data and perhaps, not so much statistical data. It is statistical data which, at the same time, are accompanied by a qualitative analysis of the situation to a certain extent, and this work will be done both by the state statistical bodies of Russia and the corresponding ministries. For example, health monitoring will be carried out by Goskomstat of Russia and the Russian Ministry of Health. And for one simple reason of which I have 16 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go already spoken. We do not place much faith in the data which are currently collected in questionnaires completed by legal persons and, frankly, the population surveys we carry out are also, in our view, highly incomplete. And over three years we plan to develop the whole information collection system so that, on the one hand, the information provides the primary data and, on the other, on the basis of mutual co-ordination and adjustment of these data, we will be able to produce a standard objective system. Of course, under these circumstances, it is difficult to say whether we will succeed in fully implementing all the methods currently used in the European Union. I think that if our colleagues in Western Europe had a black economy of the order of 25%, they would have similar problems. Nevertheless, this does not mean that we should not apply the systems currently available. That is why in the federal reform programme, the full start-up of the business register is planned from as early as 1997, from which date the register will be the main form of statistical observation in Russia, and we will dispense with local records etc. A joint order has been signed with the State Tax Service, by which the two registers, the statistical register and the register of tax payers, will be co-ordinated and a procedure has been established for joint updating. We have begun the rotation of households and are gradually moving towards the commonly accepted methods of monitoring households, and as regards the range of instruments used, we believe that by the year 2000 Russia will not differ significantly from other statistical services in countries with market economies. From 1997 onwards we will largely dispense with the methods of general full-scale observation. We will move over to the combined method. Large and medium-sized enterprises will be monitored under the system of continuous statistical observation and we consider it neither possible nor necessary to dispense with it at present. Other areas will be investigated with sample surveys (using the main series of indicators). As regards small and micro businesses, the main source of information will be provided by the business register, which is now practically full of economic indicators from the accounts which we receive from nearly 3 million legal persons, and only ongoing sample surveys carried out quarterly will give us up-to-date information on small businesses. This has been done not only to bring the methodology into line with certain common principles, it has been done primarily for economic reasons. At present we need to reduce the cost of our own statistical work. That is why economic efficiency is one of the main criteria in our federal programme, i.e. statistics must become cheaper, but that does not mean that they are to become less reliable. I think that in the course of our seminar we will look at practically all aspects of the activity of state statistical bodies, including the legal status of state statistics. Unfortunately, in Russia we have not yet passed the Law on State Statistical Activity. The Duma has passed the Law in its entirety, however, the President does not agree with the Law's drafting and at present it is being worked on in the Conciliation Commission. We hope that by the end of this year, all the same, the Law will have been passed. However, at this stage we do not overestimate the significance of the Law. The main work today is maintaining, I would say, the professionalism of our structures. We are convinced of this in Russia in any case; I do not know but perhaps in other countries the fact that there are legislative acts in one or other economic field does not always mean that these legislative acts are compatible with each other - far from it. And there is one problem which has still not been resolved in our countries; I once again emphasise, in Russia. Our law contains the principle of confidentiality of primary statistical information and rightly so. This is indisputably a necessary legal provision which must be made to work. But we have to consider that in the transitional period government bodies at federal level and especially in the regions as in the past call for data on specific legal persons. And if we were to say today that, in implementing the common recommendations, we were completely restricting the flow 17 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go of primary statistical data on businesses, I think we would be severely limiting the information available to state establishments for decision-making. There is only one problem. Privatisation has come along. We now have mainly joint-stock companies etc., etc. But these joint-stock companies now approach the government, the governors and regional administrations and ask the state to take care of them. In a normal market economy, of course, this is not possible, but in the transitional stage, when there is not yet any effective ownership, and the understanding of ownership and management has not yet become widespread, obviously the state authorities also have to deal with specific legal persons. That is why, in order not to undermine the position of the state statistical bodies in Russia, we are deferring until much later the full confidentiality of primary data in the strict sense, and in this we will deviate from standard practice. Trying to move too fast could, in my opinion, result in statistics in current practice becoming useless, and this is the worst thing that could happen. Only Goskomstat's efforts to provide up-to-date information, which we elaborate, have enabled us to approve the federal programme. You probably know, or have read, that the list of federal programmes in Russia has been severely cut back for 1997. There are nearly twenty fewer. Programmes of serious social significance and investment programmes have been dropped, but the statistical programme has got through and the cost is almost 100 million dollars over three years. The Government has agreed to this expenditure, but only for one simple reason: Goskomstat persuaded it of the need for it. Goskomstat argued that it would provide information without which government decision-making would not be possible. And I would like in the course of this seminar for us to focus on the special features of countries in the transitional period. On the one hand, we understand perfectly what needs to be done. But we also need to consider the environment in which we operate. It is not possible to reform statistics before reforming the state's legal base, and not the legal base for the statistical bodies, but for the whole social process. And the question of the speed of transforming statistics seems to me to be of special interest, and we would like to hear the opinions of our colleagues in other countries (probably not everything is running so smoothly in Central and Eastern Europe and probably not in the CIS states either) and we would like to understand for ourselves to what extent we can deviate from certain standards. This is one side of the matter. On the other hand, we nevertheless want to understand which principles have become universal, the ones which we must implement, and which ones, on the whole, are not always worth copying. We know that it is no secret that in the European Union, despite the process of integration leading towards'the harmonisation of national statistics, there are nevertheless very serious differences in the organisation of the statistical services, the methodology and the classifications, and in some instances, it could be said that these differences are very great. And here we too have to agree on how national characteristics are not to hinder work on providing information at inter-governmental level and primarily, no doubt, in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and which role the CIS Statistical Committee is to play in this process. I believe that Mr Korolev. will also be dealing with this issue, as, of course, the speed of reforms and even the direction of reforms in our countries differ. We already differ considerably from what we were like 5 years ago. Today we are fully independent states and we direct our attention towards our own national problems. But nevertheless, as our goods and labour market develops to some extent, we must understand what is taking place in other countries. That is probably why national features must not hinder the overall process. I do not want to take up any more of your time. I think we have given due consideration to specific issues. Once again I wish us success in our work. 18 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go SPEAKER MIKHAIL KOROLEV - CHAIRMAN, INTERSTATE STATISTICAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES The creation of a harmonised system of statistical information is the most important link for integrating the countries of the CIS and ensuring their inclusion in the world economy and information area. That is why it is entirely opportune to organise a regular seminar under Tacis for the heads of the national statistical services in order to assess the situation and outlook for statistics in the transitional period. As the new independent states approach their 5th anniversary, we are on the threshold of a new century. In particular we have had programmes of technical co-operation under Tacis and it is necessary to define what has been achieved and what has not and why. New objectives have to be set. And now the whole statistical world has to reconsider its objectives, tasks, approaches and methods. There are so many changes in the world to which we have to react and the quicker the better. The world has become broader, more mobile, inquisitive and democratic. But it is also more complex, especially in those countries undergoing transformation. The main users of statistical information (government, business, media, scientists, the general population) require a more precise depiction of activity, reliability and accuracy, punctuality and low cost. On the other hand, there has been a qualitative revolution in the means of information production: - there are now entirely new tools for collecting, transferring and processing information; - a global network has been created and there are unprecedented communication possibilities; - data storage disks have seen an incredible increase in capacity and reliability; - there are fantastic tools for structuring results. And this new information potential has given rise to increasing requirements regarding observation activity and sources of primary data collection, rapid availability, access to stored data, data structuring, and flexibility in technology, programming and organisation. Attempts to assess statistics from these points of view are in line with the forthcoming Washington and Lisbon seminars. An analysis of the statistical situation should help international organisations to more precisely define the future needs of the statistical bodies in the CIS countries. At this seminar each country will present a report on the statistical situation in their country. At first glance it is clear that the situations are diverse and depend on many factors. But once the discussion concerns the integration of the statistical area, then the primary issues concern mutual agreement on statistical activity. And it was not by chance that the founders of the CIS Statistical Committee - the governments of the CIS countries - from its very inception directed it towards ensuring the co-ordination of statistical activity in the CIS; this was consolidated in the Committee's regulations, which were approved by a resolution of the Council of the heads of CIS governments on 12 April 1996. Mutual co-ordination of activity provides for: - the creation of a joint legal basis for statistics, - the harmonisation of statistical methodology, 19 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - the introduction of co-ordinated systems for classifications, processes and rules for collecting and processing statistical data. Co-ordinating the legal basis of CIS countries' statistics It is important to have a legislative basis establishing the main organisational and operating principles in the conditions of converting to a market economy, and it is important that the legislative acts on statistics of the CIS countries should be compatible with each other. That is why the CIS statistical committee has developed a recommendatory (model) legislative act, \"Law on state statistics\", which was adopted by the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS on 29 October 1994. The Law provides for: - transparency and openness of statistical information, - greater access not only for government authorities but also the population at large, - protection of the confidentiality of information transferred to statistical bodies by individual enterprises and legal and natural persons. The Interparliamentary Assembly recommended to the CIS countries' parliaments that they should use the above-mentioned legislative act in elaborating or fine tuning national laws on statistics. These laws have already been adopted in Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine; they are being developed and considered by the parliaments of Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia and Turkmenistan. The new statistical methodology The previous statistical methodology was based on the special features of a centrally planned economy. Transition to a market economy has required corresponding statistics. Providing assistance to the CIS countries in introducing into practice at their statistical offices the new methodology and international statistical standards is one of the main functions of the CIS Statistical Committee. The items covered are: - familiarisation with the experience of statistical recording in the market economy, - transition to a single statistical language, - data compatibility within the CIS, and world-wide, - the possibility of presenting to various international organisations diverse statistical information in accordance with accepted standards. Introducing the new methodology is quite a complicated process of transforming the previous methodology, and entails replacing all statistical tools and retraining staff (and not only one's own staff). There is also the added complication that the new economy itself is being established \"as it goes along\", \"on the hop\", with many mistakes in the transitional period. The economic difficulties of this period make the work of the statistical bodies more difficult. However, the statistical methodology in the West too has not yet been entirely fixed and the methods concerned are far from beyond reproach, particularly as regards the macro-economic accounts in times of high inflation. In the past years, all the CIS countries have seen the completion of a significant volume of work on converting to the new methodology. 20 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The CIS Statistical Committee alone has produced 308 methodological works (instructions, recommendations), on various statistical issues. The list of these publications and data on the CIS countries' adoption of the new methodology over time are presented on a theme-by-theme basis in the documentation of the draft handbook on the activity of the statistical bodies between 1992 and 1996. A good deal of work on the SNA has been done, and this has enabled a start to be made on publications on basic accounts. Thus, 1996 saw the publication of the specialist collection of official data of the CIS countries on national accounts for 1990-1995. Further development of SNA accounts should be aimed at ensuring their completeness and reliability, more extensive recording of the black and informal economy, a more accurate depiction of the influence of inflation on GDP and its trend, the elaboration of national accounts on a quarterly and monthly basis and the development of finance and price statistics. Relatively little progress has been achieved in developing the balance of payments since there is a general lack of information on transactions with capital and financial instruments, which is needed for calculating it. In recent years work has expanded on international GDP comparisons of the CIS countries on the basis of common methodological principles and classifications used in the European comparisons programme. The CIS Statistical Committee is taking part together with the OECD and Goskomstat of Russia in the co-ordinating work for the comparisons for 1996 in connection with the third group, which includes all the CIS countries and Turkey. There is extremely important work on common principles for constructing economic classifications which are harmonised on the basis of international standards. A system of model classifications is being created on basis of the classifications used by the UN Statistical Commission. In particular, this year will see the development of principles for constructing a product (goods and services) classification which should serve as a basis for compatibility among national classifications in this field. A lot of work is being planned to introduce economic classifications into regular statistical practice. In the light of the processes of integration and the introduction of transparent borders, work must begin anew on developing statistics on foreign trade. That is why the CIS Statistical Committee is preparing recommendations on recording export and import transactions between states as part of the creation of a Customs Union, using Eurostat's experience. Work is actively proceeding in all countries on preparing the introduction of a population census at the end of the '90s. This programme will be in line with the main methodological provisions of the UN. Concluding the general survey of statistical methodology in the CIS countries, the most important indicators of socio-economic development can, on the whole, be said to be based on the concepts, definitions and classifications as recommended by international organisations. The Statistical Committee's separate report provides a more detailed review of the introduction of international standards into statistical practice in the CIS countries and describes the extent to which the main body of socio-economic statistics are in line with these standards. Expert Commissions, Discussions and seminars Reforming the statistical system and developing a common statistical base requires intensive discussion of the main problems by the countries' specialists; this is done at meetings of the Academic Council of 21 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go the CIS Statistical Committee and its sections with their temporary working parties, and various seminars and conferences featuring academics and highly qualified specialists from all CIS countries, Eurostat, the IMF and other intergovernmental organisations. From 1992 to date, the CIS Statistical Committee alone has organised more than fifty such seminars and conferences, involving more than 1 700 participants. In order to discuss these topics, the CIS Statistical Committee has received 274 delegations from all over the world. Twenty-four issues of the Information Bulletin have been produced in order to publish the methodological material. Statistical Observation, Data Collection and Exchange The privatisation and decentralisation of businesses is leading to the formation of a large number of small and medium-sized businesses which are difficult to cover by full statistical observation and comprehensive reporting. It is in the context of this core system of business statistics that registers of business activity are being developed in the CIS countries. This is why the CIS Statistical Committee is devoting much attention to harmonising the registers (primarily to defining statistical units, their coverage and rules for updating). The recommendations which have been drawn up take account of international experience, including that of Eurostat. Promising work is currently under way on standardising the electronic exchange of statistical information with the national statistical services of the CIS countries and international organisations. This technology has already been fully worked out for ten of the twelve CIS statistical services, which every month transfer data to the CIS Statistical Committee by electronic mail using standardised tables (questionnaires); the CIS Statistical Committee then aggregates these data and sends them back to the CIS countries in collated form. This automatically ensures the cycle of data collection, processing, data base management and preparation of publications. The electronic exchange of statistical data is being introduced, also through the international electronic network, Internet, using Edist\u00e4t software, developed on the basis of the EDLFACT standard. Statistical databases In connection with the creation of the Economic Union and its co-ordinating body, the Intergovernmental Economic Committee, the Intergovernmental Agreement on Methodological Comparability has been adopted and a common statistical base created for the Economic Union (10 February 1995). This database is constructed from national statistical data drawn from the agreed list of indicators for inter-governmental exchange and with a common methodology for use in inter governmental agreements and for providing economic statistics for government and inter governmental bodies, the mass media and other users. It will be published on CD-ROM. Publication and dissemination of statistical information As the authorised distributor of official statistical information on the Commonwealth of Independent States, between 1992 and 1996 the CIS Statistical Committee published 42 statistical series (including 22 on general economics, 6 on macro-economics and finance, 10 of foreign trade and 9 on social statistics), 152 statistical bulletins and 408 rapid information bulletins (cf. the Handbook). Distribution of the statistical material on CD-ROM is under way. In recent years the publication of statistical information in the national statistical services has improved. 22 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Analytical work Both the CIS countries and the CIS Statistical Committee constantly carry out a lot of work on analysing the state and development of the economy and the social sphere of the CIS countries. In the period 1992 to 1996 alone, the CIS Statistical Committee prepared and sent to government bodies of the CIS countries and inter-governmental organisations 375 analytical documents and memoranda (they are listed in the collection of material on the activity of the Statistical Committee). Computerised statistical databases and information technology In 1991 the state statistical system consisted of a network of 2 187 district and municipal computer centres, involving 371 computers, at least type Ye.S. 1045, 372 mini computers (type M-5000), 10 392 micro computers (type Ye.S. 1840) with peripheral equipment (including 302 subscriber points and 2 701 teletypes). In the period 1992 to 1996 the CIS countries completed their technical re-equipping, aimed at implementing the national programmes of conversion to the internationally accepted system of accounts and statistics. The majority of CIS countries have been finding it increasingly disadvantageous to carry out information processing on their existing mainframes. That is why the accent was placed on personal computers, of which the CIS countries currently have 1 151 (mainly IBM compatible). Preparations need to be made for the introduction of national computer networks with powerful servers and internet access, and of local internet computer networks, multi-terminal data processing systems and printing and publishing facilities. Previously the main technical facilities were the so-called electronic information processing systems with accompanying software, which even today remain the predominant technology in the national statistical services. Under this system, reports from businesses come through for statistical processing at regional level, from where the output data are then transferred to republic level. However, at district level, data are not held on electronic media because of the poor level of equipment (which makes it more difficult to prepare information for local users), and the systems are not linked to the creation and updating of the databases. Some issues of statistical organisation With the new possibilities of information processing now facing statistics, the need will soon arise for reappraising the role to be played by the national statistical bodies and their links with other organisations carrying out the collection, processing and analysis of social, economic, administrative and statistical information. First, as a result of the comparative simplification of the production of information, an increasing amount of economic and social data are being produced outside the statistical bodies, and this requires a new approach to the organisation of data processing and data unity within the national information area. New sources of information must be made accessible to statistical bodies, especially in the area of administrative information held in ministries and other government bodies, and a balance needs to be struck between multi-purpose use of administrative information and carrying out statistical surveys. An optimum balance will be possible with the development of work on business registers. The inter relationship of these registers with the annual sample surveys of economic units in comparison with 23 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go the administrative data on the accounts of these units will enable full-scale statistical observation of small and medium-sized businesses to be dispensed with. The reciprocal exchange of information between statistical and administrative bodies is at the initial stage. In this connection, there needs to be much more thorough research into the reciprocal requirements and interest in creating joint information systems and the possibilities for implementing them. This could be the subject of special studies by inter-departmental services. Alongside this, it would be expedient to use experience from abroad when statisticians are working directly in administrative bodies and exercising system co-ordination functions. Data from administrative files and statistical surveys in due course should form an integral part of information to be inputted in national information systems and the single information area. And statistical bodies must prepare themselves for a gradual reorientation towards the function of co ordinating certain types of information systems, as is already done in some western countries. Second, the situation is developing whereby as a result of databanks, primary statistical information is becoming increasingly accessible to outside users. As a result, statistical bodies have been called upon to take another look at issues such as information processing deadlines, providing help with statistical analysis and data integration and also ensuring data confidentiality. The need to adapt statistical services to \"individual\" methods of information production by different users implies the supply of corresponding meta-information to the statistical databanks and access to them. A wide range of glossaries, questionnaires, catalogues and data sets forming part of the meta- information will ensure wide-ranging co-ordination, the methodological unity of information and a universal statistical language for users performing independent research using automated statistical databanks. SPEAKER YVES FRANCHET - DIRECTOR GENERAL, EUROSTAT Introduction Four years ago I had the honour of opening with you, in Luxembourg, the first high-level seminar organised by the European Commission to launch statistical co-operation between your countries and the European Community. We were at the end of 1992 and the European region was living a period of intense political, social and economic changes. The European Community was moving towards the reality of the Single Market and was preparing the Maastricht Treaty. Most of the Central and Eastern European countries were showing substantial progress towards democracy and the market economy, even if persisting conflicts in various parts of this region indicated how difficult is the transition to a new political organisation. After the dissolution of the former Soviet Union your countries had already undertaken the first difficult steps on the way of the reforms, and the European Community had launched the Tacis programme in order to help your countries strengthen democracy and achieve a successful transition to the market economy. As far as official statistics are concerned, we all were aware that the creation of new independent states, the development of an economy which is no longer centrally planned and the emergence of 24 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go economic agents operating with independent powers of decision had created a strong need for the building up or substantial modernisation of your statistical information systems. Since the very beginning of the Tacis programme, the European Commission and the EU Member States have recognised the importance of official statistics within the reform process, and adopted basic orientations so that appropriate human and financial resources could be allocated to support your countries in the efforts to modernise the national statistical system. In 1992 the Steering Committee of International Organisations for Co-ordination of Technical Assistance in Statistics to the countries of the former Soviet Union (the so called \"Ripert\" committee) held its first meeting. Since its very beginning, the basic motivation of this committee has been the need for a major effort of co-ordination to ensure an appropriate level and composition of the assistance to meet the needs of the partner countries. After four years we can say that the whole picture has really improved. The European Community has become the European Union, the peace process has made consistent even if slow progress, most of Central and Eastern European countries have undertaken the necessary steps towards joining the European Union, your countries have made very concrete steps towards democracy and the market economy. I consider that the overall picture is encouraging for statistics too. In the high-level Tacis seminars of 1993 (Statistical information systems in a market economy) and of 1994 (Strategy for computer processing in statistics) you were the \"main customers\" of oui- information exchange. In the high-level Tacis seminar of 1995 (Experience of statistical transition) we had the possibility to learn from the progress made in Central and Eastern Europe. In this seminar you are the \"main actors\", and we will spend this week together by focusing on both the achievements since 1991 and the way ahead. In a word, \"Where we were\", \"Where we are\" and \"Where we go\". Needs and criteria for good official statistics First of all I would like to recall briefly the role of official statistics in a democratic society and a market economy, since I consider that a common understanding of this issue is a pillar of our dialogue. I had the chance to read a speech addressed in 1995 by Mr Yurkov to the Council of Heads of State Statistical Agencies of the Russian Federation, and I have particularly appreciated the clarity of his vision, the determination to achieve the goals he set for the Russian statistical system and the force with which he conveyed the message to his colleagues from all the regions of the Russian Federation. Within the framework of the reform process, official statistics are one of the elements in the country system which has to be radically changed. The demand in terms of statistics addressed to the statistical offices of your countries is identical: - on the one hand, official statistics has to describe the events which are actually happening; - on the other hand, official statistics should provide internationally comparable figures using the concepts and standards defined by the European Union or international bodies. 25 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Official statistics have to anticipate trends in the society they analyse and inform the decision-making processes by supplying reliable data on the current situation and its development in the various economic and social sectors. High quality official statistics are a prerequisite for competent, transparent and accountable government. In particular: - they are needed by governments, in order to formulate, supervise and evaluate economic and social policies, check that the mechanisms of the market economy are operating properly, ascertain the impact of policies on the most vulnerable sectors of society and be able to adopt measures for their protection; - they are needed by citizens, in order to play an effective part in the democratic process and assess the effects of government decisions; - they are needed by business, in order to decide on investment and marketing strategies and assess their position in their sector of activity. As in the countries already governed by the market economy, these statistics in your countries will not be produced by private bodies. Governments are in fact the main users of statistics. Furthermore, statistics offer little potential for profit, and for many respondents confidentiality can be guarantied only by the state. It is therefore the state statistical service which produces official statistical information, maintains the necessary infrastructure, bears most of the costs and guarantees compliance with the relevant ethical standards. The primary purpose of official statistics in your countries was formerly to provide an administrative check rather than to supply data for general use on the changing pattern of society. This means that during the transition phase the statistical offices in your countries are moving from a role which was essentially that of \"administrative supervisor\" to one ofinformation supplier\". In practice, it is necessary to build a statistical information system adapted to the new role and the new information needs, and this involves fundamental changes and challenges: - official statistical services have to achieve legitimacy and credibility; - official statistics have to get adequate resources, especially in terms of quality of manpower, management and equipment; - official statisticians have to adopt a new professional approach, with an understanding of new economic processes, the functioning of democratic society, the statistical concepts used to describe it and the tools which are needed to compile adequate information; - official statistics needs to improve the legal and administrative fi'amework, especially with regard to ethical issues, independence, statistical confidentiality, good relations to respondents and users of statistics, and the organisation of how statistical information is collected and disseminated. In the course of our fruitful co-operation we have in practice recognised two main scenarii for the transition of the statistical system. In some cases it is necessary to introduce new tools which need to reconcile continuity and interruption (for instance, structural surveys of enterprises), and these are the cases which are actually the most difficult. In other cases the need is for the introduction of tools which are more free of references to the past (for instance, business registers, prices, labour force, external trade), and this generally involves investment without calling into question previous practice. 26 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Achievements since 1991 Working together Working together! This was both a main objective and an important achievement of the last four years. As you know, the official relations between your countries and the European Union are based on association and co-operation agreements. These agreements are prepared in a spirit of partnership, provide the basis for political, economic and cultural co-operation, and lay down the legal basis for the development of trade and investment links. The agreements establish regular political dialogue and contribute to the move to a market economy, based on respect for human rights and democratic principles. These agreements also provide the overall framework for co-operation in the statistics sector. World-wide statistical co-operation with your countries involves mainly Eurostat, the EU Member States, the CESD in its capacity of implementing agency for EU statistical co-operation, third countries and various international organisations, especially the ILO, IMF, OECD, UN-ECE, World Bank and last but not least, CIS Statistical Committee. In addition to the financing provided by Tacis, there are also bilateral agreements to provide finance for statistical co-operation involving in particular France, Germany. Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The European Commission, in close collaboration with your countries and the EU Member States, defines the strategy for co-operation and draws up programmes. Co-operation is organised around the thematic projects of the various programmes and is based on the \"twinning\" of national teams from your countries and EU countries. Joint action between assisting countries is encouraged and supported, especially between EU countries and Central and Eastern European countries. For instance, this arrangement has already been very effective with Romania assisting Moldova with the support of French experts. The number of bodies and the variety of procedures involved require careful co-ordination. The European Commission has proposed a precise definition of the work organisation and of the role of each participant. Effectiveness and efficiency considerations determine the division of work among the Commission, the CESD, the Member States and the other organisations. Together, we continue to pursue the improvement of our joint undertaking. Further rationalisation is being defined so as to achieve greater economies of scale and better synergy, a reduction of administrative procedures and an increase in flexibility. In addition, project management methods make it possible to solicit and facilitate clear and strong commitment by the concerned parties. The \"Steering Committee of International Organisations\" (the \"Ripert\" committee) is in charge of co ordinating G24 statistical assistance to the countries of the former Soviet Union. It comprises Eurostat and the statistical services of the main international organisations providing assistance to these countries. Eurostat has special responsibility in this committee for co-ordinating G24 assistance with regard to three \"focal areas\": business registers, business statistics and external trade statistics. Demand and response in statistical co-operation EU statistical co-operation is designed to help the statistical offices of your countries respond to the demand for statistics they receive, by offering them the benefits of EU experience. The time-scale for this co-operation is medium and long term, and it is oriented to the hard and challenging task of producing indicators based on information which is currently available while developing statistics which are better suited to the new economic and social circumstances. 27 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The demand for assistance expressed by your countries is very similar, apart from specific local features. The solutions which are being implemented, and the pace at which changes take place, are adapted to each individual country. Financing is provided through arrangements grouping several Tacis countries as well as by special arrangements for individual countries, although this number is fairly limited at present. A budget of about 10 million ECU has been spent in 1993-95. A budget of 10 million ECU is already available to cover 1996-97 activities. We expect that similar yearly amounts could be made available until 1999. Tacis statistical co-operation started in December 1992 with two programmes: training and technical assistance. Starting from 1995, coherent projects were drafted in Eurostat focal areas and in other areas indicated as priorities by your countries. A limited amount of urgent computer equipment was provided to support the projects. Until now the Tacis countries, with the exception of Russia which has a national Tacis programme, worked on the basis of an inter-state programme. Presently they are negotiating statistical activities within the framework of individual national Tacis programmes. High-level advice was addressed at organisational and legal issues in the first co-operation period. Depending on the various countries. Eurostat high-level advisers visit them yearly or on a more \"ad hoc\" basis. In the first co-operation period a pool of instructiors was trained through formal training in several domains: national accounts, prices, agriculture, financial statistics, household surveys, macro- economic analysis. Semi-residential support is operating in the Trans-Caucasian countries and in Belarus. A resident adviser for Central Asia and Mongolia has his headquarters in Tashkent and one for Russia is now- based in Moscow. It is also foreseen to provide a resident adviser to Ukraine and Moldova when these countries have obtained national Tacis funding. Since'1993. yearly high-level meetings (this is in fact the fourth one) allowed the Heads of the statistical offices of your countries to exchange views on challenges, priorities and progress made in reforming the statistical system with their colleagues of other Tacis countries and with partners from the West and from Central and Eastern Europe. Proceedings of all these meetings in Russian have been distributed to your countries. A considerable amount of methodological material is offered to your countries at every occasion. Translations of basic manuals have been made and basic nomenclatures have also been translated into Russian. A multi-lingual glossary of economic and statistical terms was produced for focal areas and other priority areas. Tacis supports co-operation with UN-ECE for the financing and organisation of two inter-state seminars with UN-ECE on business registers and demographic statistics, including translation of methodological documentation into Russian. Some EU Member States set up bilateral co-operation programmes which are co-ordinated with the Tacis programmes and are complementary to them. Eurostat also co-operates with the Interstate Statistical Committee for those areas where they can play a co-ordinating role, such as statistical classifications, external trade statistics, and publishing and dissemination. 28 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Overall appreciation Positive points For most of your countries the first phase of co-operation has been completed, i.e. the phase of defining the general objectives with regard to the transformation of the statistical system. Most of your countries have approved or are approving a statistical law. In all focal areas progress has been made, even if at a different speed in different countries. In external trade statistics, customs statistics based on the Single Administrative Document are in place in all your countries. Countries, planning to participate in the Customs Union, participated in the Eurostat seminar on Intrastat and are requesting for more assistance in this matter. Almost all your countries have set up a business register which can be used for statistical purposes. In business statistics pilot sample surveys have been launched or are under preparation. Countries are requesting assistance to monitor informal economy. Eurostat believes that this kind of assistance should not replace more structured work in business statistics and should not replace the creation of good business registers. In any case, in order to have good estimates of informal economy, it is necessary to rely on household statistics, labour statistics and national accounts, therefore the work needs to be co-ordinated with the work done with other international organisations in their respective focal areas. Some progress has been made for publishing and dissemination of statistical information which is a new activity for the statistical offices of almost all countries. Tacis has already supported the production of new statistical publications. The countries need further support in the promotion and marketing of official statistical information. Improved communication has been reached through translation of documentation to facilitate access to technical information, compilation of multi-lingual glossaries of statistical and economic tenns, and provision of language courses for statisticians. The type of actions and the kind of dialogue they foster show that your countries and the European Union are equal partners in the dialogue, which is between professionals who have mutual respect for each other and who are working together so that different systems can ultimately come together and develop a common language. Weak points In most of your countries co-operation among the national administrations involved in the functioning of the statistical system is not yet effective and efficient. I would also recall some weak points at sectoral level, in particular regarding Eurostat focal areas. In many of your countries the availability and quality of external trade statistics still suffer from significant inconveniences regarding: organisation of the overall statistical system, in particular lack of clear definition of responsibilities and modalities of collaborations between customs and the statistical office 29 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go collection and processing of primary data, in particular errors in data coding and transmission from customs to the statistical office, and lack of appropriate data processing equipment methodological issues data dissemination, in particular lack of appropriate analysis of data and limited scope in terms of data users. Business registers do not cover yet all the relevant parts of the economy. In business statistics the use of sampling methods depends on the degree of privatisation. Sometimes the new methods have just been added to the old system in a disconnected fashion, without real change in substance. The way ahead A more systemic approach to reforms In the speech of Mr Yurkov I have already mentioned, he rightly tries to look at least five years ahead. From a fragmented to a systemic approach - that is the biggest difference stressed by him between the statistical transition until today and the blueprint for the reform of statistics from now on. For instance, with regard to the improvement of statistics in terms of standards, it is necessary to look for a systemic improvement by realising all the possibilities stemming from a combined use of the new standards. Let me recall some fundamental principles of official statistics, as adopted by the UN Statistical Commission: equal access to official statistics by all members of society respect of ethical and scientific principles in deciding on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and dissemination of statistical data facilitating a correct interpretation of data by the presentation of appropriate information on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics choice by the statistical office of the sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative records, on the basis of quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents strict protection of individual data and limitation of their use to statistical purposes co-ordination among administrations within the countries in order to achieve consistency and efficiency of the statistical system conformity with international concepts, classifications and methods. As to conformity with these principles, very much has already been done by your countries, very much has still to be done. Progress will depend not only on how quickly you will develop a new promising system of indicators but also on how resolutely you cut the burden of indicators that are not any longer useful. It is necessary to have the courage to make a clear break and switch over to progress. It is also necessary to devise publication and dissemination programmes that fully meet user needs for comparable data over time, and stick to publication schedules for the release of key indicators. Training is very important and should more and more be oriented to actions with a \"multiplicative\" rather than a simple \"additive\" effect, to facilitate the widespread diffusion of know-how within your countries. In this light, it is perhaps necessary to extend the target groups for training beyond the statistical offices of your countries so as to include methodological services, training institutes, universities and users. 30 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Future prospects for statistical co-operation EU statistical co-operation must be more and more linked to the EU political objectives. The quality of statistics and their comparability, both among Tacis countries and between them and the European Union, are essential ingredients for any effective economic and social analysis. It is true that, in the long term, Tacis aims at assisting your countries in modernising or building up the statistical system. But, in the short and medium term, the availability of reliable data on trade flows, market shares, and inter-regional trade are of primary interest for the negotiation and follow-up of EU co-operation agreements with your countries. Statistical co-operation should encourage collaboration between your countries, in particular through pilot surveys, and reinforce co-ordination between co-operation projects so as to facilitate the production of harmonised statistics. Assistance work should more and more be oriented to actions with a \"multiplicative\" rather than a simple \"additive\" effect, to facilitate the widespread diffusion of know-how within your countries. In this light, it is perhaps necessary to extend the target groups for training beyond the statistical offices of your countries so as to include methodological services, training institutes, and universities. Last but not least, it is necessary that the governments of your countries, the Tacis programme and the programmes of relevant international organisations provide in a co-ordinated way the resources which are needed to continue and reinforce the reform of your statistical systems. Conclusion A lot of hard and challenging work has still to be done, and the European Union is ready to continue and reinforce co-operation with you. The six fields covered by this seminar are of vital importance in defining and implementing the new role of official statistics in your countries. In the course of the seminar we have to try to evaluate the progress in each of these important fields, and to identify priorities for our future joint work. And now let me conclude with my vision of our. joint efforts. Statistics both depend on and influence the view of socio-economic processes and of the functioning of society in general. The process of adapting the statistical system is a genuine milestone in the development of the mentality and of the whole state system. By co-operating for the modernisation of the statistical systems in your countries, the European Union wishes to make a direct contribution towards ensuring the success of your reform efforts. Statistical co-operation goes hand in hand with socio-economic change and can help considerably with the development of a common language. In building together such a common language, we had and still have the unique opportunity to make the \"statistical family\" a pillar of this historical time when the barriers between the East and the West were, and continue to be, broken down. 31 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go COMMENTS, REPLIES ANDA UDIENCE DISCUSSION M O D E R A T O R: N O EL A T C H E R L EY - S T A T I S T I C AL A D V I S ER TO T HE R U S S I AN F E D E R A T I O N, INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND In his presentation Mr Yurkov made a lot of interesting points relevant to all transition economies and in particular he spoke about the hidden economy. I know that Goskomstat did a lot of things in that field and it is interesting to hear that much more will be done and that is relevant to all of you. The greater use of sample surveys is again important for all transition countries and, as Mr Yurkov said, it is not only to reduce cost, but you can also maintain reliability, maybe even in some cases improve it if sample surveys are designed properly. The work on updated statistical legislation, I think, is important for quite a lot of you and the effort to improve business registers is a big and difficult task for most transition economies, but particularly important are the household surveys. Like Mr Yurkov Mr Korolev has raised a lot of issues for discussion later in this seminar including the need to make statistics more economical and that is not just in transition countries but in the whole world; the western countries are really facing the same problem. Mr Korolev talked about new demands and new users, the organisation of statistical offices, the co ordination among different statistical agencies, the legislative base for statistics, retraining of staff, more emphasis on dissemination of statistics including Internet, the preparation for population censuses, the move to PCs and I like his quote that methodology is useless if you do not know technology. Mr Franchet has spoken of a lot of issues as the other two speakers. He has talked about the framework of Tacis co-operation in statistics with transition countries, about improvements in statistics over the past four years. He has spoken of the key role of the official statistics in a democratic market economy, of the need to improve co-ordination among statistical agencies, of the need to introduce statistical tools. He has outlined the significant Eurostat programmes with transition countries in the past few years and there were many achievements in these programmes. Mr Franchet emphasised the need to improve marketing and dissemination of statistics and mentioned weak points that continue to need attention, particularly co-operation among agencies in improving statistics; for example, foreign trade statistics where there is often a need for better co-operation between customs and statistical offices. Mentioned as \\vell were business registers that do not yet cover all fields, something which is very difficult in transition countries with such a big growth in the number of businesses. He also spoke about the way ahead and mentioned the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics which can guide us in the future. There were suggestions to eliminate old indicators no longer needed, to train statistical staff in better understanding new indicators as well as to help train users to understand statistics, particularly in the new fields of macroeconomic statistics. I am sure there will be unanimous agreement of what Mr Franchet said about the need of adequate resources for statistics. In the keynote addresses so many issues were raised that can be debated in the rest of the seminar. 32 ",

Legislation, whether it is statistical or other, is difficult in the sense of development. Statistical legislation is very important. All speakers today were making references to statistical legislation which is an important factor for our statistical activities. But legislation itself does not guarantee anything. If I understand legislation correctly it seems to me that it is a sort of protection for two reasons. The first reason is that legislation gives independence to us. But laws themselves do not ensure it and within the system in which these laws can be ignored there is no use to you in putting them into practice. And indeed there are many other institutions which also can help preserve the independence of statistical offices and so on. For example, Mr Franchet this morning mentioned the importance of establishing release dates for data and similarly, of course, any regular dissemination of data can become a good thing because it is expected and it is hard to stop it once it has started. The impartiality of statistics is extremely important and laws can help us to establish and preserve it. The second most important reason for legislation, as I see it, is the protection of individual rights and this in particular, of course, refers to confidentiality of the data which individuals and companies give to statistical offices for statistical purposes. So, those are two main reasons for legislation, and legislation is simply one of a large number of mechanisms for ensuring those two things happen. * * * SPEAKER VLADIMIR GORYACHKOVSKY - CHAIRMAN, STATE COMMITTEE ON STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS, KAZAKHSTAN Legislation on statistics: the current situation and prospects for the legal framework and its practical application, including statistical confidentiality Before I start, may I thank the organisers of this international seminar - the heads of Eurostat, Goskomstat of the Russian Federation and of the Statistical Committee of St. Petersburg - for giving us the opportunity to meet and exchange views on current issues relating to our co-operation, an intensification of the integration process and optimum adaptation of statistics to the new conditions of the transition period. The Republic of Kazakhstan is passing through a period of transition to a market economy which has characteristics in common with those of many other CIS countries, but also its own particular features. The creation of an efficient market economy, the final objective of this difficult process, depends on selecting the right priorities to ensure that this goal is reached with the application of the least effort, whether economic, integrational or other, and in this connection, statistics are the main mechanism for applying these efforts. In actual fact, the economic and social changes to be introduced in our country are based mainly on the economic and statistical data presented by the statistical bodies. At the same time, the efficient functioning of the state statistical bodies depends on the availability of a legal basis - in other words, legislation. This is why the Law on State Statistics in the Republic of 35 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Kazakhstan was passed in January 1992, setting out the main principles for establishing, collecting, storing, aggregating, analysing and publishing data on the phenomena and processes taking place in the country's economic and social sphere. Its application is compulsory for all state government and administrative bodies, enterprises, organisations and institutions, irrespective of the organisational and legal form or form of ownership, as well as for natural persons. In the four and a half years since this law has been in force in the country, a legislative basis has been completed which has allowed amendments and supplements to be made to this Law on Statistics in the Republic of Kazakhstan. And currently, now that the Constitution, a Civil and Tax Codex as well as a number of other legislative acts have been passed, Goskomstat has drawn up and submitted for scrutiny by the appropriate state bodies, amendments and supplements to the Law on State Statistics. In our view, the amendments and supplements to this law will make it more democratic since their drafting was based on the notion that the quality of statistical information and general confidence in statistics shown by the public, business, state government and administrative bodies, as well as other users of statistics, very much depend on respect for the basic values and principles underlying any democratic society seeking knowledge about itself and respect for the rights of its members, as enshrined in the Economic Commission for Europe's resolution on \"The basic principles of official statistics in the regions\" which was adopted in April 1992. Furthermore, in formulating these changes we were guided by the Decision of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS member states of 29 October 1994 on the reference legislative act on \"State Statistics\". The aim of this was to ensure a common approach to organising official state statistics and setting up an agreed statistical information system within the CIS, and individual provisions of the statistical legislation of developed countries with market economies were also taken into account. As a result, we now have state statistical legislation based on the Republic's Constitution, provisions of the Law on State Statistics in the Republic of Kazakhstan and other Kazakh regulatory acts governing the treatment of information in the field of primary accounts and statistics, as well as being based on the Decision regarding the State Committee on Statistics and Analysis of the Republic of Kazakhstan which was approved by the Government this January. Now, allow me to dwell in more detail on the main lines of activity of the state statistical bodies ensuing from the national legislative and regulatory acts I have just enumerated. I shall begin by telling you that the system of state statistics includes the State Committee on Statistics and Analysis, the regional and municipal statistical and analytical bodies and their structural subdivisions in the districts and towns under regional authorities. Furthermore, there are also Goskomstat-run institutes within its organisation responsible for statistical research, training, retraining and further training for accountancy and statistical staff. The Committee, by law, reports direct to the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and at the same time, by special presidential decree, the day-to-day activities of Goskomstat are supervised by the national Government. In accordance with the Decision regarding the State Committee on Statistics and Analysis of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Committee is the central government body responsible for organising the state statistics of Kazakhstan and deciding on the content and nature of statistical activities throughout its territory, meeting the needs of the state bodies, legal persons and individual business persons for statistical and economic information on the state of and trends in the socio-economic development of the Republic and its regions which they need for their activities. The Law sets out the relationships, in the field of statistics, between the Republic of Kazakhstan and other states and international bodies. They are based on bilateral and multilateral international treaties or agreements as well as treaties or agreements between the State Committee on Statistics and Analysis and the statistical bodies of other states and international organisations concluded according to the principles of equality and mutual interests. 36 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Moreover, where an international agreement signed by the Republic of Kazakhstan sets out different rules from those contained in our statistical legislation, the rules of the international agreement prevail. The Law formulates state policy on the creation and operation of a statistical information system on the basis of scientific methodology, international standards and accounting rules meeting the statistical data needs of all legal and natural persons and the central government bodies. The Law's implementation is manifested by the procedure it has established for collecting statistical information from economic units irrespective of their organisational and legal form or form of ownership in the quantities and by the deadlines to be decided by Goskomstat. In this context, the presentation of statistical information to the state statistical bodies in the specified quantities and by the set deadlines by legal and natural persons was referred to as a state information \"tax\" \"payable\" by those providing the data. However, following the publication of the \"Tax Codex for the Republic of Kazakhstan\" the idea of an information \"tax\" conflicts with the provisions of this Codex. Consequently, this term has been changed and the following amendment included in the amendments and supplements to the Law for the next version: \"the presentation of statistical information by legal and natural persons in all types of state statistical observation shall be obligatory and performed free of charge\". The Law makes provision for \"administrative and criminal liability for violating accounting discipline and not keeping reliable accounts\". Thus, fines of up to ten times the minimum wage are imposable on officials and private citizens for refusing or failing to present to the appropriate statistical bodies data for the established state statistical accounts, including bookkeeping balances and reports, for not presenting them by the set deadline, for concealing or otherwise misrepresenting data for state statistical accounts, and equally for hindering in any way or form the presentation or receipt of statistical data. The refusal by officials to fulfil their state duties in performing statistical observation or the late implementation of such duties makes them liable to be reprimanded or fined a total of up to five times the minimum wage. The sale or transfer to any person, or any other type of disclosure of statistical data subject to trade secrecy by officials without the consent of their legal owner makes them liable to a fine of ten times the minimum wage. Provision is made for a stricter measure being applied for distorting state statistical accounts or concealment or other deliberate misrepresentation of accounting data by persons on whom, in the course of a year, an administrative penalty has been inflicted for such an infringement: up to three years' imprisonment, or up to two years' corrective work, or a fine of up to fifteen times the minimum wage with or without the denial of the right to assume specific duties or occupy a specific post. As is evident from the indicated mechanism \"for tightening accounting discipline\", state statistical bodies have everything at their disposal, but in practice, directors rarely resort to applying the provisions of these articles of the Law in order \"not to spoil relations with respondents\". Other methods are used to tighten accounting discipline - above all, persuasion. It is felt, however, that in spite of taking these measures, there is a need to work out and improve other means as well for eliminating the problems of accounting discipline and reliability of accounting data at the very first stage of preparing them. This is why this question was given special attention when amendments and supplements were being drafted for the current Law on statistics. They highlight the 37 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go main areas for modern reform of state statistics and in particular aim at an overall enhancement of the observation of the activity of economic units within the country's economy. This would require both the development of a system of sectoral statistical surveys and the formation of a special observation system which depends on the type of unit - not just the branch it belongs to - and preparation of an optimum plan for organising the flow of information from them. This line of statistical work needs to be regarded as a basis for the efficient functioning of statistics, and especially for improving co operation between state statistical bodies and the economic units providing information, by adjusting the data burden according to the type of unit. There are also plans to adopt uniform methodological approaches to obtaining information according to the type of economic unit, allowing us to ensure overall co-ordination and comparability of the results of different statistical observation measures. This is also where the main demands have been made of the state statistical bodies, which have to ensure the integrity and adequacy of statistical indicators and their accessibility for users. Allow me now to go into more detail on one of the important problems - that of confidentiality of statistical information. First, in accordance with the decision of the State Commission of the Republic of Kazakhstan on questions of protection ofinformation, as from 1993, in line with constitutional demands and the need for the development of international co-operation within the Republic, a significant range of information has been revealed which had been sealed off during the period of the former Soviet Union. The state statistical bodies are entitled, within the framework of the Law on state statistics, and in line with signed international treaties and agreements, to present comparable economic information in the required volume to international organisations and to exchange information with the statistical offices of foreign countries. Furthermore, the state statistical bodies may provide information, by a set procedure, to foreign firms and companies and individual entrepreneurs in reply to their queries. We thus ensure application of the principle of openness of statistical information in relation not only to users in our country but also to our foreign partners. Secondly, in view of the requirements of the Law on Statistics, Goskomstat guarantees the principle of confidentiality of primary statistical information. This principle is fully complied with by the statistical bodies in relation to small enterprises, farms and holdings, small private firms and natural persons. As already mentioned, the state statistical bodies cooperate with international economic bodies and the statistical offices of foreign countries under current state agreements. On the whole, in their day-to-day activities, the state statistical bodies are governed by the Regulation on statistical and organisational work drafted under the Law on Statistics and approved each year by the national government. The Committee is entitled, under the Law on Statistics and Decision on Goskomstat, to monitor compliance, by ministries, state committees and other central and local government bodies, as well as enterprises, institutions and organisations irrespective of the form of ownership and organisational or legal form, with the national legislation on state statistical matters and, within its area of competence, to provide them with the instructions they need for compliance and for eliminating any infringements in state statistical accounting. Goskomstat is entitled: 38 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - for solving the most important problems in the improvement of state statistics and the co ordination of activities, to establish interdepartmental methodological and expert panels, as well as to set up working parties made up of the heads of the ministries concerned and of other central and local government bodies, organisations and institutions, including international ones; - when conducting large-scale statistical censuses and special surveys, to enlist officials, according to a set procedure, in order to conduct these state statistical surveys; - to suspend the validity of departmental legislation on questions of state and departmental statistics conflicting with current national legislation until the conflicting provisions have been eliminated; - to review cases of administrative infringements of legislation on questions of state statistics according to a set procedure. All decisions, instructions and directives issued by Goskomstat on statistical matters are binding on all ministries, state committees and other central and local government bodies of the Republic, enterprises, organisations and institutions. As already mentioned, the range of users of statistics has broadened: apart from the Government and central and local government bodies, there are now a large number of other users. Now, without the introduction of new methods, it will be impossible to cope with the growing public demand for statistical information within the activity of the statistical bodies. These approaches are clearly marked out in the Programme for the further improvement of statistics for 1996-1998, which was based on the principles in the supplements and amendments to the Law on State Statistics in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The main aim is optimum synergy between the full-scale and non-exhaustive methods of observation. In current practice, large and medium-sized enterprises are covered by full- scale accounting with the collection of a large number of indicators and a high frequency of publication. Small numbers of enterprises are dealt with on a sample basis using a small number of indicators. Thus, a whole range of methods is used during data acquisition, in accordance with world wide practice. In order to obtain objective economic-statistical information it is proposed to make wider use of economic-mathematical methods in carrying out counts and calculations of statistical indicators on the basis of special studies and one-off surveys. The basis of statistical accounting in the period ahead will be regular censuses, including an economic census of economic units, social infrastructure units, a census of livestock, areas under crops, labour market problems, uncompleted construction work, housing, etc., making it possible to study in more detail various aspects of current economic processes and phenomena. The frequency of these censuses will be laid down in central government legislation. The Law on Statistics empowers Goskomstat to keep a business register. At the present time, with the help of Eurostat we are completing its compilation, including not only administrative indicators, but also individual economic ones (capitalisation, number of employees, output, financial results, etc.) which are needed for choosing enterprises when organising sample surveys and subsequently setting up statistical registers. In this context and in that of the national programme the register method of observation basically acquires a new role with respect to quality. The idea is that during conversion to statistics on enterprises, work is being done on setting up a national statistical register of legal persons, their separate subdivisions and individual entrepreneurs, which will form the central link in the statistical information system, the core of the unit base for compiling statistics on enterprises, the array of socio- demographic characteristics of enterprises, the establishment of decentralised intra-administration 39 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go databases and the development of individual aspects of decentralised statistics. It is also quite important that it should serve as a basis for constructing the frame for sample surveys. In the forthcoming consolidation of the legal basis, the register will provide standardised methodological approaches to the creation of inter-departmental information resources. With the coming into force of new tax and customs codes there will be very substantial development of fiscal and customs statistics, which are widely used by Goskomstat in its statistical work on the SNA and balance of payments. As laid down in the Programme, work continues on improving the system of macro-indicators characterising the country's socio-economic development. Work is also continuing on harmonising the indicators in the SNA system in order to build a qualitative database for calculating GDP. This is because of the inclusion of many economic transactions which have made their appearance in recent years as a result of a rapid growth in the number of new economic units, the advent of new types of services and recourse by the population to additional sources of income to maintain their standard of living, etc. Moreover, we should not forget the new law on accounting, which has severed the traditionally close links with statistics. On the one hand it gives more freedom in using methods of accounting, calculation and documentation, while on the other this balance does not contain even the minimum of data required to draw up the national accounts. One of the most important stages in the overall system for organising statistical observation will be the setting-up of a system of interdependent national classifications of technical-economic and social information harmonised with similar international information. The revision and introduction of national classifications will be carried out in conjunction with work on assimilating and applying the main principles of the international system of national accounts, allowing classification by type of activity of the various types of statistical observation unit and acquisition of the necessary groupings. Goskomstat intends to carry out all this work from 1996 to 1998 together with the appropriate ministries and departments. With the implementation of the work on standardising observation units, improving collecting methods and compiling statistical information, there is a need to solve the problems connected with the development of a computerised statistical system representing a combination of new information technology media methods performing the task of overall automation of statistical work, including the processes of collection, processing, storage, accumulation, updating, analysis, presentation, dissemination and use of statistical information. The process will be a systematised one, covering all its components and consequently allowing conversion to a through-system technology for collecting, processing, accumulating and storing information, development of a system software for the hardware base, as well as performing the tasks of ensuring the security of the computer system's information resources and protection from unauthorised access. The implementation of tasks in the area covered by the computer system will set the conditions for converting to paperless technology for collecting statistical accounts and preparing statistical information. The most important item for us at this stage is the question of improving the hardware resources of the state statistical bodies, which is to be decided under the Programme for improving Kazakhstan's statistics for 1996-1998. The implementation of all these tasks will be impossible without the legal basis for statistics and therefore we need to attach particular importance to its improvement. 40 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go SPEAKER ION TOBULTOC - GENERAL DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS, MOLDOVA Statistical legislation in the Republic of Moldova. Current situation and outlook in terms of structure and practical application, including statistical confidentiality 1. Legislative and normative acts, regulating the activity of the state statistical authorities. Until 1990 the State statistical system of the Republic of Moldova was developed on the basis of regulations drawn up and approved by the government of the former USSR. The main legislative acts regulating the activity of the state statistical authorities were adopted in the period 1970 to 1980. The main task of the statistical authorities was the collection, processing and timely presentation to government bodies of statistical data depicting the pace at which the State plans were being met and the availability and use of natural resources, labour and equipment in the national economy. 2. The proclamation of independence of the Republic of Moldova and passing of the law on Statistics. Following the proclamation in August 1989 of the independence of the Republic of Moldova, the Department of Statistics developed and presented to Parliament the draft Law on Statistics, which was approved on 18 December 1990. This Law granted the Department of Statistics greater independence in its activities. The Law on Statistics sets out the tasks and main functions of the Department of Statistics and its subordinate enterprises, institutions and organisations, as follows: - the collection, processing, analysis, dissemination and publication of statistical information on social, demographic and economic issues. - the objectivity and reliability of statistical data; - comparisons with international statistics; - organisation and conducting of censuses and national surveys and enquiries; - compilation and publication of quarterly statistical surveys and the year book; - transmission of statistical information to international organisations of which Moldova is a member; - on the basis of statistical data originating in the Republic, studying the socio-economic processes under the conditions of a market economy, analysing this information and preparing recommendations for the government on current issues relating to the development of the national economy; - independent development of the methodology of all statistical observation on the basis of regulatory acts developed by Moldova as an independent state; - development and introduction of statistical classifications harmonised with international classifications. This work is quite new and has to be carried out at the same time as other important statistical development work depicting the economic processes of a country undergoing the construction of a market economy. Until 1994 the Department of Statistics was answerable to the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. Now the Department of Statistics is answerable to the Government of the Republic of Moldova, which appoints the Director-General of the Department and his deputies. 41 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go On the basis of the Law on Statistics, the government adopted the Regulations governing the Department of the Statistics together with the statistical work programme. In accordance with the statistical work programme, the Department of Statistics provides Parliament and the Government with a report on the work which has been carried out. In February 1996, the Board of the Department of Statistics answered questions on the results of the work for 1995 before the standing Parliamentary Committee on the economy, industry, and privatisation. 3. Development of departmental normative acts, regulating the activity of the statistical authorities of the Republic of Moldova. The following are subordinate to the Department of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: - 37 territorial statistical offices and divisions (not counting the Pridnestrovsky region), the main computer centre, the Statistics publications office and the Informstat project technology centre. They are all legal persons and operate on the basis of the regulations formulated and adopted by the Department of Statistics and which are registered in the State Registry at the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Moldova. 4. Participation of experts from the Department of Statistics and the Main Computer Centre in the development of regulatory acts issued by the Government of the Republic of Moldova. At the same time as drafting departmental regulatory acts for State statistics, experts from the Department and the main computer centre have helped in drafting regulatory acts for adoption by the Government of the Republic of Moldova. With the participation of the above-mentioned experts the following decisions were developed and passed by the Government. - No 50 of 29 January 1992 \"establishing the regulations on the state registration of enterprises in the Republic of Moldova\"; - No 51 of 29 January 1992 \"on the State Registry at the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Moldova\"; - No 52 of 29 January 1992 \"establishing the regulations on the state commercial register of enterprises of the Republic of Moldova\". The completion of the above-mentioned Government decisions has considerably improved the registration and accounting of all economic subjects of the Republic of Moldova. An automated data bank on registered enterprises has been developed and operates at the main computer centre; this is the state commercial register which helps government authorities and the Department of Statistics to analyse and forecast socio-economic developments on the basis of up-to-date and reliable information on all registered economic units which are established on the territory of the Republic of Moldova for conducting free enterprise in the various organisational and legal forms, irrespective of the form of ownership. 5. Individual aspects of the practical application of the Law on Statistics. Let us consider the practical aspects of implementing the Law on Statistics. The Law on Statistics of the Republic of Moldova (Article 3) specifies that, apart from the official statistical bodies of the Department of Statistics, other ministries and departments are also to be involved in statistics in order to carry out their functions, for example the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank and the following ministries: Internal Affairs, Education, Health, Culture, Employment and Social Security etc. The legislation sets out the co-ordinating role of the Department of Statistics in statistical matters. In practice 42 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go this role manifests itself in expertise in the form of departmental statistical accounting and subsequent approval and adoption of statistical classifications and approval of the primary accounts forms. Article \u03a0 of the Law on Statistics defines State statistical reports are to be provided as a duty free of charge to the State statistical authorities by economic units, their subdivisions and by other legal persons irrespective of the form of ownership. At present, alongside the full-scale collection of reports from large and medium sized economic agents operating in industry, construction, transport, the distributive trades, services, agriculture and energy etc., there are also sample surveys of small businesses in these areas and small farms, as well as sample surveys for price statistics: consumer and producer prices in industry and agriculture and construction work prices charged by building contractors. There are household budget surveys (covering the 1 325 families under the old programme), quarterly surveys of industrial enterprises on the economic situation and growth prospects. There is a census of perennial crops in the Republic, and the preparatory work has begun on the 1999 population census. In accordance with Article 15 of the Law on Statistics, the State statistical authorities of Moldova have the right to receive and use data from financial, banking, customs, law enforcement and other departments and services, as well as the results from sectoral, regional and other statistical surveys. Statistical information on the development of education, health, culture, crime, unemployment etc. is collected and aggregated by the corresponding ministries and departments and sent in aggregate form to the Department of Statistics for statistical and analytical purposes. Similarly, we receive information on State finances, banking activity and the balance of payments, and imports and exports of goods from customs declarations. In accordance with established agreements, this information is sent to us by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank and the Customs Department. A sizeable proportion of the information received from economic agents is processed at the Main Computer Centre of the Department of Statistics. Price data on food and non-food products as well as service tariffs in 11 cities and towns of the Republic are collected and aggregated at the Department of Statistics, and we process information on foreign trade from customs declarations, in accordance with the goods nomenclature used by the European Economic Community. Using the aggregate information received, the Department of Statistics produces calculations for the system of national accounts and calculations of gross domestic product using the final use method; quarterly calculations of GDP have been carried out since 1995. In accordance with the statistical work plan, every year the Department of Statistics prepares and publishes a statistical yearbook, short reviews and quarterly publications in the Statistical Bulletin on the socio-economic situation in Moldova. Unlike in previous years (up to 1991), the programme of statistical publications and reviews is not co-ordinated with any of the State or legislative bodies. In this respect we remain firmly independent. Thus, 1995 saw the publication of 4 different annual publications and 12 different thematic statistical reviews. In accordance with the regulations of the Department of Statistics and established procedure, since November 1995 we have also been offering a fee-charging enquiry service to private enterprise and physical persons. The tariffs for these services are calculated by us and approved by the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with established procedure. However, there is still much to be done in this area, and first and foremost, improving the technical base for the reproduction of reviews and bulletins so that the quality of the information can be raised and the publication of special catalogues can be introduced to extend the dissemination of statistical information. 43 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Since 1991 we have been providing statistical information to international organisations in the form of questionnaires. Over the course of five and a half years we have completed and returned around 300 questionnaires. In 1996. for the first time, the report on human development in Moldova was prepared under a PNUD study together with the Academy of Science of Moldova. Unlike in previous years, and in accordance with the Law on Statistics, we do not publish or disseminate data on individual enterprises, organisations or entrepreneurs (or respondents), i.e. we do not divulge commercial and economic secrets. 6. Further development of legislative work by the state statistical authorities of the Republic of Moldova under the conditions of a market economy. The introduction of economic reforms in Moldova has given rise to the urgent need to renew the legislative basis and define the legal responsibilities of respondents for providing up-to-date and reliable information. In this connection, the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova has passed a law amending Article 155 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Moldova and introducing a supplement to the Code of Administrative Offences. This Law entitles the statistical authorities to impose fines on persons in official positions for not providing statistical accounts or survey data in good time, for providing erroneous or incomplete data as well as deliberate refusal to provide statistical data or the deliberate provision of unreliable data adversely affecting the national economy - the evidence is sent to the law enforcement bodies in order to institute criminal or administrative proceedings against those responsible. Thus, over the period from 1993 to the first quarter of 1996. economic agents who had committed the above-mentioned offences were called to account, with the result that 1111 reports were drawn up, with 658 persons given a warning and 453 fined. In April 1994 representatives of the International Monetar}' Fund carried out a review of the Law on Statistics of the Republic of Moldova, which had been passed by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova in December 1990. and issued a series of recommendations for improving it. On the basis of these recommendations, the Department of Statistics drew up proposals for introducing amendments and supplements to the Law on Statistics, which were adopted by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova in June 1995. As a result of analysing the statistical system operating up to 1993 and the enquiries received during that period from a series of international organisations, we came to the conclusion that the system lacked a whole series of indicators to describe consumer prices, the level of inflation and unemployment, foreign trade, state finances, money supply, credits, and the operation of the new structures of private enterprise and the activity of intermediaries. The methodology of the system of accounts and statistics was removed from international practice, thereby complicating an analysis of the development trends in Moldova and the processes of its integration into the international community. The report concluded that a considerable reorganisation of the system of accounts and statistics in Moldova was required in order to bring them into line with international practice. As a result, the Department of Statistics together with the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank and other ministries and departments developed the State Programme for the period 1994-1997 for converting Moldova to the internationally accepted system of accounts and statistics. This programme was approved by Decision No 710 of 23 September 1994 by the Government of the Republic of Moldova. This programme was also included in the Programme of Activity of the Government of the Republic of Moldova for 1994 to 1997. The Department of Statistics exercises control over its implementation and twice a year it reports to the Government on its 44 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go implementation. Of course, implementing the above-mentioned Programme placed a large responsibility on all concerned, and required a concentration of effort to reorganise the former system of accounts and statistics as well as corresponding financial resources on the part of the Government. Over the period 1994 to 1 June 1996, 156 of the 256 measures were implemented and the remaining measures are at the stages of development and implementation, with some of the dates for certain measures (8) put back from 1995 to 1997 for specific reasons. In agreement with the Ministries of the Economy and Finance, in 1995 270 statistical forms were revised, 21 were shortened and 24 new forms were introduced, mainly for financial statistics, stock market activity, insurance organisations, banks and enterprises with foreign investment. In accordance with Article 15 of the Law on Statistics, the Department of Statistics has the right to conclude co-operation agreements with statistical bodies in other states and with international statistical organisations. Acting in accordance with this right, the Department of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova concluded co-operation agreements with the National Commission for Statistics of Romania in 1992, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Eurostat and INSEE (France) in 1993, with the Ministry of Statistics of the Republic of Belarus in 1995, and with Goskomstat of Kyrgyzstan in 1996. This enabled us to receive extensive methodological assistance in introducing the SNA system, developing and introducing national classifications, establishing a register of statistical units, which we are working on at present, implementing the 1993 European Comparisons Programme and other issues. Eurostat has also provided technical assistance by equipping the Department of Statistics with personal computers. All of the above enables us to conclude that the Law on Statistics of the Republic of Moldova was able to fundamentally change the organisation of statistics and statistical methods in our country and to attain the desired results, with the result that today Moldova is presented in international studies more extensively than before and indicators on social and economic development are comparable with those for other countries. DISCUSSANT JEAN-LOUIS BODIN - INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA STATISTIQUE ET DE ETUDES ECONOMIQUES, FRANCE First of all, as other speakers have done before me, I would like to congratulate Goskomstat of the Russian Federation and Eurostat who have organised this meeting. \"Where we were, where we are, where we are going?\" is certainly a good question which summarises the problem of statistical transition. Let me also thank our hosts, Goskomstat and the Statistical Committee of this wonderful and unique city. And finally - I promise to stop congratulating and delivering thanks after this last one! - let me also congratulate the authors of the two papers we have just heard, Mr Goryachkovsky, President of Goskomstat of Kazakhstan and Mr Ion Tobultoc, Director General of the Dipartamentul di Stat pentru Statistica of the Republic of Moldova for their very comprehensive and interesting papers, and, above all, for having succeeded in passing their fundamental Law on Statistics very soon after the creation of their states. Indeed: - in Kazakhstan, the Law was passed in 1992, that is to say less than one year after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the creation of their new republic; - in Moldova, the Law was approved in December, 1990, that is to say 16 months after the proclamation of the independence of this former Soviet Socialist Republic, in despite of a very difficult international environment for the newly created republic. 45 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Adoption of such laws is indeed very important in order to create a legal framework indispensable for permitting to continue the collection of data without any objections coming from the furnishers of those data, especially in newly created countries such as these two. On the other hand, good laws and good regulations are a prerequisite for building the confidence of both furnishers of individual data and users of aggregated data, which is a very fundamental element in a market-oriented economy and in a democratic system. A juridical, legislative and regulatory environment is absolutely necessary to legitimate the production of official statistics, but such an environment is certainly not sufficient in itself to make official statistics credible. Legitimacy and credibility cannot be achieved only through the effects of laws and decrees; they have to be achieved after years and years of proven independence vis-\u00e0-vis all the powers, not only the political power, after years and years of good professional practices, in accordance with recognised principles and accepted rules and standards. A good strategy to achieve legitimacy and credibility in official statistics is two-fold: - first, to recognise, through fundamental laws such as the ones discussed in this session, the main characteristics of statistical activities, such as scientific independence, professionalism, the need to make impartial statistical information available to society at large, confidentiality of individual data, transparency of legislation and of methods and classifications, co-ordination of the statistical activities inside and outside the Central Statistical Office, etc.; for instance, the draft regulation on the action of the European Community in the field of statistics, which is currently being submitted to the European Council, includes a full chapter describing these main characteristics; - second, to have adopted by the World Statistical Community, in bodies like the UN Statistical Commission, codes of conduct, codes of good behaviour, codes of best practices, scientific guidelines, etc. Let me come back on the concept of independence which is a very complicated one. That concept is present, more or less, in the two papers. Pardon me for being very direct: I am afraid the authors have assimilated too rapidly the independence of the National Statistical Offices (NSOs), to the kind of authority supervising NSO's activities. For instance, Mr Goryachkovsky indicates in this paper that Goskomstat of Kazakhstan operates under the direct supervision of the President of the State and he says that, I am quoting him, \"Consequently no Ministry or Department or any public organisation has any direct or indirect means of influencing the professional activities of Goskomstat\". I am not willing to say that some solutions are better than others; I certainly do not consider there are generally good solutions that should be adopted urbi et orbi. In fact, that question \"Which high authority has to supervise the NSO's activities?\" has to be solved country by country, according to each country's overall administrative organisation, traditions, ancient and recent history, etc. For instance, in France, INSEE, that is to say the French National Statistical Office, is operating under the supervision of the Minister of Economy and Finance; such a supervision does not prevent INSEE from being one of the most independent NSOs in the world. In the fifteen members of the European Union, we have probably fifteen different answers to that question! Sometimes, direct supervision by the Prime Minister, or by the Head of the State, or by the Chair of the Parliament, is not automatically a good guarantee for scientific independence and may be questionable as concerns financial independence. I do not say, of course, that this is the case in Kazakhstan; I say that there is no automatic link between the independence and the hierarchical authority on the NSOs. The concept of total independence does not exist in any country in the world: at least, no NSO anywhere in the world has got its financial independence and such a goal is certainly a pipedream! The policy of \"cost recovery\" adopted in several industrialised countries for disseminating data has to be considered but cannot guarantee by itself total financial independence, a large amount of the costs remaining not being covered. 46 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In fact, we, statisticians, should pay very close attention to NSOs' scientific independence. What is scientific independence? It means that, once the decision to launch a specific statistical investigation has been taken, no one, except statisticians themselves has any right to interfere with the choice of classifications, or methods for collecting and processing the data, etc. It is up to the statisticians, and only to them, to decide on those technical and scientific problems. At that step, the most important question is \"How to decide to launch study A and not to launch study B?\". I have the feeling that no provision of the Kazakh or of the Moldovan laws is helpful in answering that question. We have a partial answer in Article 1 of the Resolution on the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics adopted by the UN Economic Commission for Europe in April, 1992. Let me quote this article: \"Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the government, the economy and the public with data about the demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens' entitlement to public information.\" How to meet the test of practical utility? Statisticians evidently do not themselves have the authority to decide to collect a given element of information simply because they have chosen to do so or because they consider that producing such data would be \"useful to society\". It is up to society itself, and its different groups, to decide which data and information it actually needs. Obviously, two basic questions arise at this point: 1. How should decisions be made and what mechanisms should be set up to help society to decide which data should be collected? More specifically, who or which body should be authorised to say that the data that an NSO is preparing to collect meets the test of practical utility? 2. What trade-offs can be found between demand and the means actually available to national statistical offices so as to ensure that the final decision is not altogether made exclusively by the budget authorities? In most of the industrialised countries, one effective means of dealing with the problem of satisfying the test of practical utility is to have statistical programmes examined by suitable advisory bodies, such as those created throughout the most developed countries in the past 25 years, for instance the Advisory Committee on Statistics in the United Kingdom, the Central Commission for Statistics in the Netherlands, and the National Council for Statistical Information (the so-called CNIS) in France. In these countries, these organisms have become indispensable meeting points between users and producers and undoubtedly permit society to deal with this difficult problem of meeting the test of practical utility. Neither of the two laws presented in this session proposes the creation of such organisms. I have noted another very important point which is missing at least in the presentation of the papers: both of them report that the passed laws make provisions for rendering mandatory the supply of information by legal and physical persons. But none of these two papers presents provisions for ensuring the confidentiality of individual data. Confidentiality of individual data is very important to build indispensable confidence in statistics and the exact counterpart of the provisions rendering mandatory the data collection, inasmuch as, at the time of central-planned economy, the situation was, without exaggerating, the exact opposite of the situation in market-oriented economies: the aggregated data were almost secret while the individual data on firms were largely forwarded to the Gosplan and to the technical ministries. In all the countries of the European Union, provisions for ensuring strict confidentiality of individual data are one of the most important points in the statistical laws and regulations. 47 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In the same way, I think it is necessary to introduce in statistical laws and regulations some provisions for ensuring broad dissemination of all the data not covered by statistical secrecy, that is to say, grosso modo, all aggregated data. Nobody, no authority, can have the privilege to receive data which are not disseminated to any other user and to the public at large. The time of the release of aggregated data should be exactly the same for Ministers and for the public. If there is any privilege in the timeliness of the releases, this privilege should be as limited as possible: for instance, in France, it is true that the Minister of Economy and Finances knows the Consumer Price Index before it is announced through press releases; in fact, this figure is communicated to the Minister half an hour before it is released to the media! My last comment is about statistical co-ordination. Of course, statistical co-ordination is a fundamental issue in countries where the statistical system is decentralised as it is the case in countries like the USA, United Kingdom or France. But no statistical system in the world is purely centralised. So the issue of statistical co-ordination should be dealt with in all the statistical laws and regulations. These issues are present in the Kazakh and Moldovan papers. The role of the Central Statistical Office as co-ordinator of the whole statistical system is fundamental: that means that the Central Statistical Office should be the only body responsible for statistical classifications and standards and should be involved in the preparation of all the statistical programmes. If possible, the President or the Director General of the Central Statistical Office should be also appointed as the National Statistician of the country as is, for instance, clearly the case in United Kingdom. If possible, he has to be consulted before the appointment of the heads of the decentralised statistical services. To conclude these comments, I would like to insist once again on the fact that there are no good statistical laws in general since all the laws have to take into account the historical, political, administrative specificities of each country, that good laws are a prerequisite to building the confidence of the furnishers and users of data in statistics, but that such laws are not sufficient by themselves to guarantee confidence. * * * DISCUSSANT HEINZ HERBERTZ - FEDERAL STATISTICAL OFFICE IN WIESBADEN, GERMANY Legislation on statistics in Germany Thank you for giving me the opportunity to make some remarks concerning legislation on statistics in Germany. The main legal provision for statistics in Germany is the Federal Statistics Law, which you may consider as our basic law of statistics. It lays down the tasks of the Federal Statistical Office, and certain rules which are fundamental and apply to all federal statistics. Because time is short I would like to concentrate on a few very important principles, which the Federal Statistics Law regulates, or specifies in the context of federal statistics. These principles are: - Legislation - Technical concentration of official statistics Federalism - Statistical confidentiality Legislation The first principle, the principle of legislation, means that federal statistics are ordered by law unless otherwise determined. So in principle each and every federal statistic needs a special legal basis. We 48 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go do not draw up official statistics on this subject, but I estimate that there are about 130 special laws and ordinances which govern the different federal statistics. According to the federal statistics law providing the guidelines, the special legal provisions have to lay down as minimum content: - whether the survey concerned is mandatory or voluntary - the group of respondents to be covered - the characteristics - the type of survey (total enumeration or sample survey) - the reference period or date - the periodicity. Now, what is the purpose of this rather complex system of rules and regulations? The main reason is to protect the rights of every individual concerning his or her data. The German Constitutional Court has developed the general personality right laid down in the constitution into a special basic right of \"informational self-determination\". According to this right everybody can decide what happens to his or her data. Furthermore an obligation to respond to a statistical survey interferes with the constitutional right concerning the freedom of action. Of course these rights can be restricted in predominant public interest, but only by enacting the necessary legal basis. Technical concentration of official statistics in federalism The next topic concerns the administrative organisation of federal statistics, which differs very much from the situation in some transitional countries. Federal statistics are technically concentrated, which means that the statistical work is brought together at the statistical offices, which are the competent authorities established for this purpose. There are only few exceptions where non-statistical agencies, too, are authorised to draw up official statistics, for instance the labour administration and the Federal Bank. Therefore, on the federal level the Federal Statistical Office was established as the central authority in charge of statistics. Besides the 16 states within the Federal Republic of Germany, the L\u00e4nder, run their own statistical offices. The Federal Statistical Office works for all federal ministries in accordance with their requirements, the ministries have the authority to instruct the Federal Statistical Office, but not insofar as methodological and scientific questions are concerned. This area is exclusively left to the Federal Statistical Office in order to safeguard the objectivity and neutrality of its work. According to the federative structure of state and administration in Germany administrative tasks are carried out by the agencies of the L\u00e4nder unless otherwise provided by law. Concerning the implementation of Federal Statistics the Federal Statistics Law specifies that the Federal Statistical Office is responsible for the: - methodological and technical preparation and development of federal statistics - and the compilation and publication of statistics for federal purposes. This means that in accordance with the principle of federalism the 16 Statistical Offices of the L\u00e4nder are in general entrusted with the collection and processing of data up to the level of L\u00e4nder results. The Federal Statistical Office is only competent to collect and process federal statistics if this is provided for by law or if the L\u00e4nder agree. 49 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In their area of responsibility the statistical Offices of the L\u00e4nder are not bound by instructions of the federal administration; the Federal Statistical Office is limited to co-ordinating functions. So we may conclude that federal statistics in Germany are organised on a largely decentralised basis. There are only few exceptions, for example foreign trade statistics, which are carried out solely by the Federal Statistical Office. Finally, I would like to comment on the legal situation concerning Statistical Confidentiality. The Federal Statistics Law regulates that in principle individual data provided for federal statistics must not be disclosed. Violation of statistical secrecy is a criminal offence. The legal background for these regulations is the already mentioned right of informational self- determination. It requires that the individual be protected against the disclosure of his or her situation. But apart from the legal point of view this principle is also essential for the practical implementation of federal statistics because it is intended to secure the willingness of the respondents to reply as well as the reliability of the information provided. The Statistical Offices strive for a relationship of mutual trust with respondents. Consequently, in Germany statistical secrecy is regarded as an indispensible compensation for the obligation to respond to statistical surveys. Nevertheless in order to meet practical needs there is also demand for exceptions to the rule of statistical secrecy. Therefore transmission or publication of individual data is possible for example if: - it is laid down in one of the special statistics laws I mentioned in connection with the principle of legislation; - 'the respondent gives his or her written approval; - the data of at least three data subjects have been aggregated; - the data have been anonymised in such a way that it is absolutely impossible to reidentify the person concerned; and of course - the Federal Statistical Office and the Statistical Offices of the L\u00e4nder have the possibility to exchange data in order to draw up federal statistics. Furthermore under restricting conditions regulated in detail by the Federal Statistics Law transmission of individual data is also lawful to meet the requirements of community statistics and scientific projects. If a special statistical law authorises it, the ministries may receive tables for the purposes of legislation and planning, even if tabular elements record only one individual case. Prospects Finally, I would like to make some short remarks concerning the prospects of German legislation on statistics. In my view there are three main tendencies to mention: First of all official statistics in Germany are more and more influenced and determined by the law of the European Communities. For several years the EC has intensified its efforts to create a harmonised European statistical system. In the not-too-distant future the Council of the European Communities 50 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go will adopt a regulation which lays down the principles of Community statistics. The upcoming regulation on structural business statistics also constitutes a fundamental legal foundation. Another EC regulation has already entered into force, namely the regulation on Community co ordination in drawing up business registers for statistical purposes. According to this legal act Germany has to maintain a rather extensive business register. The German statistical programme so far can only partly meet the requirements of this register. But there are no resources to finance a primary collection of the missing data and besides we cannot increase the statistical burden on enterprises. Consequently we are preparing a law which gives the Statistical Offices access to administrative data. For instance, tax authorities and labour administration will be under an obligation to provide the information we need. There is a general tendency to the use of administrative data for statistical purposes in Germany nowadays, because this seems to be a solution to the problem of collecting the required data while saving costs and reducing the statistical burden on enterprises and citizens. This leads me to the aspect of cost pressure. The German government decided in 1995 that federal statistics had to be reduced to the absolute minimum. This decision is part of a general attempt to slim down administration and decrease the expenses of enterprises. In the field of statistics the government demand led to extensive negotiations, which have not finished yet. The situation is extremely difficult, because the cost saving demands are in conflict with justified information requirements of state and society. However, as a first step a law on the Adjustment of Statistics has been drafted and will hopefully enter into force in 1997. It consists of regulations that abolish certain surveys, reduce the number of characteristics and prolong periodicities. But I think that this is only the beginning of a continuing process which might also lead to slightly less detailed and more flexible legislation on statistics in Germany. These were my short and therefore very simplified remarks concerning legislation on statistics in Germany. Thank you for your attention. COMMENTS, REPLIES AND AUDIENCE DISCUSSION COMMENTS EDVARD OUTRATA - PRESIDENT, CENTRAL STATISTICAL OFFICE, CZECH REPUBLIC I would like to address one small point. The problem I think by now should not be getting your legislation through. That, I heard from Mr Yurkov, was a problem in Russia. I shall be very much interested in the details of that because that should shed very interesting light on the politics which in other countries probably was not much of an issue. 51 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go I can well imagine that getting yourself reasonable legislation and passing it through your bodies can be done within five years. I am much more concerned and I think I did not hear it in the two papers about what concrete steps as managers of your organisations you have been taking in ensuring that the letter of the law actually becomes reality and I can give you an example from my own experience. When I became president of the Statistical Office in the Czech Republic I already had an acceptable law with most of the safeguards; we rewrote it and passed another one rather easily, I must say. But my real problem was in reorienting the office really in the manner that legally clearly was there. For example, soon after I found out that there were some low level relations between some of the ministries and the office which indeed included passing on confidential information. Well, I jumped to the ceiling, made a big fuss and now I am pretty sure it is out. But clearly this happens in all of your offices or did at one time because the communist system ordered it basically. Clearly under that system you collected data in order to check against the plan. That was the main duty of the statistical office at that time. Therefore clearly you established these types of relations and unless something has been done it is still going on. What I would like to hear is, for example, how individual offices cope with this. I told you how I did and I can go into more details for anybody who is interested. That is my first question to the two presenters but really to all my colleagues in the transition countries. My next question is: \"What did you do with the requirement for formal authority of data published by the statistical office?\" When I started to draft the new law many good souls came to me and suggested that I should put something in that would put a rubber stamp on the official publications of our office. By law what I published should have authority. Clearly, I absolutely refused. If you have this in your laws, it is actually very dangerous because bad work can be covered by it. REPLY VLADIMIR GORYACHKOVSKY - CHAIRMAN, STATE COMMITTEE ON STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS, KAZAKHSTAN I shall try to answer in more detail the questions which have just been asked by the representatives of France and the Czech Republic. First of all, I would like to inform you who Goskomstat is answerable to and why it reports direct to the President. We talk a very great deal about the fact that the statistical authorities are now very much influenced by political forces. We, for example, do not feel this because our statistical office reports direct to the President and nobody can interfere in our activity, nobody can make any amendments to one or other of our figures. Today it is very difficult to make such amendments since there is not the same plan-based system and no legislative acts on whose basis we derived all the statistical data. It is true we followed the plan but the plan was the law. And whether we were in the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan or any other country with a plan economy, it was all the same. The plan was approved and the statisticians monitored its fulfilment. The situation changed when the plan system collapsed and the conversion to a market system began. What had to be done at the very start so that the statistical bodies could produce data depicting the development or decline of one or other entity? A law was needed in order to allow us today to obtain data from persons and the bodies which were being created. The system itself began to change and so this law was needed and it was adopted in January 1992. 52 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go This law was passed after studying several laws. We ourselves had never worked in market conditions, but to be able to work we needed a law. It allowed us to produce data irrespective of the hierarchical position of the newly established systems. Today, lots of people talk about us not maintaining full confidentiality. This may be so. But now 55% of the shares of state enterprises belong to the state, but the state acts in the form of the Government. As soon as it sells its shares, the enterprise closes off its data from all persons whatsoever. And only with the agreement of the enterprise or of a person has the statistical body the right to issue these data. This is clearly set out in the law and we keep to it. In my paper I said that we now fully maintain confidentiality of the data of all natural and legal persons and nobody is ever informed of the source of these data. We only use these data in an aggregated form. Unfortunately, I did not bring with me our statistical bulletin which talks about small business and how its activity is reflected in our accounts. Now I would like to say a few words about the publication of data. In my paper I said that we had a commission which sets out the schedule for our statistical work for the year. This schedule is formulated from proposals by the Government, scientific research and business organisations as well as other groups. What society needs today is compiled and published by us. The schedule is approved by the Government because it finances our activities; we get money from the Government on the basis of this schedule and it specifies the total value of all work done by us. We plan our publications independently of government departments. We produce the data society needs today. Apart from compendiums we publish other collections providing information on individual subjects. MODERATOR TOM GRIFFIN - DIRECTOR, STATISTICAL DIVISION, ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR EUROPE The last question of Mr Outrata, perhaps, was not sufficiently clear. Yes, everybody is publishing data. The point which Mr Outrata made and I am trying to reiterate was not simply that you have to make your publications but that you say in advance that your consumer price index will always be released on the seventh day of the month following the month in which it was estimated, that your unemployment data will always be released in the third week of such and such a month. In other words, very precise timetables so that a politician cannot delay the publication of data. That was the third point that many statisticians in countries have found an extremely useful defence against political interference. REPLY VLADIMIR GORYACHKOVSKY - CHAIRMAN, STATE COMMITTEE ON STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS, KAZAKHSTAN I will also reply to this question because in our country, too, everything is set out in the publication schedule. It clearly specifies the deadlines and I am obliged to publish these data by those deadlines. The Government cannot influence me in order to postpone these deadlines. I can extend them myself if I am not ready. They, on the other hand, say, \"The deadlines are set out in the schedule. Please publish the data\". Thus all work connected with publications is clearly specified. 53 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go REPLY ION TOBULTOC - GENERAL DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS, MOLDOVA I of course touched on these points in my paper. Perhaps they were not analysed thoroughly. I would not like to take up your time because some of these items have already been dealt with in the paper given by my colleague Mr Goryachkovsky. It goes without saying that we do not claim that everything is ideal in our countries. We are going through a transitional period and in this period we are learning everything from you and from others. Consequently, there may be some disparities, but on the whole, we are keeping to the laws. However, as Mr Bodin said, a law may exist without being implemented to the letter. All the same, Moldova's statistical office tries to keep to the laws. COMMENTS ELENA IVANOVA - STATE COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS As far as I can remember, all three questions to some extent were of relevance to Russia as well and perhaps to Russia in particular. My general impression is that a lot of people have been thinking for a long time now, \"Why is Russia stalling with the law? What has happened to the law on statistics of the Russian Federation?\" It is true that we have been working on it for a year and a half now, but the point is, we have to prove the need for including individual standards in the law, which not everyone understands, and we have to prove it not to the government of the Russian Federation but to the legal authorities: the Ministry of Justice and the Principal State Legal Administration of the Office of the President of the Russian Federation. We just want to make sure the law can work. There are individual articles on the organisation of statistical activity, and in particular on who is entitled to order statistical compilations and on whose account they are to be carried out at federal and regional level. We introduced an article about state statistical standards and unfortunately we have to prove that the approval of the statistical standards is the prerogative of the State Statistical Committee. Although currently some people are trying to tell us that this is the duty of the Government of the Russian Federation. Thus we are fighting over this standard and intend, in line with the Regulations governing Goskomstat, to approve statistical standards in conformity with international norms. There is another problem which at the moment is preventing us from getting the President's signature to the Law. It is the article on the State Statistical Register. The point is that in parallel with the state statistical activities in Russia a law has been drafted on the registration of legal persons and these two draft laws are to some extent in contradiction with each other. The State Statistical Register is a system of statistical registration of legal persons which was elaborated in the Russian statistical office many years ago and is developing progressively. There has never been a law on the registration of legal persons in Russia before. The registration offices of the local government bodies register legal persons \"as the whim takes them\" - in other words, according to their own personal imagination. There have never been general state standards in Russia's registration offices. And so we are now trying, via the conciliatory commission made up of representatives of the Ministry of Justice, State Duma, President's Office and Goskomstat Russia, to bring in standards for the two registration systems which will also include procedures for identifying enterprises in full compliance with each other so that there is no contradiction. 54 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Now for a few words about confidentiality. We have introduced an article on guarantees for legal and natural persons regarding the non-disclosure of raw statistical data. I am afraid I might cause a bit of a laugh in this auditorium but to some extent I am even slightly glad that the law will be delayed. As soon as it is passed, this standard will enter into force but there is no guarantee that we will not run into trouble and be taken to court by enterprises, and not even so much by enterprises but by natural persons who provide us with information on their individual activities. There must be many organisational regulations which need to be prepared in addition to the Law because on our statistical form there is a note about confidentiality being guaranteed by the recipient of the information. However, this is only a statement as yet and is not corroborated by anything else. It is true that in Russia a further law on the confidentiality of information is being drafted in parallel with ours. I assume it will include provisions also affecting state statistical reporting, but all the same, we understand all too well that there are enormous problems ahead and now we are essentially working through these questions and consulting the legal bodies at the same time. As far as publications are concerned, it is difficult for me to answer this question right now because Mr Sokolin will be talking about this particular subject in two days' time. I think he will give us enough details about how Goskomstat's activities and those of its regional offices are organised for dealing with problems of publications activity. MODERATOR TOM GRIFFLN - DIRECTOR, STATISTICAL DIVISION, ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR EUROPE In the Kazakhstan paper and also in the paper of Mr Franchet mention was made of the Fundamental Principles of Statistics which were derived in 1992 by the Conference of European Statisticians. It is an important document and I'm sure many of you already know it but for those who do not, some copies both in English and Russian are available outside where the papers are on display. So if anybody wants to refresh his memory or has not seen the Fundamental Principles of Statistics they will find them outside. In fact, the subject of the Fundamental Principles will certainly be discussed at the next plenary session of the Conference of European Statisticians which takes place in Geneva in June next year. 55 ",

        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go MODERATOR MIKHAIL BELKINDAS - STATISTICAL ADVISOR, INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT, THE WORLD BANK This session will be dealing with some very important issues of organisation of statistical work and I would like to ask the presenters and the discussants to stick to this particular issue and we all understand that this is a very broad issue. However, let us focus on it and I think that the organisation of statistical work in the transition countries is a very dynamic process because you are changing your data collection systems when you are moving away from data enumeration towards sampling, when you are changing your data processing techniques, moving from the old main frames towards using the PCs, etc. Your entire organisation of the work is changing as your economics are changing. So, what we had yesterday is partially history; what we have today is a kind of transitional stage and it will probably be years to come until there will be some kind of stable well organised statistical system. SPEAKER ARIF VELIEV - CHAIRMAN, STATE STATISTICAL COMMITTEE, AZERBAIJAN The organisation and administration of statistical activities in the Azerbaijani Republic: the organisation of central and local offices and relations between them, the staff situation (number, qualifications, organisation of in-house training) and the strategy for and organisation of information technology in statistical activities. Where we were This year the Azerbaijani Statistical Office celebrates its 76th birthday. In April 1920, when Soviet power was established in Azerbaijan, one of the state's measures was to organise state statistics in the Republic. On 8 July 1920, the Regulation on the temporary board of statisticians was approved and on 19 August of the same year a new regulation on state statistics was published, in accordance with which the keeping of statistics in the Republic became the responsibility of the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and bodies formed by it, the statistical organisations of individual departments, the municipal, district and rural administrations and administrative economic bodies. On 17 December 1920, the Central Statistical Office was set up with 15 subdivisions, whose board had 12 members. The organisation of statistics in Azerbaijan was carried out in the most difficult conditions with insufficient qualified staff. The Government of the Republic did its best to help in the creation of the statistical authority and this is evidenced by a number of government decisions and instructions issued in the first few years of Soviet power, including those on the mobilisation of statistical resources, the registration of statisticians, co-operation with staff of the Azerbaijani Central Statistical Office in statistical work, on statistical courses, the organisation of a committee for mobilising statistical resources and other legislation. 1928 saw the approval of the new Regulation on the Central Statistical Office of the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) and the CSO began to conduct its activities via the uyezd (district) statistical divisions, the Central Statistical Bureau of the Nakhichevan Autonomous SSR and the Statistical Bureau of the Karabakh Autonomous Region. 59 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In 1934 a network of district and municipal national accounts inspectorates was created and in the autumn of that year to improve the work of the lower units of state statistics the post of divisional inspector was instituted. After 1940 the state statistical authorities based their work on common principles, a uniform methodology and the organisation of common state statistics according to the concept of a centralised system of accounts and statistics being one of the most important means of state control and plan-based administration of the national economy's development. At all stages of their existence the state statistical bodies have primarily performed the vital tasks of the period concerned as laid down by the decisions and directives of the ruling party. In 1957 the computation centre of the CSO of the Azerbaijani SSR was set up, which was later to be transformed into the Main Computer Centre. In 1958, computational centres were also organised for the statistical offices of the Nakhichevan SSR, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region and Baku, but for the Republic's districts this work was only completed towards the end of 1970. In 1971 the district inspectorates of state statistics were amalgamated with the computation centres and a single state statistical body, the district (municipal) information processing centre, was created. On 17 August 1987, the Central Statistical Office of the Azerbaijani SSR was transformed into the Union-Republic State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijani SSR. Furthermore, it was decided to set up corresponding statistical offices in the Nakhichevan SSR and Nagomo-Karabakh Autonomous Region on the basis of the existing statistical offices as well as self-funding associations providing information processing and computing services, whereas in the Republic's cities and districts the municipal (district) statistical offices (divisions) were based on the municipal (district) information processing and computing centres. Throughout this period, the statistical bodies of Azerbaijan, in their activities, administered methodological material approved by Goskomstat USSR, and almost all statistical reporting was adopted via a centralised procedure. As in all former Soviet Union republics, Azerbaijan's statistical services had no links whatsoever with international economic organisations or any of the statistical offices of other countries. The State Statistical Committee of the former Soviet Union was a centralised multilevel system with a common information space and programme environment. The existence of a common information space significantly facilitated the process of drafting special EDP programs. The software drafting was done collectively, in other words, it was divided between the republic computer centres. The programming divisions of these centres drafted special programs for automatically processing the statistical forms to be used by them and circulated these programs to the statistical offices of all the other republics for their use. Thus, the software was drafted using the potential of the programmers of all the statistical offices of the Goskomstat (State Statistical Committee) USSR organisation, in other words, over 900 programmers in the republic and regional computer centres. Our computer centre in particular drafted and distributed to the other republics software for the electronic drafting of 14 statistical forms and received from them the software for processing over 120 forms. Using this technology, we and the other republics automatically processed data from over 140 types of statistical forms, including those used for the most important and largest-scale statistical tasks. Obviously, the advantages of this technology were: - the possibility of creating a large number of software products allowing automation of the most difficult statistical tasks, and 60 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - a high utilisation coefficient for software products. The drawbacks of this technology were: - insufficient attention to the specific particularities of the statistics of each individual republic; - the outdated technical basis on which the software was oriented. Where we are Since 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the formation of the Azerbaijani Republic as a sovereign state, the need arose to set up a national statistical office in line with the status of an independent state. One of the main problems facing Goskomstat, the State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijani Republic in the period of establishing the national office was the absence of a law on statistics for the Azerbaijani Republic as the legal basis for statistical activity in the Republic. The bill was prepared and presented to the Republic's \"Milli Mejlis\" where it was passed in February 1994, after repeated discussion. The law reinforces the right of the Republic's statistical bodies to obtain from legal and natural persons on a compulsory basis the information required by them, to obtain and use data from financial, banking, fiscal, customs and other state bodies, to determine the flows and volumes of information to be presented by economic units, state executive bodies, social and other organisations. The Law on Statistics allows the creation of a stable statistical information system at the national and regional levels. In 1992, by decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, the State Programme for the Azerbaijani Republic's conversion to a system of accounting and statistics accepted in international practice was drafted and approved, and became the organisational basis for statistical activity in the Republic. The implementation of the tasks earmarked in the Programme for a 5-year period is the first stage in the formation of Azerbaijani statistics which is due to be completed by 1998. In accordance with the Programme for 1993-1996 a number of tasks were completed which were oriented towards developing the technological, overall methodological and organisational basis for statistics with the aim of making a statistical study of and obtaining objective information on the new phenomena and processes under way in the Republic's economy. Consequently, a set of statistical indicators has been selected, monthly estimates of the volumes and trends of the gross domestic product are being made, completely new price and employment statistics have been established, changes have been made to the statistics of the population's standard of living, a State Statistical. Register of legal persons has been created which has already been used for conducting a sample survey, classifications have been drawn up: for types of economic activity, populated areas, forms of ownership, organisational and legal forms, as well as sectors of the economy. In accordance with international requirements, a number of tasks have been completed on establishing a system of national accounts, work has been conducted on international comparisons of gross domestic product, the reorganisation of financial, budget and banking statistics, the calculation of data required for compiling the balance of payments, the reforming of external trade indicators to bring them into line with international requirements, and other work. Efforts have been targeted on ascertaining the actual users of information and public demand for it. Work is being done on providing information support for state administration, for scientific and research organisations, commercial groups, the general public, international organisations, etc. I shall not take up your time by listing all the work we have done, but I would just like to say that in our statistical activities in the Azerbaijani Republic new ideas and developments have been set in motion which are enabling us to bring accounts and statistics up to international level. Currently, the funding of the entire state statistical system in the Republic is drawn from the national budget. The heads of the local statistical offices are appointed by Goskomstat Azerbaijan. The State Statistical Committee bears full responsibility for the national administration of statistics and is the only organisation for collecting, processing and analysing statistical information, meeting demands made of it 61 ",

Goskomstat has been given the right to approve the statistical work programme, select the set of indicators for statistical accounts and to work out the methodological instructions for keeping them. In accordance with the Law on Statistics of the Azerbaijani Republic and the Regulation on the State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijani Republic, the following come under the responsibility of Goskomstat: - the Main Computer Centre; - the State Statistical Committee of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic; - the Baku Municipal Statistical Office; - the municipal and district statistical offices (totalling 63); - the Scientific Research and Planning Technology Centre for statistical information; - the Study Centre for providing basic and further training for accounting and statistics specialists.

In the past few years, with the conversion of the accounting and statistical system to international standards, the following new units have been created: the national accounts and balances department, also responsible for price statistics; divisions in charge of external trade statistics, privatised structures statistics and the organisation of state registers and classifications. 62 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Goskomstat's organisational structure currently includes the following subdivisions: CHAIRMAN Staff administration and Training Enterprises Vice-chairman Coordination of Statistical Work department Agricultural Statistics department \u03a4 Price Statistics department I Trade and Services Statistics division Administration of Statistical Information Accounts and Auditing division Vice-chairman National Accounts and Balances department Industrial Statistics department I Financial and Banking Statistics department Labour Statistics division External Trade Statistics division Vice-chairman Vice-chairman Head of Demographic and Social Statistics Vice-chairman Head of the Main Computer Center Major Construction Statistics division Material Resources Statistics division I Transport and Communication Statistics division Privatised Structures Statistics division At the moment, there are 2 286 persons working in the central offices of the State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijani Republic, 1 653 of whom are funded from the budget. Among the staff there are 1 381 females. A total of 1 361 are administrative staff or specialists, 902 of whom have a high level and 195 a medium level of specialist training. Furthermore, 313 have been working for the statistical authorities for over 15 years, 356 for over 10 years and finally, 182 for over 5 years. The staff of Goskomstat of the Azerbaijani Republic mainly receive training at the State Economic Institute of the Azerbaijani Republic, in the economics faculties of other state and non-state universities and institutes, as well as economics technical colleges. However, the completion of the new tasks facing the statistical bodies with the country's conversion to a market economy and the integration of 63 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Azerbaijan in the world community are inconceivable without appropriate retraining of the statistical system's specialists. Each year, one fifth of the staff are retrained using in-house facilities for all forms of training. In the past few years, staff have been retrained by \"multipliers\" trained by Eurostat at the Berlin training centre. As is evident from the above tables, there are 18 independent departments and divisions operating in the State Statistical Committee's central offices. They have a staff of 169, 154 of whom with a higher education. Currently, Goskomstat also has 65 independent territorial statistical offices whose heads are appointed by it as local executive body representatives. The tasks to be performed by the territorial statistical offices are decided by the State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijani Republic and set out in an annual regulation (plan) which is approved by the Committee's board. In the regulation each area of activity is systematically divided into types of work which are performed at specific intervals, are characterised by individual means of presentation and deadlines for completion, survey tools and profiles for calculating the results of statistical enumeration. The work planned by the regulation is obligatory both for the Goskomstat central offices and its local statistical offices. These tasks can be grouped as follows: - the preparation, organisation and implementation of exhaustive and sample collections of data as set out in the regulation; - checking for completeness of report data, transferring them to the Main Computer Centre of Goskomstat of the Azerbaijani Republic and supplying them to the local bodies, studying social and economic phenomena in the region, analysing them and informing the local public and economic organisations about them; - checking the reliability of statistical data; - 'completing work connected with economic activities etc. At the moment, in Goskomstat's central offices a Novell local network with four file servers and 50 work stations are used. The servers of this network are 386 and 486-class PCs with a small RAM and hard disk memory. The work stations are mainly equipped with 286 and 386 class PCs. Apart from this network, at the Main Computer Centre the old Soviet-produced \"unified system\" computer is still in operation. Although this computer is not compatible with modern technology, it has to be used since a large portion of the main statistical work in Goskomstat's central offices has not yet been transferred to modern computers. As for the district and regional subdivisions, we can say that these have no computer equipment. Since 1991, the software left over from the former system has gradually become outdated and is starting to become unserviceable for the following reasons: - the reform of statistics and conversion to methods accepted in international statistical practice, and - the switchover to new hardware (\u0393\u0392\u039c-compatible personal computers and networks). 64 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go At the moment, special software for processing statistical information on the new hardware is gradually being prepared. However, this work is being substantially delayed for lack of programmers at the MCC and modern computer equipment in the subdivisions. Where we are going Currently in the Azerbaijani Republic the privatisation process and other reforms in the economic and social spheres of the nation's life have been started and this in turn is setting new tasks for the state statistics authorities in practice. Very soon we will have to deal with the task of putting together a methodology which takes account of the specific characteristics of Azerbaijan. A methodology for SNA indicators for Azerbaijan which characterise the country's financial flows needs to be worked out. The basis for this will have to be enterprise statistics as well as administrative and banking statistics. At the same time, complex correlations will have to be provided in the methodology of different branch indicators. The reforms under way in Azerbaijan call for a switchover to business statistics from the branch approach to collecting returns which has been applied in our statistics right from the start. In this area we already have some experience: in the last seven years we have received from joint ventures and small enterprises integrated returns for a short-list of indicators. The conversion to business statistics will allow us to make more detailed and correlated analyses of the functioning of the labour market and markets for capital, goods and services, provide producers with complex economic, demographic and sociological reference data, make more accurate assessments of the scale and trends of investment flows, and to determine which sectors of the economy are financially stable and unstable. In the process of statistical reform, an optimum combination of all existing methods of organising the collection of information such as traditional full-scale and untraditional sample surveying needs to be applied, giving special attention to sociological enquiries for providing facts about the nation as a whole. The creation of the basis for a national statistical system and the harmonisation of accounting and statistics with internationally accepted norms requires an intensification of work on improving existing and setting up new classifications. The adoption of business statistics calls for a clear formulation of the rules for dividing up accounting units; in other words, they have to be classified. Insofar as the 1st stage of the reform of Azerbaijani statistics to meet the needs of a transition economy is due for completion in 1997, we are faced with the task of drafting the plan for its development in the 2nd stage up to and including the year 2000. In the statistical reform process, the staffing of Goskomstat's bodies is particularly important and therefore special attention will be devoted in Azerbaijan to the overall improvement of the system of basic training, retraining and improvement of the qualifications of specialists in statistics. One of the most important tasks facing the statistical bodies is the publication of statistical data in the public press to inform the general public about the socio-economic development of the Republic and its regions. For this purpose, a complex information system needs to be set up which would allow the information needs of the mass media, the scientific community, international organisations, commercial structures and private persons to be satisfied. The organisation of electronic processing of statistical data in the Goskomstat organisation in line with modern European standards requires solutions to the following three problems: - supply of modern computer equipment to all levels of the statistical system; 65 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - drafting of special software for processing statistical information; - implementation of modern methods of distributed processing of statistical data. Obviously, the re-equipping of the Goskomstat system is one of the main conditions for organising the electronic processing of statistical data on a modern basis. We have worked out a plan for technically re- equipping the Goskomstat system, including all its subdivisions, with modern computer technology and local network technology. This plan has the following main items: Goskomstat's central offices and Main Computer Centre - installation of a new local network type UNIX Ethernet 100 Base-T with specialised UNIX servers; - replacement of outdated work stations with modern computers and increase in numbers to provide each economist with one work station; - installation of a Connect server and provision of real-time access to local network resources for physically remote users via telephone lines (in particular, district and regional subdivisions of Goskomstat, as well as computer systems of the Republic's authorities and other interested organisations); - provision of access to INTERNET for network users; - re-equipping of duplication and publication subdivisions with modern equipment for duplicating and publishing printed material. Goskomstat regional and district subdivisions: - installation of a Windows NT local network with 10-15 work stations in the statistical offices of the Nakhichevan A.R. and Baku city; - provision of access, via telephone lines, to the central offices local network for regional and district ' subdivisions; - supply, to all district and regional statistical offices, of equipment for duplicating and publishing statistical information. Creation of Goskomstat central services for computer hardware and software systems: - extension of the computer technology technical service and repairs unit and creation, on its basis, of a computer technology service and maintenance unit for the Goskomstat system; - creation of a system software service for the Goskomstat information processing system and organisation of training for system software specialists. To solve the problem, a new concept must be used based on the application of modem software standards for automating the programming and processing of data. The old concept, as already mentioned, was based on the collective drafting of sets for electronic processing of statistical forms using programmers (over 900) from all the Republic's statistical offices within the Goskomstat USSR organisation. Considering that the number of statistical forms has remained practically unchanged, special programs for automation cannot be drafted using only our programmers (10 persons). 66 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go According to the new concept, all statistical work will have to be broken down into two categories. The first is for important statistical work with complex algorithms and large quantities of data which cannot be automated without special tailor-made programs. Programmers can be allocated the work of drafting these programs. The second category covers straightforward calculations with simple algorithms and small volumes of data. For this there is no need to draft special programs. They can be automated by the economists themselves with the help of ready-made data-processing software provided by various firms (Excel and Stata among others), without resorting to programmers' services. The implementation of this concept demands the consecutive introduction of the following measures: Extension of the programming division and allocation to it of the following functions: - investigation of 1st category statistical work, drafting of systems and technical tasks for programming; - drafting of special software and manuals needed for its application; - introduction and monitoring of special software at users' work stations; - study and introduction for users of standard software for computerising statistical reporting. Allocation of the following functions to economics divisions and central office, regional and district subdivision departments: - implementation of tailor-made software at work stations; - computerisation of 2nd category statistical work using standard applied software for statistics computerisation; - computerised collection and transfer of information. Organisation of training for the entire programming staff in the use of modern software and programming languages (Windows, Word, Excel, Foxpro and C, among others). Organisation of training for the entire staff of economists of the central and regional offices in computer operating systems (MS DOS, Windows), formatting systems (Word) and systems for computerising the processing of statistical returns (Excel, Stata, among others). Training of the entire staff of specialists of the central offices in working within the local network. The Goskomstat organisation is in physical terms a distributed system. Its subdivisions are located in all the country's administrative territorial units. This is why the implementation of the methods for distributing the processing of statistical information within the Goskomstat organisation is necessary and quite natural. We have adopted the following scheme for breaking down the processing of information within Goskomstat which we are endeavouring to implement: - collection of all statistical information within the Republic's frontiers is to be done by the district statistical offices; - collection of statistical information from statistical units located outside the Republic is to be centralised by Goskomstat of the Azerbaijani Republic; 67 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - the district statistical departments form aggregate statistical indicators for their own districts and present them to the district authorities and interested organisations; - the district statistical departments of the Statistical Committee of the Nakhichevan A.R. present it with all primary statistical data for their districts, as well as the required range of aggregate indicators. The other district statistical departments transfer the information to Goskomstat of the Azerbaijani Republic; - the district statistical departments of Baku forward all primary statistical data for their districts as well as the required range of aggregate indicators to the Baku Statistical Office: - the Statistical Committee of the Nakhichevan A.R. and the Baku Statistical Office form aggregate statistical indicators for their region and present them to the local authorities and interested organisations; - the Statistical Committee of the Nakhichevan A.R. and the Baku Statistical Office forward all primary statistical data and the required range of aggregate indicators to Goskomstat of the Azerbaijani Republic; - Goskomstat forms the aggregate statistical indicators for the Republic on the basis of the regional breakdown and presents them to the Republic's authorities and other interested organisations; - Goskomstat creates and updates a databank of statistical information for all sectors of statistics and organises access to it for interested users. The technology for distributed processing of data allows the statistical information needs of all the state authorities to be satisfied, from district to national level. It is dependent on all the needs being fulfilled with regard to computer equipment and modem electronic communications equipment for all structural subdivisions within the Goskomstat organisation. All these arguments in favour of the conversion of our statistics to international standards testify to the need for a fundamental transformation of the structure of the statistical services in Azerbaijan. In this regard we have plans for the amalgamation in the very near future of Goskomstat and the Main Computer Centre of Azerbaijan. With a view to the switchover from the branch-based to the functional approach to the keeping of statistics, the structure of the Goskomstat organisation will be as follows: Administration Management Accounts & auditing Personnel & training enterprises Coordi nation of statistical work Statistica information Nationa accounts & balances Demog raphic & social statistics Production & enterprise statistics Agri cultural statistics Trade & services statistics Price statistics Population censuses To all appearances, the structure presented here will change again more than once in the future since the reforms under way in the Republic constantly bring with them new modifications. We understand what complex tasks will have to be completed in the future. The following factors have a particularly negative effect on their progress: 68 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - insufficient equipping of the Republic's statistical services with modern computer technology; - increase in staff turnover when good specialists in the statistics sector feel obliged to move to the business sector because of low pay in the statistical services. In spite of all these difficulties, work continues on the adoption of international standards for our accounts and statistics in Azerbaijan. Much of our hope for the fulfilment of these tasks rests on the support of and co-operation with the international organisations and statistical offices of individual countries. Up to now, we have enjoyed co-operating with organisations such as the IMF, World, Bank, OECD, Eurostat, the Central Statistical Office of the Netherlands, the State Statistical Institute of Turkey and others. SPEAKER ELENA IVANOVA - STATE COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS The Organisation and Management of Statistical Activities in the Russian Federation I thank you for accepting the invitation from the Russian Federation and coming together here today in this beautiful hall. I have to ask for your forbearance for the fact that this hall was not suitable for setting up the local area networks in the corridors to present fragments of the information resources of Goskomstat of Russia, but I suggest that if anybody feels a real need to see how statistics are organised and produced in the St Petersburg State Statistical Committee our hosts have kindly agreed and Mr Bespalov will be pleased to take you through his domain. Now, allow me to begin my paper. What are Russian State statistics? We (I have in mind my colleagues from the CIS countries) split up from one another four years ago. Is that a long time or a short time? Russia is one of the few organisations that received everything on a \"last-one-to-be-served\" basis. Each of us remembers that we co-operated, and by \"we\" I have in mind Goskomstat of the USSR, with Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic countries. In our organisation Russia always came last. So it came about that when we became Goskomstat of the Russian Federation we practically had to begin many things afresh. The main function of Goskomstat Russia has remained practically unchanged, namely: the organisation of state statistical activities. What has changed are the conditions under which we have to work and the methods we use. The structure of the state statistical bodies as a whole has also remained as it was. We have the federal level (that is the central office of Goskomstat and the computer centre of Goskomstat), the regional statistical committees (their status has changed slightly, but essentially there are still 89 of them) and over 2 000 district offices. You can imagine the scale of the whole system. The number of state statistical staff falls every year. Like other executive bodies, we are undergoing administrative cutbacks and have to find way of solving our problems with fewer staff, but nevertheless such conditions stimulate us to take decisions on technology and also as regards the organisation of the work. 69 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Since last year the State Statistical Committee has been operating in accordance with the federal programme, which is approved by the government of the Russian Federation. In practice this was not the case. In fact we receive a long-term order from the State, which is paid for out of the federal budget. Apart from the federal programme the regional committees dealing with state statistics implement a regional order from the territorial executive bodies. The district statistical offices operate under the same regime. Mr Yurkov has told you that in 1996 Russia completed the state programme for transition to international standards, under which we basically solved the methodological problems, and last week the government of the Russian Federation approved the federal state programme for the development of state statistics up to the year 2000. In this programme a significant amount of attention has been paid to the technical and technological aspect. Yesterday I listened to the papers delivered by my colleagues, who pursued the idea that they devote considerable effort to ensuring the reliability of reported data and to taking administrative measures against careless managers out of line with state accounting. I envied them a little; and the envy was nostalgic. In Russia we do not spend any time on these things, not because we do not want to but because in principle they have lost their relevance. The concept of \"reliability\" is for us today a question of the quality of the methodology, the correctness of calculations. Administratively to exert influence on a private person or on the owner of a company is quite complicated, the more so as we do not have the law that I was talking about yesterday. That is why Russia found itself in the conditions in which it had to take quite decisive measures to develop the register of companies and to organise statistical observation on the basis of it. The administrative part of the register ceased to satisfy us; we worked on it intensively and the results are already apparent. Ms Prokunina is present amongst us; she is head of the business statistics department, which was recently set up within the structure of central office and which is trying to organise statistical observation once again using the register's population. Many of you know that the legal persons included in the databank of our register today number three million economic units. In 1996 we started to include in the register individual entrepreneurs, in other words, the number of statistical observation units is growing quite quickly. The problem of accounting , the problem of working with those with whom we are trying again today to organise relations grows more acute every day. In the territorial units, it should be said, we used to receive from each legal person a completed form. Today that does not happen. Up to 40% of report forms are returned to us empty, either because they did not reach the addressee or because the entrepreneur does not consider it necessary and possible to answer statistical questions. Hence Goskomstat methodologists devote more attention today to the problem of completing calculations or organising correct sampling. In this context, however much we talk about the problems occurring in particular with our hardware, in the technology of organising output and in electronic data processing, the most important thing for Russia today is a slimmed-down system of organising statistical activities. This is first and foremost the approach to the design of state report forms or sheets, and electronic forms made their appearance when we started using industrial methods to design a form on the screen. We then transmit this tool by telecommunications lines to the territorial units, to each district (for this we use quite powerful government channels). It also means the design of continuous systems for data processing and the updating of dynamic series using personal computers. Finally there is a database for recording units, with which we are also busy at the present time. There is another problem that was not discussed in the paper. In Russia statistical information is seen more and more frequently as a commodity. It is not only the government administrative bodies that are interested in this information (for some reason we have been worrying about these for the last two 70 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go days). There is interest in this information from the private sector, trade associations and banks. In the absence of a regulatory basis statistics are in an extremely difficult situation because banks want primary information on companies; so do a varied group of associations and public organisations, and each time we have to decide whether to give them the information or not. If we give it, we have to decide what guarantees to ask for. However, as it is our aim to achieve full co-operation on information, inter alia with the banking sector, we are naturally working out procedures which suit all parties. We are gradually adopting continuous systems in data processing. The aim is for completed forms to be received by electronic mail at district level, to have large-scale data processing at district level and to transmit either files of primary documents or summary data through communication channels to regional or republic level (i.e. in practice regional level) and to generate the corresponding tables there in anonymous form, which are then transmitted to federal level. When I refer to the department headed by Ms Prokunina I am talking about a department with a multitude of tasks. It is responsible for the planning of statistical activities, the organisation of the production of statistics and the updating of business statistics; it also has the register of companies and perhaps even classifications etc. Our territorial units have been affected to a minor degree by changes in the organisation of business statistics. The structure has not changed much. The internal units have the same breakdown as before, either by branch or by statistical sector. Goskomstat does not exert any particular pressure on the territorial structure in this respect. We produce models, and each local head examines how he can best adapt them to his own conditions. Further, I would like to say a few words about hardware and software. In actual fact, new requirements dictate new conditions for organising the system's hardware. It would be simpler to replace all the equipment we have and switch fully to software under licence such as WINDOWS NT, but at the moment, given the scale of Russian conditions, we can only do it for some territorial units, giving approval in principle to new technological approaches and solutions. In Russia we picked out fifty of these territorial units in which we intend essentially to stop data processing on large computers. Perhaps at the present time this is not quite justified (after all the volumes we have to deal with set their own requirements), but we are going ahead nevertheless. We are consciously switching to the development of local computer networks, to stronger configurations and to the use of software under licence not only for operation but also for design. We are discussing with Eurostat the desirability of our having SPSS packages, trying out BLAISE and looking at other commercial packages. Yesterday I could not have asked such a question but today we are asking it because technically and organisationally we have reached that stage. Certainly there are difficulties associated with the telecommunications system. A continuous system implies the availability of distributed databases and very fast data transmission not simply by the bottom-up method, but with feedback. You know how big Russia is and how difficult it is to reach remote regions, and that goes also for communication channels. In some cases we are still using telephone lines, in others we are still using modems, but at the present time in conjunction with the Federal Agency for Government communications we are developing a system which will allow us to transfer quite a large volume of data top-down and bottom-up in very short transmission periods. I am talking about our \"ATLAS\" system, which to a certain extent resolves the problem of the confidentiality of transmitted primary information because there is a matching data protection system. Another problem that we are encountering today is the work of our staff in the context of new technology. Not every statistician has mastered the EXCEL, WORD and other packages that we have at our disposal. We now have to accustom our teaching centres and territorial statistical committees to 71 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go the idea that there is a need for retraining literally every member of Goskomstat's staff so that they know what it is like to work just with a protocol from the large computers or his own fully adequate workplace in the local area network. Here, of course, questions of data protection crop up, and not only at the level we were speaking of yesterday, but also at purely technological level, namely questions regarding what to protect and where to store the information. Either we generate the resource on the server, and then it becomes simpler, or we generate the resource on each workstation, and in that case we would have to know what capital expenditure we can save to install boards for data protection at each workplace. An important aspect is how to get our users accustomed to working with anti-virus programs so that they know that without pre-testing the computer should not be switched on. So there is a mass of different technological elements which are still absent from our present practices today, but will be mandatory tomorrow. We have to resolve the problem of equipping the district units with hardware and software. There are 2 300 district statistical units. Almost half of Goskomstat of the Russian Federation staff have to go to the districts, where there are not enough offices and where statistical information in the form of reports may simply be left lying about on desks (we brought up the same point yesterday). It is something like a multi-purpose workstation, which will have as a minimum five to ten occupants (which is inconceivable). Today the ratio is approximately 1:5. sometimes 1:7. i.e. one personal computer in a district for 5 to 7 workers. Unfortunately, in view of the difficult financial situation in our network, we cannot say that in 1996 this problem will be resolved. We hope, however, that by the year 2000, when we plan to realise fully the principles of continuous systems in data processing, the technical level of our network will be substantially higher. Two months ago Goskomstat of the Russian Federation signed an internal convention, I would say a Russian one, in which it promised not to make use in its practical activities of unlicensed software. We gave our word, but keeping it is quite difficult. In the end we understood that avoiding the use of licensed software products would not work out cheaper but more expensive than the straight forward purchase of equipment. And here we must overcome ourselves and the appropriate framework and perhaps even come to an agreement on joint action with international organisations, for example within the framework of the Tacis programme for assistance to the Russian Federation in obtaining licences for the right to pass on licensed software packages or acquiring these packages ourselves because we must account for our actions and feel a reasonably stable part of the world community, since we would not wish to expose ourselves to any criticism in this connection. I should like to say a few words about the international co-operation that we are implementing at the present time. We noted that here in the hall a stand was set up which characterises our relations with the Swedish Central Statistical Office. I should like to tell you that we are living life to the full under the Tacis programme and that we are carrying out some fifteen projects in different sectors. But I would like also to address myself to our dear colleagues from the CIS countries. My friends, I have been listening to your papers, I count myself one of you, but I have the impression that each of us is stewing in his or her own juice. Each of us is going his or her own way and Goskomstat Russia knows what it is to be the owner of resources, to speak the same language as the information systems and the owners of other information resources, and how important the principle of integration is. It does not matter in the least who adopts what technical platform, who is going to have a new network and whose system is going to have another configuration, but we must talk to you about a single methodology, about some integration procedure for the identification of economic units since we are developing intergovernmental economic links. We are encountering massive problems as regards information, and I would suggest that the first basic step by way of integration will be taken by us together with Belarus because we have drawn up a common programme of work, which implies co operation in the field of information, involving both equipment and methodology, the exchange of information and publications and the dissemination of information. I call upon all those who are interested in putting similar procedures in place to pay close attention to the development of our co operation and we will share our experience with you. But the most important thing in my view is not 72 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go to be too late, and here you have a sensible beginning to integration within the framework of CIS governments which we should recognise today. I believe that the road we are following today will be followed by no-one else. Basically no recommendations or models which we would like to apply to ourselves will suit us all. I am glad that it is we and nobody else that have to take this difficult road. DISCUSSANT RONALD LUTTIKHUIZEN - STATISTICS NETHERLANDS In this session two papers were presented. And both papers are very interesting since they give us information about developments inside the organisations which are extremely complex. Moreover it should be mentioned that it is very hard to fully comprehend the nature and the magnitude of the problems that the statistical offices of the NIS are facing. To speak about and write about a reorganisation process is one thing, to experience it is a completely different one. The paper of Goskomstat (RF) gives most of all a description of their views of the re-organisation process. And it shows that our colleagues have a very good and adequate understanding of their situation and the difficulties that are ahead. The paper of the Azerbaijani Statistical Office is focusing on describing the present situation, the tasks to be done and focuses also on the description of the main dimensions of their internal reorganisation process. It also makes clear that the colleagues in Baku have very clearly recognised that their main problems are linked to the automation policy of their office and their human resources policy. A first conclusion is that both organisations in principle face the same problems but that they are on a completely different level. Goskomstat of the Russian Federation is Europe\"s largest statistical organisation. It has the advantage of having easier access to highly qualified staff. But on the other hand the organisational problems in the medium and longer term, in all aspects, are enormous. Goskomstat of Azerbaijan is significantly smaller, meaning that they have also relatively less resources to face their problems. Many of the western statistical offices are also in the process of reorganisation. Although I think that the problems of the western offices can not be compared with the nature of the problems of our colleagues of the Former Soviet Union. (In both papers you find interesting remarks about the history.) But the aspects they deal with are the same. I want to mention a view. From both papers it is clear that the following three topics have a high priority: 1. Automation; 2. Organisation of the production process of making statistics; 3. Human resources management. And we could add the institutional organisation, but I do not want to go into that here. Let me comment on them from our perspective. 73 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go 1. Automation. Both countries are in the process of renewal of the hardware and software. I cannot comment on the details. But I can inform you on our views on these aspects. a) First of all it should be taken into account that the prices for hardware are constantly diminishing. This means that on the (western) markets every year more automation functions can be bought for less money. Automation Expenditure CBS (sheet) in 1987 in Dutch guilders 25 Million 750 screens (terminals/mainframe) in 1990 20 M. 2300 screens (micro) in 1996 10 M. 3600 PC's and laptops Per staff member 1,5 PC. (1 US $ is 1.75 guilders, in August 1996) The increase in processing power is dazzling and storage capacity has grown accordingly. The on-line tape archive now gives access to a storage space for 7000 Gigabytes in each CBS-side. The conclusion is that we have achieved an enormous reduction in costs of automation and an enormous growth in the processing power. Meaning that the unit processing costs have fallen enormously. b) These achievements have been caused by the consequent installation of consistent automation policies. The automation policy was formulated for the whole organisation by one unit: the automation department. They focussed on the following: - Standardisation. All staff work with the same hardware and software. This has enormous advantages in the maintenance, the knowledge, the training and the moving of staff to different work-positions. You realise standardisation between different departments. Since all departments use the same software for carrying out their surveys, exchange of information between departments is easier and less error prone. - Decentralisation of work with the help of standardised software. Most of the work, including almost all of the programming, can be done by the subject-matter departments. Especially when use is made of integrated software, like the Blaise tool developed by the CBS. These tools enforce consistency in the various steps of statistical production and data processing. This makes all statistical production processes easier to manage and to control. The design and the maintenance of the complex information systems are to be carried out by the computer specialist of the information system unit. - Design of surveys. All interactive work (including data entry and data editing) is carried out on micro computers while most batch oriented work and interactive use of large databases is concentrated on batch and database servers. The client server architecture takes care of transparent switching between personal and server platforms. - Training of staff in automation. The CBS has a very high developed automation/information environment. In such an environment, training and support is vital, as is co-ordination. In other words we promote decentralised use in a 74 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go centralised environment, in order to increase the efficiency of statistical production and the people's motivation and to decrease the total time to produce the final results. The CBS has therefore for automation its own training programmes. The people, the human resources, are the most important production factors in the organisation. - The growing impact of electronic data interchange. In the latest developments in automation the emphasis is on the automated data capture from enterprises. In my view these developments can also be of key importance for your countries. Because you have many large enterprises that could do this. But also you already have considerable experience in related fields. Since the on-line exchange of data is already well developed in most of your countries. These recent developments also have a great impact on the future dissemination policies. 2. Organisation and design of the statistical production processes. We consider the making of statistics primarily as a production process. Like most other production processes these need to be organised. Therefore we try to organise it in such a way that most statistics run through the same cycles. For instance for the structural enterprise statistics we use for all enterprises to a high degree the same questionnaires. With additional questions for the branch specific aspects. And also the central methodology departments help the production units to make use of the centrally available knowledge. We try to avoid having units all looking for their own solutions. And thus avoiding all kinds of different errors. 3. Human resources: training. Again in the field of training we organise things centrally. This was already explained for the automation, but we also provide training in some subject matter areas. Like in the use of different methods (sampling etc.) as in the internal dissemination of subject matter knowledge. How can all this relate to your situation. I think that a comparison of experiences between yours and western countries can lead to some recommendations: 1. For key areas of the reorganisation process: automation, statistical production and training, special policy units should be installed; 2. Investigations should be made about the 'best practices' concerning automation policies and the statistical production process; 3. Automation plans must be developed and implemented in view of the medium and long term; 4. Regarding the design of the production process uniformity and standardisation is of importance; 5. Also for the training-policies it is important to create a unit that has two functions: to co-ordinate the training inside the organisation and to organise the absorption and dissemination of all training and assistance received from donor organisations. It is clear to me from reading the papers that both organisations think in principle along the lines ljust mentioned. (And especially Goskomstat of the Russian Federation is well under way in improving the service to the users of statistics with a well developed dissemination policy. It seems to me that these developments can be examples for all countries present.) Finally I want to mention that I have a paper with me in English that gives a full description of the automation policy of the CBS. Perhaps that in the future projects can be designed that can make you familiar in detail with the best practices of automation policies of western countries. And once you know these policies you can stop lagging behind and move into an advanced position. 75 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go * * * DISCUSSANT JEAN-LOUIS BODIN - INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA STATISTIQUE ET DE ETUDES ECONOMIQUES, FRANCE Like Ronald Luttikhuizen, I would like to thank the authors of the two good papers which have just been presented, Mr Veliev, President of Goskomstat of Azerbaijan, and Ms Ivanova, on behalf of Goskomstat of the Russian Federation. Let me make two preliminary comments: 1. First, let me remind you that Eurostat organised in Luxembourg in 1992 a seminar which dealt precisely with these matters of organisation and management of the statistical offices in transition countries. On that occasion, I was asked to present the organisation of the French statistical system. Some other countries of the European Community, Germany for instance, did the same during that seminar. I remember I started my presentation by saying that I was certainly not presenting the organisation of the French statistical system as a model, but just as an example, since, exactly as I said yesterday afternoon there is no model of good statistical laws, there is no model of good statistical organisation. The most important questions concerning the organisational problems are well known and have been discussed several times in the past, for instance under the auspices of the Conference of the European Statisticians: centralisation or decentralisation degree of geographical d\u00e9concentration degree of centralisation of computer activities place of the unit in charge of the co-ordination etc. It is certainly up to each country to give its own answers to those questions, taking into account its overall administrative organisation, its history, its culture, its traditions, etc. 2. My second preliminary comment will be shorter. It is more or less a consequence of the first one. From time to time, it is necessary to review the statistical organisation and, if necessary, to change it or to change the chart of the statistical offices, since the phenomenon of transition is not restricted to the transition in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Former Soviet Union observed since 1990 and which is characterised by a very rapid move from a centrally-planned economy to a market-oriented democracy. All the countries are, in some way, in transition: for instance, my own country is also in transition because of the rapid reduction in the size of the public sector in the French economy, because of the impact of the European treaties, the very next introduction in 1999 of the Single Currency, and because of the globalisation of the economy and of the markets. Because of these phenomena, maybe we will have to change in the near future the organisation of the INSEE - the French National Statistical Office - as we did seven years ago. Of course, the transition in your countries is a more complex process and raises more problems than the ones I have just described in France. Why did I made those preliminary comments? In fact, I was struck by the great similarity of the two organisations proposed by the two Goskomstats of Azerbaijan and Russia. Of course, those two countries are both ex-Soviet Union. But they are now in very different situations: as Ronald Luttikhuizen noted, the Russian Federation is one of the biggest countries in the world, the first one by its area, the fourth of fifth one according to its population. It is a federal country and Goskomstat of Russia can count upon the scientific and technical competence of the former Goskomstat of the 76 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Soviet Union. On the other hand, Azerbaijan is a very small country - 7,5 million inhabitants, that is to say the size of Sweden - and its statistical office was absolutely not used to being responsible for its own organisation and its own programmes before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Of course, as I said a few minutes ago, the statistical organisation of the newly created countries of the CIS must take into account the process of transition. The main characteristics of this process has been recalled yesterday morning by the keynote addresses; they are also described in a very comprehensive way in the Russian paper which has just been presented by Ms Ivanova. It is not necessary to come back on these issues. One particular point deserves to be noted: the transition process was extremely rapid in your countries, compared to the similar process in some .other countries in transition from a central-planned economy to a market-oriented one like China and Vietnam. The transition in those two countries started before yours, around 1984-1985, but the process was certainly less rapid. The main points which can have some influence on the organisational problems are the very rapid increase in the number of economic units and decision-makers, the rapid increase in the unregistered economy, the emergence of new tools like sample surveys, and a rapid increase in the users' needs, which implies an in-depth transformation of the ways to disseminate statistical data. All the departments and units of a statistical office have more or less to introduce changes within this context. The Azeri and Russian papers give us very useful indications as regards these changes. I would like to comment on four domains which are dealt with in both the papers: Training: along with the task of training newly recruited statisticians, there is a big need to retrain all staff members; this retraining should include courses on the mechanisms of the market economies and on the role of the different players in such economies; for instance, INSEE and the University of Strathclyde at Glasgow organised together three years ago a four-week course for Albanian statisticians on the main basic concepts in a market-oriented economy. The retraining is certainly a big effort and deserves to be managed by a special unit under the direct authority of the President himself or of one of his deputies. Electronic Data Processing (EDP): I will not go into detail on this domain which was dealt with in detail by Ronald Luttikhuizen; as he noted, the organisation of the statistical offices must take into account this new fact that every statistician to-day should be able to use directly statistical software and data bank management systems without any substantial help from a specialised Computer Centre. The problem to be solved here is a problem of training and equipment. Another point: a clear distinction has to be made between the preparation of new projects, which has to be dealt with by people able to think in terms of integration - from the collection of the individual data to the dissemination of the aggregated data -, and the maintenance of the old chains. Dissemination: dissemination is certainly a new challenge for transition countries statisticians. Such a challenge deserves to be faced by a special unit with real specialists, or, at least, people able to become rapidly good specialists of dissemination problems: dissemination is a real job! the dissemination of statistical data is a very complex system, covering not only publications, but also customised services, design of statistical data banks oriented towards their use by a very large external public, relations with the press and the media, and the analysis of users' needs. In all industrialised countries, the task of dissemination is the responsibility of the chairman himself or of one of his deputies. I have not seen in the two papers any proposal to create specialised units in data dissemination in that direction. Planning and programmes which are to be the results of a trade-off between budgetary constraints and the maximisation of the users' needs. 77 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Another point is also missing in those two papers: the creation of a real co-ordination unit, in charge of the whole statistical system of the whole country. I also mentioned that problem yesterday afternoon during my invited discussion in session I (\"Legislation on statistics\"). Such a unit must also have the duty to deal with the management of business registers, or with the management of standards and classifications, which are very important tools for ensuring real co-ordination. My last comment will be devoted to a point I consider to be one of the most important in transition countries: this problem is that of the regional organisation of the official statistical system. We have heard, during the presentation of the two papers, that the Russian Federation Central Committee has nearly 2 500 different territorial units, and they have statistical bureaus within each of those. 2 500 district statistical offices is really very numerous. This figure is 115 times the number of territorial statistical units we have in France. Even in correcting in order to take into account the respective population of the two countries, the figure is going in the same way since the number of statistical territorial units by inhabitant is 35 times higher in France than in Russia. Azerbaijan has something like 100 statistical territorial units; at the same time, the Netherlands, the size of which is one and a half times that of Azerbaijan, can operate without any territorial unit. I know that, at the time of the centrally-planned economy, such a decentralised system was absolutely necessary. But times have changed! Nowadays, such a geographical structure seems not very well adapted to the next situation. It is very costly, it is difficult to get well trained staff in such small units and such small staffs are not veiy well prepared to serve the needs of the regional and local authorities and of the regional and local decision-makers. I can also of course understand that it is very difficult to reduce too quickly the number of statistical territorial units, because of employment problems for instance. But I am very surprised that the former regional and local organisation has been considered by those two papers as a fact which is impossible to change and as a point which has not to be discussed. COMMENTS, REPLIES AND A UDIENCE DISCUSSION REPLY ARIF VELIEV - CHAIRMAN. STATE STATISTICAL COMMITTEE, AZERBAIJAN I would like to thank Mr Luttikhuizen and Mr Bodin for their most valuable recommendations which We will take into account in our future work. This especially concerns the recommendations on computerisation. As far as some of Mr Bodin*s reconunendations regarding regional offices are concerned, in my view, and I believe my colleagues from other CIS countries will back me up on this, now is not the time to think about closing down or drastically reducing the regional statistical bodies, and it would not be useful to do so at the moment. Sometime in the next ten or fifteen years we will inevitably arrive at that point, but for the moment, it is not possible to fold up these bodies because our users and the clients who allocate funds to us ask us for data with a regional breakdown. As regards the dissemination of data, we already have such a division. It deals with matters relating to the dissemination of data to public organisations and other users. REPLY ELENA IVANOVA - STATE COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS First of all I would like to refer to the third question mentioned by Mr Bodin, which precisely concerned the activity of regional bodies. 78 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In Russia we cannot abolish the regional structure. Each region is a subject, or entity, of the Russian Federation. I cannot imagine how Moscow can assume the functions of the St Petersburg State Statistical Committee or any other regional committee, of which there are 89 in Russia. In this connection there is also the question of the raion or district level, which is the local level of our statistical system. If we had a well developed telecommunications system, we could contemplate restructuring the activity of this local level. But the telecommunications system is not sufficiently well developed in our country and so we cannot now talk about a new structure for our statistical bodies at the district level, although in a few districts this could be done and we at Goskomstat are currently thinking about it. One further problem I would like to talk about has to do with data dissemination. Goskomstat attaches great importance to this matter, which is shown by the fact that a marketing service has been set up at the Goskomstat Computer Centre. In the central offices, the aggregated information administration in our new structure deals with this problem and we are getting our regional bodies to create similar types of subdivisions because we understand all too well that statistical information today is required not just by government bodies and the civil service but also by private business and the public at large. Finally, as regards computerisation, Goskomstat has formed a centre for computerisation which has been given all the powers it need regarding computerisation policy. The task of Goskomstat's senior management is to help this centre to do its work properly. COMMENTS MIKHAIL YUZBASHEV - HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS, ST. PETERSBURG AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY From the reports we have listened to it is patently clear that in the Tacis countries in the near future, and possibly for a longer time to come, state statistics will remain the main source of statistical information for both the state bodies as well as the public at large and commercial organisations. In this connection I believe that the level we have achieved in computerisation and software in the state statistical bodies is not put to sufficient use in our country, and I believe in the other Tacis countries as well. The overwhelming majority of items to be published and presented have an inadequate level of aggregation and analysis for the current-day situation; they are presented mainly in the form of average values, primary breakdown series and dynamic series without being analytically aggregated and processed. Nevertheless, the methods and programs of mathematical statistics which are already well mastered at the existing computerisation level, allow us to obtain information in a more compact, analytical form which is suitable for drawing more thorough conclusions. As an example, one could cite the study of the breakdown of a population by per capita income level. We have an average per capita income, and at best, the gap between the income of the richest 10% and the poorest 10%. This is all that is published. However, the average quarterly deviation and coefficient of variation should have been published and the indicators should have been presented in the form of a Lorenz diagram and Lorenz's coefficient of unevenness, then these indicators' trends should have been followed quarter by quarter and year by year and conclusions drawn on whether there is also a trend towards too abrupt an increase in property stratification, which could lead society to a danger zone. Another example is the processing of dynamic series for crop capacity. The trends, tendencies and fluctuations should be studied and districts and significant economic territories of the Russian 79 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Federation should be presented according to their similarity in harvest fluctuations or, vice versa, according to their synchronised fluctuations, since this would help to achieve a correct distribution of the areas sown with crops and avoid sharp fluctuations in the average harvest yield throughout the country and mitigate fluctuations in general. But there are no such presentations and the correlation between harvest fluctuations in the different regions is not studied. There are scientific elaborations but this for some reason is not part of Goskomstat's work or that of its bodies. Many such examples can be cited. There are two habitual objections against the broad application of mathematical statistical methods, but 1 shall try to show you very briefly that both objections are untenable. The first objection is from theoreticians, according to whom the phenomena of economic and social life have no strict normal breakdown and do not meet the pure requirements of mathematics. But then we can easily imagine that we should generally do without any mathematical formulae since in nature there are no exactly straight lines or exact spheres, or any other exact mathematically abstract figures or other aggregates. Even the railway line from St Petersburg to Moscow, which according to legend Czar Nicholas I drew on the map using a ruler and in so doing he hit the end of his fingernail with the pencil, with the result that the builders had to follow the same curve with the line of the railway. This may be a legend but in actual fact, anyone travelling on this length of track knows that it is not straight in strictly mathematical terms. Similarly, any shaft produced at a factory has tolerances. There has also been much talk at this seminar about the transition from full-scale observation to sample surveys. However, if we present the results of sample surveys, and this is already being done, we have to present not only the average sample estimate but also indicate the standard error of this estimate, or the probable error, indicating a sufficiently high probability in which this indicator is located. This has not yet been done in the publications and presentations of Goskomstat. My conclusion is that the character of socio-economic changes allows us to apply mathematical statistical methods to them, naturally with the required reservations about the approximateness of the probability' estimates obtained. But this is not a reason. The second reason given by practicing statisticians is that the user will not understand coefficients of determination, coefficients of variation, the levelling of trends and regression lines. In the paper given by Mr Korolev, we have already heard that we should teach our information users how to understand things of this sort. For over thirty years I have given students courses in mathematical statistics and I must assure you that about half the students managed to learn with some success. These are not over- learned, terribly difficult items which a specialist is incapable of understanding. At the same time we elect oui' presidents, mayors, governors and others from this better half of the people, who are able to understand the indicators concerned and use them in their work. The phenomena of socio-mathematical life, whether we like it or not. are subject to natural laws which are statistical in form. We live in a probability world and there is no escaping it. Therefore in Goskomstat's work, this inalterable, naturally-induced fact needs to be taken into account. This is how the world was created and we must live with this whether we like it or not. COMMENTS EDVARD OUTRVTA - PRESIDENT. CENTRAL STATISTICAL OFFICE. CZECH REPUBLIC I am glad that we have already had one round on the reduction of regional offices because that is a concern of ours in the Czech Republic. 80 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go I think it is important to realise that we have inherited from the Communist regime a completely impossible structure of regional offices in most of our countries. There may be a few exceptions, but whichever way you look at it, we are in a very special situation with regional offices. I think that is also important to realise when hearing about the Dutch system because that is being implemented of course in the environment of no regional offices. We have problems of a different dimension. Now, clearly the most efficient way, and if I was starting in a new country without any tradition, I would never think of building any regional office. However we have inherited those offices and I completely agree with both of the presenters of the papers that it will take some time to quite get rid ofthat structure. And I want to stress that it is a most important issue and I will tell you why, apart from the obvious, it is so. The basic underlying problem, even deeper than this one. is that we do not have qualified staff. We have rather large offices. At one of the meetings of CIS STAT with the participation of Poland, Hungary. Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic we discussed our organisational problems and we established what we call the \"\"Cromezish coefficient\" after the place where we met. More or less, most countries are not too far from a coefficient of about one to five thousand statisticians to population. I am not sure that is true, it is very experimental, but here if you calculate your result you will be far above that. I assure you. And in any case if these people are distributed into the regions it is impossible to maintain the type of qualification which is absolutely necessary to do statistics. And my immediate task is exactly that I have to find a way having inherited this enormous nonsense. I have to find a way of exchanging somehow the lovely old ladies, who know the old ladies in the accounting offices and get data from them, into specialists who have studied statistics and can work on my methodology. I described it in one of my articles as the following: \"Enormous body and a tiny little head\". All of our organisations were inherited in that form. We have an enormous organisation that of course has to continue and produce data and so we are very slow in introducing sample surveys, we are very slow in changing our methodologies because on the one hand we have nobody to invent them (we have got a minimum amount of people, compared to western countries, working on those issues in our centres), but on the other hand we have got masses of people who will do all the old work and go on like that. That is why it is so hard to make changes. So, in our country we have selected it as one of the most important points in our internal organisation. When we are introducing a change we have three aspects to it and the organisational one is basically exactly this. However, as I must agree, and against everything that I feel, it is impossible to abolish it. I have abolished the special status in the law of these offices by having Parliament pass the law which did that. I still cannot get rid of the groups in the regional centres. However, what one can do, is distribute work which is central in its principle. For example, one of my regional offices can at least concentrate and specialise in industrial statistics, the other one- in something else. And we have found a way of splitting our work in a manner that allows regional offices to do central work. We hope we will get somewhere. The regions fortunately in our small country only total eight. There is another level where most of the people are still actually working at this moment. We will eventually abolish little offices in every district centre at the bottom level even though I have to go slowly. Now, this comes in several aspects. I have already spoken about the fundamental one and that it is impossible to raise the qualification of the office unless you either grow inconceivably (and your ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go governments will not allow that), or alternatively you get rid of the idea that a statistician is an old lady who knows old ladies in the accounting offices of the companies who are assisting her. We just have to get away from it. That is one aspect. Another one is the computing. We have not linked our district offices to the system at all. What will remain there will use central communication lines, not the basic system, because we cannot afford it. We do not have money to do such a thing. We concentrated on automating the centre and only the basic aid at the regional offices: no more. All of this is going to take a while but it is, I think, fundamental to state that this is so. One more point. It is not true that a federation cannot have a central office. I worked for twenty four and a half years at Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada is completely centralised, covers a continent also, has six regional offices that do the very basic collection work and does not have anything else decentralised. It is of course a matter of arrangement and not everything can be done, but let us not believe that it is impossible. If political needs force us towards an inefficient way of organising statistics, I think it is important that the politicians know they are doing that. Then of course it is their decision. Maybe it is worth a political goal to keep that inefficiency and I can see that in the particular instance. That may be so. but let us not kid ourselves, So. it is possible to do it that way. However it is also true that those countries which started out from a decentralised structure have extreme problems in doing so. Germany, I think, does not even raise the issue. Australia is doing and has done tremendous work along these lines for over a century. Other countries have, more or less, gone different ways. We tried to do a little bit by the Australian example, and follow the French a bit who have tried something similar to what we are doing. I hope I shall be able to tell you in five or ten years that we have got absolutely rid of our district offices. We will not get rid of the next level. COMMENTS YVES FRANCHET - DIRECTOR GENERAL, EUROSTAT I would like to make some comments on one of the points raised by Ms. Ivanova about the plea for a common computer architecture of the CIS countries. Basically I would like to qualify that and maybe I shall ask her a question on that. I think what is needed is not a common architecUrre because now most of us and maybe all of us work with open systems and open systems are able to work between one architecture and another provided we have common messages and basic standards. Now that I have heard Ms. Ivanova's plea I think it is a very good plea. I think it is very essential that at the beginning of the definition of your new computer architecture you agree that you have basic EDI messages together and this will enable you to exchange the information easily through your computer structures. It is an essential field. We have had the same kind of problems in the European Union. We have fifteen different computer architectures. They are very different. But they are all open architectures and they can communicate provided we create the same messages. Now we are creating the same messages. They are called GUESS MES, they are called EDI BOT and they are available. 82 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go So, maybe what we could do is to have a little task force in this field on common language for different architectures of computer facilities and see whether what we have in the European Union could be used in your countries as the basis for data communication. This is very complex but it has to be defined very early in the process because it is a basis on which you work. Now if we agree on something like that and develop common messages jointly, that would perhaps be worthwhile because we will have the strength of European countries working together. COMMENTS MALCOLM WALMSLEY - OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION, UNITED KINGDOM I found the papers this morning very interesting and I would like to compliment the speakers on their papers. Ijust want to pick up one point on the issue of training. The national statistics offices are involved in an enormous change process which needs managing and has to be implemented exceptionally quickly. Training is not just important, it seems to me to be the absolute key to undertaking this change process. The paper by the Russian Federation picked up on the point particularly in relation to the implementation of training for information technology and the complete retraining needs of its staff. This particular topic is about organisational structure and perhaps it would be of interest for me to know how many of the national statistics offices' organisational structures feature the training unit specifically, because I think this is an area where the organisations have been inherited from old structures and perhaps have not yet been changed to meet the new needs that we perceive during the process that we are undergoing now. Certainly from the donor perspective I find that the co-ordination of training activities is very important and I think this is an area where perhaps there has been a lack of co-ordination and in which more improved systems within the national statistics offices for setting up training units and providing a much more structured training plan would be very valuable. This would ensure that training is implemented over the next few years in an efficient way, meets the needs of all the staff in statistics offices and enables sustainable development in methods and practices to be maintained. COMMENTS RONALD LUTTIKHUIZEN - STATISTICS NETHERLANDS I would like to react on remarks have been made by Mr Franchet and Mr Outrata because both remarks I think are also linked to the special situation of the Russian Federation and deserve a little bit more attention. Mr Outrata very rightly says that one of the bottlenecks at the present transition period is that intellectual staff available in the office is, let us put it mildly, understaffed. The office does not have enough people with enough basic skills to do all the things that should be done. And that is an extra pressure on the whole organisation which makes the whole process even more difficult. Now, a very kind proposal of Mr Franchet was to organise a task force on the exchange of data or the transmission of data between different institutions, and indeed this can be very important, but with the current shortage of staff, there is always a balance to be struck between putting staff into internal organisation related to the data collection process and the exchange of information between different institutions. 83 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go REPLY ELENA IVANOVA - STATE COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS I would like to thank you for your proposal, Mr Franchet. I am examining it not just from the angle of organisation of information exchange but also from the opposite angle - the organisation of data resources. In order to organise the exchange of information successfully, information resources have to be planned accordingly. This is why the problem becomes a complex one and I presume that by the end of the seminar we will have had time to make specific proposals on a list of participants for a working party and to discuss a few organisational matters with our colleagues participating in the Tacis Programme. The second question which was asked here dealt with the problem of training. I was delighted with what Mr Outrata had to say because he explained to us in clear and graphic terms what sort of staff we are dealing with nowadays. Indeed, we admire the older generation of people working in our system and using their very rich experience, but we are forced to acknowledge that in general it is difficult for them to adapt to the new environment. Young people learn everything so much faster. At Goskomstat Russia, the staff training programme, for the moment at least, has a centralised structure. Our personnel department has a special sector which deals with the elaboration of training programmes. It arranges with the Ministry of Education for statisticians who have no formalised education to obtain diplomas from Russia's institutes of higher education. This sector works out training programmes for specialists who are already working and have corresponding diplomas from institutes of higher education. What is more, we work on a centralised basis with Goskomstat's training centres. An example of this is the St Petersburg training centre. We have agreed that the staff of the St Petersburg Statistical Committee central offices should receive training in the St Petersburg training centre and learn how to use new software and hardware at their own workplaces or that special groups should be formed to attend the training centre and receive a specific course of training. Yesterday I had an interesting conversation with the head of the training centre. Mr Klyuyev. He made a very interesting proposal for the organisation of a mobile training class. What he has in mind is for the teachers of the training centre to be able to go out to the districts and provide training for local section specialists there. Yesterday. I took an interest in this idea of our Swedish colleagues. We shall try to help the St Petersburg training centre and I believe that within the Tacis Programme a little more attention could also be given to this line of action. 84 ",

        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go MODERATOR YVES FRANCHET - DIRECTOR GENERAL, EUROSTAT The topic of this session is \"Co-ordination and relations among national administrations\". So, it is something for which there is no optimal situation but it is worth looking at it to see the kinds of problems you are going to meet when you are in a transition phase and how you solve them. * * * SPEAKER EDUARD AGADJANOV - MINISTER, DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS, STATE REGISTER AND ANALYSIS, OF ARMENIA Our policy on statistics is currently aimed mainly at doing away with the special features and distortions introduced into statistics by the system of State control. For many decades the statistical system, in terms of both methodology and content, followed the plan and was geared to monitoring the fulfilment of the tasks set by the plan and generally to obtaining quantitative characteristics. Our statistics became somewhat removed from world-wide statistical practice, international standards, indicators and the methods used to calculate them. The statistical system of the Republic of Armenia is represented by the Ministry of Statistics, the State Register and Analysis and the urban and regional statistical divisions. Approximately 800 people work in the statistical system of the Republic of Armenia, and all the country's statistical bodies are financed by the Republic's budget. The Statistical Office bears full responsibility for the general management of statistics at all levels of the economy and serves as the sole organised system for collecting, processing and analysing statistical information, providing the government with the statistics it requires, meeting the requirements of scientific research bodies, ministries and government departments, and systematically informing the population via statistical publications. The Statistical Office is entitled to draw up and approve the statistical work programme, the accounts (set of indicators) of enterprises and organisations, and the methodological instructions for filling them in. The users of statistical data are actively involved in drawing up the report forms and the system of statistical indicators. The Statistical Office has a Scientific and Methodological Council, an analytical service which twice a month submits to the Armenian Government analytical material concerning the state of external economic relations, the labour market, migration and emigration, population flows, inflation and other vital matters, and operates as a collegiate body in which decisions are taken (by the collegiate Council) on almost all global matters. The ministries and government departments of the Republic collect information only after the set of statistical indicators has been approved by the Ministry of Statistics, the State Register and Analysis. This approach makes it possible to obtain not only statistical data on the topics covered by the observation and surveys carried out by the statistical bodies but also data collected by the ministries and government departments of the Republic. The Statistical Office decides autonomously on matters concerning the structure and staffing of the statistical bodies within the limits of the expenditure amount earmarked in the State budget. The functions and tasks of the urban, regional and communal statistical bodies is determined by the Statistical Office. Local statistical bodies submit information to the territorial government bodies on the basis of a uniform statistical accounting system in order to assist them in decision-making. 87 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go What was our starting point? In the last decade the basic task of the Statistical Office was to measure the fulfilment of all the approved plans. This was not, of course, its only activity, and for many years it had to be involved not only in professional statistical activity but also in areas which had nothing in common with the plans, and as a result of the political system the Central Statistical Office acted as a representative of the government, and its organisation was closely linked with the government administration. Reports and collections of data were systematically drawn up marked \"top secret\" so that only a small circle of people, and principally the political leadership, received them. This already seems strange today. It can be seen from what I have said that the activity of the former Central Statistical Office could not avoid being influenced from outside, although it must be pointed out that all this was not directed at embellishing the results of statistics but at suppressing and restricting access to unpleasant or unfavourable data. In its professional activity, a determining factor was that a large number of threads linked statistics with accounting and a whole series of compulsory similarities ensured that they were co-ordinated with each other. An important element in the reform process is tradition, i.e. the outcome of over 75 years of Soviet and Armenian statistics, which is gradually disappearing. Which way are we going? The social and economic reforms of recent years have fundamentally changed the environment in which Armenia's statistical system has to operate. It must be borne in mind that for the transitional period an increasing role is being played by the statistical services, particularly in the context of a market economy. Determined efforts are being made to eliminate a whole series of shortcomings in the methodology of accounting and statistics and to improve the system of indicators. A system needs to be set up to enable us to obtain information which objectively reflects the state of the economy on the basis of the methodology and system of indicators used in developed countries with a market economy. In order to perform this important task, in 1992 the Statistical Office presented to the Armenian Government a programme for the conversion of accounts and statistics to international standards. This programme provides for the reform of the structure of the statistical bodies at all levels and the radical restructuring of the collection and processing of information and the system for making it available to users. Under agreements with international economic and financial organisations and individual countries, a major work programme is currently under way in priority areas, and I should like to go into these briefly: System of national accounts In close co-operation with experts from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Eurostat, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), determined efforts are being made to develop the UN System of National Accounts and to introduce it into our statistical practice. 88 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The system of the balance of the national economy (BNE) which used to be employed in statistics enabled us to obtain extensive and very valuable economic information on the mechanism of socialist reproduction and to portray basic economic ratios and interrelationships in the national economy and the level and rate of material production. The BNE, as a system for calculating aggregate indicators, was an important instrument for the overall assessment of the economic situation in the context of a centralised economy. However, the BNE system reflected economic processes in an uncoordinated and unintegrated way. The switchover to economic methods of administration in a developing market called for the system of macroeconomic information to be changed rapidly and radically. It became necessary to use the main elements of the SNA in macroeconomic calculations. The main context for introducing the SNA has been the regular calculation since 1988 of the GDP indicator widely used in international statistics, and this contributes to our dialogue with the whole world in a single statistical language. While applying UN international standards on national accounts, we have retained all the necessary elements of the BNE system. We began calculating GDP by using the BNE and SNA integrated system of macroeconomic indicators. This method was used to calculate GDP until 1992. In that year, with considerable methodological assistance from all the above-mentioned international organisations (seminars, courses and conferences), it became possible to introduce the calculations of GDP by the output method for all branches and sectors of the economy for all seven SNA accounts. In Armenia, the SNA was first compiled with 1990 accounting data. We have now compiled the SNA for branches and sectors from 1990 to 1994 and for 1995 for branches only. At the same time, GDP is also being compiled by the final consumption method (1990-1995). GDP is calculated in real and comparable prices. Major efforts have been made to introduce the quarterly compilation of GDP (by the output method and the final consumption method). These efforts have received vital assistance from the OECD expert, Mrs Anne Harrison, who is still carrying out major work with us. On the basis of GDP for 1994-1995, a first preliminary estimate of the hidden economy has been made. In view of the importance of this indicator, on the initiative of the Statistical Office a working group has been set up composed of representatives of the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank, the tax authorities and scientific research institutes belonging to the Ministry of Economics. Measures have been drawn up to study the methods of estimating the hidden economy - in particular the Italian method, the Dutch method and the methods used to record the hidden economy in Hungary, Poland and other countries with a view to devising in future our own plan for recording the processes occurring in the Armenian economy. Price statistics Until the transition period, price changes occurred as a result of government decree. This system did not reflect the real situation regarding price changes and could not be used in today's situation. This problem has become of foremost concern. We must master the methodology of price statistics used in Western countries as soon as possible so that it becomes a basis for determining the trends of indicators at macro level in constant prices and for evaluating changes in the nation's standard of living. 89 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go For the first time in January 1993, in co-operation with the IMF, the calculation of an aggregate consumer price index in line with international standards was introduced. Work is currently being conducted jointly with Eurostat, the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, the Statistical committees of the member countries of the CIS, and interested Armenian ministries in order to improve the methodology for calculating industrial producer price indices and to introduce calculations of price indices for exports and imports, agricultural production and building and assembly work. Armenia belongs to the third European group in the international programme of comparisons of GDP and currency purchasing power parity organised and supervised by the OECD and the CIS Statistical Committee. The following have been compiled under this programme: - average prices for consumer goods and services, quarterly and annually; - average prices for capital goods; - average prices for building works; - data on GDP expenditure categories; - data on non-market services. The programme to complete industrial production prices in co-operation with the IMF must be speeded up since the structure of weightings and the prices associated with them are changing rapidly during the transitional period. Business resister In September 1993, the Parliament of the Republic of Armenia adopted a law on the State Register, under which a State Register Division was set up within the Statistical Office. From the time this division was organised, a gradual start was made on devising the plan for the first stage in drawing up the business register, i.e. compiling lists of register users, deciding on the content of the register, selecting sources for collecting information, drafting the forms for initial and ongoing registration and the registration certificate, drawing up methodological instructions on how to fill in the forrris and updating reference information (classifications). Devising the process of interaction between the register and the user. Drafting a technological plan and \"REGISTOR\" equipment for performing the following tasks of the State Register: - computerisation of input and checking of reference information; - computerisation of input and checking of operational information, including the following: a) initial registration of the economic unit; b) ongoing registration, i.e. recording changes in the data concerning the economic unit; - recording of the cancellation or winding-up of the economic unit; - formulating enquiries, output forms and lists for enquiries. On 1 January 1996, the State Register contained data on 21 295 enterprises and 57 wound up enterprises, as well as 21 238 individual owners of enterprises. 90 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Links have been established with sectoral statistical departments, and during the above-mentioned phase the classifications used in the State Register have been communicated to them. The sectoral divisions according to the ISIC classification have been defined as those types of activity for which the State Register periodically sends them lists of enterprises for surveys. Since the beginning of 1996, the labour and remuneration statistics division has been carrying out a labour force survey in Armenia on the basis of information from the administrative register. This is the first time that the administrative register's data resources have been used in Armenian statistics,as the sample survey field. The experience from the surveys will reinforce the link between statistics and the register. We receive technical help in this area from Eurostat under the \"Business Register and Enterprise Statistics\" programme. Business statistics The transition to a pluralist economy and the development of private business, private farming, leasing and share companies and free-market structures in trade calls for completely different approaches to the organisation of statistical observation and information processing. Approximately 30-35% of industrial production is already produced by enterprises which are not in State ownership. Almost all contract building and assembly work in Armenia is performed by non-State organisations. The turnover in goods among non-State organisations accounts for approximately 75-78% of the total volume of goods circulating in Armenia. In 1995 the private sector's share of Armenia's GDP was 52%, and it is proposed to increase it to 75% by the end of 1996 as a result of the large-scale privatisation now taking place in the country. This is leading to the emergence of a large number of private enterprise and business firms, which has also demanded a radical restructuring of the system for collecting and processing information. As part of the above-mentioned action under the Tacis Programme, the Armenian statistical bodies have, with Eurostat's assistance, drawn up a draft business statistics programme. The technique of business statistics is an instrument for understanding the conditions and processes occurring in the economy and enables us to use the data obtained for short-term forecasts. With a view to implementing the business statistics project and carrying out sample surveys, a working group (council) has been set up within the Armenian Statistical Office to carry out the work in stages in accordance with the schedule of the business statistics project. Since, owing to their versatility and ability to adapt rapidly to supply and demand, small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) are playing an important part during the transitional period, these are the enterprises which the Armenian business statistics programme covers in particular. In order to carry out a sample survey of SMEs, the State Register has been used to draw up a list of such enterprises with their characteristics and to draw up a quarterly and annual questionnaire. Work is being conducted to select SMEs and to distribute the questionnaires among them via the staff of the statistical bodies in order to obtain statistical information for the first half of 1996. Similar work is also being conducted among distributive trade and service enterprises. In the individual trade centres (trade fairs), statistical data are collected by means of the observation method. The above project is to be extended with the vital assistance of Eurostat, for which we are very grateful. 91 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Balance of payments and external trade statistics The balance of payments is an important source for drawing up the rest of the world account with the SNA. All the national sectors make their contribution to the export of goods and services and receive income from their imports and are thus connected with the rest of the world account. The balance of payments for Armenia was first drawn up according to the data for 1992 by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which on the whole carried out this work on a non-systematic basis, and the estimates were for the most part obtained on the basis of various indicators. The data on trade did not cover the import of goods received as humanitarian aid, and the estimates of trade with the countries of the former Soviet Union were made on the basis of information on the fulfilment of international agreements. The estimates of volumes of trade with other foreign countries were made on the basis of customs data and information on licences. In accordance with the decision by the Armenian Government, the Statistical Office is responsible for calculating the balance of payments. In order to obtain data on trade flows, the Statistical Office has begun to use customs declarations, although for some types of goods these declarations do not show their value. In order to fill in these gaps, the Statistical Office has used alternative sources of information. We did not have any data on services, investment income or capital flows. The review of the monetary and credit sector drawn up by the Central Bank contained information on the net international assets of the banking system, which we used to compile statistics on international reserves and the import of rouble bank notes. With the methodological assistance of the IMF, the balance of payments and external economic relations division set up within the Statistical Office has drawn up the balance of payments (short version) since the first quarter of 1993. Since the third IMF mission (at the end of 1994), the Statistical Office has drawn up the Armenian balance of payments according to international standard components. The balance of payments according to the new programme has been drawn up for 1994 and 1995 (on a quarterly basis). It must be said that at present, while the problems regarding the balance of trade can be regarded as settled, certain complications remain regarding services, investment income and capital flows (particularly in obtaining data from enterprises and organisations). I should like to draw your attention to the fact that in the second half of 1996 the Statistical Office is to introduce new accounting forms for the balance of payments (on transport services, communications services, government services, tourism, leisure and cultural services, health care and investments). Together with the introduction of these forms, it is planned to conduct surveys of enterprises and organisations to obtain data on investment income. In the field of external trade, in co-operation with Eurostat and the Central Statistical Bureau of the Netherlands, we have switched over from observing enterprises to observing external trade, processing customs declarations on a monthly basis. Between 1993 and 1995 the above work was somewhat improved, and I would say in particular that, while in 1993 there were only data by country and sub-group of goods, in 1995 the output tables on Armenia's external trade were much richer in content (i.e. trade by country, by type of goods, by type of goods to 8-digit code level, by basic and supplementary size units, by individual enterprise and by mode of transport). However, since April 1996 the Statistical Office has begun to record trade by citizens during journeys (\"shuttle\" trade). 92 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The Statistical Office and the customs administration are continuing to work jointly on improving the coverage and quality of the calculations of external trade statistics. Household statistics In order to study the nation's living standards, the Armenian Statistical Office has for many years conducted a family budget survey. This survey was organised by the sectoral selection method. A permanent network of budget surveys covered more than 1 000 families. This method and the permanent network have their particular defects. The system of continuous observation becomes extremely burdensome for the families surveyed. This circumstance obviously has an adverse effect on the quality of the entries. In the present survey the balance-sheet method is used for checking the data on the income and expenditure of each family surveyed. In the transition to a market economy, the sectoral selection method does not guarantee representativeness in the case of family budget surveys. At present, in parallel with the old budget network, the Statistical Office conducts household surveys by the snapshot survey method. The World Bank gives us methodological and technical support for conducting the sample survey of households according to the methodology widely used in many countries of the world. In order to obtain a representative sample of households, we have created a data base of all the households in Armenia, comprising information on their size and location. The data base is broken down into three geographical areas: 1. the city of Erevan, comprising eight administrative districts (the rayon); 2. cities and towns in decreasing order of population size; 3. villages in decreasing order of population size and by altitude. At the same time information can be obtained by province. A radical solution to this problem can be achieved by giving up the existing practice of compiling balanced budgets for each family surveyed, since the tasks of the consumer budget survey are to obtain an accurate record for each unit (family) surveyed. The input of all the information has been completed and we are ready to begin selecting the households in order to carry out initially a pilot survey and then a basic survey. The questionnaire compiled with the help of the World Bank expert has been translated into Armenian and Russian. A pilot survey is due to be conducted in July, and a basic survey will start in September and last two months. In principle, the new approach to organising the household survey makes it possible, for the same expenditure, to increase considerably the size of the sample and thereby to obtain a representative selection. It is now intended to carry out an analysis of poverty in Armenia on the basis of the available information. Agricultural statistics A land reform and the privatisation of State and collective farms began in Armenia in 1991 and was virtually completed in 1994. On the basis of the former collective and State farms, 316 000 peasant 93 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go farms and 409 peasant collective farms were set up. It was impossible to monitor their activity by using the method of exhaustive statistical observation. In order to solve this problem, we drew up and launched, in co-operation with the US International Development Agency (USAID) and Arizona State University, a programme of sample statistical surveys of farms. Since there was no register of farms, we made a random selection of 3 400 farms in 170 villages (20 peasant farms and peasant collective farms in each village). All the information on the selected farms was recorded in four questionnaires drawn up by the Statistical Office. In addition to these questionnaires, supplementary sociological surveys were carried out during 1995. In the second half of 1996, the Statistical Office plans to conduct an exhaustive registration of peasant farms and peasant collective farms, and the resulting material can be used to make a scientifically based sample. The computerisation of statistics The computerisation of statistics in Armenia is a very important question. At present our technical facilities are essentially based on the equipment used during the Soviet period. In October 1994, under the Tacis Programme, Eurostat supplied us with computer technology to the value of ECU 30 000, whereby we received eight computers (two 486DX2 and six 4868X) and one laser printer HP Laser Jet 4m. On the basis of this equipment and the five computers (386DX) we already had, Eurostat installed at our premises two local networks with two 486 PC servers: two 486 PC supervisors; four 486 PCs and five 486 PC workstations. In April 1995 we received a further 2 computers (one 486 PC and one 386 PC) from the reserves of the Armenian Government. Modern software can only be used on high-speed computers with a large operating memory and large hard disk capacity. The Statistical Office currently has only 11 computers which more or less conform to international standards, and this is obviously not enough for carrying out all the programmes and achieving all our aims in the future. At present we use all the computer technology available to us to draw up balance of payments and external trade statistics, price statistics, agricultural statistics, household surveys and population migration statistics and to compile information material and collections of statistics. Under the Tacis technical assistance programme, ten computers were ordered in 1995 and were received by us in June 1996. for which we are very grateful to our colleagues at Eurostat. Under the Tacis Programme we are to receive 15 Pentium-120 computers in 1996, and under the World Bank technical aid programme we are due to receive another 80 to 90 computers. The problems in this area are: equipping the statistical services with new modern machines, learning to use them and training the staff of the departments of the Statistical Office. 94 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Where are we going? The answer to this question may be: setting a realistically attainable goal and reforming the statistical system. In short, this may be expressed as follows: by the end of the decade, Armenia's statistical system must provide basic economic and social information for the government, business circles and the public in accordance with international standards and practice. I should like to state, however, that there are objective factors which complicate our work, and unless they are overcome, it is unlikely that we shall achieve our objectives. The first difficulty is the lack of resources - mainly financial resources. In contrast to Armenia's other ministries, the Statistical Office cannot, in response to budget restrictions, refuse to carry out some of its tasks in order to meet new requirements. The period of transition to market conditions requires radical changes in the system for collecting and processing statistical data, a change in the structure of the statistical bodies, and the concentration of efforts on priority actions. These tasks have to be tackled at a time when Armenia is developing into an independent State. I should like to take advantage of my public appearance here to state that Armenian statistics are currently going through a complicated stage in their development, a stage marked by the transition to a market economy. In these conditions, the aid we receive from Eurostat, international economic organisations and the national statistical offices of various countries is extremely important for us, and we thank you very much. All sectors of statistics are about to be converted to international standards. However, the funds granted from the national budget for covering the overall tasks facing statistics are insufficient, and unfortunately our country is unable for the time being to increase funding. The basic provisions governing the activity of the Statistical Office are contained in the law on statistics adopted by the National Assembly in May 1996. This law stipulates that the Armenian Statistical Office is a professionally independent organisation whose activity covers the entire Republic. Despite the considerable efforts made by the Statistical Office to introduce national accounts and despite certain success in this area in recent years, it is necessary to continue the work of developing the Armenian SNA. It can now be stated that the basis for the Armenian SNA has been created. However, there are still major problems connected with the expansion of the structure of the accounts: mainly the construction of the accounts by institutional sector, the financial account and the primary and secondary distribution of income accounts, but there are also problems in completing the methodology in line with the new 1993 SNA to take account of the specific practical features of the Armenian economy. The problem of developing rapid monthly and quarterly estimates remains very pressing. I would add that the first steps have been taken in Armenia to draw up the financial account. In the initial phase of introducing national accounts, we refrained from the rapid compilation of the financial account since more pressing tasks had first to be performed to overcome the lack of information and resources and the methodological problems. However, this account will ultimately have to be drawn up, and in this connection I should like to ask the experts from the IMF to give us all the methodological assistance they can in the matter. Co-operation in the work on the system of national accounts needs to be permanent. It would be very important for us to draw up a detailed interbranch balance sheet according to the SNA system, but Armenia is obviously not able to compile it in this way, mainly owing to the lack of financial resources. 95 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Since the SNA is being introduced in Armenia within very tight time limits and resources are also limited, we need above all to concentrate our efforts on performing the most pressing tasks, improving the quality of the calculations and improving the data bases. However, drawing.up a detailed interbranch balance sheet according to the SNA system is not, in principle, any less important for our statistics. The reform of the statistical system concentrates particularly on information and placing the dissemination of information on a new footing. Together with the existing principle of transparency, the category of exclusive users has ceased to exist, i.e. no user has any advantage over the others, so that all users, whether government bodies, press representatives or any interested parties, receive our information at the same time. Perhaps the most typical example is our monthly information giving an overall assessment of the socio economic situation of the country. Since 1993 the Armenian Ministry of Statistics, the State Register and Analysis has co-operated closely with the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) under the Tacis Programme of technical assistance to the republics of the former Soviet Union. In 1993 and 1994, this co-operation was implemented with the aid of two programmes: technical assistance and training. The main feature of the co-operation as from 1995 has been the transition from the information research phase begun in 1993 to the implementation of the practical co-operation projects adopted by the Statistical Office in December 1994. Co-operation with Eurostat from 1995 to 1997 is based on the following projects: external trade statistics, business statistics, business registers, demographic statistics, statistics on publications, and linguistic support. The projects involving priority Eurostat actions, such as the business register, business statistics and external trade statistics, are being managed by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Netherlands (CBS). The demographic statistics project is being conducted with the help of experts from the research and planning policy department of the Northern Irish organisation NICO. Under this project, a draft law of the Armenian Republic has been drawn up on conducting a population census in 1999. Again under this project, preparatory work is being carried out for a trial census in Armenia in 1997. Under the project for a statistical publications programme, a statistical collection in English was published in 1995 entitled \"Armenia in Figures, 1994\", which was compiled by the Statistical Office and published by Eurostat. Preparatory work is currently being carried out on the publication of a Trans- Caucasian Statistical Collection, with methodological and technical assistance from Eurostat. Linguistic support: Since September 1994, language courses, funded by Eurostat, have been held for staff of the statistical service. During the reform of the statistical system, we must be aware of the technical development which we could achieve with Eurostat's help and, using this system, introduce priority projects and a progressive system for collecting and processing information and issuing publications. Close co-operation has been established with the CIS Statistical Committee, the UN Statistical Office and the UN Economic Commission for Europe, and co-operation with the OECD is well-targeted. There is permanent consultation with the Russian State Statistical Committee. 96 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In conclusion, I should like to thank all the organisers of the meeting for giving me the opportunity to attend and to present this report. This is only the beginning of our very difficult and protracted transitional period, and we shall need your help and support in the future also. SPEAKER VALENTIN KOMPALOV - DIRECTOR AND MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS, UKRAINE Inter-relationships and co-ordination between National administration Introduction I would like to inform you about how we are working in Ukraine on restructuring statistics under the Tacis Programme and about co-operation between the national administrative bodies. Where we were, where we are and where we are going. The organisation of statistics in the former Soviet Union met the requirements of the planned economy and provided the government bodies with all the information they required for monitoring the fulfilment of plans and for socio-economic development. It was a clearly defined system for collecting and processing information within strict, tight deadlines, based on full-scale observation. In some cases, information on enterprises had to be collected within the space of hours. The system ensured that the reporting data were accurate because heads of enterprises and organisations were liable for providing inaccurate data and not meeting deadlines. Methodological and organisational work was concentrated in the hands of the State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat USSR). The statistical bodies of the Republic worked strictly under the management of Goskomstat USSR. A drawback in the organisation of statistics in those days was the fact that it was based on an isolated methodology which did not allow direct international comparisons to be made and that the whole system was supported by administrative methods. If we consider that statistics cannot function in isolation from the economic system they are supposed to provide with information, this drawback immediately became very evident when the Soviet Union broke up and Ukraine gained her independence. Ukraine's obligations towards international organisations mean that statistical information has to be provided which is comparable to that of other states. Moreover, the restructuring of the country's economic system began at the same time. Statistics lost their administrative support and many indicators became meaningless. The restructuring of statistics All this required a thorough restructuring of statistics. In 1993, the Law on Statistics was passed. Following this, in 1993 the Government adopted the Concept for the construction of national statistics in Ukraine and the State programme for conversion to the international system of accounting and statistics. 97 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In order to complete this programme, information was needed on the organisation of statistics in countries with a market economy and the assistance of experts from these countries was required. It should be noted that we are receiving a good deal of help in restructuring statistics from Eurostat and several EU countries - Germany, the United Kingdom and France, and recently links have started to be established with Sweden. Ukraine is receiving substantial assistance in restructuring statistics from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). At the beginning of 1996, help was being given to Minstat Ukraine in six projects under the Tacis Programme: 1. Foreign trade statistics. 2. Business statistics. 3. Classifications. 4. Business activity registers. 5. Dissemination of information in the transition period. 6. The general support programme (consultations on the system, computer equipment, language support). One of the main problems in conducting international comparisons was the differences in the classifications used, and especially those of the classifications of types of economic activity and products. In this connection, it was decided to base our national classifications on those employed by Eurostat: NACE for types of activity, CPA and PRODCOM for types of products. Currently, work on setting up our classification of types of activity is practically terminated. It is due to be put into operation in 1997. Work is underway on a classification of products and services. In the area of \"business statistics\", Ukraine is actively co-operating - through the Tacis programme - with the statistical service of Germany. It is highly useful for us that Germany already has specific experience in solving the problems encountered during transition from a socialist economy to a market economy in the eastern Lander after reunification. A programme of co-operation on business statistics has been drawn up in conjunction with Germany's Federal Statistical Office (FSO). It made provision for the restructuring of statistics on industry, building construction and domestic trade and services. During its implementation, the FSO of Germany organised seminars and consultations concerning business statistics as a whole and the individual sectors thereof: industry, building construction and trade. Specialists from Minstat studied the organisation of work directly in the statistical bodies of Germany and specialists from Germany became acquainted with the organisation of statistics at Minstat. In this work, we also very closely co-operate with Minstat of Belarus. Many joint measures are included in the co-operation programme with the FSO of Germany. The stage involving the study of statistical systems has now been completed. 98 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Now it is time to put into practice the knowledge that has been acquired. It should be noted that when restructuring statistics one should not transfer the experience of one country to another directly. The state of the economy has to be taken into account. Ours is at a transitional stage. One further point is that the administrative bodies have not undergone very much restructuring yet. Business statistics One of the main statistical problems during the period of transition to a market economy is that of establishing trends in industrial production. In the USSR, where prices were practically constant, the trend in industrial production was calculated using data on production volume for the reporting period and the basic period in constant (comparable) prices. Prices in the USSR were established by directives. Enterprises could not set prices arbitrarily or independently and prices for a specific type of product at different enterprises were in practice completely uniform. In such a situation the production trend could be established fairly accurately. In market economy conditions, the situation has become very complicated. Enterprises set prices for their products independently. Furthermore, in a hyperinflationary situation it is difficult for enterprises to determine comparable prices for different types of products. Consequently we obtain a not fully reliable and trustworthy production index. Why, then, do we still continue to calculate the production rate on the old basis and not switch over to the methods accepted in international practice? Here are a few of the reasons. The first one is: the Ministry of Economics makes calculations of indicative production plans and requires from us data on production volumes in comparable prices. A second more important reason is: in a hyperinflationary situation, when in some months the increase in prices has been 800 percent, it has been very difficult to obtain a reliable and trustworthy producer price index for use as a deflator. At the moment, the rates of inflation in Ukraine have slowed down considerably and we are working on improving the method for calculating the trend in industrial production, which is based on principles accepted in international practice. In the \"industry\" sector, since 1994 sample surveys of business activity (business surveys) have been conducted twice a year. These are aimed at surveying the opinions of heads of enterprises on the current situation and their forecasts for the near future. These surveys are conducted in accordance with the recommended Eurostat programme. Under the \"Business Statistics\" programme, experts from Minstat Ukraine are co-operating with experts from the FSO in Germany on capital construction statistics. It should be noted that in capital construction statistics the differences in the observation system are very substantial. This is basically because of the special information requirements of Ukraine's administrative bodies. 99 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go For this reason, in this branch of statistics there are plans for a gradual restructuring. To begin with, the current accounting system is being maintained and sample surveys are being introduced on the basis of experience in Germany. We are receiving substantial help in industry statistics from the United Kingdom - in particular, in the study and implementation of methods of calculating seasonal fluctuations in the production trend. In domestic trade statistics, up to 1992 all reporting to the statistical bodies was done by administrative structures of the trade sector (administrations, trading organisations, trusts, etc.). These administrative bodies presented data on all subsidiary enterprises and trading organisations. The number of reporting units was only 8 500. With the development of a market situation, these administrative bodies responsible for running trading enterprises have been closed down. Enterprises and organisations have been given legal freedom. This has led to a vast increase in the number of reporting units. In addition, many new trading enterprises have come on the scene, especially small firms. All this has made the collection of statistical information more difficult. To determine the number of trading enterprises and their size in terms of turnover, a survey was conducted in 1994. The results of this survey were processed with the application of a methodology which allowed calculations to be made of the volume of retail turnover of small enterprises on a monthly report basis. A census of enterprises in the retail trade and public catering will be carried out in Ukraine in 1996-97 in order to establish a population to be used in the future for conducting sample surveys. Substantial help in our work in restructuring domestic trade statistics is being provided by specialists from the FSO in Germany. Foreign trade statistics Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, data on foreign trade statistics were collected by the State Statistical Cc declarations. Statistical Committee of the USSR from regional statistical directorates on the basis of freight In 1993, the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine organised the collection of data on foreign trade statistics. Separate report forms were drawn up for the countries of the former Soviet Union and for other countries. At the moment we have a situation in which both the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine and the State Customs Committee are responsible for collecting data on foreign trade activity. Minstat collects data, via the regional statistical directorates, from enterprises and organisations on goods for which freight customs declarations have been drawn up and on goods which are not declared. In parallel with Minstat, the customs authorities process data on imports and exports on the basis of the data in freight customs declarations. 100 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The availability of two sources of foreign trade statistics creates serious problems. It results in different assessments of the situation on the external market. The Government of Ukraine has set itself the task of setting up a reliable information system for foreign trade statistics in 1996-1997. In May 1996, an agreement was signed between the State Customs Committee and Minstat Ukraine on the transfer of data from freight customs declarations for processing by Minstat. Under this agreement, a whole range of measures have been worked out which allow all users to be provided with reliable information on foreign trade activity. Co-operation and co-ordination of work on establishing business activity registers In accordance with the state programme for conversion to the international system for accounting and statistics in Ukraine, July 1993 saw the introduction of the State Register of reporting (statistical) units, which was transformed in January 1996 into the Single State Register of enterprises and organisations of Ukraine, covering the following economic units: - legal persons and their separate sub-divisions (branches, representation offices, departments, etc.), located on the territory of Ukraine and operating in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine; - legal persons and separate sub-divisions (branches, representation offices, departments, etc.), located beyond the borders of Ukraine and established with the participation of legal persons of Ukraine in accordance with the legislation of foreign states. The establishment of the state register constitutes the basis for: - state accounting and standard identification of economic units; - conducting observation of the structural changes which take place in the economy when economic units are created, reorganised and wound up; - providing state administrative bodies with data on economic units; - organising and co-ordinating the conduct of full-scale and sample statistical observation, special surveys and censuses on the basis of the state register; - interaction, using a common methodology, with the databases of the National Bank, the Principle State Revenue Inspectorate, the State Property Association, the Anti-Monopolies Committee and other ministries and government departments for the formation of specific registers and databases containing information on legal persons and their separate sub-divisions. The register is created and managed centrally by the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine. Management of the regional levels of the register is the responsibility of the corresponding regional state statistical bodies. These bodies carry out computerised operation of the register and inform the Ministry of Statistics in the established manner of any changes and additions concerning their level. The Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine is responsible for the organisational, methodological, normative and technological aspects of the establishment and operation of the register. 101 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The main partners of the Ministry of Statistics for the creation of the register are the bodies responsible for the state registration of business units of all forms of ownership. The special divisions of the executive committees of the Councils of National Deputies (state administrations) of the corresponding geographical level act in this capacity. The units which are not registered (banks, the mass media, stock exchanges, etc.) are those covered by special state registration rules laid down in individual acts. When state registration bodies register a business unit, they are obliged to provide notification thereof, within a period of ten days, to the statistical bodies and the revenue inspection bodies responsible for the area in which the unit is located. When a business unit has received a state registration certificate or has decided to establish a sub division (in the case of branches, representation offices and separate subdivisions), it must send the registration card and the normative and constitutive documents to the corresponding statistical body within ten days for inclusion in the Single State Register of Enterprises and Organisations of Ukraine. Units are removed from the register as follows: the state registration bodies cancel registration as soon as the business unit has taken all winding-up measures, and sends notification to the statistical bodies, after which the unit is removed from the register. By 1 January 1996, information on physical persons which are business units was transferred to the Principle State Revenue Inspectorate, which established a special register of physical persons who are payers of taxes and other compulsory payments. By the end of this year, it is planned to add the following economic indicators to the Single State Register of Enterprises and Organisations of Ukraine: - the established number of staff; - the initial (balance) cost of fixed capital; - the initial (balance) cost of fixed productive capital; - proceeds (gross income) from the sale of products; - the agricultural area of agricultural enterprises and the characteristics of the privatised enterprise, small enterprise, etc. Given the need to exchange comparable statistical information on economic units, a working party was set up, at the CIS Statistical Committee, on the register of enterprises and organisations, including representatives of Ukraine, in order to co-ordinate work on the establishment of national registers. While the national registers of the CIS countries have much in common, there are also distinctions between them, resulting from differences in their legislative acts and in their approaches to selecting the units to be covered by accounting and the set of economic indicators. There are difficulties in using a common terminology and in defining statistical units. Once the problems of establishment and operation of the register have been solved, which the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine is currently working on, the main task will be to ensure that the data are accurate. The co-ordination of the work of the Statistical Committee of the CIS and the exchange of experience on the establishment and management of national registers, including those of the Member States of the European Union, will ensure the comparability of statistical data on economic units. 102 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go SPEAKER PIOTR DOLGOPOLOV - MAIN COMPUTER CENTRE OF THE STATE COMMITTEE FOR FORECASTING AND STATISTICS, UZBEKISTAN Allow me to thank the organisers of this high-level seminar - Eurostat and our hosts - Goskomstat Russia and the St. Petersburg State Statistical Committee for providing us with the opportunity to present a paper and discuss a range of problems which have arisen and now face our statistical organisations, and above all, to draw conclusions about the course of action we have taken, make assessments about our present course and work out specific plans for the future. In the work we did together over many years in the former Soviet Union, there were of course aims such as deadlines, reliability and efficiency of the data sent direct to the Centre. Moreover, apart from efficiency and rapidity of action, the main priority was to avoid any distortions in the reporting. Otherwise, the head of each enterprise was punished, or we were. Of course there were also positive aspects about the centralisation of statistics. Above all, there was the uniformity of methodology and software. However, there was also a negative side: for example, the software did not allow any changes, corrections or additions. Also, the problems set directly by Moscow did not take account of regional features which we all had to deal with. With the gaining of independence and sovereignty each state has formed its own approach to market reforms. The restructuring of the statistical bodies in our Republic, by contrast with other states, had its own special features. On the basis of two organisations - the Economics Committee and Goskomstat - we formed the State Committee on Forecasting and Statistics into which were incorporated the entire structures of both committees. This led to changes in the functions and not only in the structure of the central body but also in that of the regional statistical bodies. The statistical bodies were then given both the traditional tasks of collecting and processing data and some tasks associated with the forecasting and analysis of the country's socio-economic development, the introduction of universally accepted statistical standards and rules, as well as the development of an entirely new system of statistical data. With regard to changes in the structure of the regional statistical bodies, it was decided at the end of last year to organise the district level on the basis of the district computer centres, which at that time had practically ceased to exist. District computer centres were thus reorganised to operate on a fully self-financing basis and deal not only with statistics but also in providing consultancy services. The heads of the district teams are directly answerable to and appointed by the deputy-chairman of our State Statistics who is at the same time the Director-General of the Main Computer Centre (MCC). Currently, the collection and processing of statistical information is carried out by the Data- processing System for the Republic's Statistics. It is basically a centralised system geared to the structure of the state statistical system. At state level, statistical information is processed by the Main Computer Centre which receives data collected and processed by the regional computer centres. At this level, data are passed on to the legislative and executive bodies, public bodies, ministries and state departments and enterprises etc. on the basis of the individual subjects involved. At the oblast (regional) level, statistical data are collected from accountable statistical units whereas the district level is responsible for the processing and analysis of data as well as their transfer to regional users of statistical information. The district statistical authorities collect, process and analyse statistical information from the primary units, then they transfer the data via data carriers to the oblast level and to users of statistical data. 103 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The information processing system of the statistical authorities of the Republic of Uzbekistan has the following general structure: - at republic (state) level: the State Committee for Forecasting and Statistics; the Main Computer Centre of the State Statistics; - at regional (oblast) level: 14 Regional and Main Forecasting and Statistical Administrations of equal status; 14 Regional Data-processing Centres of the Main Forecasting and Statistical Administrations; - at district level: 219 district and other centres for statistics and consulting services of equal status. The technological equipment forming the information-processing system for statistics constitutes a uniform system of local and global processing networks which make up a single information space. Thus the Main Computer Centre of Uzbekistan's State Statistics is the economic body which supplies all statistics for the Republic. It collects, processes, aggregates and analyses statistical information. It also drafts methodological recommendations and draws up plans for statistical work which are submitted to the Ministry of Finance. In collecting and aggregating information we are guided by the Government-approved programme for converting the Republic of Uzbekistan to an internationally accepted system of accounting and statistics and we follow the recommendations of the institutes of economic sciences. The materials we issue directly are sent not only to the state administration for decision-making purposes but also to all economic bodies. When the statistical bodies were being restructured, we needed to take specific steps in order not to lose the Soviet Union-based system of statistical accounts. This was indeed done but at the same time we developed the market structure as well. Therefore a Law on Statistics had to be passed as quickly as possible, and this was done on 2 September 1993. This law allows statistical reports to be collected from each unit, which means both physical and legal persons. These units bear the corresponding administrative responsibility for providing statistical information in general and observing the set deadlines. As already pointed out, apart from collecting statistical data, the statistical authorities have the major task of drafting methodological materials. We ran up against a very difficult problem - that of the gradual loss of the indicators which were required for reflecting economic restructuring in the state, especially in market conditions. This is why our State Statistics together with the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank and other economic bodies, as well as specialists of the regional bodies and enterprises, drafted measures to improve the system of statistical indicators to make it capable of providing an objective depiction of the socio-economic processes now underway. The main principles of this system were drawn up in co-operation with the heads of sectoral groups, ministries and departments, concerns, associations, corporations and other units. At the same time a new system of statistical observation was worked out which allowed statistical indicators to be classed in the following blocks: the macroeconomic, marketing and social stability blocks. The central item in the macroeconomic block is the system of national accounts and indicators for prices, finance and external economic activity. The marketing block includes statistics of the concentration and d\u00e9concentration of capital, statistics of the formation of market infrastructure, statistics of monopolisation and demonopolisation, statistics of the labour market, capital market, securities market and markets of goods. The indicators of the third block contain characteristics for measuring the nation's social protection. 104 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go At the moment, the work underway in the Republic on introducing the System of National Accounts (SNA) is at the stage of the switchover to establishing the main accounts on a regular basis. In order to develop the work on introducing the SNA, new sources of data are being established based on the revision of current statistical reporting and that of business accounts, which serve as the basis for statistical reports. The newly approved Regulation on the list of expenditure on production and sale of products (work and services) will provide a record of non-productive assets and their depreciation, as well as a range of new categories and transactions which previously did not appear in business accounts. External trade statistics are being improved in order to obtain information on transactions with the rest of the world. Work is underway on improving price indices. Our State Statistics face the task of organising the drafting of the full-scale interbranch balance in accordance with the SNA. It is planned to continue work on improving accounting and statistics, and especially in obtaining information for drawing up the balance of payments and providing a complete depiction of household budgets in the system of national accounts. Important items are the introduction of methods and data sources for evaluating non-market services in constant prices, the reform of branch statistics and the introduction of internationally accepted classifications, the elaboration of the balance of payments, the improvement of statistics of state finances, banking and currency circulation on the basis of IMF recommendations. Our statistical bodies also have to solve the problems of converting from exhaustive to non-exhaustive reporting. At a time of developing market conditions, a system based on exhaustive statistical accounting data and reports from enterprises does not work. Exhaustive observation, by needlessly increasing the burden on enterprises, does not provide a complete objective picture of the processes being observed. This is especially clear from the statistical accounts of external economic activities. In a situation of permeable borders, a large part of exports and imports are not included in exhaustive statistical reports. Similar problems are also to be found in the statistical accounts of small enterprises. In this connection it has become necessary to have a reasonable combination of exhaustive and non- exhaustive statistical observation. The introduction of non-exhaustive methods is to be based on a permanent sample network. For this, a register of economic units is of fundamental importance. An organisational, methodological and legal basis has been established for the register and at the moment, data resources are being inputted. As far as further registers are concerned, these are to be set up on a sectoral basis. To ensure full coverage of the register's survey units, co-operation is being increased between the statistical bodies and the regional public bodies as well as with the departments operating the tax service registers. Co-operation with international organisations is also a fairly important item in the adaptation of statistics to a market economy. Three international projects - \"Business Registers\", \"Enterprise Statistics\" and \"External Trade\" have been drawn up; these will make a substantial contribution towards creating and introducing adequate statistical forms and methods. Consequently, at the seminars organised as part of the co-operation on the Business Register\" and \"Enterprise Statistics\" projects, discussions centred on the creation of a statistical register, its structures and a range of problematical issues concerning the registration of local units, conversion to international standards and experience in drafting registers was exchanged between national authorities and the CBS of the Netherlands. The proposals and recommendations on choosing the best solutions subsequently were reflected in the implementation of the Republic's register project. The drafting of a Single State Register of Enterprises and Organisations is being done to implement the Decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan of 17 November 1994 \"On 105 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go the Single State Register of Enterprises and Organisations irrespective of the form of ownership and type of management\", of 24 August 1994 \"On the State Programme for Converting the Republic of Uzbekistan to an internationally approved system of accounting and statistics\" and that of 12 February 1996 \"On improving the procedure for creating state registration of the activity of enterprises with foreign investments\". The current situation of the national register is as follows: regional bases have been set up and are operating automatically in 14 regions of the Republic (at oblast level). In these regions enterprises are registered, given a code (from the set of codes reserved for the regions) and other characteristics (type of activity, form of ownership, organisational-legal form, names of founders, registered capital etc.) are recorded. The filled-in registration card is put into the computer and each month the set of data formed for the region is transferred to the central database on magnetic media or via modem in order to feed the State Register database (at national level). The central base is formed from the data from the regional bases by applying specific methodological, design and software principles. The computer system is based on PC/AT-486 (386) personal computers. The register operates in system mode with the automated databases of the following classifications: OKPO - Classification of Enterprises and Organisations; SOATO - Classification of Administrative and Territorial Subdivisions; SOOGU - Classification of Government Administrative Bodies; KFS - Classification of Forms of Ownership; KOPF - Classification of Organisational Legal Forms; OKSM - Classification of the world's countries and currencies. The operation of the Single State Register of Enterprises and Organisations includes systems for updating the Register's database, creating local bases, providing information for users and automatically operating the classification databases. In user mode, for the entire content of the Register's database, which is of the order of 150 000 economic units (legal persons), it is possible to make any selection for set indicators and forms. For the most urgent issues connected with the national economy which require constant monitoring, local databases containing data on joint ventures are formed from the Register and samples are made of small and medium-sized enterprises etc. Constant users of the Register are the President's office, the Cabinet of Ministers, the State Property Committee, the health care authorities, ministries and state departments without subsequent commercial use of the data. Since the volume of information in the Register rose sharply in 1995 (it more than doubled and is likely to reach half a million units soon), an urgent problem has arisen - that of the question of collecting and processing the data as well as the development of system software and design of the hardware for normal operation of the database. The hardest question at the moment is that of providing full coverage, reliability and updating for the Register's database on the basis of using non-statistical information and achieving co-ordination with the registers of the State Property Committee, the Tax Committee, the banking system, state department services etc. The main problematical issues requiring serious study in 1996 and the next few years under the Tacis Programme and co-operation with the CIS Statistical Committee are the following: - harmonisation of the branch classification with the international standard classification of types of activity, and its introduction; - work on inclusion of economic units in the system of national accounts on the basis of their organisational-legal form; - creation of a statistical register and associated database for conducting sample surveys; 106 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - dealing with the question of registration and identification of local units and conversion of the administrative registers into statistical ones; - development of a classification of changes and, in connection with this, performance of work on analysing the demography and structural changes of enterprises. Further work on the business register project should in our view be conducted in the light of the above problems in order to create a reliable information base for conducting sample surveys. Work associated with economic analysis, forecasting and publications needs to be raised to a higher quality level. An extremely important item for us is the problem of technical equipment for the Republic's statistical system. If we keep the technology for our statistical work at its current level, the implementation of the statistical reform programme may be slowed down. A solution to this problem hinges on solving financial difficulties. In this connection we have drawn up this year a programme for publishing activities which we believe will help us to earn money ourselves by selling our statistical information. We have a great deal of information since we have set up a large databank for business registers which are very much in demand with both state and private users. We can put together any groupings or selections of all enterprises contained in our register. Some of the users of this information are capable of paying for it and therefore we have the possibility of existing not just on the basis of budget appropriations but also from sales of our information. We also have problems with the black economy. We recently did some work on a localised basis, training our specialists in methodology for calculating various indicators, including those for the black economy. Such calculations are now performed at regional level; the data are then passed on direct to the Main Computer Centre which constantly checks to make sure the work is not neglected at either the regional or national level. Calculations are made for manufacturing, construction, paid services, trading in goods, transport, external trade etc. In other words, estimates are made for the black economy at regional level for the calculation of GDP, but we are aware that there are still a lot of problems to be solved in this context, the main one being how to achieve accuracy and reliability for our calculations. Despite all these difficulties, work is continuing on converting accounting and statistics to international standards in the Republic of Uzbekistan. DISCUSSANT MALCOLM WALMSLEY - OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION, UNITED KINGDOM First I would like to thank Armenia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan for their very interesting papers which highlight many of the issues of where we certainly were. Statistical needs and relationships at the national level were focussed on the needs of centrally planned economies and on monitoring the state plan. Data collection was based on a very hierarchical system and statistics, as noted in the paper by Uzbekistan, is collected through the \"rayon\" and \"oblast\" level and all the implications that we already talked about at this session on that particular topic. In many ways the past relationships at a national level were very much dependent on the fulfilment of the plan. I think one of the issues is that all papers highlight the terrific progress that has been made in achieving new systems, particularly introducing international classifications, the SNA, business registers and improving foreign trade statistics. But in this new situation, we now find ourselves in, 107 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go new national institutions have been created necessarily so and others have taken on new roles. And there are therefore new needs for both co-ordination between these national organisations and the statistical offices, in particular, the national organisations that are both providers of information to the statistical offices and users of the statistical output of the national statistical offices. There needs to be in many areas a clarification of their respective roles and of the potential conflicts of roles and the sorts of work statistical offices and some organisations do. I am talking about the national institutions, such as the National Bank, Ministries of Economy, Finance and other Government institutions being both the prime users of statistics and also influencing the Government about providing the national statistical offices with resources. A key issue, as I see it in affecting the national statistical offices both now and for the future, is how they identify user needs for statistical information and how the statistical offices translate those needs into a deliverable product. If the national statistical office does not fully meet needs there is a potential for it to be treated in those areas as weak and other alternative data sources and analysis will spring up and be developed by those organisations that need the data for their own decision making processes. This is a danger that faces statistical offices and needs to be addressed. In many instances we are already seeing publications appearing with present economic data and analysis in well presented and commercially acceptable products in quite a number of countries. Some of these publications are even supported by international organisations that are supporting the national statistical offices themselves and in some way set up conflicts between both the offices and the organisations which are in competition with them. A further point is that there have been and in many cases still are conflicts between the roles of the Central Bank, particularly in the areas of balance of payments, on a \"who does what\" basis. This regards not only balance of payments but also, in some instances, the calculation of Gross Domestic Product. And, as I said, in those areas that are weak, there is possibility that alternative methods of statistical data collection and analysis will come up to fill the gaps because resources can be made from elsewhere. I think another area is the respective roles of customs departments, or customs committees and the national statistical offices. This can cause friction and has done in a number of countries where there have not been clearly defined roles respectively for the ministry or the national statistical office and the customs committee. However, certainly it is my experience, that in general there are existing good relationships between national statistical offices and other Government departments and also training institutions and academic institutions within a country. In my view a crucial thing is the question of to what extent should the statistical offices become involved in analysis of statistical data. If the production of large volumes of statistical data according to existing practices fully consumes available resources and there are no resources for the analysis of that data, again the issue of meeting and addressing user needs for the analysis of data comes into question and as a result of that alternative analysis will be made on the data and conflicts can come up. So, there needs to be made an assessment of to what extent the role of a statistical office is involved in statistical analysis and I certainly believe myself that it is crucial and a statistician has a very important role in interpretation of his data and the analysis of them. An additional problem which affects national organisational relationships is the budgetary framework that many countries find themselves in and which very often is on annual budget cycle. Agreement has to be made for an annual plan. This can present problems for the statisticians because many statistical programmes are medium- or long-term in their nature and their perspective. And if we are 108 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go dealing, for example, with planning a household survey or a population census there has to be a significant lead time and an appropriate budgetary framework needs to be in existence if the end product is to be delivered. In many respects the most important item in helping with all these problems is a clear perspective of user/producer needs. As such, they can help with defining the particular requirements for statistics in detail, but also enable prioritisation of programmes to be made and assist with getting resources for the needs that have been identified in a statistical sense. More and more national statistical offices are faced with a conflict of priorities. On the one hand they are under considerable pressure from their Ministry of Economy or the equivalent ministry to maintain existing data sources based on a supply-driven economic structure. On the other hand there is a need to introduce the new systems with resources generally being cut and they do not have sufficient resources to do both properly. Somehow, choices therefore need to be made. Maybe the attention paid to the supply of statistics required for Ministry of Economy is possibly one role that needs to be looked at. If we look at the UK example we can see a considerable number of working groups set up to identify and work with interested parties over the collection of statistics. These working groups are user/producer type, some of them are statutory, others are taking a lead by the Central Statistical Office, or now it is called Office for National Statistics. And they involve statistical experts but also academies, industry, trade organisations, etc. to ensure that statistical programmes meet their requirements. And this is a very important part of the planning process that goes into meeting statistics, identifying gaps and weaknesses in the statistical process. Where are we going? I see that the issue of defining the user/producer needs and setting up institutional structures within countries and formalising them is very key to the whole issue of good quality statistics and meeting needs. If statistical services need resources, however, they must first show how the existing resources of both manpower and other resources are utilised effectively. Again, if I use the UK example, we have had to be forced into a considerable process of efficiency scrutiny throughout not just the statistical service but in Government generally. We have had to look in particular focus at what each department does to find clear objectives, how those objectives meet the overall department mission statements and through the development of individual departments' business plans to identify how statistics would be collected, processed and analysed. In many departments statistical processes have been subject to the process of market testing and this means preparing a business plan and defining costs which are then subject to a market tender process. Considerable savings have been achieved in many areas of statistics by this process, either by the inhouse bid being accepted or actually by putting work out to the private sector. Sometimes it is not just the private sector, it could be academic institutions. The price system, for example, is collected by a commercial company in the UK now. External trade statistics, the dissemination of them in the operation of an external trade database is done by commercial company very efficiently and those people who have seen the outputs and the service they provide say that it is a very interesting example of co-operation between Government statistical agency and the commercial sector. And there have been considerable savings achieved. The other issue which I think is important is the development of service level agreements between statistical offices and the suppliers of their basic data. And I was particularly interested and I draw your attention to the paper of Ukraine where such a service level agreement has been introduced between the Ministry of Statistics and the Customs Committee, which provides for the provision of data in a specified format according to specific time-schedule and I think this will be the forerunner perhaps of many similar sorts of operations which will help to guarantee the timeliness and quality of statistical information coming to the statistical offices in many countries. 109 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go So, I was particularly interested in that and I would be interested to hear of any other examples of this being introduced. And I would also, perhaps, like to hear from other participants about the experience of their user/producer relationships and whether or not their experience points to the issue of whether these can be useful and increase the resources available to statistics for the new demands being placed on your offices. DISCUSSANT ENRICO GIOVANNINI - ISTITUTO NAZIONALE DI STATISTICA, ITALY The papers give a very clear and well organised view of the situation of statistical systems in Armenia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, in particular of the improvements and new projects realised or in the phase of implementation. This kind of information is very useful and we want to thank the authors for these contributions. My discussion will be divided in two parts. The first one is devoted to making some comments on papers, the second to focussing on three problems not well covered, in my view, by the contributions. The first paper, presented by Mr Agadjanov, gives an overall picture of important new developments in the Armenian statistical system. In particular, it seems to me very important that in the Armenian case, national accounts are put in the centre of the system of economic surveys and statistics. This choice, coherent with the suggestions of the new SNA, implies that concepts, definitions and classifications used in different surveys are ex-ante homogeneous and coherent. I think that this approach must be used especially in those countries in which the new statistical system is still at the stage of general design, in order to avoid difficulties and additional costs at the time of assembling heterogeneous information for national purposes. The main consequence of this approach for the development of relationships among the various bodies involved in statistical activity is that the national institutes of statistics have to push other agencies which produce sectoral statistics to follow a strict co-ordination in the methodological field under the supervision of national accountants. National accounts are not the \"centre of the world\" but th'ey play a central role in the development of economic statistics. The second comment is related to business registers. The difficulties in building registers are very well known, but perhaps it is more difficult to update the register with low costs than to obtain a full coverage of the register at its starting point. In order to update the register it is essential that all the bodies involved work together in a co-ordinated way. This activity needs a specific statistical work culture as a fundamental contribution to the right knowledge of the current economic situation and to economic policy. Also in this case statistical institutes must play a role of stimulus and training of other administrations, in particular those which are in direct contact with firms and other economic agents. Special work to make clear the importance of the register has to be done with the registered enterprises. Without this important, and obviously difficult activity the register risks becoming an empty box in a few years. A very important topic is analysed in Mr Dolgopolov's paper about the Uzbekistan experience. It is the problem of co-ordination among local, regional and central authorities in the collection and processing of statistical data, In this field there have been many different experiences also in western European countries and it is very difficult to give suggestions. The problem exists and its solution is influenced by the historical evolution of political organisation, different administrative structures, etc. My suggestion is to find a solution looking to the concrete possibilities to solve technical problems of processing information and compiling statistics with the given resources, without following an \"optimal\" design from the institutional point of view. 110 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go As I have already said, there are three points that I want to stress to stimulate general discussion, the first one is the role of statistical institutes, particular in the activity of analysis of economic and social phenomena. It is clear that, if statistical institutes do analysis, the relationships with other public bodies (like research institutes) are more complex. In western European countries there are different approaches to this problem, but it seems to me that the tendency to consider analysis as a fundamental task of statistical offices is very clear, also inside Eurostat. I fully agree with this tendency because the analysis of the socio-economic reality and tendencies permits us to have a better selection of the areas of interest for new surveys. In Italy, for instance, we produce an Annual Report of about 400 pages of analysis in economic, social, demographic and environment areas, trying to give an interrelated view of the evolution of Italian society and the economy. To play this role can be a very important element also at the time of the distribution of financial resources among different areas of the public sector. If the statistical office makes this kind of activity, its power and role in the country can be important and in this situation it can be easier to obtain an enlargement of the budget, also for statistical activity in a strict sense. The Armenian and Uzbek statistical offices play this role and it could be interesting to know something more about their experience. My second point is brief, but very important in my view. In none of the papers there are no references to the relationship between statistical offices and central banks. This relationship is very important and not easy, as the experience of western European countries shows. At the European Union level the so called \"Committee for Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics\" has been created to stimulate co-operation between statistical offices and central banks at national and international levels. My suggestion is to develop as soon as possible common projects with central banks in the statistical field. To adopt common definitions and classifications for real and financial surveys is absolutely necessary to compile national accounts and basic statistics on financial enterprises. Specific attention to this area could be given also in the Tacis programme. The last point is on the role of national accounts and other accounting schemes, like satellite accounts and Social Accounting Matrixes (SAM), Satellite accounts are sets of national accounts connected with the \"core\" of the system on specific areas (transport, tourism, health, etc.). SAM is an integrated way to see some social and economic phenomena following a sort of input-output scheme. My suggestion is not to start to build these kinds of accounts, which are quite sophisticated and complex, but to look at sectoral statistics in the light of these accounts. Following this approach it can be easier to decide priorities for new surveys and to have a dialogue with other public administration and with users. For instance, in France there are some permanent commissions to study sectoral accounts, like the satellite accounts of commerce, transport, etc.. These commissions are very useful to co-operate with users and other public administrations interested in different areas and to check the adequacy of the statistical information produced for users' needs. * * * COMMENTS, REPLIES AND AUDIENCE DISCUSSION COMMENTS EKATERINA PROKUNINA - STATE COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS I would like to make a few comments on the problems we have been examining today. We at Goskomstat announced the switchover to business statistics as the main direction for developing statistics in Russia up to the year 2000. However, it should not be said that we have never had business statistics. In the past 70 years it was a sort of branch statistics, but today it is probably 1 1 1 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go wrong to treat the enterprise as a unit relating to a specific branch. Nowadays, an enterprise is an independent economic unit in the Russian economy and we have tried, while converting to business statistics, to create a system of statistical observation of enterprises as economic units irrespective of their branch membership. In so doing we are aiming at several fundamental targets, the main one of which is reducing the burden on enterprises. Today, we have already divided up the largest types of enterprises according to size, and the system of statistical observation differs substantially depending on the type of enterprise. The first task we are setting ourselves is to elaborate a typology of enterprises as economic units. It should be mentioned that the most general criteria have already been defined by law in Russia, and first and foremost the criterion of size of the enterprise which allows us to split up the groups of the largest enterprises according to the system of statistical observation applied to them. Currently, the smallest enterprises with up to 15 employees have the simplified system of registration and reporting; there are small enterprises with up to a hundred workers for which we organise quarterly surveys only on a sample basis so that no enterprise should have to fill in more than one current statistical report form. We also have medium and large enterprises which are covered by us in the traditional way and our surveying of these enterprises is organised so that we can obtain from them a sufficiently detailed depiction of their activities. We can thus treat the conversion to business statistics as a matter of integrating the information we now have at our disposal by creating corresponding databases. We have thus set ourselves a few basic tasks: - to reduce the burden on reporting enterprises; - to develop standard general economic information for depicting any type of enterprise and providing the means for making a comparative analysis of these general economic data on enterprises; - to provide the means of obtaining comparable information at any level of aggregation. Today we have the basis for introducing business statistics: our registers, which contain some two and a half million units. We have an administrative register which contains legal characteristics and is fed with information from legal documents. When we faced the need to use a register in statistical practice, it became quite clear to us that nowadays an administrative register in itself cannot be used directly for organising statistical observation. Admittedly, a means of obtaining a very good source for updating the register became available. In all probability, in Russian practice, in the absence of legislative acts, the most serious of existing sources is data from company accounts. By Government decision, Goskomstat has been given the functions of collecting, processing and presenting company accounting data to all users. Of course, problems do crop up. The actual methodology of company accounting and reporting is elaborated by the Ministry of Finance at the moment. We only collect the information and are unable perhaps to analyse or check its content in the same way as we do with statistical accounts. But at the same time we now constitute an absolutely genuine source of information on the list of enterprises which actually exercise an economic activity. If we compare the set of enterprises for which we have received statistical accounts and had information on several economic indicators in the register (this was about five hundred thousand enterprises out of two million) today we have collected the company accounts for 1995, this group has been increased twice over in practical terms and we believe that now out of two and a half million some one million economic units are valid; they are tax-payers and present company accounts. It must be said of course that the state statistical bodies have collected some 700 000 accounts, but in August we managed to sign an agreement with the Federal Tax Service to allow us to exchange copies of missing company accounts and regularly collate the databases of our company register and the register 112 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go of taxpaying enterprises. We regard this as a very substantial help for us in organising statistical observation. These preconditions allow us today to form a single population of statistical accounting units and we have set out as our main target for 1997 the development of statistical accounts and obtaining information in the first instance by non-exhaustive methods only on the basis of this single population. By the same token we hope in the coming year to achieve comparability for the statistical information we have at the moment. Business statistics, of course, are not only current information. They also involve new methods of collecting and processing information and Mr Yuzbashev was absolutely right today in saying that there are lots of methods we do not fully master yet, in particular , economic-mathematical methods and models, and the conversion to sample probability surveys at the moment of course constitutes a considerable problem. The problems of business statistics evidently need to be covered by a separate paper since all countries have come to understand, one way or another, that we need to move in this direction. Having the opportunity to speak directly to you I would just like to say one thing. We started a discussion in our journal \"Questions of Statistics\" (\"Voprosy Statistiki\") precisely about the problems of conversion to business statistics. I would be very grateful to everyone attending this seminar if they could take part in this discussion because the problem of conversion to business statistics is by no means unambiguous; it is a thorny issue and the opinions of all those involved in it, first and foremost of those working in statistical practice and of the methodologists of the different countries, and not just the CIS countries, would be extremely useful to us. COMMENTS ANDREY KOSAREV - STATE COMMITTEE OF RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS I would like to say a few words on the item in the programme we are discussing now, and specifically about the problem of co-operation between the national administrative bodies in the field of external trade statistics and the balance of payments. Today, this problem, seen objectively, has become extremely important in Russia. In historical terms, external trade statistics were developed over several decades by the statistical authority of the Soviet Union, and of Russia - Goskomstat. And when active economic reforms began in Russia in 1992, one of the areas where these reforms progressed the fastest was and remains external economic activity. Accordingly, serious reforms have also started to be introduced in external trade statistics. Changes are being made to both methodology and organisation. As far as organisational aspects are concerned, there are two highly important reasons: first the change in the character of the economy itself and secondly, the introduction of the calculation of the balance of payments. Doing away with the centralised economy pointed the way towards abolition of the collection of external trade data from enterprises since it had become impossible. And in Russia it was decided that external trade statistics had to be based on customs statistics. The second reason, the calculation of the balance of payments, means that a significant proportion of information on external trade activity has to be collected, processed and aggregated not by Goskomstat but by the Central Bank. Consequently, a minimum of three main participants process develop information on external trade activity: Goskomstat, the Central Bank and the State Customs Committee. In constructing the balance of payments, Goskomstat gives the Central Bank a large part of the information for the current transactions account, and for forming the state external trade statistics, Goskomstat uses the data of the customs statistics published fairly regularly by the State Customs 113 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Committee. These data do not become state statistics until they are published by Goskomstat after undergoing a set processing procedure. Several documents regulate this co-operation, the first being the Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation on the Procedure for Calculating the Balance of Payments\". This document specifies the deadlines and the main bodies responsible for drawing up the balance of payments: the Central Bank, Goskomstat and the Ministry of Finance of Russia. As regards co-operation between Goskomstat and the State Customs Committee, in 1996 a special agreement was signed between these two government departments setting out the rules and deadlines for transferring customs information to Goskomstat for subsequent inclusion in state statistical data and transfer to the Central Bank for drawing up the balance of payments. I would like to conclude by stressing the importance of a systematic and comprehensive approach to dealing with a problem like the compiling of statistics of external economic activity today. This sort of approach is being applied in Russia, it is being implemented gradually, all possible means are being used, one of which in our view could be the external trade statistics project under the Tacis programme which is gradually taking shape. 114 ",

They include the statistical framework, statistical classifications, nomenclatures, definitions, etc. They can refer to statistical contents, like the system of national accounts, harmonised system or to statistical processes; we have for example the standards for data exchange EDIFACT and standards for data dissemination built by IMF. I assume that the use of international standards is not only in the interests of international organisations. International standards can be used for variety of reasons. Firstly, they provide quality solutions. International statistical standards usually are built with the help of experts in many countries and many international organisations. Secondly, they provide cost-effective solutions. Adapting existing standards is generally cheaper than designing and building your own. Thirdly, international statistical standards make it possible to give internationally comparable descriptions of the economic and social situation in different countries. This is especially important given the increasing globalisation of economic activities and the increased interaction between countries and people of the world in fields other than economics. Availability of internationally comparable statistics also makes it possible to analyse economic developments in different countries side by side and to use the experiences in one country for finding solutions to problems in others. Having said all this, I do not think that I should pretend that the use of international standards is a solution to all statistical problems and that implementation is a straightforward task. Standards at best may provide a necessary condition for success. They certainly are not a sufficient condition. Existing standards may be adopted but in practice they often also need to be adapted before they can be implemented, so some work is needed. Also there are areas in which statistical standards are not available. One very specific area and one very important area for transition economies is the hidden economy. Although I have done a bit of work on the hidden economy of western countries I do not yet see a standard solution for measuring hidden economy activities in transition countries. # # * SPEAKER YURI IVANOV - DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, INTERSTATE STATISTICAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES Introduction 1. The report discusses a number of issues pertaining to the work carried out by the CIS Statistical Committee in order to facilitate the introduction of international standards into the statistical practice of the CIS member states. In this context, the general situation in this field is assessed as well as the degree of conformity with international standards of the main sets of socio-economic statistics collected and disseminated by the CIS Statistical Committee; problems are examined and the work programme for the immediate future in this area are also discussed at some length. 117 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Such an analysis will help international organisations to assess more accurately the requirements of the CIS countries and to improve co-operation and co-ordination with the CIS Statistical Committee. It should be noted that the provision of technical assistance to the CIS countries in the introduction of international statistical standards is one of the major functions of the CIS Statistical Committee. Achieving objectives in this area is essential for promoting international comparability of data both within the CIS and in a broader international context; the latter is important because the CIS countries have to fill in and submit numerous questionnaires to the international organisations. 2. The work on introduction of international standards into the statistical practice of the CIS countries was initiated by the CIS Statistical Committee immediately after its creation in 1991. The objective of this work was to assist in the gradual transformation of the methodology which was employed in the USSR and its republics, in order to reflect the new shape of the economy. The USSR statistics represented a rigid hierarchical system which on the whole satisfied the requirements of planing and management of the economy for both the country as a whole and for individual republics and regions. However, this methodology reflected specific features of the economy based on centralised planning and distribution of resources. In this connection the following features should be noted: - the calculation of the main macro-economic indicators was based on the methodology of the Balance of the National Economy (BNE), in which the concept of economic production was restricted to material production; in addition, a number of important aspects of the economic process such as distribution of income and transactions with financial instruments were not reflected properly in the BNE; - the classification of revenue and expenditure used in the USSR budget statistics did not allow the deficit or surplus to be calculated as required by the IMF; in particular, the distinction between borrowing and revenue was blurred in this classification; - economic classifications (by branches, commodities, types of assets and liabilities etc.) differed substantially from those internationally recommended; in particular, the classification of economic sectors was based on a fundamental distinction between the material production sphere and non-material sphere; - substantial special features characterised the methodology of price and labour statistics; in particular, the calculation of price indices was based on keeping track of real changes in prices using price lists; such an approach was in line with the practice of pricing and methods of management of the centrally planned economy; - a considerable number of deviations from international standards existed in external trade statistics; these deviations were to be found in classifications, the method of evaluation of flows as well as the treatment of certain transactions; - deviations from international standards in the methodology of the statistics of main sectors of the economy (industry, agriculture, construction, transport etc) were to be found especially in commodity indicators; for example, in industrial statistics, contrary to international standards, the emphasis was on the gross output indicator rather than value added; - the important difference in the statistics of the USSR was that the main source of primary data for compilation of various indicators was a system of compulsory comprehensive reports submitted by all enterprises, organisations and institutions to the statistical authorities; sample surveys played a secondary role and were applied on a limited scale. 118 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go One of the important functions of USSR statistics consisted in monitoring fulfilment of the state plan and this predetermined the content of the main statistical indicators and the use ofinformation. Review of the introduction of international standards into major areas of statistics National accounts 1. The most significant progress in introduction of international standards in CIS countries has been achieved in national accounts. The CIS Statistical Committee in co-operation with the OECD and other international organisations has prepared a number of methodological documents which adapt the provisions of the SNA 1993 to the conditions of the CIS countries; considerable attention has been paid in these documents to recommendations regarding specific data sources which can be used now and in the immediate future for compiling the most important accounts and calculating major SNA indicators. Priority is given to compilation of current accounts, the capital transactions account for all sectors of the economy as well as the production and generation of income account for economic sectors. An analysis of the work undertaken in this area during the last few years makes it possible to conclude that CIS countries have made considerable progress and are able now to publish on a regular basis data on major accounts and indicators based on the SNA. As a result, in 1996 the CIS Statistical Committee has published a compendium of national accounts with the figures for 1990-1995. The publication contains official data on national accounts prepared by the statistical offices of the CIS countries for this period. The data refer to GDP and GDP sectors, final use of GDP (consumption and savings), rates of growth of GDP and value added of individual sectors. Moreover, the publication contains data on the most important accounts for the economic sectors of a number of CIS countries. If these data are to be used efficiently for economic analysis and the formulation of macro-economic policy, further effort will be needed to improve these calculations in the near future to ensure that the figures are complete and reliable. In particular, special efforts are needed to obtain fuller accounts of the black economy and a more realistic reflection of the impact of inflation on GDP and other indicators. At present, the CIS Statistical Committee is also working on the introduction into regular CIS statistical practice of other accounts and aggregates of the SNA, such as the financial account, balance sheet of assets and liabilities and interbranch balance sheet based on SNA concepts and definitions. The CIS Statistical Committee is also continuing work on revising its recommendations on sources of data needed for compiling different SNA accounts. Government finance statistics In all CIS countries efforts are being undertaken to convert national budget statistics to bring them into line with the recommendations and standards of the IMF classifications. The most noticeable progress in this area has been achieved in the Russian Federation where budget classifications have been harmonised with international standards. However, on the whole, a great deal of work remains to be done in this field. It should be noted that financial statistics are compiled by the ministries of finance in the CIS countries. Nevertheless, the CIS Statistical Committee has prepared a number of documents on this topic which are designed to assist statistical services of the CIS countries in converting to international standards and using the data compiled by the ministries of finance. Moreover, the CIS Statistical Committee has prepared a questionnaire on state finance statistics, the basis concepts and definitions of which are consistent with the IMF manual on this subject. International comparisons of GDP on the basis of Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) During recent years considerable work has been initiated in the field of international comparisons of GDP of the CIS countries on the basis of PPPs. The methodology used for this purpose relies on the 119 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go general provisions and classifications which are used by the international organisations for comparisons of GDP carried out within the framework of the European Comparisons Programme. As is generally known, the CIS countries are also taking part in international comparisons as part of the ICP project and therefore it is essential that the calculation methods employed in the CIS and for ICP comparisons should be identical. This will make it easier to link the results of comparisons and to reduce the burden on the countries in providing primary data for calculations. In this context it is worth noting that for the next phase of the ICP for 1996 it has been decided to create in the European region a so- called \"third group of countries\" which includes all CIS countries and Turkey. It has also been decided that general co-ordination of comparisons in this group will be done by the OECD, the CIS Statistical Committee and Goskomstat of the Russian Federation. Economic classifications General principles for building up a system of economic classifications harmonised with international standards have been formulated by the CIS Statistical Committee with the help of a system of model classifications. A system of classifications worked out by the UN Statistical Commission was adopted as a basis for the work in this area. This choice was determined by a number of factors: the decision of the CIS countries to use the UN System of National Accounts with which major UN economic classifications are associated and the fact that the CIS consists of countries of both Europe and Asia and therefore the information language had to be based on a worldwide classification system. In its work on this field, the CIS Statistical Committee relies on the following central classifications recommended by the UN: ISIC, rev3; CPC and the goods nomenclature for external trade activities. The CIS Statistical Committee has adopted a method of harmonisation whereby one classification is the aggregated or disaggregated version of the other. It is recommended to CIS countries to use as a starting point the UN classifications (both with respect to general structure and coding) and to carry out disaggregation on a more detailed level of classification to reflect national particularities. Such an approach was applied by the CIS Interstate Council on Metrology and Certification in its document \"Procedures for harmonisation of classifications of technical economic and social information\" which is recommended for use by all CIS member states. This approach was used in particular by the CIS Statistical Committee to prepare a model for a general classification of all types of economic activities (OKED) in 1992-1993. The OKED uses all four levels of ISIC codes and designations, whereas the fifth digit level is reserved for reflecting the national particularities of the CIS countries. At the same time certain features of NACE were also used. Thus, for such divisions of classifications as construction, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and catering, transport, warehousing and communications, which are not sufficiently detailed in ISIC and OKONKh (the All- Russian Classification of Sectors of the National Economy), the groupings of NACE were used. As a result, the most detailed level of the OKED has 658 groupings, whereas the ISIC has only 292 groupings and NACE 503. On the basis of the OKED, national classifications of types of economic activity have been drawn up and approved in Kazakhstan and Moldova; work on their trial introduction is under way in Armenia, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. In Russia, an All-Russian Classification of all Economic Activities, Goods and Services (OKDP) was introduced in 1993 (based on the UN's ISIC and CPC). 120 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Together with the classification of types of economic activity, the classification of goods plays an important role in the classification system. In many CIS countries (Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan) the All-Russian Goods Classification (OKP) is used in the former USSR version. The All-Russian Goods Classification was approved in 1994 in the Russian Federation. In 1996 the CIS Statistical Committee has drawn up the methodological principles for compiling a harmonised product classification (for goods and services) which will serve as a basis for ensuring the compatibility of national classifications in this field. Considering the differences in opinion on the choice of a basis for harmonising national classifications of economic activities, the CIS Statistical Committee has started work on the second (revised) version of the OKED model classification and the related goods classification on the basis of the European NACE-CPA-PRODCOM system of classifications. Statistics of External Economic Relations The CIS Statistical Committee has prepared a number of methodological materials to serve as recommendations for the CIS countries in the field of statistics of external trade, foreign tourism and the balance of payments etc. These materials were based on international recommendations in this area (UN, IMF): - \"Statistics of International Trade: Concepts and Definitions\" (United Nations, 1982) - \"Statistics of Tourism: Recommendations\" (United Nations, 1992) - \"International Standards for Accounts and Reporting\" (United Nations, 1990) - \"Standard International Trade Classification\" (United Nations, 1986) - \"Balance of Payments\" (Manuals of the International Monetary Fund, 1993 and 1995). The methodological recommendations on external trade statistics drawn up by the CIS Statistical Committee are broadly used in practice in the CIS countries and serve as a basis for collecting and systematising internationally comparable data on exports and imports. The main classification used by the countries is \"The Goods Nomenclature of External Economic Activity of the CIS Countries\" (TN VED/CIS) which is based on the six-digit Harmonised System (HS) for commodity description and coding and eight-digit Combined Nomenclature of the European Union (CN); for coding partner countries the CIS countries use the \"Classification of Countries\" which is consistent with the \"International classification of countries and territories\". Currencies are coded on the basis of the Currency Code Classification drawn up by the International Standardisation Organisation. Comparatively less progress has been achieved by the CIS countries in compiling the balance of payments. The major problem in this area is generally the lack of adequate data on transactions with capital and financial instruments. It appears that the most visible progress in this area has been achieved in Russia where the balance of payments is compiled by the Central bank in co-operation with Goskomstat. Recommendations on statistics of foreign tourism are prepared by the CIS Statistical Committee on the basis of corresponding documents of the UN. They have not yet been implemented in all the CIS countries owing to difficulties associated with the collection of primary data as a result of the transparency of the borders between the CIS countries. The CIS Statistical Committee is currently working on recommendations dealing with accounts of export and import transactions between the CIS countries under the Customs Union. These recommendations will take into account the experience of Eurostat in the formation of a single accounting system for trading operations within the European Union. 121 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Price statistics On the basis of international practice in surveying retail prices and calculating the retail price index, the CIS Statistical Committee drew up methodological recommendations in 1993 on the registration of prices in the retail trade and on markets, and on that basis constructed a price index for the retail trade. In 1994 it issued methodological recommendations on the study and computation of consumer price indices for goods and services based in particular on the ILO's methodological guide on consumer price indices. At present the CIS countries use methodology proposed by the IMF which takes into account the experience obtained in applying the CIS Statistical Committee's recommendations. In international practice, the calculation of consumer price indices for a basic period involves taking the structure of consumption expenditure of households for a specific year. This is then used for five to ten years. However, as a result of the fast changes in prices during the period of transition to a market economy, the structure of the nations' consumption expenditure in the CIS countries has been changing rapidly and therefore it is recommended that they take the previous year as the base period. Labour statistics In the period 1992-1995 the CIS Statistical Committee prepared a number of methodological documents in this field which are based on international standards (BLO documents). Thus in 1993 the CIS Statistical Committee issued to the member countries recommendations for introducing into statistical practice new categories of employment and unemployment based on corresponding ILO resolutions. The designations and methods for demarcating these categories (employment, degree of economic activity, types, duration and level of unemployment) currently used in the CIS are consistent with the international standards in this field. At present, the CIS Statistical Committee is working on proposals for improving the methodology of labour statistics which take into account recommendations adopted at the seminar organised by the ILO and Czech statistical body in Prague in November 1995. The CIS Statistical Committee has also prepared \"Recommendations on conducting surveys of wages and salaries earned by different categories of employees\". These recommendations are intended to help the CIS countries in filling in the ILO questionnaire on remuneration and hours worked. These recommendations were used by practically all CIS countries. Since 1993 the CIS Statistical Committee has been working on statistics of expenditure on labour on the basis of the ILO recommendations adopted at the 11th International Conference of labour statisticians in October 1966. Some CIS countries have included in their forms for the reports submitted by enterprises and organisations special sections dealing with this topic. In Russia information on the composition of expenditure on labour is collected with the help of special labour cost surveys. The CIS Statistical Committee has been giving its attention to a number of other labour statistics related areas: statistics of migration, the introduction of an employment status classification, the study of working conditions, industrial injuries etc. Since 1995 the CIS Statistical Committee has been assisting the CIS countries in introducing a classification of occupations based on ISCO-88. 122 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Socio-demographic statistics The methodological work of the CIS Statistical Committee in this area is based on the \"Handbook on social indicators\" published by the UN Secretariat's Department of International Economic and Social Questions in 1989. In demographic statistics the CIS countries basically follow the internationally applied methodology, classifications and concepts. Thus, the ICD International classification of diseases, traumas and causes of death (adopted by the WHO) serves as a basis for statistical monitoring of the health of the population and for assessing demographic processes. Following the regular review of this classification in 1989, the CIS Statistical Committee prepared new methodological tools, including a brief classification of causes of death, recommendations on codes for causes of death and recommendations on the analysis of data on causes of death. Practice in the CIS countries regarding the recording of international migration is not in line with international standards. Not all categories of migrants recommended by the UN, for example, are included (instead, only persons who change their permanent place of residence); there is no uniform classification of population into urban and rural categories; a different age limit is applied for determining the population of working age. The CIS Statistical Committee is actively helping to co-ordinate the work involved in the forthcoming population census to be held in the CIS countries at the end of the 1990s. The methodological materials being prepared, which include recommendations for the programme of questionnaires, the main methodological provisions and program for processing the census results, are based on UN documents, and in particular, the Manual on conducting population and housing censuses and the Recommendations on the conducting of the 1990 population and housing census in the ECE region, as well as the material from the seminar on population censuses which was held in Berlin in 1995 (organised by the UN ECE together with Eurostat). In the field of education statistics the CIS Statistical Committee intends to prepare recommendations for the CIS countries dealing with the implementation of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) published by UNESCO. As far as statistics of scientific potential are concerned, recommendations on improving surveys of the completion of scientific and technological work have been completed this year. These were based on the OECD's Manual on surveys of scientific and technological activity (the Frascati Manual). The CIS Statistical Committee carries out work on harmonising the methodological principles for household budget surveys in the CIS countries. The material on this topic relating to the programs for a special sample survey of the income and expenditure of farmers, the program for processing the results of household budget surveys by per capita income category were prepared with the help of the documents of the UN and other international organisations. Statistics of industry and agriculture In 1992 and 1993 the CIS Statistical Committee drew up methodological recommendations and issued them to the statistical offices of the CIS countries on \"the calculation of indicators of trends in industrial output during the period of transition to a market economy and liberalisation of prices\" and \"Methods of calculation of indices of the physical volume of industrial output adjusted for seasonal factors and hours worked\". The first document justifies the introduction into statistical practice of the calculation of aggregated indices of the physical volume of industrial production based on trend indicators for different types of production. Such an approach broadly corresponds to widespread international practice in forming 123 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go indicators of change in the volume of production in a market economy context. The second document discusses the expediency of introducing into statistical practice the successive comparison of consecutive periods, in other words, the comparison of the volume of monthly or quarterly production with the corresponding previous period (with the previous month, quarter or any other consecutive period taken as the basis for comparison). In 1994, the national statistical services were issued with recommendations on improving the method of calculating the index of the physical volume of industrial production in current conditions, as well as recommendations on eliminating seasonal factors when calculating the index of the physical volume of industrial production. The national statistical services were also sent methodological recommendations on the organisation of sample surveys of the economic activity of industrial enterprises which are based on international practice. In agricultural statistics, the bulk of indicators for output in physical units, for agricultural land and areas under crops as well as the herd numbers for different livestock are currently comparable among the CIS countries and by and large correspond to international standards. As for calculating per capita consumption of food products in accordance with FAO methodology, on the basis of which the balance sheets for the supply and use of the main agricultural products are. drawn up, in 1993 the CIS Statistical Committee prepared and issued to the member countries' statistical bodies methodological recommendations on compiling such balance sheets. Using such data, the statistical bodies of Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine compile the balance sheets for numerous agricultural products. Kazakhstan Statistics have calculated these balance sheets for 1995. In 1996, recommendations on improving the methods of calculating average yields for crops have been prepared in accordance with international standards. Conclusion The work of the CIS Statistical Committee has facilitated introduction of international statistical standards into the practice of the CIS member states in the most important fields of socio-economic statistics. As a result the basic indicators of socio-economic development of the CIS member states are, on the whole, based on internationally recommended concepts, definitions and classifications. At the same time it is clear that the work should continue along several lines: recording data for the hidden economy, compiling quarterly national accounts, achieving a more effective depiction of the impact of inflation on GDP and its trends, development of financial and price statistics and calculation of the balance of payments. The improvement of foreign trade statistics will be an important item of our future work. The work in the field of economic classifications should also continue. Particular attention has to be paid to introducing the CPC into the regular statistical practice of the CIS countries. There is a clear need to improve industrial statistics and to harmonise them with international standards. It is intended, in particular, to work out proposals on the calculation of indices of the physical volume of industrial production on the basis of value added. More complete coverage of economic activities and more systematic application of sample surveys will be achieved by improving statistical registers in CIS member states. 124 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go SPEAKER HABIB GAYBULLAEV - PRESIDENT OF THE STATE STATISTICAL AGENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT, TAJIKISTAN Conformity with international standards I am very pleased to be attending this seminar and to have the opportunity to take the floor and therefore I am very grateful to the organisers of this event. This is already the fourth day of the seminar and I can say that I have listened very attentively to the reports given by Mr Franchet, Mr Yurkov, Mr Korolev and other heads of statistical offices of the CIS countries and learned a lot about the improvement of statistics in these countries during their transition to a market economy. We are very pleased about their success. The statistical bodies in our Republic were set up in 1924 after Tajikistan was declared an autonomous region forming part of the Republic of Uzbekistan. In those days there were a total of only 13 specialists working in statistics for a total population of 751 000. In the subsequent 72 years, the name of our statistical organisation has changed eleven times, whereas our work has practically remained unchanged. Before the collapse of the USSR, the statistical authorities of the Republic of Tajikistan consisted of Goskomstat, or the State Statistical Committee, of the Republic of Tajikistan and local statistical bodies consisting of 4 regional and 62 urban district statistical agencies, as well as the Computer Centre, forming a total staff of about 1 000 persons. The statistical bodies worked under the aegis of Goskomstat USSR on the basis of a uniform methodology. The funding, supply of equipment, road vehicles, computer equipment and statistical report forms etc were provided centrally by Goskomstat USSR. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan became an independent state and its statistical bodies inherited the system for collecting and compiling statistical data on the basis of economic planning. The basis of the statistical reporting system was the material balance production accounts which were used for putting together the plan and establishing the production tasks for enterprises, as well as checking economic indicators at both macro and micro level. These accounts, which did not include the production of non-material services, were intended for measuring the volumes of industrial production and were compiled on the basis of statistical classifications which substantially differed from international standard classifications. Irrespective of the degree of decentralisation of the collection and processing of statistical data, statistical policy was formulated on an extremely centralised basis. As a result, the newly formed independent state encountered major difficulties in administering the existing statistical system. These problems also arose as a result of mounting demands for statistical information to help in taking administrative decisions during the conversion of the country's economy to market conditions. The conversion of the Republic's statistical and accounting system to international standards is proceeding slowly and painfully because of a lack of adequately skilled specialists or staff with experience of work in this field. We have begun to overcome these difficulties with the help of many international organisations which have provided and are still providing us with invaluable assistance. 125 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In particular, every year, 30 to 40 specialists of Tajikistan's statistical services have participated in seminars organised by Eurostat, the OECD, IMF, ILO and World Bank, studying topics such as the role of statistics in a market economy, price statistics, foreign trade statistics, financial statistics, international comparisons, the methodology for calculating GDP and business registers etc. Representatives of the OECD, Mr Derek Blades, Mr Bent Thage, Mr David Roberts, Mrs Barbara Kondrat, Mrs Anne Harrison and Mr Peter Scrimgeour, came over from France and organised practical training in our country for specialists on the construction of a system of national accounts for the Republic. All this gave the Republic's statisticians the opportunity to speed up the solving of problems connected with work in the period of transition to a market economy and with the improvement of statistical reporting to meet the requirements of international standards. In particular, as one of the first states with an economy in transition to do so, Tajikistan passed a Law on State Statistics. Our statistical office carried out work on creating a business register up to regional level based on over 12 000 economic units. The register's software is used on a \"Unified System\" ES- 1840 computer which has allowed aggregated data to be obtained on territories, types of units, forms of ownership, profits and sectors. However, in view of the shortage of specialists and inadequacy of computer equipment the register does not contain data on the Republic as a whole. Work has been conducted on establishing a system of national accounts (SNA) for the Republic of Tajikistan applying uniform methodological principles and based on international standards. The GDP and GNP as a whole and in elements have been calculated using internationally accepted parameters. Inter-branch balance sheets have been compiled according to the short scheme for 1991-1993 and we are continuing the work on SNA methodology over the next few years. The economic table of exports and imports of products for the past 25 years has been systematised. Indicators for the SNA, balance of payments and external economic relations have been broadly used by IMF experts. In the market economy period, the indicator for the population's standard of living is especially important. For this purpose, in early 1992, on the basis of a Government decision, a service was set up in Goskomstat's central offices which is responsible for price registration and indexing the population's income; it also surveys prices as well as determining the value of the basket of consumer goods. In addition, joint statistical publications on the countries of Central Asia have started to be issued, monthly statistical information is submitted to the UN Statistical Office as well as international organisations and specific non-CIS foreign countries. The absence of an adequate number of specialists, sufficient equipment and funds for obtaining it, as well as training, and a reduction in 1992 of almost 60% of statistical report forms were factors which hindered success in the adoption of international standards, but the fratricidal war which was unleashed also contributed to this situation. In the Republic, this pointless war has cost tens of thousands of lives of people, especially those of working age. The hostilities, violence and emigration associated with the civil war of 1992-1993 made the situation even worse. The economic situation in the country has started to become difficult. The rise in consumer prices, the fall in production, ever growing shortages of goods, the devaluation of the national currency carried out in May 1995 and the intensification of inflationary processes have had a negative influence on the nation's material situation. 126 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The nation's nominal income has been increased more than once by the Government as part of their social protection measures. However, in this connection, the fact that the rise in the prices of goods has systematically outstripped real income many times over, the nation's standard of living has fallen drastically and therefore many qualified statistical staff, in order to survive, have changed over to better-paid work or left the Republic. The activity of the statistical authorities has been affected by one further factor, which is possibly an essential one. In early 1994, attaching insufficient importance to the statistical authorities, the government of the Republic abolished the independent organisation of Goskomstat of the Republic of Tajikistan and formed a statistical body under the Ministry of Economics of the Republic. In other words, the statistical authority gradually lost its prestige and this factor became one of the reasons for the statistical system losing qualified specialists. The new government, understanding the importance of statistics decided to restore the independence of the statistical organisation in early 1995, which was the start of an improvement in the activity of the Republic's statistical bodies. Currently, state statistics are the responsibility of the State Statistics Agency of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, which directs the Computer Centre, 4 regional and 68 district and urban statistical offices with a staff of 861 persons. In the course of the past year, as a result of the instability of the situation in the Republic, international organisations or the CIS Interstate Statistical Committee have hardly planned or conducted any action or meetings in Tajikistan. Furthermore, in 1994 50 and in 1995 48 of the Republic's statisticians participated in seminars and conferences of statisticians, including 30 in non-CIS countries organised on the basis of the Tacis programme, by the World Bank, the OECD, ILO, UNDP, UNESCO etc on business registers, the labour market, foreign economic activity, the development of social statistics, international comparisons, sampling theory, agricultural statistics, interbranch balance sheets and the preparation of population censuses, etc. It should be noted that in view of the low standard of living in the Republic and especially the low pay in the statistical bodies, which at 1 June 1996 was, as in the rest of the national economy, an average of 7 dollars per month, at least 40% of posts are vacant for the second year running and no-one comes to work for this pay. Moreover, for the past few years, the specialists who have been taken on have not produced the required qualifications for statisticians, and therefore work on the adoption of international standards and other matters is not dealt with properly. At the same time, the Republic's statistical authorities have recently reviewed the Law on Statistics and the Law on a Business Register, and material has been sent for discussion to the Machlis Olya (Supreme Soviet) and will be reviewed in the regular session. Following the comments and verification by representatives working on the Tacis Programme, the Business Register is being renewed. The register's effectiveness could have been very much enhanced if the classifications had been compiled and computer equipment had been supplied on time, but unfortunately these problems have not yet been fully solved. During the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 1995, we conducted a survey on the informal market and established the proportion of the volume of goods turnover in private trading. The survey results showed that the proportion of private trade within the total volume of the Republic's goods turnover was 88% on 1.9.95. Continuing this survey, we established that the proportion of state goods turnover 127 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go at 1 June 1996 was only 9% and the private sector represented 91%. The survey results were checked by specialists from international organisations and they confirmed that the survey had been conducted in accordance with international standards. IMF expert Mr Thomas Tibetts visited Dushanbe in 1995 and twice verified our calculations of the rate of inflation, the consumer price and producer price index and concluded that all calculations were in line with international standards, even though few specialists were employed in this work and no computer equipment whatsoever was available; in other words, the work was done manually. In 1995, in order to ensure the adoption of international standards as quickly as possible and obtain statistical indicators in line with the demands of a market economy, the statistical authorities of Tajikistan revised all statistical report forms to bring them into line with the recommendations of the CIS Statistical Committee. After the introduction of changes and new indicators, 213 existing forms were confirmed and 25 new forms created, dealing in particular with macroeconomic indicators and indicators for foreign economic relations and household surveys. It should be noted that the State Statistics Agency, for the already mentioned objective reasons, cannot provide for the Republic and international organisations detailed figures for such indicators as: the level of poverty, standard of living and proportion of the country's agricultural production produced on private plots; in other words, those main market economy indicators which are needed at the present time. The household budget survey is currently one of the most outdated parts of the work of Tajikistan's statistical authority. To improve representativeness, the number of families covered had to be raised from 600 to 1 000 and the families surveyed had to be paid almost seven times more than in the past for recording their budgets. This will allow us now to improve our work on family budget surveys somewhat, although for two years now we have not had the computer equipment or enough specialists to process the collected results of the survey and obtain figures for the Republic. In a market economy, the main levers of economic policy (fiscal, monetary and foreign currency) cannot be used effectively without a decent system of national accounts. Work on introducing national accounts into Tajikistan's statistics began in 1992, although for obvious reasons it was not continued until 1995. Currently, basic accounts have been drawn up in accordance with UN methodology which include capital transaction accounts for 1993, as well as branch and sector accounts in real prices. We went on to calculate and draw up accounts for 1994 and 1995. Of course, in this work, we have fallen behind the CIS countries somewhat, but the work now being done and the technical assistance to be provided by the OECD, LMF and World Bank give us reason to hope that we shall catch up again with the others. The main indicator of the economy and system of national accounts is the GDP. At the moment, the State Statistics Agency is working on this item according to plan. We have begun monthly calculations of GDP by the production method and the provisional GDP for 1995 has been calculated. The difficulty lies in aggregating to establish the total volume of GDP, since such a calculation requires the conducting of a sample survey for which there are no funds; the aggregation therefore has to be done by traditional estimates which impair the reliability of the GDP calculation. We need to continue working on improving the system of macroindicators depicting the country's socio-economic development and do a lot of work on co-ordinating indicators in the system of national accounts in order to form a good database for estimating GDP. This is because of the coverage of many economic transactions which have cropped up over the past few years in the wake of the accelerated rise in the number of new economic units, the development of new types of services and the use of supplementary sources of income by the population. 128 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go One of the most important stages in the overall system of organising statistical surveys is the development of work on creating a system of co-ordinated national classifications for technical, economic and social information harmonised with similar international systems. The review and introduction of national classifications will be done in co-ordination with work on introducing and applying the basic principles of the international system of national accounts, providing a classification by type of activity of different types of statistical survey units and obtaining the necessary groupings. A priority area for work in this field which will allow international comparability of economic statistical data will be the adoption of the Classifications approved by the UN, Eurostat and other international organisations for Economic Activities and Products and Services, the Standard International Trade Classification, the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System, the International Standard Classification of Occupations, etc., which are homogeneous in their structure. The application of these classifications will make it possible to depict the state and trend of the national economy's development, solve problems associated with blocks of demographic and social statistics, the creation of statistical registers, catalogues, aggregate-grouping tables and lists of homogeneous data elements. With the implementation of the range of tasks on systematising observation units, improving methods of collection and processing statistical information, there is a need to solve the problems connected with the development of a data-processing system for statistics which will be a combination of new information technology methods and equipment capable of performing complex automated statistical tasks, including the processes of collection, processing, storage, aggregation, analysis, presentation, dissemination and use of statistical information. Consequently, Tajikistan Statistics are setting themselves the task of keeping in step with all the other countries in their conversion to international standards. However, I would stress once more that because qualified staff are leaving us and in view of the lack of computer and duplication equipment, paper and funds means there is no way of solving these problems in the near future. In addition to these difficulties there is a further problem: the implementation of the population census in 1999. The Republic is in practical terms not ready for this sort of task since this used to be done centrally, all the costs and equipment being provided by Goskomstat USSR. Now, this task is being shouldered by the Republic itself where there are hardly any specialists, equipment, paper or funds. As a result, the State Statistics Agency of the Republic of Tajikistan, with the Government's permission, has appealed to all international statistical organisations, states and national organisations to provide technical assistance and funds for this work, which is important for our country. In order to solve the problems already indicated, Tajikistan Statistics have worked out a series of programmes together with Eurostat, the UNDP and UN Fund for Population Activities, in accordance with which these organisations, with the help of statisticians from the Netherlands, Turkey and Germany, will provide us with technical assistance in the development of a register, foreign economic relations statistics, staff training, conducting of surveys, calculation of construction price indices, the calculation of GDP in the agricultural and services sectors, budget surveys, the compilation of interbranch balances and classifications, as well as the allocation of computer equipment and other indispensable supplies for conducting the population census, for which we are very grateful. We hope that these measures will be implemented. 129 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go At this point I would like to ask Eurostat and the other international organisations to provide on-the- spot assistance to the State Statistics Agency of the Republic of Tajikistan in dealing with problems such as the following: - improving the information base for compiling key SNA accounts reflecting the new developments in the country's economy; - calculating seasonal factors, which at this stage is one of the most difficult problems in the calculation of annual and quarterly GDP; - rafting and introducing national classifications in line with international standards for comparisons and exchanges of information; - calculating the Republic's national accounts in constant prices; - applying economic and mathematical methods for balancing monthly, quarterly and annual data; - rafting methodology for estimating corresponding statistical indicators not provided by full-scale statistical surveys; - conducting verifications of our surveys of the informal sector of the economy; - providing technical assistance in household surveys. I believe this conference will first of all give a major impetus to the implementation of the programmes for improving statistics and accounting which have been drawn up and approved, and secondly, it will help us to study the experience of western countries in speeding up the adoption of international standards. And finally, I would like to thank the organisers of this seminar: Eurostat, the CIS Statistical Committee, Goskomstat Russia and the St. Petersburg State Statistics Committee for providing us with the opportunity to attend this seminar, for their cordial welcome, pleasant venue and the good atmosphere of this conference. SPEAKER BAIRAMKLYCH URASOV - CHAIRMAN OF STATE COMMITTEE ON STATISTICS, TURKMENISTAN The work of Goskomstat of Turkmenistan on Harmonising Statistical Indicators with International Standards As it was also mentioned by my colleague of Tajikistan, until 1992 the system of accounts and statistics in Turkmenistan had been shaped by the administrative conditions of the command economy and was directly dependent on the methodological basis of the central planning system. All statistical instruments, statistical reporting forms and classifications were developed by the former Goskomstat of the USSR and its institutes and were obligatory for all the former republics of the Soviet Union. The resultant legacy to the independent Turkmenistan, as to all the other states, was a reporting system loaded with diverse technical production indicators and statistical methodology and classifications which largely did not correspond to international standards and classification systems and therefore did not enable a reliable analysis of the country's socio-economic development, its foreign trade links and Turkmenistan's integration into the world community. 130 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In October 1991 Turkmenistan attained independence. Being a country with an economy in transition, all its efforts were directed to creating essential state institutions. It took the course of reforming the economic system based on a policy of openness, which led to the development of the private sector co operatives, private enterprises, self-employed businesses and joint ventures with foreign capital. At present in Turkmenistan 30 844 enterprises are registered, of which 21 972 are under private ownership, 6 028 are state owned, 1 535 are co-operatives and 505 are of joint or combined ownership. In the state sector various forms of organising labour are also beginning to emerge, which are stimulating the activity of enterprises. The policy of openness has enabled foreign investors to create enterprises and units in both the industrial and socio-cultural spheres. Turkmenistan's foreign trade links have been intensified, resulting in an increase in its foreign trade. Reforming the state economy has required a fundamental reorganisation of national statistics. To this end, 1993 saw the development of the draft state Programme for converting Turkmenistan to the international system of accounts and statistics. Following more precise definitions and partial changes, the draft was approved in September 1995 and at present is the organisational basis for achieving statistical priorities. A series of measures for statistical reforms has already been initiated and carried out in accordance with the draft programme through the adoption of individual legislative acts on accounts and statistics, in accordance with which experimental calculations have been carried out. The first steps have been taken towards rebuilding the general methodological basis for state statistics, and important changes have been introduced for this purpose into the system of statistical indicators and accounts. The revision of state statistical reporting also included the indicators of the system of national accounts, based on the redevelopment of the structure and set of indicators of bookkeeping, banking and customs reports and their integration with state statistics. During the drafting of the statistical forms the set of indicators was decided as well as their economic content and the method of calculating them for breakdowns corresponding to the international standard statistical systems. By 1992 this work had resulted in a reduction from 600 to 350 in the total number of state statistical reporting forms. In countries with centrally planned economies, changes in price levels and indices had much less importance. In an economy undergoing transition, changes in prices and price indices are the latest instruments for economic calculations. That is why price statistics were first in line for reform. The growing participation of Turkmenistan's economy in international trade and capital flows has been adequately reflected in the foreign trade statistics. An important area for further development of these statistics has been improved harmonisation between national and international indicators of the growth of foreign trade. The methodological basis of foreign trade statistics has been the material used by the countries of the European Union and its statistical office (Eurostat). Goskomstat has carried out a range of work relating to the organisation of customs statistics on the basis of co-ordination with the state customs authorities, and on introducing into statistical practice the classifications \"Countries of world\" and \"Foreign currencies\", developed on the basis of international recommendations. In 1993, the Government of Turkmenistan took the decision to introduce the SNA as the standard for the whole system of accounts and statistics and give the indicator of gross domestic product (GDP) the status of main descriptive indicator of national economic activity. Prior to the statistical reforms, the GDP indicator to a certain extent remained simply a supplementary element of the existing system of 131 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go indicators at macro-economic level. The need to use GDP in statistical accounts is explained by the fact that it describes the operation of the whole economy in both the production and non-production spheres. GDP and its structural components provide a basis for international economic comparisons and an estimate of the level of integration of Turkmenistan into the world economy. This year Goskomstat of Turkmenistan began the organisational work on international economic comparisons of GDP. At present Turkmenistan is among the group of countries participating in the European Comparisons Programme, which includes Turkey, the countries of the Central Asian region of the former USSR, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and the Russian Federation and the CIS countries. The first stage in establishing the SNA for drawing up the main aggregate accounts was the formulation of the methodology and organisation of the calculation of its indicators. Eurostat's system of national accounts was taken as the basis. A series of experimental calculations were carried out, using a current information database, of aggregate accounts at macro-economic level and the main accounts by sector and branch of the economy. The results of this work have been presented for international examination. On the basis of the experimental calculations, proposals for improving the SNA information base have been formulated and the system of accounts has been reconstructed in accordance with international standards. The review of current statistical accounts has been directed towards a reduction in indicators of an industrial and technical nature and the introduction of new ones to provide information required for the SNA and the national balance of payments. As a result, new indicators are being created and the existing system of processing statistical information is being reviewed. In 1993, Turkmenistan began to set up a Unified State Register of Enterprises and Organisations, irrespective of the form of ownership and management, on the basis of full-scale surveys and registration of all legal persons and their separate territorial sub-units. This register has the role of main distributed database on every single enterprise and organisation, voluntary organisation and association, enterprises with foreign investors and other economic units. Its introduction enables the following: '- a unified information area for co-operation between state and territorial authorities; - full-scale surveys with a minimum set of statistical indicators for all groups of economic units registered on the territory of Turkmenistan, which in combination with sample survey methods using a wider set of indicators and data obtained through co-operation arrangements with registers of other information systems, enables the production of the information required to analyse the socio economic situation in Turkmenistan; - the maintenance of continuous time series in the event of changes in territorial divisions, branch membership and form of ownership of the register's economic units covered by survey; - an opportunity to supplement analyses with indicators required for individual regions; - faster and more economical development of the survey system and data storage, processing and output; - the possibility of converting from full-scale to sample surveys and introducing new methods of information processing in order to produce groupings in line with international classifications and forms of data presentation. The register is being developed along the following lines: - making use of international experience in setting up similar registers; - selecting the set of economic indicators in order to more fully depict the processes taking place in the economy; 132 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - consolidating the legal basis (registration of enterprises, data collection strategy, confidentiality, aspects of the register); - ensuring the reliability of the register through co-operation with the registers of banks, tax authorities and other ministries; - carrying out sample surveys. Classifications of the following items are used as a basis for extracting information from the register: - territories; - system of designation of government bodies; - forms of ownership; - organisational and legal forms; - national economic branches; - types of economic activity. The classifications of forms of ownership and organisational and legal forms were developed and introduced into practice in 1993. The classification of types of economic activity started to be used for the register in 1993 and was created on the basis of recommendations from the CIS Statistical Committee (ISIC, rev. 3). It is designed for the simultaneous provision of results by branch classification and by type of economic activity, thus enabling the conversion of dynamic series. The classification of types of economic activity is currently being introduced into statistical practice. Much work will have to be done throughout the year to obtain results classified according to both the OKONKh, the All-Russian Classification of Sectors of the National Economy, and the OKED, the All-Russian Classification of Economic Activities. At OKONKh level the national economy is divided into 16 branches: 01 - industry, 02 -construction, 03 - agriculture, 04 - forestry, 05 - transport, 06 - communications, 07 - trade, supply and procurement of materials, and 08 - other branches of material production. OKED, which is based on ISIC rev 3, does not distinguish between the production and non-production spheres, and thus OKED groupings differ completely from the delimitations of the main economic branches in the OKONKh. Converting to the OKED enables the main structure of the harmonised classifications to be used in the statistical system and enables the corresponding results to be obtained. In order to carry out its obligations as regards international co-operation, Turkmenistan needs to proceed with the work on harmonisation, adaptation and introduction of international statistical standards. Problems in the way of harmonisation are breaks in the continuity of dynamic series and the reduction in data reliability and comparability during the transitional period. Resolving these problems requires considerable material resources and a considerable amount of time. The gains from carrying out the harmonisation work are: - an improvement in the informational and statistical base for studying the economy in the period of transition; - the comparability of statistics on socio-economic development at international level; - the extension of information coverage to areas not previously covered by statistical surveys. In 1996 Goskomstat started work on the revision of the territorial classification to include all localities, thus avoiding mistakes in the register and in other records in the designations of localities and enabling registration of the economic units, population etc. on their territory. 133 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The classification system for designating state administration bodies is being revised and converted to the classification of the functions of administrative bodies, corresponding to international standards. Draft classifications have been developed on the reasons for winding up economic units and institutions. The period 1996 to 1998 saw the development and introduction into statistical practice of classifications of products and services, professions by type of education, occupations, equity levels, international definitions of the cause of death and illnesses, and units of measure etc. They will be the basis of the distributed data base of classifications of Turkmenistan. The instruments of sectoral statistics are being developed as follows: - defining the structure of financial and banking accounts, the procedure for their presentation and publication, on the basis of international standards; - developing the methodology for constructing the key SNA accounts by economic sector: industry, income formation, income use, capital transactions; - developing new methods for accounts of GDP and its main components at constant prices, in US dollars for the period 1994 to 1995; - developing a survey programme for non-market services (health, education, government administration); - developing price statistics on capital construction, foreign trade and industrial production; - developing methodological indicators for calculating the provision of the population with consumer durables; - developing methods of data calculation according to the main indicators of capital construction; - developing the methodology for financial statistical calculations in accordance with UN and Eurostat recommendations; - developing methodological material for defining indicators on the labour force, employment and unemployment, in accordance with the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO); - developing a system of social indicators in accordance with international practice and taking account of regional conditions; - creating and extending the household network; - developing a methodology for converting to the recording of international migrations; - improving the statistical observation of private sector activity, through the introduction into statistical surveys of indicators for calculating GDP and operating the SNA. Constant co-ordination and mutual co-operation with international organisations is very important for the statistical reforms in Turkmenistan. Goskomstat of Turkmenistan is proceeding on the understanding that at the current stage of co-operation with international organisations efforts should be aimed at making maximum use of the potential of international organisations in statistical conversion to accepted international standards. Work has been carried out on three international projects: business registers, enterprise statistics and foreign trade. The main EU partner in these projects is the Netherlands Statistical Office (CBS). Goskomstat of Turkmenistan is formulating the specific orientations for international co-operation on the basis of the main statistical priorities resulting primarily from the radical changes in the state sector and the social and socio-economic environments, from the need for the statistical bodies to assimilate in the shortest possible time the full arsenal of current international statistical standards, from the past experience of foreign countries and from the search for ways of organising work and co-operation with all the regional submits of state statistics. * * * 134 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go DISCUSSANT WOLF SCOTT - ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR EUROPE 1. I have assisted the ECE with the organisation of workshops and other technical assistance in the domains of social and demographic statistics in an activity which is financially supported by Eurostat as well as UNDP and the Council of Europe. My interventions therefore will be from the social perspective, rather than an economic perspective. 2. A strong case can be made for standardisation, which is essential for the reasons mentioned by the chairman. I would however like also to discuss briefly the limits of standardisation and mention conflicts that can arise between the demands for standardisation of international agencies and national requirements. 3. I can do this more simply by distinguishing four aspects in which standardisation is applied in statistics: - definitions - classifications - methodology - concepts. 4. Not so many sources of conflict over the first three. Definitions may differ as between western and eastern European countries. Usually however there is a solution. Infant mortality whose definition still differs in some transition countries as compared with international standards, is an example. The solution is to use whatever definition is appropriate, but to describe when a figure is published the method and definition that is used, so there can be no confusion in comparisons. 5. In classifications, similarly, a compromise between west and transition countries is possible, for example, as suggested by CIS-STAT, using the four-digit classification for comparative purposes, and a fifth digit for national specificities. 6. There is however a major potential source of conflict between standardisation and national needs as regards concepts and indicators, in the social perhaps much more so than in the economic. Countries may find themselves between the devil (the international community) and the deep blue sea (national requirements) in this respect. Some examples were given, among them: Whereas in the west the labour force is divided into the employed and unemployed, a major category in transition economies are the underemployed (persons with full employment, but very little income and often spending little time on their work, those on permanent sick leave, etc). Distinction only between employed and unemployed would be confusing here. Another example is the use of hospital bed and doctor ratios to population. Such ratios could be acceptable in western countries, but in conditions as sometimes prevail in transition economies, where many doctors, though nominally registered as such, in fact do not work as doctors but do other work to supplement their incomes. Similarly many hospitals beds, though they are still counted and reported in statistics, remain empty because there is no food, heating or other care provided in some hospitals. The indicators could thus show apparent stability in conditions where the health care service has sadly declined. 7. The lesson of all this is that in the social sector at least international recommendations for standards should be carefully and critically scrutinised for their relevance to national conditions and accepted of rejected as appropriate. 135 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go DISCUSSANT MALCOLM WALMSLEY - OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION, UNITED KINGDOM I would like to thank the contributors for the papers they presented on international standards. Mr Ivanov from the CIS Statcommittee drew our attention to the very important role in implementing international standards in CIS countries not just from the formal and procedural points of view but also from the point of view of the work done in developing practical aspects of data and related issues. I think the progress made in developing and introducing international standards since 1991 is indeed quite remarkable and a very significant achievement for the statistical offices in your countries. We have heard in the papers that the 1993 SNA is being generally implemented and ILO standards have been implemented and price statistics for the retail price index which was perhaps initially in the transition process given priority. The IMF took a lead in this work in the early part of the transition process because of the importance of statistics for policy and economic management. In other areas the harmonised system is generally being introduced and it provides links to the SITC and provides a basis for other classifications, ISIC and NACE's progress being also very significant. Perhaps I would like to look at one or two other areas. The first concerns some organisational issues that are associated with the implementation of standards. In most areas of classifications, I think, considerable detailed expertise is required so that they are implemented successfully. In some specific areas, for example production industry classifications, the expertise is significant and needs specific resource requirements and they should not be underestimated. I ask the question: \"Can one statistician, for example, be an expert in every product produced by the industrial sector?\" And in some instances we need to do that and it is probably unrealistic. So, it will be useful to hear from the participants of their experiences in this area from an organisational point of view: - what training needs have to be undertaken, for example, to introduce PRODCOM and NACE? - have any old ladies that we talked about yesterday been retrained from the regions and districts? - are we, in fact, using staff resources efficiently? Another point I would like to draw out is to emphasise the importance that the contributors have drawn to the value and importance of international classifications. I think there is one area that we have not discussed and that is the important value of the adoption of international standards that provides for protecting statisticians from political interference. And the fact that an international standard has been adopted at the national level does enable the statistician to ensure that data are organised and presented in a harmonised and consistent manner and that it arguably also is an essential component in the maintenance of statistical integrity. In the UK there have been a couple of quite useful examples of this. First, statisticians were under pressure to amend the comparison and composition of the weighting structure of the retail price index following very high increases in the past in our mortgage interest rates. And the fact that the RPI was based on an international standard assisted quite significantly in resisting demands from politicians to change the system and to introduce different weighting structures. I think another example concerns the level of unemployment indicators in the UK. It has always been a very sensitive statistic in our country as it is in other countries. With the data being derived from administrative sources statistical consistency became rather difficult to ensure, following quite a large number of adjustments to administrative records and sources. And it did provide difficulties for the statisticians in reporting unemployment data. This led to the quarterly labour force survey in the UK which now plays a very important role and is based on international standards. It has also removed in 136 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go many areas the difficulties surrounding these particular statistics. It did provide us at the same time with a unique opportunity to understand the data from one survey approach and find new estimates based on the administrative data and to assess the predictive ability of sample survey technique. I also would like to emphasise the points made by Mr Scott that the classifications are very important and need to be used for national purposes. The classifications provide the statistical building blocks that enable statistics to be presented and analysed in a way that statisticians regard as meeting user needs. And the challenge therefore is to ensure that the aggregations of data using statistical classifications are in fact relevant to meet the needs of the national planners and users of data in the country. Within the framework of the GDP it is often criticised that this provides only one figure. The new SNA goes a long way in developing the role of GDP and providing much greater use of the system through the provision of satellite accounts and also development of Social Accounting Matrices. I think, therefore, the message I also wanted to reinforce is that although the international classifications are keys they must not be completely introduced at the expense of the requirements to meet national needs and standards. But within them there is plenty of scope for the provision of national needs to ensure that statistics are collected appropriately. So, where are we going? I found it very useful to hear the proposals, the indications in the papers presented, particularly from the CIS Statistical Committee, about the development in classifications in the industrial area. I think this is useful and significant. It is also of interest perhaps to understand where we are going today and to synthesise what we have actually achieved and learnt because what has been done, I think, has been quite remarkable. A forum such as this does provide a very useful opportunity for such a synthesis. Classifications need to be adopted and adapted to meet and reflect changes in the structure of the economy and society, and the work of the United Nations is very useful in taking a lead in this. I think one of the themes is how our experiences can be channelled possibly into adapting international standards to ensure that they are in subsequent revision, adequate and appropriate. This is an issue that, I think, we all need to be aware of and perhaps I would like to hear your views on that. Feedback is another issue on the classifications and we need to see how we are going to achieve such feedback. There are some other areas where more work needs to be done. In particular, the issue of improving data sources and data quality in line with international recommendations and classifications. The financial sector and capital accounts are particular areas one needs to be looking at. There are also problems with accounting standards in many countries which provide for considerable scope for quality data because the basic accounting standards are not necessarily clearly defined in terms of legislation. Again feed-back in this particular area I would find useful from participants. * * * COMMENTS, REPLIES AND AUDIENCE DISCUSSION COMMENTS VLADIMIR SOKOLIN - STATE COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS I asked to speak because a very interesting subject was touched upon in Mr Scott's contribution. This topic became the subject of a very stormy discussion in May this year in St Petersburg - not in this room, but at the International Conference on Employment Problems. Mr Scott approached this problem diplomatically but did not refer to it by name. 137 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go At the conference, this problem was mentioned by our colleagues from Central and Eastern European countries, and from the Baltic states. It was formulated as the problem of determining by an international standard secondary, or as we called it, informal employment. Unfortunately, this standard is not currently contained in the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation. I must say that for Russia it is a very serious problem. Currently, we are unfortunately not in a position to measure secondary employment statistically, since we have not even managed to solve this problem as far as definitions are concerned. The discussion was very interesting and lasted a whole day. There were very interesting proposals, especially that of the representative from Scotland who unobtrusively tried to suggest to us how to go about measuring the phenomenon. However, we in the Russian Federation have possibly gone a long way already. We have called in the Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Labour and set up a scientific group which is to provide us by the end of the year with a scientific definition of what we wish to measure. This is very important since from the experience from the household budget survey we know that there are cases where a person is listed as having one job but in actual fact he or she has two, three, four or even five jobs. But you yourselves understand that measuring statistically what so far has not been defined is nonsensical. This is why we have followed what may be a difficult path but the completion of the first task will help us to supplement the standards we sometimes do not find in currently existing international recommendations. I shall not go into details but there are specialists here who were in New York in April this year who know that some countries raised before the UN Statistical Commission the question of the need for drafting definitions of poverty and destitution. However, for some reason or other which may be understood by those present here, this proposal was not approved. At the same time, I know that the Economic Commission for Latin America took upon itself the task of organising an International Conference on this problem next year to try to give statisticians at least some idea of what should be measured and how. All of you know all too well that this problem is most important and complex, especially for the countries with transition economies. We came up against this not too long ago - perhaps four or five years ago. I can say that here in Russia we have still not got a standard for defining poverty. We currently use indicators such as the subsistence minimum, although we are well aware that it has many defects. In this discussion I would like to back up Mr Walmsley as well, who said that naturally, international standards were a good thing. But from our statistical practice it should not be overlooked that we to some degree or other have to solve problems all the time at national level. That is why, taking advantage of the fact that we are all gathered here together as friends and colleagues dealing with a common misfortune called statistics, we should say once more that international standards are a good thing but life in each of our countries creates its own problems and the contacts we have here allow us to deal with these problems together instead of in isolation. C O M M E N T S: N O EL A T C H E R L EY - S T A T I S T I C AL A D V I S ER TO T HE R U S S I AN F E D E R A T I O N, INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND I would just like to comment on the point made by Mr Scott and also elaborated in Mr Sokolin's remarks about this question on the extent to which you should follow the international standards. 138 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go I think in the areas which Mr Scott mentioned and which were elaborated by Mr Sokolin it is quite right to think there are real problems with some particular standard. Then you may want to compile statistics on some different basis. But I would like to strike a slightly more different note in relation to the standards for key macroeconomic statistics which are well established and well developed in areas like national accounts, balance of payments, CPI, monetary statistics, government finance statistics. I do not think it would be desirable to give the impression that you should choose round the definition of GDP or the budget deficit, or the definition of international reserves. If you do that, then it becomes completely impossible to compare your statistics with those of other countries and completely impossible to aggregate them into world data; that would create major confusion both within your country and with international organisations and other countries dealing with your country. So, I mean I fully agree with the comments of Mr Scott and Mr Sokolin concerning particular areas, components and indicators, but I think you should strive very strongly to compile data as closely as you can to international standards in these key fields of economic statistics. If you feel that there are some problems with that in relation to national users within your country, then compile a supplementary concept or definition. I do not think it is good enough to choose your own definition on GDP and then have to say that it does not agree with international standards. If you want to do that you need to say where it disagrees and the amount of the difference if you can. And in that context some of you would be aware of the IMF data dissemination standards which we might talk about at some other time. Those of you whose countries subscribe to those standards would be obliged to show all departures from international standards of any significance. So, I would like to give a slightly different perspective even if I am sure Mr Sokolin and Mr Scott will agree to these key well established fields of macroeconomic statistics. And of course, I do not think any country in the world follows a hundred percent all international statistical standards. Some areas are not entirely feasible, some are not entirely relevant, but if it is much different from international standard, you might want to do something different in your own country. I would strongly urge that you compile data on the basis of international standards for the purpose of comparison and give them to international organisations for aggregation into world totals. COMMENTS MIKHAIL BELKINDAS - STATISTICAL ADVISOR, INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT, THE WORLD BANK I would like to make some comments starting with Mr Ivanov's paper. I think it was a beautiful description of the ways statistical systems went and of the problems with international standards still occurring. But I want to elaborate a little on the issue which Mr Ivanov raised, namely financial accounts. Here we come immediately to the problem of dealing with government finance statistics. The International Monetary Fund is doing a very good job in helping the Ministries of Finance of the countries in transition with the government finance statistics but we understand that this is a very difficult task. It will be years until the countries in transition will have government finance statistics in conformity with international standards, because for different reasons the Ministries of Finance at some points are very slow at moving towards those standards. We know some reasons as well, one of them being that sometimes they do not want to do it because there is a way of mixing all kinds of expenditures and thus creating problems. 139 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go What I want to say is that the introduction of full national accounts in the format of international standards will take a certain period of time. This is really a goal but the statisticians alone will not be able to solve this problem if other partners in the Government are not co-operative. Another comment concerns the point addressed in Mr Gaybullaev's paper, when he was talking about the technical assistance which they would like to get from international organisations so as to bring their statistics up to international standard. I want to say that the World Bank still does not have a program in Tajikistan. But I think that when we start working in Tajikistan there will not be any problems in giving some technical assistance to this country as we do in other countries in transition. COMMENTS TOM GRIFFIN - DIRECTOR, STATISTICAL DIVISION, ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR EUROPE I should like to refer back to what a couple of people were saying about following definitions and the difficulty in following definitions. I would like to put in the strongest plea for a clear description of methodology and a clear description of any departure from international standards when national statistical offices are publishing data. In well established statistical offices this is one of the prime features of their data. I have compared in the past the statistics produced by government statistical services with statistics produced by private companies and I have noticed one of the major differences between them, namely, that with the official statistics you do know what you are guessing. In other words they do very clearly define the strengths and weaknesses of their data and the extent to which they follow well-known classifications. And I have noticed and, like many others, have been impressed with the way that in many newly independent states there have been produced more and more statistics for the last five years. But the one thing which is often lacking from those publications is a clear definition of what the statistics are in terms of the classification systems they follow, the methodology they use, the strengths and weaknesses of those data. We notice it, particularly in international organisations where we are trying to compare data and to publish data from various countries. Often it is impossible to do that because, although we find figures in books produced by statistical offices, we do not really know what they mean and nobody does. So, this is a strong plea for defining what you do. M O D E R A T OR R O B E RT V AN E CK - O R G A N I S A T I ON F OR E C O N O M IC C O - O P E R A T I ON A ND DEVELOPMENT I would like to summarise a few things. One question on international standards concerned the extent to which they should be applied and I think there was some consensus on the use of standards in key areas of economics for defining, for example, social indicators such as poverty where international standards may be less clear. I was also following Mr Griffin and other people who observed that in whichever case we deviate from standards it is highly desirable to describe the deviations. I think major advances in implementation of standards have been made in the area of national accounts. At the same time the implementation of the SNA made it possible to compare existing data 140 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go from different sources.

        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go MODERATOR HEIKKI SALMI - EUROSTAT The theme of this session is \"Modernisation of data collection, survey methods, use of sampling techniques, use of registers, use of administrative sources\". I think that this is a very important area for your countries as well as for western countries, because the world is changing and this is an area where new techniques are coming in together with new problems. I have tried to list some of the key questions in this area: - The first is whether data collection should be centralised or decentralised. - An important question is how to motivate the respondents to answer the questionnaires, since there seems to be very much reluctance to answer them. We should also consider how to lower the response burden in general. - Another question concerns the role of full-scale observation methods and sample surveys. In your case it is a question of moving from exhaustive surveys to sample surveys. - How to use and develop registers (e.g. the business register for sample surveys), and how to use administrative data and administrative registers in data collection. - Finally, which modern data collection methods should we invest in? For instance, electronic data collection? Direct access to the data sources of data-suppliers? At the beginning of this week we talked about very typical current issues for Eurostat: how to develop EDI and GESMES messages and how to use them in data collection. One of the topical issues in your countries is the hidden economy. I think that this problem which is linked to the data collection problems is enormous. New methods should be developed to overcome them. SPEAKER JUMAKADYR AKENEEV - CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL STATISTICAL COMMITTEE, KYRGHYZSTAN Improvement of data collection: Survey methods, use of sampling technology, use of registers, use of administrative sources I would like to begin by saying how very grateful I am to the Director-General of Eurostat, Yves Franchet, the organisers of this seminar, including the Chairman of the CIS Statistical Committee, Mikhail Korolev, and the Chairman of the State Statistical Committee of the Russian Federation, Yury Yurkov. and the Tacis co-ordinators for inviting the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic and for providing it with generous financial assistance. I shall talk about the work being done by the statistical bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic to improve the methods and procedures for the collection of statistical information. Because of the complexity and varied nature of the matters which have to be resolved during the Republic's transition to a different economic model, there is a need for a varied approach to the organisation of statistical observation. The priorities for the development of accounting and statistics in our Republic are set out in the State Programme for the transition of the Kyrgyz Republic to the accepted international system of accounting and statistics. The Programme shows where we are now and where we are heading. 145 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The economy's move to market conditions, the intensive development of the non-State sector, the establishment of market infrastructure and other completely new phenomena in the current reform of statistics require the use of new methods of statistical observation and the development of fundamentally different, system characteristics and economic indicators. This also means bringing the methods for the formation of statistical information into line with the standards used by developed countries with a market economy and by international organisations. Of the very many different aspects of statistical observation, the most important are the reflection of the qualitative and quantitative changes in the Republic's economy from the standpoint of: - rapid restoration of the Republic's general economic development; - observation of the market transformation processes (creation of market conditions, changes in the qualitative nature of the economic system and its various elements); - ensuring economic and social stability (conditions showing the seriousness of the socio-economic situation). Statistical information on economic units in the Republic is collected through State and Government- Department statistical surveys. The staff of enterprises, institutions and organisations assist when major and particularly important State statistical surveys are conducted. Statistical information is collected by means of exhaustive, sample and one-off statistical surveys. The main sources used in the Republic are reports, questionnaires, declarations, censuses and enquiries. The majority of economic units in the Kyrgyz Republic are in the agricultural sector. Statistical observation of the agricultural sector was exhaustive before the transition to a market economy; sample surveys accounted for less than 1% of observation. , However, considerable changes began to take place in the structure of agricultural enterprises during the early '90s as a result of agricultural reform. Collective farms and State farms are being broken up, and new, relatively small enterprises are being created. These enterprises have new organisational and legal forms and differ in their production size indicators. Nonetheless, there has been little change in the ways in which statistical observation of the state of the agricultural sector is organised. The main form of observation remains statistical reporting by agricultural enterprises. The number of small farms/holdings - either collective or individual - has risen sharply during the reform of the agricultural sector in the Kyrgyz Republic. The collection of exhaustive statistical information for such holdings is not warranted, as there is a large number of them and they represent a very low proportion of agricultural production. The activity of economic units in agriculture is observed using sample surveys, as well as through the traditional exhaustive surveys. The documents on unit accounting have been revised and standardised. They contain the indicators describing the production activity of smallholdings, independent farms and private subsidiary plots. In order to obtain a more detailed and comprehensive picture of the state and development of the agricultural sector, exhaustive censuses must be carried out once every five and ten years. 146 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The type of agricultural census conducted in the Republic is the annual census (counting) of livestock. The main aims of this census are to obtain objective statistical information on livestock breeding production by holding category and to define more precisely the territorial location and production specialisation. I would like to talk about a number of problems which have a significant bearing on the reform of statistics in the agricultural sector. We are faced with the task of establishing a common methodology for calculating the production and yields of households. The calculation methodology currently in use, which is based on relative indicators of the production yield of households averaged over one hundred families (using the data of budget surveys), distorts the data and makes the calculation for the, overall population unreliable because the families are not sufficiently representative and varied. In order to solve these problems, the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic proposes to examine the possibility of developing and introducing a single statistical report for all economic units on the land, to be divided by indicators between two presentation dates (1 June and 1 January). A single report collected from all categories of units will make it possible to use a system of qualifications based on a set of characteristics in order to classify units in the appropriate population. It will also make it possible to develop various groupings and tables in order to study problems of interest in the various categories of units. In addition, it will be possible to use the data from the single statistical report, with computer assistance, to obtain forecast data on crop yields and livestock numbers and to monitor changes in the renewal of the main stocks in the agricultural sector. The system of State and government-department statistics on the overall circulation of commodities, which developed over several decades, has proved unsuitable for market economy conditions. The previous monthly survey of data in the retail trade had many shortcomings and did not provide information on newly formed enterprises. A twin approach is now taken to statistical observation, with the simultaneous use of exhaustive statistical accounting and sample surveys. In the case of commercial enterprises which are registered but which do not report, a 10-15% sample of observation units is taken using a simple mechanical sampling technique. A 10% sample from the ranked series means the selection of every tenth enterprise, and a 15% sample means the selection of every sixth or seventh enterprise. The selected enterprises are subject to monthly reporting on turnover, stocks and the sale of individual goods. The data obtained through sampling are grossed up. Using the town markets of the sample group of towns, the statistical services conduct systematic daily observation of the volumes of agricultural produce supplied and register the prices once every month. This information is used to calculate the total value of sales of produce at markets in these towns over the month. In order to find out the total turnover of the markets, a special survey of the volumes of produce supplied and of the prices is carried out once every year in all markets in the Republic. The turnover of the markets covered by systematic accounting is calculated as a proportion of the total turnover in all markets. The data from this accounting of the volumes of produce supplied and of the prices are used to determine total sales of goods for all markets covered by systematic sample surveys. The resulting coefficient (proportion) of turnover in the markets studied is used to calculate the turnover of the whole group of markets. 147 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go It is extremely difficult - or practically impossible - for accounting to cover the informal market, in other words the sale of mostly non-food goods imported from the CIS and non-CIS countries, not included in the volume of foreign trade activity and sold by private individuals through free trade. The volume of these sales is calculated using the data of budget statistics by taking the volume of purchases from private individuals as the volume of purchases on the informal market. Statistics are currently being collected on the volume of sales by individual citizens (physical persons) of consumer goods and on the prices of these goods at non-food, mixed and food markets. Observation covers district (rayon) and urban markets which operate on plots of land specially assigned for this purpose. Two or three non-food markets are surveyed in each region. The observation is conducted on two days per quarter, one of which must be a working day and the other a non-working day. The main categories of goods offered by the largest number of sellers at the market are chosen for the survey. The data from the survey (average volume of sales per place of trade) are extrapolated to cover the months in which the market is not surveyed, on the basis of the number of places of trade. In the subsequent months, the average proceeds for one place of trade are corrected in line with the price index. Of all the surveys conducted, the household (family) budget surveys are generally recognised to be important. The survey materials provide unique comprehensive information on the population's standard of living, its social strata and types of household, showing the breakdown by sex and age of the members of the family, the activity in the various sectors of the economy of those who are fit for work, the state and change in the level and composition of income and expenditure, and the consumption and savings of the various population groups. The budgets of households (families) have been surveyed by territory and sector since 1952 in the Kyrgyz Republic. The main feature of the survey's methodology is that households of manual workers, white-collar 'workers and peasants (collective-farm workers) were selected from their population for observation using the standard proportional two-stage sampling method. To start with, enterprises and organisations were selected from a series ranked by average wage level, and then, from these enterprises and organisations, the same wage-level characteristic was used to select the manual and white-collar workers whose households were to be observed. Virtually the same sampling approach was used to organise the survey of the households of collective-farm workers. Consequently, it was not the households which were selected from the corresponding population groups, but the household members working in enterprises or organisations of a given sector of the economy. This sampling approach did not take account of the distribution of the population and the labour force by region. Households with two or three workers in enterprises or organisations had a correspondingly greater chance of being selected for the survey. This systematically distorted the representativeness of the survey results. The Republic's household budget survey is currently being conducted using the old form of sampling by territory and sector, although the sampling approach changed fundamentally in 1994, with the result that the households which are no longer covered by the survey for one reason or another are now replaced on an exclusively territorial basis. 1 100 households, representing 0.1% of the population, are currently being covered by survey in the Republic. Financial constraints are the main reason for such a small survey population. The National 148 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic proposes developing a new survey programme based on the specific characteristics of daily life of the Republic's population, and expanding the network of survey households to 5 000, which will be equivalent to 0.5% of the population and will be in line with accepted world standards. The expansion of the network of survey households will provide more detailed and more reliable information on the situation in the Republic and will make it possible to monitor changes in the population's standard of living and to provide a more detailed analysis of the indicators obtained. One of the shortcomings of this sampling is the failure to represent the households of various types of entrepreneurs, tenants, fanners, co-operative workers and other people employed in the new structures of the market economy. By and large, these are people on a high income, with a corresponding standard of living, pattern of consumption, housing situation, etc. An objective assessment of the results of the sample surveys of households before the Republic's transition to a market economy reveals that surveys conducted by sampling largely on the basis of territory and sector met the needs of State bodies and government departments for the corresponding information. However, given the developing market conditions, the methods used to organise sample household surveys require major improvement, mainly by employing better sampling methods which can provide representative data on the standard of living in the Republic and its constituent regions. This can be achieved by using territorial sampling. In order to calculate the households to be included in the sample population for each region, it is essential to take account of the ratio between the urban and rural populations, the standard of living in relation to the economic development of the region, the environment, climate, ecology, and certain other conditions affecting the population. In order to collect social information on the whole population by means of territorial samples of households, use is made of material on the overall population of these households, obtained through periodic exhaustive and small-scale population censuses. A 5% sample, socio-demographic survey (small-scale census) was conducted in 1994 in the Kyrgyz Republic. The sample survey of the population covered 215 300 members of the permanent population (51 000 households). On average, there are 4.3 people in each household in the Republic. This was the first time that the Republic's population censuses and surveys used the \"household\" as the unit, in line with international statistical practice, and marked a change from the use of the \"family\" in surveys by statistical bodies prior to the Republic's transition to a market economy. The method employed to obtain a population sample was the random selection of cases using the 1989 population census materials. In accordance with the calculations, every 20th case was selected, in other words 5% of the total number. Then, the location and borders of each selected accounting area of the 1989 population census were determined and used to create accounting areas for carrying out a sample survey of the population. This ensured that the sample population was representative and corresponded with the material of the 1989 census, account being taken of natural movement and migration. For the statistical bodies, the sample socio-demographic population survey was good practice for the universal population census which is to be carried out in the Kyrgyz Republic in 1999 in line with UN recommendations. As censuses are expensive, they are generally carried out once every ten years. In the period between censuses, administrative records are used as the source for demographic statistics on the population. 149 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go There are peculiarities about the collection and processing of information on the population. The information arrives directly from people and covers each person and each demographic event (birth, death, wedding, divorce, migration). The data are processed on the basis of individual primary accounting documents concerning the natural movement of the population, its migration, its size by sex and age, and tables of the birth rate, death rate and life expectancy. A country's real riches are its people. In order to assess their life conditions, social statistics survey social phenomena in the lives of the population. In addition to the exhaustive method of surveying enterprises and organisations of the social infrastructure, sample surveys are conducted on various subjects. These include the development of education, women's work and daily life, young people, students, the training of university specialists, ecology, the social protection of the disadvantaged sections of the population, and medical care for the population. Women make up half the population of the Kyrgyz Republic and are playing a key role in shaping the economic and social conditions of the future. The current changes have made the lives of certain groups of women not just become difficult, but also tragic in some cases. Elderly, unemployed women with many children, as well as young people, have found themselves in a particularly vulnerable position under the new economic conditions which replaced the command economy. Consequently, a sociological study entitled \"women of Kyrgyzstan\" has been conducted in an attempt to determine the effects of the economic and social changes on vulnerable groups of women (elderly women, single mothers, mothers with many children, women who have recently become unemployed, and women students). The socio-economic changes affecting these women are a valuable source of information needed to take decisions on social assistance, State intervention and future planning for the population as a whole. The study was undertaken using qualitative methods in conjunction with the quantitative survey approach. More than 600 women were surveyed. Of this sample, 572 women filled in the questionnaire, which contained 47 questions. The respondents, aged between 17 and 70 years, included representatives of all the main ethnic groups in the Republic and people resident in towns, villages, mountain areas and valleys. Approximately 5% of the women studied took part in an interview lasting 3-4 hours. Eight interviewers took part in the survey. Respondents were chosen from both official and unofficial sources, including local employment offices, pension fund departments, the social services and local authorities. They were recruited at markets and kiosks, through the local press, in mosques and churches, as well as through the interviewers' personal contacts in the various regions of the Republic. Data on activity and remuneration by type of activity and by region, obtained from the exhaustive survey of enterprises and organisations, have a wide range of uses. The present system of collecting and processing current returns on employment was established in 1991 in response to the need to obtain monthly data on worker remuneration. The methods of obtaining information had to be reviewed because of the major increase in the number of accounting units over recent years as a result of the structural reforms in the economy. 150 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go This revealed the need to prepare for the changeover to using sample surveys for collecting monthly information on employment. The sample set of enterprises will be formed using standard sampling in each of the groups on the basis of the indicators under study. Work is planned to start in the second half of 1996. When special sample surveys are conducted, the sampling is based on the type of activity being surveyed and, as the Republic is small but has many territorial units, the sector being surveyed is usually represented in the survey by one enterprise or institution. Price statistics are one of the key priorities during the establishment of a market economy. The primary information basis for these statistics, obtained for each place of sale of goods and services, is used to calculate the consumer price index in accordance with international conceptual and methodological standards. Price information is collected between the 5th and 25th of each month. Data are collected on the prices of each good at all trading outlets and markets. It is particularly important that the composition of the sample of trading outlets selected for the collection of data is representative. The enterprises which provide the population with the greatest number of types of service are selected as the basic enterprises in the service sector. In order to calculate the consumer price index, a basket of consumer goods is used comprising 305 items which represent the range of goods and services available to the population in all parts of the Republic. The selection of representative goods and services means the selection of a specific good or service of a particular type (sort, brand, type, dimensions, purpose, etc.) from the total population of goods or services of this type according to its (consumption) purpose. When the prices for a specific good or service are recorded, one of the most important criteria is the maximum demand for the good/service in question, i.e. typical consumption. In order to calculate aggregate producer price indices for industrial goods by sector, the prices of representative goods manufactured by industrial enterprises are recorded every month. The observation of changes in producer prices is carried out by statistical bodies using the sample network of basic (reference) enterprises. The following factors are taken into account when selecting enterprises for inclusion in the list of basic enterprises: - the most typical enterprises in the sector are included, in accordance with the sector's share of the total volume of industrial output; - small as well as large enterprises are included; - all forms of ownership are covered. In order to be selected, an article must have been produced for a relatively long period of time and have a dominant position in the total production of the group of goods concerned. If the move towards a market economy and the liberalisation of prices are accompanied by the maintenance of the system of producers' monopolies, inflation is the inevitable result. Under such conditions, it is particularly important to determine price indices and the amount of work being completed in the construction industry. 151 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Price indices are used to examine changes in output and structure at macro level, to determine the economic effectiveness of capital investment and to calculate balances, gross domestic product and national income. Every month, data are collected and processed on changes in the prices of purchases of building materials, changes in the prices of equipment already installed at building sites are monitored, and the price indices for capital investment are calculated, as is the amount of contract work. The data from surveys of economic units concerning the construction of trading establishments, public catering establishments, religious buildings and offices are used to calculate the fundamentals of the shadow economy and to obtain a complete calculation of investment development. The emergence of new market structures, the closing of enterprises and their privatisation, together with the extensive observation of the activity of industrial economic units, made it necessary to use sample survey methods. Every month, information is gathered on the activity of small private enterprises and co operatives with up to 20 employees. The results are used to calculate production output in the Republic. Accounting also covers all other non-industrial economic units whose balance sheets contain industrial subdivisions engaged in the manufacture of industrial products or the provision of industrial services. The volume of industrial output also includes the industrial activity of the self-employed. Their production is included in the totals from the questionnaire-based observation of the nation's industrial activity. The most important indicator of market conditions is the index of the physical volume of production for industry as a whole and by sector, which is calculated from the trend in the manufacture of specific representative goods, followed by their aggregation by comparison with the corresponding period of the previous year and with the previous period of the reporting year. The process of denationalisation in the transport sector is being accompanied by the establishment of small businesses and consequent increase in the number of small-scale vehicle-operators and the emergence of owners of goods vehicles with a licence to transport goods on a commercial basis. The growth in the amount of work done by such enterprises and the lack of corresponding statistical observation mean that there is an ever increasing need to establish the volume of transport operations conducted by them. Under these conditions, the only realistic way of assessing the volume of freight and passenger carriage by small-scale road transport firms is to conduct sample surveys of their transport activities and then to calculate the volume of freight and passenger movements. The sample for this observation is formed from the population of all owners of goods vehicles, buses and cars who are licensed to engage in commercial activity according to the data of the Republic's Transport Inspectorate. Sampling for sample observation is carried out with due regard to seasonal factors. Foreign trade statistics are extremely important for analysing today's economy and are used to establish national and international indicators. Foreign trade statistics are used to compile the Republic's trade balance and balance of payments and for the system of national accounts. 152 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Foreign trade statistics are based on customs statistics for non-CIS countries and full-scale surveys of economic units for CIS countries, using the single foreign-trade goods classification and the classifications of the world's countries and territories, types of currency and types of delivery. The results of foreign trade statistics are analysed using indices which make it possible to isolate part of the turnover volume from the influence of prices and which establish a new, more accurate diagnosis of trade development. Given the establishment of the Customs Union between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan as agreed by these countries, it is proposed to conduct statistical observation of foreign trade flows using the mirror statistics method. The abolition of customs accounting and customs formalities at the internal borders between these countries means that their statistical services will have to carry out monthly accounting of trade between these countries. To this end, it will be necessary to study the \"Intrastat\" system, which is designed to reduce as much as possible the burden on individual enterprises by introducing thresholds for transactions. In the current situation, national statistical registers are extremely important in the reform of statistical observation. The Single State Register of Statistical Units (EGRSE) has been developed and introduced in order to create a database covering all enterprises, institutions, public associations and other economic units (without exception), regardless of their form of ownership and management. The Register is based on the former Ail-Union Classifier of Enterprises and Organisations (OKPO). The Single State Register is used to establish sectoral catalogues for carrying out exhaustive and sample statistical surveys. The use of the Single State Statistical Register as the survey population is based on the following: - the Register's organisational system; - the procedure for registering and identifying enterprises; - the procedure by which changes in their structure, organisational and legal form and form of ownership are entered in the Register; - the procedure for winding up enterprises; - the content of the information resources, which include data on the main indicators of economic statistics. Accordingly, the Single State Register, as the Republic's specially organised list of enterprises, represents the population of enterprises because it contains the whole set of enterprises at a given moment in time (or for a given period of time) and because enterprises do not appear twice in the list; in other words there is no double counting. The State register, as the population of enterprises, can be used for various purposes: - for structural analysis of the population being studied; - to determine the size of the sample population; 153 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - to form the basis for sampling; - for grossing up sample data. The methodology for forming a sample population for each specific survey is based on the structural analysis of the overall population, which includes: - the selection of specific characteristics of importance for the aims of the survey (territory, sector, form of ownership, type of activity, organisational and legal form, main economic statistics indicators); - the establishment of the quantitative relationship between the values of the strata forming the overall population on the basis of these characteristics. The value of the population's size is essential for determining (calculating) the size of the sample and its breakdown into strata. The establishment of the frame, i.e. the listing of the overall population in a particular order, is an important stage before the selection of the observation units. When the data are grossed up, the corresponding values for the population are calculated on the basis of the structural relationships which apply when the survey is concluded. The Single State Register is operated in co-operation with the information processing systems of the Revenue and Customs Inspectorates, the National Bank, the State Property Association, the State Agency for Monitoring Operations with Securities, the State Insurance Inspectorate, the State Commission on Foreign and Economic Assistance, the Ministry of Justice and a number of other ministries and government departments of the Republic. The main aims of establishing interaction between the Single State Register and the registers of ministries and government departments are to conduct full and reliable accounting of the economic units established and operating on the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic, to ensure the compatibility of the information in the registers of government departments with a view to obtaining economic indicators, and to create a single information area in the Kyrgyz Republic. A single classification and codification system is used to encode the information of the Single State Register and for interaction between the State Register and the registers of government departments. Each unit in the Single State Register is identified using a unique 8-character code, which does not change throughout the unit's period of activity and which is not re-allocated if the unit is wound up. The Register's information stock contains identification, classification, reference and economic data. It should be emphasised that the Register is an instrument for further developing the Republic's national statistics, that it is the basis for conducting statistical observation, for sample survey methods and for developing new approaches to the production of statistics on enterprises, and that it is the stepping stone to the new information technologies. The State Register is used to form the catalogue of reporting economic units on the basis of financial statistics. Financial statistics are compiled by full-scale statistical observation. The Register's range of application has made it possible to resolve such problems as the introduction of integrated programmes for drafting the manpower resources balance sheet, as well as expanding the results tables of annual labour statistics, etc. 154 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Information from a number of ministries and government departments is used to update the Single State Register: - from the State Insurance Inspectorate: the inventory of companies licensed to work in the area of insurance; - from the State Agency for Monitoring Operations with Securities and the State Property Association: the inventory of joint-stock companies, investment funds, commodity and raw materials exchanges and stock exchanges, and the lists of issuers of securities; - from the National Bank: the list of banks, foreign exchange offices and pawnshops with a licence to operate; - from the Revenue Inspectorate and the Social Fund: the list of taxpayers; - from the Ministry of Health: the list of economic units licensed to provide medical services to the public. The harmonisation of national statistical registers means that the data of the revenue services on the level of actual budgetary receipts can be used to calculate the balance of the population's income and expenditure and for the monthly calculation of gross domestic product, as well as to analyse budget receipts by region. The data on the gross income of physical persons engaged in trade and services for the public are used to calculate the gross output of households and to correct analytical data obtained through the family budget survey. The information of the National Bank is used in the balance of payments and in the system of national accounts to calculate the \"rest of the world\" account and the balance of the population's monetary income and expenditure. The report on the implementation of the Social Fund budget is used to calculate social transfers. The monthly report of the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic \"On the Socio- Economic Situation in the Republic\" is drawn up using data of the State Property Association, the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank, the revenue services and the Treasury, the State Agency for Monitoring Operations with Securities, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The data of the Customs Inspectorate on the export and import of goods to and from CIS and non-CIS countries are also used every month in the above-mentioned report. The quarterly data on foreign trade and the data on informal trade (shuttle trading) are used in drawing up the balance of payments. The following conclusions can be drawn from the points made above: Exhaustive observation in the form of reporting is the basic and almost universal way of obtaining the most comprehensive statistical information. However, the transition to market conditions and the introduction of economically independent units have significantly changed the stereotypes in the organisation of State statistics and statistical observation. The ratio of exhaustive to non-exhaustive forms of statistical observation is in the process of changing. The move from exhaustive observation to various forms of non-exhaustive observation, the application of the stratum-qualification principle, and the removal of a large group of small enterprises (for which strict regulation through statistical reporting is completely unacceptable) are all perfectly sound. 155 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The appearance of a large number of small enterprises in various sectors of the economy has led to a sharp increase in the scale, diversity and dynamics of observed populations. In many cases, it is impossible to use the system of full-scale reporting. Given the difficulties with reporting, it is quite understandable that more interest is being shown in the methods of non-exhaustive statistical observation. However, this is not without its difficulties. It is necessary to implement these methods on a large scale and to increase their share of observation to an optimum level in line with the current state of the economy and the statistical service. In order to organise non-exhaustive observation, it is necessary to have prior information for a specific period in the past on the population under study. The minimum amount of information is the size of the population, but the more information there is and the more reliable it is, the more effectively the methods can be applied. The best option is perhaps the combination of non-exhaustive observation with periodic censuses specifying the characteristics to be covered by non-exhaustive observation. In order to make additional economic calculations so as to further improve the coverage and measurement of statistical indicators, it is also necessary to use periodic non-exhaustive observation in the form of economic censuses and household budget surveys. The increasing possibilities offered by computers are fundamentally changing information processing technology and are making it possible to use labour-intensive methods of non-exhaustive observation. It follows from the above that there is a future for non-exhaustive observation methods. The main priorities for the use of such methods are as follows: 1. development of methods of targeted sampling; 2. further improvement of methods for collecting prior information on the population under study; 3. use of multidimensional non-exhaustive observation methods; 4. development of a system for using national statistical registers. Colleagues and participants in the statistical seminar of the Tacis countries, this is the situation with regard to the collection of statistical information in the Kyrgyz Republic and the direction in which it is moving. Many unresolved problems remain, and these will have to be tackled by the statistical services of the Republic in close co-operation with Eurostat and other statistical bodies of the world community in order to further improve the methods of non-exhaustive observation against the background of the transition to market conditions. Thank you for your attention. * * * SPEAKER BADAMTSEDENGIIN TSEND-AYUSH - CHAIRMAN OF THE STATE STATISTICAL OFFICE, MONGOLIA Modernisation of the data collection system in Mongolia Where we were The existing system and organisation of statistical services in Mongolia was set up under a centralised planning and administrative system of management on the basis of full-scale observation within a 156 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go regional network. Former statistical and accounting systems included a large number of reports, aimed at evaluating the execution of long-term and short-term plans. It was based on methodology appropriate for the planning agencies and was used for managing the economy. A uniform reporting system was applied which required regular reports to be collected from all enterprises. For example, harvest reports were collected every ten days. There was a regulation that each enterprise had to submit its annual bookkeeping balance sheet to the Ministry of Finance, the State Statistical Office (SSO) and the relevant ministry. Recently, the SSO carried out a survey whose main purpose was to find out how the former statistical indicator system in Mongolia was different from international standards. For this we estimated our statistics according to the methodology provided by the UN Statistical Division and other agencies, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The results showed that out of all indicators presented in main international statistical publications 60 percent were available for Mongolia and 20 percent were comparable with international standards. However, there is a need to re-estimate those indicators according to the appropriate methodology. From the above-mentioned survey we concluded that 20 percent of indicators were not provided by the SSO. There is a lack of primary data available for their estimation. On the basis of the survey results, we started the implementation of the Programme for Transition to international standard statistics. Where we are The transition to a market economy, intensive development of the public sector, the establishment of the infrastructure and the new phenomena occurring in the Mongolian economy, have led to the application of new methods of data collection and reorganisation of statistical activities. Following the need to change the accounting and statistical system in accordance with the new conditions, the Government specified in its programme of activities that 'in order to manage the national economy under market economy conditions, a new national accounting and statistical system is to be set up\". The \"Law on Statistics\" passed by the Mongolian Parliament at the beginning of 1994 sets the legal background for statistical activities. It provides the basis for the creation of well-organised statistical systems at the central and local level, on the basis of a common methodology, and improves the supply of the necessary statistical information to administrative bodies. In accordance with this law. the central and local statistical bodies have a right to select tasks relating to: - collecting information to be provided by all legal and physical persons, - collecting information from all financial, banking, tax, customs and other government agencies, - specifying the flow and volume of statistical information. The next nationally important document on the co-ordination of economic, financial and statistical activities was the \"State Programme for Conversion to a System of International Statistics and Methodology\". This Programme was approved by Mongolian Government Decree at the beginning of 1994. State Programme This programme has been targeted on the next 3-4 years, and it will create the background for the following activities: - widening the representativeness of the socio-economic sphere in all statistical indicators; 157 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - improving techniques used for conducting surveys on the basis of business registers of enterprises with different kinds of ownership: conversion from simply using a reporting system to using sample surveys; - developing on a co-operation basis primary data from accounting, financial, banking and customs reports and converting them into a system of statistical indicators in line with international standards; - clarifying the structure of statistical indicators, their frequency and form of presentation. In order to implement this programme, the SSO is involved in the following activities: - compilation of the System of National Accounts (SNA); - development of intersectoral balances in accordance with the SNA methodology; - reorganisation of financial, budget, banking, external trade and customs statistics; - conversion of statistics on consumer prices, population, labour and living standards to international standards; - revision of accounting and banking reports; - creation of business registers for enterprises of all types of ownership and activity; - development and introduction of international standard classifications and coding systems; - basic and further training for specialist staff; - strengthening of international co-operation in the field of statistics. The SSO intends to replace the current statistical reporting system with efficient methods involving non-uniform systems such as sample surveys and the creation of business registers. In our opinion, this will provide the opportunity to collect more accurate and timely information at less cost, more quickly and using fewer labour resources. We carry out some sample surveys on a regular basis as well as special one-off surveys. We are placing greater emphasis on sample surveys in the industrial and agricultural sectors. This means we select approximately one thousand basic enterprises which provide a true depiction of the whole industrial sector of Mongolia. Consumer and producer prices are being surveyed on a regular basis. The method used for sample surveys dealing with aspects of birth rate and employment statistics needs further development. In the wake of the transformation to a market economy, the existence of different forms of business activities, problems of social insurance in some population groups, the analysis of other social development indicators, and the need for differentiated approaches towards the study of the cost and standard of living, we have a few problems in developing new household budget statistics. The current household budget survey covers 1 800 households in Mongolia. Last year the SSO, with the World Bank's assistance, conducted the \"Living standards measurement survey\". Recently the SSO carried out the sample survey \"Children in Mongolia\". Although the central and local statistical organisations have undertaken a number of statistical surveys, the scientific and methodological basis does not reach the necessary standard. One of the most widely used data sources is business registers. It is absolutely clear that one of the most important tasks for statistics in the near future is to set up a State Business Register. It will allow transition from full-scale observation to sample surveys as well as the introduction of new methods of data processing. The activities in setting up a State Business Register will be developed along the following lines: - use of international experience in setting up similar kinds of registers; 158 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - checking the composition of economic indicators; - use of the State Register at the regional level; - interaction and combination with other registers. In order to meet this objective the State Statistical Office will closely co-operate with tax and other financial organisations. On the basis of what I have said, the key priorities and future tasks for Mongolia's statistics should be based on an optimum combination of the existing system of data collection and processing with progressive technologies, methods and the methodologies applied in countries with a developed market economy. Prospects for development The task of developing a statistical information system and reconciling it with international standards is a very labour-intensive and complex problem. Therefore, it will require substantial long-term investment. On the other hand, for any country this is an internal problem that depends on the general economic development as well as on the country's financial and personnel resources. In the case of Mongolia, however, we have been trying to make improvements, innovations and changes to the statistical system and its structure on the basis of our human and technical capacity, which already forms the right basis. But we still need to improve many aspects of our work. We have based our conclusions on the following: the statistical practice of the past five years, recommendations from statistical, economic and fiscal international organisations, consultations with international experts who have been working on many statistical projects, overseas and local training and the experience of foreign countries. We have concluded that the process of conversion of accounting and the statistical system to international standards should be organised in the following stages: 1. Speeding up the process of training and retraining of statistical staff; 2. Unifying statistical scientific theory with the theory of market economics to include it in the university teaching programme; 3. Renewing the accounting and statistical system. Bringing the methodology of estimation up to international level taking the specific conditions of our country into account; 4. Obtaining effective forms and methods of statistical observation in accordance with market economies. For example, avoiding collections of data from each establishment and using more sampling methods in data collection; 5. Establishing and applying a national classification to provide comparable data at the international level at a time of deepening co-operation between Mongolia and the world community; 6. At the macro level, converting from the Material Product System to the System of National Accounts in order to estimate, investigate and analyse all macroeconomic variables; 7. Establishing a new technology for transfer, processing, use and printing of statistical data and bringing it up to the level of modern technologies for data collection and processing; 8. Converting accounting to international methods; 9. Establishing a new structure for statistical services, decentralisation of data collection and processing and transfer of these jobs to regional and urban statistical offices. We hope that the discussions, experience of other countries and other information obtained during this seminar will be useful for further developing the statistical information system in Mongolia to international level. 159 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Conclusion Mongolia's statistical system has gone through a difficult period in its development. This dictates the need to solve the following tasks as priorities: - to obtain effective forms and methods of statistical observation; - to provide comparable data at the international level at a time of deepening co-operation between Mongolia and the world community; - to actively apply modern technologies for data collection and processing; - to intensify international co-operation in the field of statistics; - to speed up the process of basic and further training of statistical staff. * * * DISCUSSANT MAURO MASSELLI - ISTITUTO NAZIONALE DI STATISTICA, ITALY In the papers of Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan the authors begin by stating that the old method of collecting data, that is, administrative reporting is not adapted to the new situation of a market economy that generates new players and new phenomena in the social and economic field. In particular they pointed out the importance of sample surveys. In many parts of the Kyrgyz paper there are references to sample surveys used in different fields. Of course there is general agreement on the statement that sample surveys are very important in collecting data. But my opinion is that sample surveys are strictly related to sample design and for conducting a survey you need such operations as planning it and making a design for it, designing its questionnaire, editing data, their tabulation and presentation. All these phases can generate errors. So, conducting a sample survey means that you should try to reduce these errors. But sometimes you can see that the scheme of your survey, the techniques are not well established. This can happen also in the western countries because the world is changing. I agree with the statement that this is true as well for the eastern countries. I agree with the Mongolian delegate that statistical international co-operation in training is very important. But also it is important to use information technology, for example, software that is rather efficient in time saving and in access to methodology which is incorporated in it. In the future we can apply information technology like geographic and statistical information system for conducting different surveys. The second problem in conducting a survey, which is rather crucial in my opinion, is compulsory or non-compulsory statistics. Regardless of the law in force in the western and I suppose in the eastern countries the sample surveys are not compulsory. That is, you have a lot of actors in the social and economic fields and they can refuse to respond or they can be wrong in their responses or they can give false answers to a question. So, you have to convince them to give their information. And I think that it is and it will be, together with the development of a market economy, the principle point of the sample survey in the eastern countries. The sample design requires the selection of units, the extrapolation of results and the planning, for example, of the stratification and post-stratification weights, etc. Both of the authors mentioned business registers as independent sources of information and survey sampling frames. But in my opinion some effort can be made also in preparing lists for the household surveys which include units and area frames depending on a scheme more adapted to your sampling. 160 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Both papers also emphasize budget surveys for social and economic analysis. In my opinion together with the development of a market economy it will be necessary in future also to carry out labour force surveys in order to take into account all the labour figures and avoid the biases reported, for example, in the Kyrgyz paper. So. my suggestion is to think about the kind of survey that can be also used for calculation and estimation of the informal economy. In the field of social and demographic statistics administrative sources are very useful and cheaper. I think that in the eastern countries there is no problem in using this kind of statistical technique and in future these sources can be expanded to other fields. I will finally underline a suggestion stated in the Mongolian paper, namely concerning improvement and expansion of the links between statistical agencies and universities. In my opinion, in the eastern countries this is a crucial point. Such links will enable you to obtain additional resources for training and developing statistical methods and techniques. I think that links between statistical agencies and universities are very important for the eastern countries. DISCUSSANT RONALD LUTTIKHUIZEN - STATISTICS NETHERLANDS I would like to compliment the authors of both papers. But I would also like to mention some differences. For me it is clear that the Kyrgyz statistical office is already well on the way towards designing and implementing the transition of statistics. Whereas the Statistical Office of Mongolia appears to be more in an early phase of this process. I liked the Mongolian comparison of their own indicators with those in the main international publications (although it was not always mentioned which publications were referred to). Further it is clear from the paper that the introduction of sampling techniques and the training of staff in new statistical methods is considered a key priority. The same is true for the Kyrgyz Statistical Office. The paper of the Kyrgyz Republic is longer and contains more information. I was interested by the long list of important topics on which our Kyrgyz colleagues report. The paper is very interesting and covers many of the remarks of the paper of Mongolia. It refers to developments in almost all sectors of the statistical office, therefore it is impossible to comment on all of them. I would however like to make some comments on the points which strike me most. 1. Statistical methods. The paper makes it very clear that the introduction of the use of sampling methods is very well accepted. Both in the field of social as well as economic statistics. In social statistics different experiences have been made already. A sample survey of 1100 households was changed into a larger and clearly better sample of 5.000 households. This is of course a trend in the right direction because the information obtained from more households is by definition more reliable. Also in the field of social statistics a sample-based socio-demographic survey was held among 5% of the population. And indeed this can also obtain good results. Further there was mention of a survey among 600 women who were not randomly but selectively chosen. And from this group about 30 were interviewed. The results of such a survey can also be very interesting although the outcomes probably will not be very representative. But still they can be very informative and thus quite important. For a representative survey a few more people should be selected and they should be chosen in a-selective way. 161 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The reliability of a sample survey is very dependent on the way the method is applied. This is also clear from some other examples that are mentioned. Sample surveys are also held in the field of enterprise statistics. Monthly surveys are mentioned for different branches and different indicators. A special case is for instance a sample survey of two or three non-food markets. The sample method used here is two observations during one quarter of the year. One for working days and one for non- working days, it seems to me that the number of observations is minimal. This can only be done if it is certain that there are hardly any fluctuations in time during the quarters observed. Therefore an evaluation and review of this method should be made. 2. Economic statistical concepts. The paper also refers to the output of the various surveys. And it is mentioned on page 11 that 'the most important indicator for market conditions is the index of the physical volume of production for industry as a whole and by sector.' This sentence refers to one of the main points of discussion in our co-operation projects. In the past we stressed the importance of the relationship between monthly indicators and the yearly structural surveys. And the relationship between the calculation of turnover, value added and the national accounts. In that context we made it clear that the development of the economy can be best measured by looking at the monthly and quarterly development of turnover and value added. Of course an index of the physical production output is also very useful. Especially if there is strong inflation. But it has specific problems. What is the distinction between production sold and the production for the warehouse? And is it certain that the production cost of the physical production is higher than the income? Because if that is not the case the production can imply a negative value added. And thus the continuation of the production can imply (in theory) that the economy is in decline although the production is on the increase. This is considered by international experts to be one of the most problematical questions of the former economic system. On the other hand, if the turnover is measured, this can be meaningless if there is (high) inflation. In that case the values of the turnover obtained must be deflated in order to have a time series in constant prices (the volume of the turnover). In our country (unlike Germany) we use this monthly information on turnover to calculate the monthly value added. And this value added is calculated using the structural information of the enterprises. Because the production ratios especially in industry (the ratio of production value, intermediate consumption and value added) are fixed, it is easy to estimate the volume of the value added (system approach). But what is needed is the producer price index. And with the help of structural information, each month, quarter and year the volume of the value added can be estimated. Another aspect is the nature of the statistical programme of a statistical office. In a statistical programme the list of statistical projects is organised in such a way that various distinctions can be made and that relationships between statistical projects can be defined, evaluated and analysed. In our co-operation projects we often spoke about the difference between institutional statistics and functional statistics. With institutional statistics we describe the behaviour of economic agents (enterprises). And if we aggregate them, we describe the behaviour and the relationships between branches. This is what we consider the heart of enterprise statistics. We can use this kind of enterprise statistics to make input and output tables: again to describe the relationships between the enterprises. 162 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go To give an example: we consider the construction work done by retail enterprises to be part of the total activity of the retail enterprises. Then there are two options. If the work done is a repair, the materials bought can be part of the intermediate consumption, and all work done is part of the value added ofthat enterprise. But if it requires a considerable investment, in that case the total value ofthat work should be part of the value added of that organisation. And this equals the value of the 'self realised own investment'. And this value can be added to the investments in the economy. But, and this is essential: the construction work in both cases should be part of the value added (small or larger part) of the retail enterprises (this topic was of great importance in central Asia.). The consequence is that construction work, as own investment, is always considered part of the branch by which it is done. And not as part of the construction branch. But we also draw up functional statistics. And with functional statistics we can describe the various aspects of the enterprises. And thus we can describe the construction activities in the retail trade as part of the total construction activity in a country. But this is done in another kind of input and output table (synthetic input/output table). I think it should be advocated to describe the statistical work of the statistical offices of the transition countries in coherent and consistent work programmes. In this way it can be analysed very clearly how the various statistics relate to each other. And it can avoid confusion that can easily exist about the difference between institutional and functional statistics. 3. On the hidden-informal-underground-not observed economy The paper refers also to the shadow economy. But again around this topic there are different questions, both conceptual and methodological, of great importance. I want to mention three of them. 3.1. Construction work done by households and by religious organisations. This work is often done without payment for the labour inputs. But still the questions can be asked: what is the value added, what is the production value and what is the value of the investment done? These questions can all be answered but it is very important to define what kind of assumptions are made. Of course in all cases the costs of the material inputs (the intermediate consumption of households) can be observed and calculated. According to the new SNA also the unpaid labour inputs and the value of the work should be valued. But the question. is whether this should be a top-priority in the work programme. Because the observation of these matters is rather complex and relatively costly. (Unless there is a system of registration of construction work, where people have to indicate the value of the work.) To some extent this problem can also be solved by making calculations on the basis of estimations. Estimated labour input and estimated 'invented' wages/production values (imputations) . But in our view the statistical office is approaching the limits of its professional work. Since if we want to describe reality; we have to accept that no wages were paid. On the other hand of course production was realised with the input of labour. In this case we would advocate more a solution based on a model approach and less an approach based on observations of these unpaid labour inputs. And so the problem changes from a pure statistical one to a problem of econometric modelling. 3.2. The production of food in households. Of course this is of great importance to all transition countries. But how do we deal with it? According to the SNA 93 this should be calculated with the help of 'basic prices on markets'. In our view we can be faced with a serious problem if this kind of production is very important in relation to the national accounts. Again we have a similar problem. Since these products are produced but not actually sold on markets; what is their value? Because if everybody was to bring their food to the markets and food was bought only at the markets then the prices and the quantities sold would be very different. In our view the market prices of city markets should not be used. This would lead to the wrong economic information. The basic prices to be used can be (maximally) the prices for which food products are sold by households to others who bring 163 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go things to the markets. These prices are probably 30 to 50% lower than the actual market prices. In the market prices such costs are included like transport and sales costs that by definition are not incurred in the production and consumption by households. 3.3. A clear distinction must be made between hidden production and the hidden transfer of income from enterprises to households. 4. On the use of registers. In both papers much attention is rightly paid to the use of registers. The existence of registers (or census information) is a necessary condition for a useful statistical description of enterprises. The choice of the statistical units in the registers is therefore of great importance. Since the choice of the units has a strong influence on all results. This is especially important if the registration of enterprises in different registers occurs. And this brings me to a special point of interest. Registers are not only important for the design of sample surveys. But they can potentially also be important in a different way. If the registers are designed properly they can already contain lots of information that can be useful for statistical purposes. And thus can improve the use of administrations and registers for statistical purposes. This becomes even more important when the most modern automation tools are used for the electronic capture of data. This use of secondary sources can improve the efficiency and reduce the burden on enterprises. Of course all this needs planning, organisation and co-ordination, in order to make sure that the concepts that are used in the various registrations can be linked to each other. And this information can also be used to improve the results of the surveys. Since one of the strong points of the former system was large-scale registration, it should be investigated which of the registrations and administrations that are left or constructed can be used for further improving the statistical systems. COMMENTS, REPLIES AND A UDIENCE DISCUSSION MODERATOR HEIKKI SALMI - EUROSTAT One important point I would like to raise here is the use of administrative data. In the western countries now the data burden on enterprises is enormous, so we have to find new solutions on how to decrease this data burden and here is where the question arises of whether some ways are available. Administrative data which are useful for statistical purposes should be used by us so as not to collect the same data from the enteiprises. In your countries you can check and go through these administrative data. That will be very helpful for overall statistical production and will enable you to avoid duplication of data collection. In some European countries there are a lot of processes for using these data. In some cases, perhaps, in your previous data collection methods there was something which you are now trying to avoid and you are now tiying to find some new solutions on how to get the data by means of sampling or direct collection from enterprises. 164 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go C O M M E N TS E D V A RD O U T R A TA - PRESIDENT, C E N T R AL STATISTICAL OFFICE, C Z E CH REPUBLIC In the use of administrative data I found an interesting phenomenon when I took over responsibility for the Czech Statistical Office. It was under the communist system that in instances where the same information was required by more ministries or by more institutions it was the statistical office precisely of those institutions which collected the administrative data and then distributed them to the users. Consequently that of course was against the law and even before my time my predecessors had stopped that with different levels of efficiency. When I came in I landed in the middle of the debate about what to do. Clearly, the representatives of the other ministries told me I did not want our poor respondents to have to fill in duplicate information for the Statistical Office and also for the ministries. So, would I please go on collecting individual information and passing it over to the ministries? Clearly that was within the idea of reducing response burden. I wonder if the same problem arises among the countries here and what they are doing. I like to say what I think is the only possible way because I agree, of course, that one should not increase responsibility. Surely, we should not collect the information twice. And it is clear that it is impossible to pass individual information and it is extremely complicated, if at all possible, and very dangerous to make some exceptions in collecting information under some other Act than the Statistics Act which may be a solution. The obvious solution that however does not seem obvious in a communist environment is that other ministries should collect information and pass it as administrative data over to the statistical office. Clearly one or two situations arise. One is they have the right by law to require that information. In that case there is no legal problem and they should go ahead and do it. Or alternatively, they do not have that right but they try to get it back from the statistical office. Well, in that case it probably should be stopped or a law should be enacted to that effect. There is no third way. This was accepted basically after some discussion in our country in 1993 and I stopped getting these requests. Nevertheless, there was another technical debate on that when the ministries were unhappy that they did not have the know-how and expertise to do the collection. In those instances we offered, and in one or two instances actually provided help in doing that. So, indeed the companies kept getting their questionnaires if it was legal but under the heading of a Ministry and everything was fine from then on. I wonder if the same situation arises somewhere in your countries and if it does what your approaches would be. But this is a situation which is obvious too. That was one point. I want now to stop at a different subject. Indeed I find in my own country the lack of experience in methodology in mathematical statistics generally and in sampling methods also as one of the major limiting factors to our progress. It is very hard to stop this process with the minimum staff which even my country has for this. I am pretty sure this is a problem in your countries also. I have to come back to something I said a few days ago. The only way one gets out of the vicious circle in which first of all in the centre we do not have staff to do proper sampling, and consequently we continue with the old system, consequently we cannot get rid of the enormous expense of the old system and consequently we cannot ensure that the people work properly in the centre. The only way to get out of that, I think, is to drastically reduce the ability of the office to do anything but surveys. After that it will find its own way of operating. 165 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go MODERATOR HEIKKI SALMI - EUROSTAT I think that the comments of Mr Outrata concerning administrative data are widely shared. It is very dangerous if the statistical office has also an administrative role and collects administrative data. It is quite another world. Statistics and administrative data collection should be separated. But of course there is the question of using administrative data if they are available somewhere else. Statistical office activities should be organised to provide statistical data, not administrative. COMMENTS NIKOLAI BELOV - FIRST DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE INTERSTATE STATISTICAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES I would like to tell you about two ideas which, I believe, are basically connected with the subject of today's discussion. The first is the correlation between centralisation and decentralisation. I would like to remind you that in his paper, the Chairman of Goskomstat Russia, Mr Yurkov, said that in Russia and other CIS countries, statistics remained very rigidly built into the system of state administration and it would be wrong to ignore this fact in the reform of statistics in the CIS countries. Therefore, the correlation between centralisation and decentralisation stems first and foremost from this situation. It is evident that for some time yet, there will still be a need for the regional statistical structures against which Mr Outrata is so opposed, and for a decentralised system for collecting data for subsequent aggregation at both regional and national level in line with the role of statistics in these countries. And now we come to the second idea. It is also evident to us all from the results of the discussion of this topic that we all need to draw a conclusion for him- or herself on the need to combine methods of full-scale and sample surveys. The state sector, which remains quite strong, requires urgent direct regulation and it is evident that for this sector the need for full-scale observation at a specific stage in the transition period will remain. As a result, in the CIS countries there is a continuing need for a combination of full-scale and sample surveys. Of course, as and when the number of market-type commercial structures increases and a system of registers is developed, sample surveys will become far more important and the system for collecting and processing statistical data will clearly be based on a combination of these two methods. If we arrive at this understanding, there will be less and less difference between us statisticians of the countries with a transition economy and the statisticians of countries with a market economy. C O M M E N TS L E IH GLGINEISHVILI - STATE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL A ND ECONOMIC INFORMATION, GEORGIA I would like to make a few comments on the idea of deriving data on the basis of administrative sources. The point is, with the conversion to a market economy, the ministries and departments have lost all their economic functions, and enterprises which previously supplied them with information now have no contact at all with them. That is why statistics have a major role to play in data collection. The only administrative sources possible are the tax inspectorate, national and commercial banks, and the customs services. And there is an interesting point here: the confidentiality of data, which is prescribed by the law on statistics. The tax inspectorates, banks and customs services maintain 166 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go confidentiality and therefore this question is a constant one in relation to statistics and the statistical services are entitled to receive these administrative data. We should not believe that anyone else will give us the data. Only the administrative bodies I have mentioned can provide us with the necessary information. 167 ",

        "Session VI Dissemination policy and relations with the users of statistics ",
        "",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go MODERATOR WILLEM DE VRIES - HIGH-LEVEL ADVISER, STATISTICS NETHERLANDS Today's topic is \"Dissemination of Statistical Information and Relations with the Users\". I think this is a very important topic because what is the use of good statistics if they are not properly delivered to the users? On the other hand I think that publication work is usually underestimated in the statistical offices. Most statisticians refer to the work in data collection or in analysis or even in informatics and usually people who deal with publication work and marketing and so on are considered to be second rate statisticians. However, I think that is a wrong point of view because publishing is a profession and so is marketing. In the \"Fundamental Principles for Official Statistics\" we find the phrase that we must make statistics that meet the test of practical utility. And practical utility can be shown by delivering statistics to the users. As the expression goes: \"The proof of the pudding is in its eating\". And utility of course means timeliness, relevance, but also things that are easy to understand and are unambiguous, etc. And all this is a matter of presentation. So, I think that dissemination is the ultimate method to find out whether your users are satisfied or not. Advisory councils and things like that are of course very important but they cannot decide ultimately whether the users will be satisfied. Of course you have all sorts of user contacts, but finally the question is: \"Do our users buy the products?\" This is I think a new phenomenon for CIS countries because their main client was the Government and to some extent of course the mass media, but now they will meet new different sorts of client groups - the private sector, international users, etc. I shall tell you a little anecdote. I made a deal with Mr Gigineishvili of Georgia about a year ago. Georgia had produced a little booklet called \"Georgia in Figures, 1994\" and I said to him that I could sell it at western markets. We had a mailing list which was not very long, there were about two thousand addresses and we sent out a letter and tried to sell the publication. The price for it was very high; we charged two dollars for each page that it had. It was 55 dollars for a publication and without any efforts we have sold thirty. You may think that thirty is not much but direct mail specialists can tell you that a score of one percent is very high. So, we got one and a half percent easily and this was a very simple book. It was sold to Harward University, Rockefeller Foundation, Deutsche Bank, etc. because it was the only information they had about Georgia. So, your statistics are worth money. All depends of course on your philosophy: either you try to make money, or try to get the maximum number of users. You can for example print a book and put some people in Nevsky Prospect or in Gostiny Dvor and give it away free and you will give away ten thousand copies a day. But I think this is not a proper way. There are three basic philosophies in the dissemination policy of statistical offices: maximum distribution, no matter what kind of money you make out of it, maximum use and maximum profits. * * * 171 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go SPEAKER VLADIMIR NICHIPOROVITCH - DIRECTOR, MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS, BELARUS Policy on the Dissemination of Statistical Data and the relationship with data users. The Work of the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis of the Republic of Belarus The work of the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis of the Republic of Belarus in collecting, processing and disseminating statistical information is carried out in accordance with the Regulation governing the Ministry, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus. Minstat's main task consists of providing statistical information to the Supreme Soviet, the President, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus and other central government bodies. In accordance with the above-mentioned Regulation, the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis allows associations, enterprises, institutions, organisations and the citizens of the Republic of Belarus equal access to aggregated statistical information through the dissemination of reports, data compilations, bulletins, publications and statistical data in the mass media and also in response to enquiries. The Ministry of Statistics and Analysis operates according to a statistical work programme based on proposals submitted by the legislative and executive authorities and by scientific and other organisations and institutions, which is approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus and by the Ministry. Every year the Ministry's Board compiles and approves the catalogue of publications. This catalogue lists the most important statistical compilations, bulletins and other publications which are to be published in the course of the year. The list of publications is sent to ministries, departments, scientific research institutes and heads of international organisations, and is published in periodicals. In accordance with the list of publications, there is the annual publication of the short statistical handbook \"The Republic of Belarus in Figures\" and a full statistical yearbook, \"The National Economy of the Republic of Belarus\", which set out data on the trend of the socio-economic situation in the Republic over a period of years. Until 1991 the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis produced the statistical yearbook in mass editions of 10 to 12 000 copies via printing and publishing combines. These yearbooks were much in demand from specialists and the general population and could be obtained at affordable prices, since at that time economic publications were subsidised under the planned economy. Subsequently, however, when the Republic began the process of economic transformation, abandoning central planning, the publication of mass editions of statistical handbooks became practically impossible in a market transitional period accompanied by crises in the economy and financial sector and high rates of inflation. That is why the Ministry took steps to organise the publication of yearbooks using their own printing facilities. The centre for preparing and publishing statistical information, INFORMSTAT, was created at the Ministry. This is the basis for publishing statistical handbooks and other planned publications, with a print run of up to 500 copies. 172 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In a year around 30 statistical handbooks and bulletins are published, describing the democratic processes in Belarus, the labour situation in the individual branches of the national economy and the country's foreign trade. The handbooks include publications such as \"The Population of the Republic\", \"Industry\", \"Agriculture\", \"Finance\", \"Employment of the Population and Remuneration\" etc. The handbook \"The National Accounts of the Republic of Belarus\" is published in both Russian and English. A statistical bulletin has been published since 1995, showing the trend in employment indicators for the national economy since 1990, and for 1995 and 1996 this is shown on a monthly basis. As from 1996 this bulletin is being published in both Russian and English. In 1995 Minstat worked with the World Bank to develop and conduct a general survey of 5 000 households. This survey will provide objective and representative information on the population of Belarus. From the results of the survey, the statistical publications \"The main socio-demographic characteristics of households in the Republic of Belarus\" and \"Expenditure and income in the Republic\" are published on a quarterly basis. These publications have received the highest rating from the World Bank and are highly significant for analysing the national standard of living. There is a monthly report on employment in the national economy. This contains an analysis of the situation in all the most important spheres of economic and social life in the Republic. These publications are made available to users as soon as they are published. The statistical publications are sent free of charge to government bodies, a range of leading research institutes and the main newspapers and journals: the expenditure on their publication is funded by the state budget. As part of the exchange of information, Minstat also sends its publications free of charge to the CIS Intergovernmental Statistical Committee, the statistical bodies of the CIS countries, the governments of the Baltic States and to the statistical bodies of countries with which co-operation agreements have been concluded (Poland, Germany). The Ministry of Statistics and Analysis of the Republic of Belarus provides a constant stream of statistical information to Eurostat, the UN Economic Commission for Europe, the UN Statistical Office, the OECD, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and various other international organisations. Foreign companies, representations, state and commercial enterprises and organisations may obtain the statistical publications at set prices from Informstat. The publications are dispatched to these organisations on the basis of completed order forms. Since publications have not yet reached the appropriate print quality level, the prices for the publications are established on the principle of covering costs. Informstafs revenue from producing publications is still relatively small, at some 110 million Belorussian roubles in 1995. 173 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Every year there is a growing demand for statistical information in non-state publications, which are sponsored by commercial banks, stock exchanges and other independent financial and economic journals and newspapers. Informstat of Minstat does not restrict the provision of statistical information or its publications. From time to time the only restriction is simply an insufficient number of copies available. In such circumstances, it is advantageous to use the largest research organisations, newspapers and journals. In order to cater for users' inquiries, a library has been created in Minstat containing all their publications and any citizen may order the data he requires. If these are not available in publications, the information may be obtained from the Minstat departments. The library also has the publications of the national statistical services of the CIS, many foreign countries and international organisations, which we receive as part of the exchange ofinformation. The main macro-economic indicators on the CIS countries appear in monthly Minstat publications. Minstat sends the CIS Statistical Committee statistical information on the main indicators of the economy of the Republic of Belarus on a specially selected questionnaire by electronic mail. Every month the CIS statistical committee publishes, and sends to the statistical offices of the CIS countries, statistical bulletins containing statistical information on all the CIS countries,. These publications are sent to Minstat's library to facilitate the work of statistical users. Furthermore, the Ministry provides information to practically all interested international organisations, private firms and individuals on request. Direct contacts have been established with radio and television, which are sent the main indicators on the domestic economy for use in television and radio broadcasts. Short-term data on the economic situation are readily published in all the Republic's newspapers and journals. There is an especially large demand for statistical data on inflation, the main macro-economic indicators, the situation in industry and agriculture, the consumer market, earned income, both for the Republic as a whole and for the individual branches of the economy, particularly in the non- production sector, real disposable income of the population, the level of pension provision, housing construction and prices of individual consumer goods and services. Price indices are calculated by Minstat on a weekly and monthly basis and are published in practically all mass media, including radio and television. There are broad presentations of statistical information in the weekly \"National Economic Gazette\", in the journal \"Man and Economics\" and in the publication of the Agricultural and Scientific Research Institute, \"Agro-economics\". These publications are very popular with the scholars, specialists and government workers. 1996 saw the start of publication of the monthly information bulletins of the Administration of the President of the Republic of Belarus. This publication also provides a broad presentation of statistical information on the national economy. 174 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The mass media and sociologists are also very interested in statistical data depicting the activity of specific economic units and natural persons. In this area the statistical bodies are governed by the Republic's laws on the confidentiality of data on natural and legal persons and by the main principles of official statistics of the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which were adopted at the 47th session of the ECE in Geneva on 15 April 1992. All the statistical data processed by the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis are published in its name. At the same time, the ministries and other government bodies which collect statistics publish this information in their own name. For example, the National Bank regularly publishes data on the balance of payments, and the exchange rate of the national currency. A series of statistical material is published by the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs. The Ministry of Statistics and Analysis strives to ensure that it disseminates its information as quickly as possible, and much has recently been done in this respect. The main data are sent to the mass media no later than the 15th of the month following the reference month. At the same time, the labour intensiveness of statistical data processing and the low level of computing technology at the statistical bodies does not enable the information to be sent to the mass media any more quickly. At present, the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis is working hard on providing the statistical bodies with new equipment, first and foremost the regional authorities and the urban and district statistical departments. This should speed up the collection, processing and dissemination of statistical information. At the same time, work with users sometimes gives rise to important problems. In Minsk a group of experts works on the Tacis programme and prepares monthly surveys of the Republic's economy which are sent to many government and international organisations. In preparing these publications they use Minstat's statistical material, particularly the monthly statistical bulletins showing the trend on an annual basis and, for the past two years, on a monthly basis. However, there are serious distortions in the interpretation of these data and the calculations, tables and graphs derived from them and this mis-represents the actual economic situation in the Republic. The level of inflation and Minstat's analytical comparisons of the main macro-economic indicators on the basis of price indices are not correctly interpreted. Minstat has repeatedly drawn experts' attention to the inadmissibility of loosely interpreting the indicators developed by Minstat, pointing out that the GDP calculations were carried out with the assistance of OECD experts and in the case of price indices, the International Monetary Fund, with which Minstat has been working since 1992. An expert from the International Monetary Fund, Mr Fasler, was working at Minstat for a considerable time. Both the experts of the above-mentioned organisations and Mr Fasler gave a positive assessment of how Minstat has constructed the national accounts and defined the price indices. With the help of these international organisations, the Republic of Belarus has become the first country in the transitional stage to have started on the construction of quarterly national accounts. 175 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The head of the Tacis project, Mr Raul de Lutsenberger has sent a document to Minstat, showing the Republic's level of inflation in 1995 in relation to 1994 not as 700% but, according to their estimate, as 244%. Minstat compiled the inflation data for 1995 using average prices over the whole of 1995 in relation to the average figures for 1994. In this way, account was taken of the monthly indices over the two- year period in defining these indices. Minstat calculates GDP at comparable prices, the annual average level of real earned income and other important macro-economic indicators. Mr Lutsenberger obtained the price index change of 244% not as a change in average annual practices but in prices for the period December 1994 to December 1995. This method can be used, but it must be applied to the whole period 1994-1995. Minstat has stated that if there is any doubt on the part of the Tacis experts over the accuracy of the calculation of the annual or monthly price indices, they could consult the OECD, International Monetary Fund and Eurostat experts. Use of the estimates of the Tacis experts could result in a highly negative reaction amongst users and the wider population, as it could result in overestimating the whole system of macro-economic indicators and real income of the population. Minstat has been forced to bring this to the attention of the Government and has set forth its position on this issue. SPEAKER LERI GIGINEISHVILI - STATE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION, GEORGIA The Main Results and Trends in the Development of Georgian Statistics during the transitional period I thank all those who have given me the opportunity on behalf of the Georgian delegation to speak before such a representative forum of statisticians. It is already the fifth day of discussions on the papers summing up the state of statistics in the countries with transition economies. In essence it is a presentation of the results of the Tacis Programme since 1991, in which, along with other countries, Georgia has been participating. The reform of Georgia's statistics coincided with the Declaration of Independence, which was followed by the dramatic events in the social, political and economic life of the country in 1991-1993 (elements of civil war, conflicts in Abkhazia and in the South Ossetia region). During those years practically the whole technical infrastructure of statistics was destroyed. The country was gripped by a deep economic recession. Georgia was faced with a choice: either rebuild the previous administrative structure and begin a stage-by-stage transition to market conditions or decisively take the road to economic reforms. The second way was chosen - the route of deep radical reforms. The basis of statistical reform was the introduction of the Programme for the introduction of the national accounting system, which began to be implemented in 1992. In 1993 Parliament approved the Law on Statistics and Registers. As a result of that we succeeded in setting up an appropriate infrastructure for statistical reporting and working tables adequate for analysis by sector and type of goods of the results of economic activity. 176 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go During those years the Department organised balance of payment statistics and also indices reflecting the market mechanisms more faithfully, such as the CPI, standard of living and employment indices. In close co-operation with the OECD Georgia produced national accounts for the year 1990 to 1993. A compendium was published in Georgian and in English. At the present time the national accounts for 1994 are ready for publication and the calculations have been made for 1995. Since 1995 Georgia has calculated micro-economic indices on a quarterly basis. Thanks to the Law on Statistics, which stipulated absolute confidentiality of the data on individual units, the problems of collecting information on the balance of payments were solved, in close co-operation with the Customs Department, the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank. As a result we issue a quarterly bulletin in Georgian and English containing appropriate comments. There is strong demand for these publications both from the authorities and from foreign embassies and investors of various kinds Work on the balance of payments is being systematically improved within the framework of the Tacis project \"Foreign trade statistics\", and also with the co-operation of experts from the Netherlands CBS using the \"mirror statistics\" method in agreement with the Transcaucasian republics. The key point in market conditions is the switch from full-scale surveys to sample surveys, the basis for which will be the business register. Without exaggeration this Tacis project can be called the heart of the restructuring of statistical theory and practice. In Georgia implementation of the projects began after the adoption of the Law on Free Enterprise at the beginning of 1995. Before that time, with support from Eurostat and with intensive consultation with the Netherlands statistical office, we built up a hardware and software complex (a network of 27 computers). The existing problems were tackled. In this we were assisted by an analysis carried out by Statistical Committee of the CIS and by the experience of Russia and other countries. The registration process is being conducted decentrally in all regions. At the present time some 25 000 businesses are registered, and the intention is to complete the entries by the end of the year. Although the register is not yet complete it already works in many respects, first and foremost as a means of carrying out sample surveys. That is why in 1995 in agreement with the Netherlands the \"Business Register\" project developed into an independent project, \"Business Statistics\". As we considered the Business Register to be not complete enough for arriving at correct estimates, and also in order to speed up the process of re-registration, we introduced a new integrated quarterly statistical form taking into account all the SNA requirements. This is an intermediate stage prior to the completion of the \"Business Statistics\" project. One of the key innovations in the reform of statistics in the last few years has been the switch from the branch method to business statistics, i.e. whereas formally information on each aspect of activity (employment, finance, material resources etc.) were collected on separate forms, after the changeover all the main indicators characterising the production activities of a business were integrated on a single form. For large enterprises there are up to 150 indices, and for small ones about 25. This system was started as from the second quarter of 1995 in Tbilisi and in the rest of the country as from mid-1995. In view of the exceptional importance of this information, we requested co-operation from the tax authorities to ensure completeness of data collection and presentation. Their co-operation gave positive results not only for us, but also for the tax authorities themselves as they are one of the main users of the information we provide. Until we have built up a complete register, and even afterwards, the practice we have had in carrying out general economic censuses will not have been wasted. Out of present necessity we have already carried out the first of such large-scale operations - a census of businesses in the wholesale and retail trade. 177 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Not long ago we took a decision of importance for the future of Georgia's statistics, namely to switch to the European classification of types of economic activity, which will be a good basis for pursuing state policy in the field of accounting, the tax system, financial policy-making and economic analysis. In the course of our work we constantly receive support and assistance from the Government and other high executive bodies. A short time ago the Government of Georgia passed a piece of legislation entitled \"Some measures for the reform of the statistics of private enterprise\", which, in addition to conferring new tasks on our Department, laid down obligations for many ministries and departments to support us in the collection and processing of primary statistical information. Georgia, like most of the countries that have sent their representatives to this seminar, is in the transitional stage. The transitional stage of economic relations is reflected in the nature of the tasks statistics are required to perform for society and the national authorities. On the one hand we have to monitor the process of fulfilment of the outline plans for the social and economic development of the country, and on the other hand we have to ensure the effectiveness of taking administrative decisions. We often have to \"dig down almost to the level of the micro- economy\" and give information on the state of affairs in individual regions or groups of businesses. For example, under a Presidential decree we conducted a two-week enquiry into the general characteristics of the social and economic situation of the regions of the Republic, and the reports are being collected and sent to state authorities on the personal responsibility of the leading figures in the towns (districts) of the country. The information collected in this way is for the use of the President's office and the Georgian Ministry of Economics for taking rapid decisions to prevent the development of negative trends slowing down economic reforms and to remove in good time any bottlenecks in this or that sector of social and economic development. One of the most important statistical indices is now the consumer price index. The range of users is quite wide and it is particularly successfully used in the calculation of macro-economic indicators and changes in the purchasing power of money. Although in Georgia no law as yet been passed on the indexation of deposits and savings, the CPI calculated by our Department is used by the courts in resolving many questions relating to property and money disputes. The consumer price index, which is based on 295 types of goods and services, is calculated in complete conformity with international economic recommendations in five large regions of the republic. In line with current needs, we have started to calculate the consumer price index weekly on the basis of 40 representative goods and services. Calculations of producer price indices, indices of capital goods and indices of export/import goods, etc. are at the preparatory stage. One of the major tasks that we have to undertake in the near future is to determine the purchasing power parity of the national currency throughout the whole range of representative goods. A problem which still remains to be solved, and not only by Georgia's statisticians, is the calculation of the size of the hidden economy. Every country with a market economy has a hidden economy, and particularly in the food sectors it flourishes in countries that have only recently become acquainted with fully-fledged market conditions and where the payments culture leaves something to be desired. The most conservative estimates assess the size of the hidden economy of Georgia at about half of the official GDP. Directives do not help in this situation, and the solution lies somewhere between registration and reregistration. In May a special seminar was held in Tbilisi for the Governments of Transcaucasia to discuss aspects of studying the scale of the hidden economy. The seminar was attended by experts from Italy, the Netherlands and Russia. 178 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Georgia's statisticians will never forget the help and co-operation which we are receiving from the international statistical organisations. In recent years many of our staff have attended seminars and working meetings organised by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, and the national statistical offices in Germany, the Netherlands and other countries of the European Union. It was particularly pleasing for us to note that as part of its active co-operation Eurostat issued the statistical compilation \"Georgia in figures\" (in English). At the present time a work entitled \"Transcausasia in figures\" is in preparation. With the active collaboration of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training in Berlin as early as the spring of 1995 a substantial compendium on Georgia was published in German. Eurostat regularly supplies us with methodological recommendations, manuals, compendiums, etc. I am happy to recall that Mr Von Der Lippe's manual \"Economic Statistics\" was presented in August 1995 in Tbilisi and attracted attention in wide scientific circles and amongst the public at large. We are determined to set-up a regional centre in Tbilisi for the retraining of staff and the improvement of skills on the basis of our department. We should like to make maximum use of the geopolitical position of Georgia, the role of Tbilisi, which traditionally has always been considered the centre of Transcaucasia, and also of the avalanche of changes for the better that we have seen recently in and around the Republic. We are prepared to examine any realistic proposals from Eurostat and its supporting structures in this respect. The experience which we have accumulated in the last three years in holding joint seminars on various sectors of statistics provides a basis for optimism about progress in this direction. In the last year alone twelve seminars and various meetings were held, in which the Transcaucasian republics and Kazakhstan participated. I should like to touch upon one topical problem that equally affects the interests of all statisticians of the CIS States. It is the intention of the bodies concerned of the European Union as from 1998 to switch Tacis project financing entirely from regional projects to national ones. The experience of the last four years of working with Eurostat and the statistical offices of the Member States of the European Union has demonstrated the effectiveness of implementing regional projects, and I am not completely sure that changes in the principle of financing the work in this way will prove productive and useful for the statistical offices of the countries in economic transition. I should like to ask the senior management of Eurostat and other competent offices of the European Union to look into the possibility of maintaining the present principle for the financing of projects under the Tacis programme, even if only until the year 2000. . The transformation of state statistics is no less complex and long-term a task than the transformation of the whole national economy. Notwithstanding certain achievements in the field of statistics, as regards the main aspects discussed above, I must be objective and tell you that this year we are completing the first stage of the reform of state statistics. In accordance with the Law on statistics, which was discussed at length at Eurostat, and here we would like to thank Mr De Vries personally for his direct participation in that, we were given liberal statistics. We deliberately avoided many control functions. Now in Georgia there are about thirty nine control bodies at various levels. We would not like to be the fortieth body to keep an eye on the entrepreneur. We stand for statistics with a human face. The preliminary and incomplete nature of the process of reform is attributable to the fact that, because of the acute shortage of resources, we had to undertake the restructuring piecemeal. But time has set us a challenge and we must integrate the projects in hand into the system. In the very near future steps will be taken to switch from a piecemeal approach to reform to an integrated one, and to its adaptation to the conditions of the market economy. We must set up a fully-fledged system with the necessary hardware and databanks operating on the World-Wide Web standard and with access to the resources of the Internet. We have to strengthen co-operation with all departments in the economic sphere and 179 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go with our regular users. The effectiveness of statistical activity depends largely on the organisational structure of state statistics. We have taken the first steps towards the decentralisation of the acquisition, processing and analysis of primary data by creating regional statistical offices. We will continue working along these lines and set up a complete system of statistical information for the krai regional administrations of the Republic. Preliminary steps have been taken to set up geographical information systems (GIS) which will be used to create a modern socio-economic database geared to the administrative and territorial division of the country. This is the most effective way of publishing statistical information. Our main bottleneck is computing and publishing capacity. But in this direction, too, progress is being made: literally on the eve of this meeting we received a batch of equipment under a World Bank credit to strengthen the institution. There is a high probability that under the Tacis programme we will also receive computing equipment within a few weeks. All this will make it possible for us in the near future to equip our branch departments, the information publishing centre and the local statistical offices with modern computing and telecommunications equipment. In accordance with a recent Presidential decree a Presidential commission on the creation of a strategic information system has been set up on the basis of a project drawn up by this Department, whose task will be to set in motion the integration of the information resources of the National Bank, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economics, the Customs Department and the Tax Inspectorate. In the context of this project a corporate ten-node network has been designed and is being set up for the transmission of statistical data. It has an X.25 and TCP/IP protocol and a data transmission speed of 64 kilobytes - 128 kilobytes/second and access to INTERNET resources. In the first stage this will link up in the network all krai departments, which will have a good opportunity to produce and publish the necessary bulletins on the spot. Our work is appreciated not only by the leading legislative and executive bodies, but also by the public. We avail ourselves of all possible means to make our statistics clear to the population at large. A special measure for this purpose was the setting-up of a press centre which, in addition to carrying out its normal functions, organises press conferences and briefings for the Department's top management on one or other of the latest developments in statistics. Every significant public, socio-economic phenomenon which is of concern throughout the country will be the subject of a rapid statistical study. This was the case when the national currency, the lari, was introduced in September-October 1995, and also when the prices of cereal products were completely liberated in June 1996. The information prepared and passed on to the authorities concerned made it much easier to take the right urgent decisions quickly and implement the economic reforms successfully. Statistics not only reflect the socio-economic situation and the life of the community, but are themselves undergoing rational reforms aimed at full compliance with international standards and thus ensuring comparability of methodology and statistical data. Georgia has chosen the democratic path of development, the economy is pulling out of the long-drawn-out period of crisis and there is a burst of investment activity. All this forms a favourable background against which we can look forward with optimism not only to the future of the economy, but also to the future of state statistics in Georgia. * * * 180 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go SPEAKER VLADIMIR SOKOLIN - STATE COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS 1. Fundamental Changes in Statistical Data Dissemination Policy The evolution of market relations in Russia, the emergence of various forms of ownership, a sea- change in the way the economy is run and the move away from the methods of the centrally-planned economy have, in their turn, entailed changes in the policy of statistical data dissemination. Whereas previously one of the main tasks of state statistics was to provide the ruling authorities with operational information about the state of the country (a significant part of which, it should be noted, was classified), now virtually all information regarding the socio-economic situation of the country forwarded to the President and government is fast becoming part of the public domain. As far as dissemination is concerned, equal access to overall statistical data has become the cornerstone principle of Goskomstat's activity. Irrespective of the type of proprietorship involved, any enterprise or organisation, as well as private individuals, can obtain, on a commercial basis, aggregate data from the various branches of the state statistic service. Goskomstat Russia (the central body of the state service) is not entitled itself to engage in commercial activity. Its staff is responsible for drafting statistical publications which take into account the requirements of a variety of users. It also supplies statistical information to an established list of specific users free of charge. This includes legislative and judicial bodies, management agencies, the mass media, the diplomatic corps, international organisations and the national statistical offices of various countries. The right to supply statistical data on a commercial basis has been conferred on the Computer Centre of Goskomstat Russia, which, apart from its main activity of data processing, has now acquired a new, but no less important, task - that of servicing the commercial sector of the economy through data dissemination. This same right is shared by all the regional bodies of the state statistical service, which, while continuing to provide local government with data free of charge, are increasingly becoming part of the data service- market. The Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics is the principal organisation in Russia for the collection, processing and dissemination of statistical data and covers virtually all aspects of economic and social activity throughout the country. Goskomstat derives the major part of its data, it should be noted, through its extensive system of regional representation. In parallel fashion, Goskomstat obtains another part of its data on specific sectors of the economy and social issues from the various ministries and agencies of Russia, in particular the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, the Customs Committee and so on. The principal means of statistical data dissemination is through Goskomstat's official publications in the form of statistical handbooks and bulletins, papers, journals, press-releases and the like. 181 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go 2. The Statistical publications of Goskomstat (Russia) Goskomstat's basic statistical publications - those which describe socio-economic developments in the country over a number of years are the statistical handbooks. Annually published handbooks covering general aggregated statistics - such as Russia in figures and the Russian Statistical Yearbook are in the greatest demand with a wide range of readers. These publications contain broad-based statistical data on the long-term development of the socio economic situation of the Russian Federation. This type of information covers a wide range of developments and also includes comparison with foreign countries, in the case of many indicators; often presentation includes a regional break-down. In addition, Goskomstat publishes sectoral and subject-based statistical handbooks, both annually and more than once a year: Industry in Russia, Russian Agriculture, the Demographic Yearbook of Russia, Social Affairs in Russia, Family in Russia, Prices in Russia, Work and Employment in Russia and so on. These publications contain more detailed information on the state of individual sectors of the economy. For example, the Demographic Yearbook of Russia takes a more detailed look at the changing trends in birth and death rates, in migration, and in so doing emphasises the major trends over the most recent years and attempts to assess the various scenarios for the future demographic development of Russia in the near future. In this type of publication a wider range of indicators are provided not only for Russia as a whole, but also according to regions. Goskomstat also publishes statistical handbooks on the occasion of individual anniversaries, World Conferences an such like. Thus, for the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations in 1995 it published, in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, a statistical handbook entitled Russia and the United Nations Organisation. Goskomstat's other publishing activities include the results of censuses, one-off and sample surveys. Separate editions also appear in English - Russia 95, Russia in Figures, the journal Statistical Survey and a number of others. Goskomstat's periodicals occupy pride of place amongst its publishing activities. Amongst these is the quarterly statistical survey which Goskomstat started publishing in 1994. It should be noted that the first issues of this journal appeared thanks to support from the European Union in the form of a Tacis technical assistance grant. This journal provides a full picture of the macro-economic situation of Russia during the current year. In 1994 Goskomstat also started publishing a monthly scholarly journal entitled Issues in Statistics, containing articles by prominent Russian and foreign economists, famous academics and practitioners, as well as those setting out on their careers as statisticians; information about the practice and academic and scientific activity of Goskomstat and other material. Amongst the statistical periodicals Goskomstat publishes, the monthly report entitled The Socio- Economic Situation of Russia occupies an important place. The report contains current information on the changes which have taken place in the Russian economy over the previous month, as well as an outline of the main trends through the year. Material is provided on macro-economic indicators, the GDP, the various sectors of industry, foreign trade, prices, finance, the consumer and employment markets, standard of living and income. The report contains not only tables and charts, but also brief analyses. This kind of presentation combines statistical data published for the first time and analysis. The report is circulated to 182 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go government institutions. A survey entitled The Economy of Russia, similar to the above-mentioned monthly report, is made available to the mass media and enjoys free circulation. Goskomstat publishes informational and analytical documentation on a range of specific issues or problems, both on a regular and on a one-off basis. An example of this is the Statistical Data Bulletin which contains analytical material and data on the economic and social development of the country and appears as and when sufficient material is available. Goskomstat's most operational publications are its press-releases containing brief information on the most topical issues (inflation levels, production figures for particular types of product, the state of enterprise accounts etc.). These appear daily and are destined essentially for the media. The latter either publish such releases in extenso in their own publications or use them as a basis for writing their own articles or commentaries. 3. The User Interface: Public Relations In the interests of making information about socio-economic matters ever more widely available, Goskomstat currently enjoys continuous contact with the media. Somewhere in the region of forty different newspapers, journals and information agencies are accredited with Goskomstat. These include inter alia: AO INTERFAKS, ITAR-TASS, RIA, NOVOSTI, the television company NTV, Kommer s ant-D ally, Delevoi Mir (Business World), Financial Times, Izvestia, Pravda, Ekonomicheskaya gazeta. Goskomstat supplies the latter with statistical publications free of charge. The directorship of Goskomstat holds press-conferences, gives regular interviews, contributes articles on topical issues to a variety of newspapers and journals and organises meetings on the problems faced by the state service; these are regularly attended by representatives of the mass media. An important role is played in terms of public relations by Goskomstat's library, which has an outstandingly rich variety of statistical literature, including the statistical publications of pre- revolutionary Russia, those of the USSR Central Statistical Office and Goskomstat itself; a collection of statistical handbooks published by international organisations and other national statistical offices. The library receives through the international inter-library loan scheme annual statistical handbooks from some thirty international organisations and fifty-five national statistical offices. Goskomstat in 1996 sent the Russian Statistics Yearbook to 160 different addresses. 4. International Co-operation International co-operation is far from being confined to library services and inter-library loans. Currently under a co-operation programme between Goskomstat and the CSO of Sweden, financed by the SIDA Fund, a publication consisting of a series of statistical handbooks on the region of south west Russia and the Kaliningrad oblast is being prepared. Co-operation of this kind has certainly been of great value to those concerned: territorial divisions have been supplied with new computer technology: CPC-486s equipped with Windows software; laser printers; and four regions have acquired the Page maker desk-top publishing software. This was all delivered recently and is in the process of being installed as we write. The work experience gained through consultations with Swedish experts has had a significant effect on the quality of published statistical materials. 183 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Under the bilateral Agreement on Co-operation with the FSO of Germany the basic lay-out for the joint publication of the concise statistical handbook Russia and Germany (in both Russian and German) has been produced and will be published in the near future. As of present, the main directions of a Tacis project with Eurostat have been mapped out to publish a joint handbook in English and Russian, entitled Europe and Russia. The aim of the project is to disseminate statistical data about Russia to the countries of the European Union and vice versa. Joint publications with other European countries and with Eurostat will only serve to enhance the prestige of Russian statistics and make them both more transparent and accessible. Goskomstat provides statistical data to various organisations on a continuous basis. It supplies the statistical division of the UN with the Statistical Bulletin, which contains indicators on demography, transport, prices, industry, construction and foreign trade. Goskomstat provides the IMF's International Finance Statistics with data on national accounts, price and industrial indices, employment, wages, exports and imports. As from April 1996 data on the production, stocks, consumption, exports and imports of oil and petro-chemicals are also being supplied to the OECD and the IEA. On a quarterly basis Goskomstat completes the two UN ECE questionnaires: Production, Export and Import of Raw Materials and Steel Production, and Direct Foreign Investments in the Russian Economy. Annually Goskomstat completes about ten UN questionnaires, the ESKATO questionnaire for the Asia and the Pacific Ocean in Figures Yearbook, more than fifty UN ECE questionnaires covering almost all the indicators of sectoral statistics; foreign trade statistics, agricultural production, statistics on production, consumption, price, import and export of fertilisers, and on prices; about twelve UNESCO questionnaires covering social statistics indicators, finance and national accounting statistics; ILO questionnaires for the Statistical Yearbook on Labour, as well as the October Survey on Wages, Working Hours and Retail Foodstuff Prices, including variables to do with demographic and social statistics; the World Bank questionnaire Economic Memorandum of the Country, and a questionnaire for the member-countries of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation Scheme, covering demographic, labour statistics, national accounts, prices, agriculture, foreign trade, industry, transport and construction. Furthermore, Goskomstat provides information on specific requests from international organisations such as the OECD, ILO etc. Despite considerable success in the area of statistical data dissemination and in the provision of equal access to users, demand, especially from the entrepreneurial sector, has not yet been fully satisfied. The principal reasons for this are poor technical equipment, the lack of up-to-date and sustainable communications systems and inadequate publicity. 184 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go DISCUSSANT SIBYLLE VON OPPELN-BRONIKOWSKI - FEDERAL STATISTICAL OFFICE IN WIESBADEN, GERMANY First of all I would like to express my thanks and my respect to the three authors of the papers. Mr Nichiporovich gave a very interesting description of the activities of the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis of the Republic of Belarus. We have for several years had very good relations and co operation with Belarus and I know what efforts they have made and which improvements. The paper presented by Mr Gigineishvili gives a very good overview of the problems but also the progress that was made under very dramatic conditions. I was twice in Tbilisi and I could see it with my own eyes. Mr Sokolin showed us the enormous changes in statistical data dissemination policy. The statistical service of the Russian Federation is becoming more and more part of the service market. I am very proud that we have a publication project with Goskomstat. If you allow I would like to draw your attention now to the dissemination topic: \"Where we are and where we will be\". I'll focus on three aspects: the user approach, the market approach and the media approach. On the way to our users In our democratic society statistical information is a factor that forms public opinion and open society requires that citizens have different chances to inform themselves, to express themselves and to participate in public life. For this reason a democratic state needs independent channels to offer information and to inform public opinion. In this respect statistics is an important source from which the users can obtain information directly or indirectly. This is certainly nothing new for the majority of statisticians because it had been said at all conferences dealing with dissemination for years. At the Federal Statistical Office of Germany it is expressed by the slogan \"Figures for everyone\" which is printed on our envelopes. Figures for everyone is an important principle, a basis for a development of user-oriented approach. Nowadays user-oriented dissemination of information is a task we simply cannot deny. We are on the way to our users and depending on the distance we are still far away from them or closer to them. Many statistical offices are very innovative and creative. That helps to develop a great variety of products and marketing ideas. We have heard some examples from Mr Nichiporovich like this special information project. I have also an example from our Federal Statistical Office of Germany and I will give it to you. We have this little pocket yearbook and we sell more than one hundred thousand copies of it per year. How does that come about? We sell it to banks and companies. We put their sign on it, for example \"Volkswagen\". And then they can present it as a Christmas gift to their customers. Maybe this is a good example and an idea for you as well to put something on the brochures that you have. Some of us have good ideas and this might go on for long time. But it is like a town which does not cease to grow. Some day the old concepts are no longer good but cause trouble. The infrastructure is not sufficient anymore. The same applies to the supply ofinformation. A great variety of new products and services leads to a variety of price and cost regulation. More new customers appear, new versions of contracts are concluded, new media are introduced, the prices of electronic services and products do not suit 185 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go anymore and the competitors appear on the market, the copyright question has to be settled anew, the European and international markets are open. Our daily job - the dissemination ofinformation is characterised by a complex network of procedures and interactions which is partly inconsistent and in the last instance not manageable. Certainly the slogan \"Figures for everyone\" will continue to be the basis of our work, but we have to see and overcome the obstacles I have mentioned which impede our way to the users. Market orientation and marketing An integrated dissemination policy has to define regulations and guidelines of what should be disseminated, to whom, how, when and under what conditions it should be done. An important principle here forming the basis for an efficient and user-oriented dissemination policy is that statistics have to be available in well structured, co-ordinated and documented data banks. There cannot be efficient marketing with scattered and heterogeneous data banks. On this basis a dissemination model can be set up which distinguishes between the following users: \u2022 Public. The principle here is that the basic informational requirements of society shall be met by providing free access to the statistical results which should be granted basically free of charge. Examples:- regular contacts with the press, an information service, on-line service, leaflets, brochures, supply of publications to libraries both our own and external, international exchange of documents; \u2022 Target groups. The principle here is that a publication system should be structured according to target groups and should guarantee the dissemination of standard products and services at fair market prices. Examples:- the statistical yearbook, thematic publications, CD-ROM offers, data banks, branch-related services, data files on diskettes or magnetic tapes; \u2022 Professional users. The principle here is that professional users with scientific or commercial background get desagregated data on-line and off-line, so that the results of statistical surveys can be used more effectively and the duplication of service is avoided. Since special evaluations are very costly the extra cost will have to be paid. Examples:- tailor-made data files from sample surveys, data on production and foreign trade, special evaluations on demand, historical compilations. The challenge of the new media The demand has changed and also the structures of users, but the means of communications of information have developed even faster. Here we can see several aspects: \u2022 as markets become more global and competition more intensive new demand structures develop; \u2022 topical information has to be available everywhere and at any time; \u2022 the new advanced technologies are so dominant on the information market that statisticians must simply take them into consideration; \u2022 the computer has become a medium of everyday work; commercial customers are used to working on computers; \u2022 the global network which was a coarsely knitted one in the past has turned into a fine meshed fabric via the Internet multimedia information flows around the world. All forecasts say that Internet will become a basis of all on-line services. What does this mean to us? The national statistical institutes have to adapt to the new multimedia environment if they want to hold the ground. Since March 1996 the Federal Statistical Office of Germany has offered information on a server of its own and already registered a great number of accesses and considerable degree of acceptance. The concept has the following advantages: -two languages (German and English), the most recent data, speech performance, informative offers, basic 186 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go data press services, full service. That means statistical links to all national statistical institutes all over the world, dialogue-oriented control. We have statistics of users and their trends. Within the framework of the model described above we will try to include all types of users and price regulations via the Internet. From our point of view this new medium will not push the old media into the background. It will only change the function. Printed and electronic products will maintain their rights to exist. In dialogue with our users via the Internet the world shrinks to the size of a television screen. That leaves us more scope for action and organisation. In this connection communication with our users attains a new quality which is directly measurable. Now users can choose from a great variety of information or participate in an interactive dialogue. There is a directly noticeable and available feed back that shows us if the supply ofinformation was good or unsatisfactory. Ideally, the new media will guarantee permanent communication with our customers and finally create a well-identified group of users. This community of interests can control the supply of information. Then a user-oriented dissemination policy will be really possible. DISCUSSANT LARS THYGESEN - DANMARKS STATISTIK, DENMARK Firstly I would like to thank the organisers for inviting me to this stimulating and important seminar in the beautiful city of St. Petersburg. It is a great experience and opportunity to meet colleagues. For the session today we have three extremely interesting papers giving a lot of information on not only the dissemination of statistics, but also the general situation of statistics in Belarus, Georgia, and Russia. I want to compliment the authors for these presentations. The papers touch upon all important aspects of dissemination and I shall just highlight a few of the points which I see as most interesting. The importance of dissemination I would like to say a few words about the importance of dissemination. It might be argued that dissemination is only of secondary importance to our work in official statistics. The first and most crucial task of a central statistical office is to produce high quality statistical information on issues in society that are important to the government as well as for business and the public at large. But our work is no good if this information is not really received by anyone. Dissemination and even marketing is necessary in order to make our work used by those for whom it was intended. Without good dissemination, our work is useless. This is very well reflected in the three papers. The test of official statistics is whether it is being used - and of course if it is being used as it should be used! hi my country it is also quite clear that the reputation of the central statistical office depends on good dissemination and marketing. This is very important when the government decides on the allocation of money. I believe dissemination should be considered a high prestige area of work in statistical agencies and that top management should pay very much attention to it. 187 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The importance of a coherent dissemination strategy It is evident from the presentations that all of the three countries have a wide variety of dissemination channels and that they are aiming at satisfying the needs of many different groups of users. This means that it is necessary to publish statistics with different levels of detail, e.g. at the geographical level. For instance, the press and the general public needs a broad overview while business analysts need more detail, the government and parliament need even more detailed statistics for law preparation, and also researchers need to make their analysis based on very detailed data. Some users need more analysis than others, some like to do the analysis themselves. And consequently, the users want different media of dissemination: paper, diskettes, CD-ROMs, online service. If we are very user-oriented and try to fulfil every whim of the users, there is a great risk of ending up in chaos. It is important to meet all of the needs and at the same time have coherence regarding the contents as well as the formats. This demands a strong standardisation and a dissemination strategy. First of all, this is important because of the users. They need to know that when we speak of one concept, we always mean the same thing. They need to compare one field of statistics with another. It is also important that the figures are presented in a homogeneous way. But it is also important to the statistical office in order to keep up efficient production. All products should be made in one process. In order to accomplish this, it is important to use one common software platform for all dissemination, be it electronic or on paper. This software should support a statistical database (or \"data warehouse\") from which all publications can be drawn. A special organisational unit for dissemination I believe it is important that subject matter statisticians should have the responsibility for dissemination in the sense that they produce the contents and the comments. At the same time it is a good idea to have a special unit for dissemination. This unit should have the responsibility for the setting and enforcement of standards for good dissemination, leading to a coherent and efficient dissemination. They should maintain a dissemination plan. And they should develop expertise in user contacts and communication. The dissemination unit should aim at giving all products a common look and feel. Cost recovery The economic aspects of dissemination are quite important to a central statistical office. Publishing is resource consuming, especially if it is successful. For instance, if we publish a very good book, the users may want a lot of copies which will cost us money. We should try to avoid a situation where big success leads to economic disaster. In this way, bad dissemination is encouraged. Rather, successful dissemination should be encouraged. One answer to this is to make the users pay for the services. The payment should not cover all of the activities, but it would be desirable to have payment at least for the marginal costs of the service. We heard in Mr Sokolin's presentation that, because of legal obstacles, Goskomstat itself is not allowed to sell publications and other services, this has to be left over to an organisation outside. A similar situation seems to exist in Belarus and also in other countries. It would be important to change this situation in order to create strong motivation for dissemination but I realise that this is probably not an easy task. 188 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go I know that the money that could be involved may not at present be very large sums but it might be encouraging anyway to have the incentive to sell. And I can tell you that in my country, one third of the total budget of official statistics comes from selling services, books, etc. In my office, we have a small but well functioning Statistics Shop in the library where users may buy publications, diskettes, etc. We have heard that Goskomstat wants to create such an \"Information Centre'\" and indeed my office is involved in the Tacis project aiming at building this centre. I sincerely hope that Goskomstat will be successful in this project. The importance of good documentation I found it especially interesting to see in the Belarus paper the discussion of interpretation and misinterpretation of their statistics. This is an important and difficult area. There is a great risk that users may misunderstand what we are publishing. The first precondition is that we explain what we publish. What the content is. What the figures show - and what they do not show. This leads me to the concept of metadata: The description of the data and statistics that we make (or data on data). Without metadata the data are useless. Metadata should be used intensively whenever we disseminate the statistics. As a common basis for our work in the statistical office, it is therefore important to create a database containing all our descriptions and documentation of our data: The Metadatabase. This Metadatabase should be integrated with the statistical database which I mentioned earlier. I should add, however, that creating a complete Metadatabase is not an easy task. Many of us have worked on this problem for many years without reaching the perfect solution. Our independence should be recognised Pre-announce fixed dates for publishing all important statistical indicators. And stick to these dates no matter what happens - almost. Otherwise we will be suspected of trying to manipulate the public even if we are just doing our best. Of course there may be force majeure situations where it is necessary to postpone the publication but it has to be a very good reason. Publish them simultaneously for everybody. This is of course easier said than done. Powerful forces want us to reveal information to them exclusively or earlier than others. These may include ministers, colleagues in the public administration or people operating on the stock exchange. And I know from personal experience that it can be almost impossible to resist these powers. 189 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go DISCUSSANT HILKKA VIHAVAINEN - STATISTICS FINLAND General remarks Dissemination is a very important issue today. All three papers - by Mr Nichiporovich, by Mr Ginineishvili and Mr Sokolin - show that increasingly larger amounts of resources have been and will have to be allocated to the dissemination of data in the future. The general trend is quite similar not only in the transition countries but also in the so-called western economies. Both the contents and the layout of printed and electronic publications must be better than before, and they must be published at a faster rate. The time lag between the collection of data and the release of the processed data needs to become shorter. This development is inevitable if statistical institutes intend to react to the competition in the information markets and if they wish to ensure their future by better service to their clients. In my comments I shall concentrate only on two different items. The first one is the need for a dissemination strategy and the second one is public relations between statistical offices and the mass media. In doing this I shall try to relate a few of our good experiences, which might also give rise to ideas for the other countries. The need for a dissemination strategy and for an implementation programme The dissemination policy of Statistics Finland changed completely about ten years ago. Publications used to be prepared so that the publication itself was considered the end of the production line. The question of for whom or for what purpose the publications are made never arose. In those days publications were distributed free of charge. Since then the change has been quite considerable. And it still continues. Marketing principles were adopted and publications as well as most other services were made subject to charge (with the exception of the library services, brief telephone services and press releases). Market analysis and customer surveys were also applied. The result has been highly satisfactory. We have been able to develop better products to clearly targeted audiences. The products sell quite well (even though statistical reports and other statistical products are hardly best-sellers). It is, however, essential that both positive and negative feedback is received. Both are necessary in order to further develop our products. The point which I want to raise here is the following: eventually it will be necessary to analyse the needs of different users more thoroughly and to process strategy and implementation plans for the dissemination of the data products. Relations with the mass media However good our statistics might be - timely, accurate, reliable - and however efficient dissemination tools we might have - printed, electronic or whatever - we cannot be fully sure that the different actors of society are aware of what we have to offer. Besides marketing we need active and efficient public relations with the mass media. This item was mentioned in the paper of Mr Sokolin and also in the oral presentation of Mr Nichiporovich. This area is also highly prioritised in our office. Why? We believe that if we can get the mass media convinced of our creditability, it has a great effect on how well decision-makers both in the public sector and in the private sector can make use of our figures, and also that ordinary citizens have - at least in principle - the chance to access statistical information on society. Mass media can, in the best case, be a major promoter of democracy by reporting on the economic and social developments in society on the basis of reliable and relevant statistical data. 190 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go To have relations on the matter-of-fact level we have formulated the principles of our dissemination policy, which characterises our way of thinking about publicity. In our case, journalists and reporters often contact our various experts directly. It is therefore important that we all have more or less the same kind of principles when dealing with the mass media. The principles are the following: Reliability * information to be disseminated should be correct, and if mistakes occur they should be visibly corrected; * all essential information should be presented; * information activities and services should be organised in such a way that as few errors as possible are caused by the lack of time; * the quality (e.g. representativeness, comparability) and meaning (where and how the data were collected, what they describe) of the disseminated information should be made known. Timeliness and topicality * statistical data should be published as soon as possible without compromising the reliability of the data; * when publishing statistics attention should be paid to topical issues of society at any given time (seek to find news in the tables). Equal access * every citizen should have access to basic statistical information on society; * statistical information should be popularised in such a way that everyone can understand the message conveyed without any knowledge of special concepts; * citizens should have the possibility of drawing their own conclusions on the basis of statistical releases (for instance, it is advisable to have tabulations attached to the text for those who are interested in judging for themselves) Impartiality (disinterestedness) * expressing opinions on social issues should be avoided, but publishing data that brings certain groups or organisations into an unfavourable light should not be shunned either; * stigmatising of individual groups of people, areas etc. should be avoided, however. Analytical quality * statistics should be sufficiently interpreted (e.g. it should be explained whether the change is big or small) and developments should be tied to their causal chain (e.g. the reason for the change should be explained); * different statistics should be compared, contrasted and combined in order to give users as many- sided a picture of society as possible. Transparency * reliable statistics should not be secret; basic data concerning any individual household or enterprise are naturally highly confidential, but all the metadata - methods, concepts and classifications, questionnaires etc., are available for anyone * advance information on publication schedules should be given to the public and the data should be delivered to all interested parties simultaneously (this is especially important when publishing 191 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go statistics subject to insider rules). We publish advance information three times a year on forthcoming statistical bulletins including fixed dates for some of the main short-term indicators, such as the CPI, the monthly indicator of total output, employment and unemployment. Informing in advance has clearly generated greater interest in our bulletins and improved the chance of being noticed by the media and other users of statistics. It has also improved co-ordination between Statistics Finland and other producers of statistics. Furthermore, it has brought about a change in the operating culture of Statistics Finland, as a result of which statistics can now be released according to a very strict timetable. Active role * debate carried out in society should be followed and be reported on, and other interesting information obtainable from statistical data should be sought; * the usability of statistical data for different user groups should be continuously improved; * new audiences should be sought; * new ways of developing communication techniques should be continuously sought. Reference to the source of information * The information presented has to be authorised. The role of the statistical office should be emphasised. However, other producers of data should be respected and acknowledged as well. Marketing of the products and the services: * data consumers should be given guidance in their search for information; * a realistic and positive picture of the services of the statistical office should be conveyed. The relations with the media should be as interactive as possible. We for our part try to help journalists in their work. In this context we improved our news service recently. We have adopted a distribution system by which press releases can be simultaneously mailed in the public postal system, faxed, or sent to clients by electronic mail. The client can choose in which form she/he wishes to receive the information. The quickest way is by electronic mail and the slowest by the conventional postal system. At present the statistical news service is free of charge. In the near future we will, however, begin charging clients other than the media for the transmission costs incurred. The news itself will continue to be free of charge and can be obtained at no extra expense via. for example, the Internet. The fast growing Internet network is becoming a workable alternative for making the dissemination of statistical news and other information more effective. Statistics Finland has its own home page in the Internet data network. Internet solves many problems relating to communication policies and technology. Press conferences are, of course, in some cases important. However, press conferences are not held very often. Instead of press conferences, we have started to arrange seminars where we can give information about forthcoming changes in the time series resulting from revisions in the statistical methodology or harmonisation in concepts and classifications. Training courses on the statistical information have also been organised just for journalists. In the future there will be more common projects with the mass media where together we shall try to find the best possible ways of presenting and interpreting difficult and quite abstract information, which statistical information essentially is. 192 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go We believe that these kinds of activities have helped the mass media in most cases to use statistical information correctly as well as to understand - at least to some extent - the difficulties in measuring changes in a continuously changing economy and society. This kind of co-operation should be important also in the countries of transition where statistical institutes surely need public understanding and goodwill. To some extent statisticians and the media can be said to sit in the same boat: they try to tell the truth about society - however difficult it can sometimes be. 193 ",

I have got very many positive responses about the substance of this seminar. I am happy that we are now in the situation to make some conclusions. I hope we shall have good innovative ideas for our future work. If the seminar is good then the conclusions should also be good. Oui - high-level advisors Mr Holder, Mr Mothe and Mr De Vries have very carefully listened,the whole week to your presentations and the discussions. They will now present their ideas about what will be the outcome of the seminar: recommendations and conclusions. I would like to point out that the recommendations are especially for your national work. You can take them into consideration when you are implementing your national programmes, but of course they are also an input to the work which we are doing together with you.

FORMER PRESIDENT OF FEDERAL STATISTICAL OFFICE, GERMANY Closing remarks on Session I: Statistical Legislation A hundred years ago a prominent lawyer and philosopher maintained that one had to fight for one's rights. Statisticians have fought for their rights, claimed them publicly and demanded laws to serve as a basis for their work. The rights of statistical authorities vis-\u00e0-vis anyone to have information and the protection of statistics from interference in the production process by the state and others must be governed by legislation in the same way as the scale of statistical work, the responsibility of statisticians and the ways of performing this task and bearing the responsibility. Statisticians thus fight not just for themselves but for the rights of society and every individual for truth as well as true and free information. The difference between \"where we were\"' and \"where we are\" shows that statisticians, in their struggle for justice, have achieved significant success and made significant progress. Two papers have been given: a) Mr V. I. Goryachkovsky gave us a detailed account of the regulations in force in Kazakhstan and the tasks set out in them for statistics, important sub-functions such as the operation of the national population register and the register of legal persons, as well as telling us about the protection of business secrets of enterprises. He also pointed out that the implementation of the regulations sometimes created problems. b) Mr Ion Tobultoc informed us about the situation in Moldova in a written version of his paper and in a lively address with numerous interesting details; he also told us about the difficulties of applying the law in day-to-day administrative and political activity. Both papers are well worth reading and merit a detailed appreciation. I would like to thank their authors very much. 197 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In almost all the papers on the seminar themes, the legal situation was dealt with or touched upon, and therefore we now have a great deal of information from the CIS states. I would also like to thank the discussants, Mr Bodin of the INSEE in France and Mr Herbertz from the Federal Statistical Office in Germany, for their contributions in which they depicted the legal situation in their countries. All these contributions traced out the considerable progress made in the last few years. This applies in particular to the countries previously forming part of the Soviet Union, but many western countries, too, have made substantial progress compared with the situation 10 or 20 years ago. A major element behind this development in both the east and west was the Fundamental Principles for Official Statistics developed by the CES in Geneva and adopted in 1992, in which important ideas were formulated for achieving correct, neutral and objective state statistics. Although they were regarded by some with a degree of condescension to begin with, they proved to be a good initial basis for the struggle for a stable legal system for statistics. Mr Griffin has announced that, now that there has been a breakthrough, they, too, are to be further improved. Summing up, therefore, one can say that the path out of the past and into the present has rapidly produced remarkable results. In the initial stages there is a surprising similarity between the legal bases for statistics in the countries whose statisticians are taking part in this seminar. Is no more important work needed therefore? Do we not need to go any further? The answer is: we have to go further. Where are we going There are several considerations which point to the need for future action: a) It is not enough to have a law. It has to be a good law which also entitles statisticians to conduct the necessary enquiries, issue the necessary orders and carry out the necessary surveys, as well as safeguarding their independence from non-statistical bodies and satisfactorily setting out the procedures for publishing information. The papers and discussions indicated the odd weak point in otherwise good legislation. b) It is not enough, either, to have a good law. It has to be obeyed, adhered to, filled out and implemented. There are still a few wishes which need to be dealt with in this connection. Support for the statistical community needs to be organised and rendered effective. c) The tasks of statistics are not limited to the national sphere: it is in the national interests for statistics to be really comparable with the data of neighbouring states and other countries. All national statistical bodies must also make their contributions to the statistical data of international communities such as the European Union or regional economic areas and, in the final analysis, to world statistics. This entails comparable organisational and methodological decisions which need to be backed up by legislation. d) In his contribution as moderator, Mr Griffin said that legislation was a tool which could ensure the quality of statistical work. I agree; that is why there has to be international standardisation as there is for other tools for which there needs to be international comparability. One can most probably go some way towards agreeing with Mr Bodin that there are national particularities calling for a special ruling. It is, however, equally clear that there is an area which is identical in all states, or whose content could be dealt with in a similar fashion, and, for the sake of statistical truth, should 198 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go be. It could be governed by national laws containing provisions which concur with each other on this particular point, or by an international agreement. In other words, we need to go further. Experience with laws and other legal provisions in the individual states needs to be utilised. Existing laws will serve as the paving stones for the road into the future. As partners with both similar and different experience, the statisticians from the EU, the countries attending this seminar and those from the Phare region should do the preparatory work and start drafting a specimen international regulation for official statistics. The close economic links which these states already have or are trying to establish between themselves also underline the political value of such steps. If this contribution had not been scheduled for the end of the seminar and there had been an opportunity to discuss a proposal likely to attract the public's attention, I would have proposed issuing a St. Petersburg Declaration. Instead, I would like to suggest the following: 1. Being aware that reliable, topical statistical data are similar in importance to a reliable and stable monetary system for developing international economic links, the statistical offices of the states forming the EU or supported by the Tacis and Phare assistance programmes should develop a standard international agreement on the legal basis for official statistics in these states. The text should first be drafted as an experts' model only, and should then be passed on to the states and communities of states with the recommendation to conclude appropriate treaties. 2. The preliminary work should be assigned to a working party of 8 to 12 members to which Eurostat, the CIS Statistical Committee, Goskomstat Russia, the statistical office of a further country assisted by the Tacis Programme, the statistical office of a central European state (Phare) and the statistical offices of three of the EU member states should assign one member each, to be designated specifically by name. 3. The working party should be chaired and run by Eurostat. 4. Representatives of other statistical organisations (e.g. the CES) could be invited to individual meetings as guests or could present their opinions. 5. The working party, using a questionnaire drafted by it, should determine the current situation and wishes and ideas of all countries involved regarding an international standardised regulation. 6. The working party should draw up a list of the issues and items to be standardised and the answers and solutions it works out with regard to them. It should also develop a draft agreement. Both would be adopted by the working party by a simple majority vote. 7. The results of the work mentioned in 6) would be presented together with the overruled minority proposals to Eurostat, the CIS Statistical Committee and the statistical offices of all participating countries, with a request for an opinion to be delivered within 10 weeks. 8. The heads of all the participating statistical offices would confer at a meeting and decide by simple majority vote on individual contentious formulations and on the proposal as a whole. Voting in writing would also be permitted if the offices and authorities which had delegated representatives to the working party agreed to this by a simple majority vote. 9. The draft would then be presented to the governments of the participating states and to the political supervisors of participating organisations with a request to adopt it by law. 199 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go A joint initiative on standardising statistics on the basis of this proposal would not only have major practical and economic advantages but also ensure that political authorities became more aware of statistics and thus attract more support for them. * * # ALAIN M O T HE - HIGH LEVEL ADVISER, INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA STATISTIQUE ET DES ETUDES ECONOMIQUES, FRANCE Closing remarks on Session II: Organisation and Management of statistical activities First, I would first like to thank Azerba\u00efdjan and the Russian Federation for their papers which were extremely interesting. In particular I am sure some of us will have found the background sketched by Azerba\u00efdjan very informative and, in my view, future plans appear to be very clear-sighted. I should also like to pay tribute to the frankness with which the Russian Federation depicted the situation as it existed in the past and the problems it now encounters. Mr Luttikhuizen and Mr Bodin supplemented the papers successfully, the former by looking more closely at the organisational problems linked to information technology, Mr Bodin by looking at two fundamental problems touched on briefly in the papers. Much could be said about the points raised in these papers and in the ensuing discussion, but I shall dwell only on some points which appear to me of particular importance. 1. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the territorial organisation of statistics was very similar in the various countries of the CIS. The programme was centralised, with technical directives being issued by the Central Office of the Union and determined by the needs of the Plan. 2. After 1990, the same trends emerged everywhere. a) A sovereign statistical body was created in each State. This body enjoys extensive powers in its field and is protected, in principle, by legislation. Its role is to co-ordinate the statistical aspects of the other bodies involved, such as the Central Bank, the Customs' authorities, etc... Its task is to adjust the statistical apparatus to the move towards a market economy and to bring the country's data into line with international standards. b) The Computing Centre is linked to the central statistical body and retains a vital role in processing the collected data. c) New units are being created in the Central Office to undertake tasks such as compiling price indices, classifications, external trade figures, the national accounts. The gradual transformation of statistics on economic units also means changes in the organisation processing them. d) The national statistical offices are obliged to train their staff in techniques such as the use of microcomputers, sampling theory, national accounts, etc. Wherever possible they recruit specialists. International co-operation is particularly useful in providing assistance with this training in new techniques. 200 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go In all countries, the training and the recruitment of specialists are hampered by the low salary levels; after training, some staff leave the Statistical Office, attracted by the better standard of living offered by salaries in banks or in private enterprises. 3. Obviously the above developments, which in my view go in the right direction, occur at different speeds, depending on political will and above all on the national situation. Likewise, future plans, which are similar in theory, are likely to differ greatly between countries in practice. 4. The discussion has shown that fundamental questions concerning the organisation of statistical activities are posed in the medium or long-term. a) First question: Should the staff in the statistical bodies remain the same as in the past or should changes be made? To be more precise, should there not be fewer but more qualified employees? And if the answer is yes, what is the long-term objective in terms of manpower levels and qualification structure? b) Second question: the gradual availability of information technology for statisticians will lead to a change in the tasks of the Computing Centres, which will be more focused on technological problems, the overall organisation of information technology and the planning of important projects. How will this change affect the role of the Computing Centre and the composition of its staff? c) Third question: Changes should continue to be made in the organisation chart of the Central Offices, not only to adapt to the new statistical products, but also because important qualitative changes will gradually transform the relative importance of the various tasks. The increasing role played by the dissemination of statistical information and its analysis will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the proportion of staff devoted to this task. For example, in France, 15% of the staff of the Statistical Institute work on the dissemination of data. Similarly, the co-ordination of the statistical work of various government bodies will require specialised staff at Central Office level. Measuring the informal, or \"underground:\", economy is undoubtedly particularly crucial in the countries in transition in order to assess the state of the economy and to compile reliable national accounts. Would it not be a good idea to create a special cell in each Office to discuss the methodology of such measurement and to organise the necessary activities? d) Fourth question: Should the very \"splintered\" structure of the statistical organisation inherited from the USSR be retained? The Russian Federation has 2 419 establishments, a very large number! A small country like Azerba\u00efdjan has more than 70 establishments, which is also a lot! In any event, such \"splintering\" exists only in countries from the former Communist block. In France, with around thirty establishments for 60 million inhabitants, we consider that we have too many. Some thought should be given to whether this structure should be retained in the long term. Should district Offices be regrouped or even gradually abandoned? Should establishments specialise by geographical level, for example by entrusting work on small enterprises mainly to the district Offices? As suggested by the Director General of the Czech Statistical Office, should the regional Offices, even the district offices, be given certain national tasks, so that these offices can create what are known in France as \"centres of skill\"? 201 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Personally I have no very definite opinion. It is clear that the current organisation has advantages; in particular, it allows statisticians to gain a sound knowledge of the enterprises. However, the proximity between statisticians and respondents will lose some of its advantages as transport and telecommunications develop. In addition, geographical breakdown into very small teams is not compatible with the specialisation and higher qualifications needed to introduce more sophisticated techniques. Inevitably, any changes in the geographical organisation are likely to pose enormous human problems. This is why they should be studied as soon as possible so than any changes can be introduced gradually, at the very least as current staff are replaced. e) Fifth question: Are there enough staff in the central Offices? Two comments indicate that the answer is no (perhaps with the exception of Russia): 1) Staff levels are far higher in other developed countries (for a given population); 2) They tackle a far more important and diverse range of tasks than before 1990, while staff levels have not changed. f) Sixth question: What measures should be taken to train existing staff in the new techniques and to recruit high quality specialists for data processing, sample surveys, national accounts, publications, etc.? This problem has been raised by various speakers at our seminar. It was highlighted as a major problem because it involves changing the habits of all staff at all levels. A decision should be reached on how to organise such training. Should a specialist training body be created alongside the Central Office, as is the case in some countries? Or should there be a cell responsible for organising the training, while the training itself is entrusted to experts? In conclusion, while this seminar has made a substantial contribution to the discussion on the organisation and management of statistical activities, it is necessary to go even further and plan important developments for the long term. Since these developments can only be introduced gradually, the sooner they are prepared the better. * * * WILLEM DE VRIES - HIGH LEVEL ADVISER, STATISTICS NETHERLANDS Closing remarks on Session III: Relations and Co-ordination among National Administrations\" and Session V: Modernisation of data collection First of all, I would like to say that during the four years or so that the Tacis-programme for statistics has been operational, enormous progress has been made. That is also one of the reasons why this conference has been so successful; it has very much addressed the issues and I had the feeling that we understood each other better than in the past. Of course this is not only due to the efforts of the European Union and its Members States, but also to the work of other international organisations. However, I think Europe may be proud to have taken part in this revolutionary process of changing the statistical systems in the republics of the former Soviet Union into systems that are able to serve emerging democratic market economies. We have seen progress in many areas: legislation, data collection, computer technology, statistical organisation, dissemination and accepting international standards in many areas of statistics. 202 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The problem of a statistical adviser like myself is, in my experience, that for a specific situation in a specific country, some useful advice may be given, based on one's experience and knowledge of best practices, but that it is always very difficult to give general advice to a group of countries that may be in the same process of change, but that are nevertheless very different also, in many respects. Therefore, I will necessarily have to restrict myself to some generalities concerning the two areas that I am supposed to speak about: in the first place national co-ordination and co-operation of the statistical office with other institutions, primarily government agencies, and secondly data collection methods. Now these two areas are very closely inter-related. Co-operation with other agencies is of course very much a function of the organisational structure of the national statistical system. I shall give you just three models that may be considered typical. There are very centralised statistical systems, such as in my own country the Netherlands. There are countries where the statistical system is rather decentralised, but with a rather firm grip from the central statistical office on statistical work undertaken by others. And there are countries where the statistical system is not only decentralised, but where the central office in fact does not have a very strong grip on the whole system. I think this applies to the United States, where more than 70 government agencies do statistical work, not even counting the individual states, and it also applied to the United Kingdom, until it was decided to merge some of the important agencies into one Office for National Statistics. So co-operation is different under each of these types of systems. And even in centralised systems, such as the Dutch system, a lot of co-operation with others is necessary, for many different reasons. Some of these reasons I will discuss later on. During this conference, co-operation was mentioned and discussed a number of times. However, one type of co-operation was not mentioned at all and I think, nevertheless, that it is very important. I am referring to co-operation with respondents. In the Netherlands, and in fact in several other countries, we have come to the conclusion that, regardless of all the legal instruments that you may have to force respondents to fill out your questionnaires, there is nothing more important than trying to establish a good working relationship with them. I know that, so far, the discipline of your respondents has always been very high, but that may soon change. Our experience is, that it is far more important to try and change them into a sort of partners, rather than to force them. In other words: every successful survey begins with the respondents. First rule: Try to speak their language. This applies not only to business surveys, but to household surveys as well. Try to find out what information they can and what they cannot, or not very easily supply. A good questionnaire is at least half of the success of a survey. And I am not even speaking of techniques such as electronic questionnaires or EDI, because that is for the future. Second rule: do not ask what other government agencies have already asked. And of course do not repeat your own questions unnecessarily. Not asking what other government agencies already know, that sounds simple, and of course it is not. However, always try to use the information that others may already have available. I know that this is easier said than done, because there may be all kinds of legal and other restrictions, but at least you should try to get the data from them. Third rule: do not collect information that other government bodies may collect better and/or have already collected. I am of course referring to such institutions as Customs, the Central Bank, taxation offices, social security organisations, local authorities, other types of holders of public registrations. Do not see them as competitors, but as potential partners. I know from my own experience that there are often serious barriers to be overcome. One of the obstacles is, obviously, that data exchange between statistical offices and other government agencies as a rule has to remain one-way traffic, because of the absolute confidentiality rules that NSIs have to respect. Also, it is not always easy to use the information that others may have, because they use other definitions, standards, concepts or time-frames. Nevertheless, one should try to influence their data collections in such a way that they 203 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go become better suited for statistical purposes. This is not an easy process, but one has to be determined and patient. Negotiations may take considerable time, but occasionally there may be sudden success. In this whole process, one should also be as flexible as possible. Data may not be 100% right for statistical purposes, but it is always better to have information that is 80% right than no information at all. So my advice would also be to actively search for information that others may have. You may discover unexpected data sources in the process. And do not forget the private sector either. The most important issues here are: reducing response burden and be more cost-effective at the same time. Now, about the more traditional data collection methods, such as sampling from your business registers and sending out questionnaires, I think that in most of your countries, good systems are in the process of being developed. Naturally, priorities have to be set. I would suppose that in this respect the need of your national accounts department is the leading factor. Possibly they are even trying to set up systems for making - and using input-output tables, maybe even social accounting matrices (which would be good as a guideline for your social statistics collections). Measuring the shadow economy also has to be an essential priority in this respect. I would suggest that there is room for harmonisation here. Our impression is that the shadow economy is measured in too many different ways in your countries. Therefore, setting up a working group to analyse the possibilities for further harmonisation in this area would be most useful. As I said, the response burden of businesses is probably not yet an issue in your countries, but it may soon become one. Therefore, it would be good if you were kept informed on developments in the west in this respect. Some experience with EDI may be gained by developing standard statistical messages between your offices and between your offices and international organisations. Eurostat may take the lead in this respect. We have heard quite a lot these days about regional offices and whether they are useful or should gradually be abolished. I must say that I have no clear view yet. It all has to do with communications. Even in a small country such as the Netherlands, where communications are so excellent that a letter is guaranteed to be delivered in one working day, and where everybody has telephone and fax, and more and more people have e-mail, we have a corps of regionally operating field staff to keep us in touch with businesses. So what about large countries such as the Russian Federation where the communications are still relatively poor? It takes five days for a letter to be delivered within greater Leningrad, I was told. In such a country, regional offices must necessarily have an important function for many years to come. However, their function may change gradually. It is important to make the best possible use of their potential. So I would think: give them some liberty to be creative, apart from their traditional functions. Like in Australia and the Czech Republic, you may think of making them responsible for certain areas of statistics, nationally. Why not make St. Petersburg responsible for nationwide statistics of the services sector? It would certainly stimulate the officials there to be more involved, and to get even better qualified as well as better paid. ALAIN MOTHE - HIGH LEVEL ADVISER, INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA STATISTIQUE ET DES ETUDES ECONOMIQUES, FRANCE Closing remarks on Session IV: Conformity with international standards All the speakers, whether they were referring specifically to the question of achieving conformity with international standards or dealing with other subjects, emphasised, during the seminar, the priority given to achieving conformity. 204 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go It is clearly the top priority of all the CIS countries in the statistical field. The task is \u03af\u03bf join in this way the world community, to be able to make comparisons with other countries, and to meet the requests of international organisations. 1. The first question is: what are international standards? As far as I know, there is no definition of this expression. Clearly, the term \"international standards\" covers concepts, classifications, the System of National Accounts, and also a number of statistical products in various fields of activity. But are there worldwide standards for data quality, confidentiality, lead times for obtaining results etc. We shall consider here the most restrictive definition, without going into these various aspects. 2. In its paper, the CIS Statistical Committee states that this is one of its main tasks: it makes recommendations so that all the CIS countries can make comparisons with each other and with other countries, and reply to questionnaires from international organisations. This indicates to me that the CIS Statistical Committee is in fact doing its job. The CIS Statistical Committee's document describes very clearly the various fields of activity in which work on standardisation has been done, and states what still remains to be done. I will therefore not repeat this, but just summarise the main points. 3. The most striking progress has been made in the fields which are new to the CIS countries. This may appear paradoxical, but it is quite normal: it is often easier to construct than to alter, to create completely anew rather than to change old habits. Thus: - In all the countries, a consumer price index based on recorded prices appears to have been compiled; in spite of difficulties due to very high inflation, the results already seem to be quite acceptable in many cases; - In all the countries, external trade and balance of payment statistics have been compiled, but in many cases their reliability needs to be improved; - In all the countries, work has begun on drawing up national accounts in accordance with the UN system; the CIS countries are now capable of publishing the main accounts and aggregates regularly. The CIS Statistical Committee is trying to assemble 1990-1995 series for the various countries. Naturally, the most detailed data and specific accounts, such as the financial accounts, constant-price accounts and input-output tables, are not yet available in most cases. Obviously, the reliability of the accounts is very dependent on the information collected; in particular, the poor recording of the informal economy often affects the reliability to a significant extent. Nevertheless, the progress made in just a few years is quite dramatic in some cases. - To such an extent that the CIS countries now take part in international programmes to compare purchasing powers. 4. Progress is slower in other conversion fields, but still significant. Two categories of basic instruments for official statistics have had to be changed in order to conform to international standards, i.e. directories and classifications. - In all the countries, a start has been made on compiling a register of enterprises and other economic units for statistical purposes: in general this register is common to all government authorities; the rate of progress is very variable, but the project seems to be given priority by all concerned. 205 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - In all the countries, the classifications used are being reorganised in line with the UN system; in many cases the work on economic activities classifications is quite advanced, that on products and services less so. A whole series of other classifications (geographical, on trades and professions, on qualifications etc.) are also being revamped. Major conversions in other fields have already been carried out in general. - Industrial production indices are calculated in most of the countries in accordance with international practice. - Indicators for agriculture have also been adapted, but less progress has been made in this sector. - Even less progress has been made in the other sectors of the economy (building, transport, services etc.). - In all the countries, an effort is being made to implement the IMF recommendations on government finance statistics; much remains to be done to achieve good quality results, but work has begun. 5. Little progress has been made as yet in certain important fields. Two fields where little progress seems to have been made in general are statistics on enterprises and social statistics. The statistics on enterprises inherited from the communist system are very different from those in the market economy countries. They are exhaustive and very detailed, whereas ours are much more global, and use sampling techniques. Much caution is required in making the transition from the one system to the other, because of the different backgrounds, and also because the internal structure of the statistical departments has to be turned upside down in many cases. This process has begun in most of the countries, but several years' work is still required. In each subsector of the economy, (industry, agriculture, construction, transport, services and trade) the parties involved induce the need for special indicators, progress on which varies from one country to another. Social statistics also seem to require much work over the next few years. If progress often seems slow in this field, it is because it is expensive. Establishing regular surveys on employment or earnings, or revamped surveys on household budgets, requires not only an investment in methodology, but also financial appropriations, which some countries have not been able to procure. 6. In conclusion, I should like to mention a number of considerations which in the main were raised during the interesting discussion after the talks on achieving conformity with international standards. ( l ) There are standards, but we must also consider how they are to be implemented. Identical concepts can cover different realities, depending on the country and the methodology concerned. Some examples have been given, such as the number of doctors per head of population, which does not take account of their working hours, or the number of hospital beds per head of population, which is not a true reflection of the quality of care given to the sick. In the same way, the varying degrees to which the informal economy is taken into account must be specified for users. It must therefore be clearly explained what the figures mean, either in methodological notes or the introduction, as the UN recommends. 206 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go (2) There are different levels of international standards. World standards are set by organisations such as the UN, the ILO and the IMF. But there are standards for large areas of the world, which apply these standards and specify them. The European Union has its own standards. The CIS Statistical Committee is trying to establish standards for the CIS countries. I consider that one important question has been neglected, or at least little discussed in these papers. This is, whether the \"regional standards\" of the CIS countries should be as close as possible to European Union standards, particularly for classijications and national accounts. Some countries have used the European standards, others have not. Personally, I feel that taking European standards into account certainly offers the CIS countries more advantages than disadvantages. (3) The high degree of priority accorded by the CIS countries to achieving conformity with international standards does not seem to be in dispute: this enables international comparisons to be made, it give authority to analyses of the economic situation in a given country by interested parties throughout the world; lastly, it enables statistical offices to maintain their independence from governments, which are thus shielded from the temptation to manipulate concepts. It is the responsibility of the heads of the statistical offices to defend the independence of the figures themselves, apart from their independence in the matter of concepts. EGON HOLDER - HIGH LEVEL ADVISER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF FEDERAL STATISTICAL OFFICE, GERMANY Closing remarks on Session VI: Dissemination policy and relations with the users of statistics Publications, Announcements, Press, PR, Sale ofinformation and Texts We have heard three different contributions by Mr Nichiporovich (Belarus), Mr Gigineishvili (Georgia), and Mr Sokolin (Russian Federation), all of which were very worthwhile. They dealt with several aspects of dissemination from press information to the statistical yearbook and the office library. We are very grateful for these contributions, which will undoubtedly be of great use for our future work. I should also like to thank the discussants, Mrs von Oppeln-Bronikowski (Germany), Mr Thygesen (Denmark) and Mrs Vihavainen (Finland) for their suggestions and their descriptions of practice in their own Offices. I should also like to thank Mr de Vries for skilfully chairing the morning session. This whole subject is endless in its scope and I shall therefore restrict myself to a number of points which have struck me today and make some suggestions for work in the coming years. In a modern state it is politically and legally necessary to make the results of statistical work available not only to the government and administration but to all interested parties. Economic as well as political decisions often depend on statistical information, not only for a country's own citizens, but also for the foreign partners with whom one wishes to deal. This accessibility for everyone is the reason why statistics are so important nowadays, and it can only be achieved through the various forms of publication. Publication is therefore in fact part and parcel of the production of statistical information, since only skilful publication makes usable results available to the public at large. On the other hand, publication has similarities with the distribution of manufactured goods and can be compared with the marketing phase. In any event, the publication of statistical data should not pass through the filter of other bodies, but be carried out by and under the full responsibility 207 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go of the statistical authorities, since the statistical process must not only be, but must be seen to be, neutral and objective. What, however, are the differences between the various types of publication, who are the partners, what are the procedures, and can the results of official statistical work be sold? As a rule, official statistics should not disclose or disseminate individual data - in other words data on individual persons or businesses. Information of this kind is just the raw material used for calculating aggregated data. Data which can and should be published fall roughly into three categories as regards the appropriate form of publication: Type of information 1 ) Important topical data with great political or economic significance 2) Details regarding important data, special data, including detailed breakdown 3) \"Cross-sectional\" information, regular or ad hoc Type of publication Press announcement direct and/or via press agency, hitherto usually free of charge Through the media, printed or electronic periodicals, free of charge or for a fee Yearbooks, periodicals, monthly or weekly digests, specialised series, (eg. \"women\" or \"trade\") in printed or electronic form, usually sold or supplied for a fee. In addition to these, there are evaluations carried out for academic or political purposes or in response to requests from customers, i.e. information service in the broadest sense. Users should also be divided into three categories: Target group 1) Government, parliament, official bodies in own country, international bodies with claims to information (e.g. UN) 2) Private customers, such as the media and academic and economic circles, which produce new derived products and hence make profits 3) Miscellaneous, requests by individual citizens, small businessmen, etc. Fee? If statistics financed by the State, no fee as a rule. Persons or bodies making profits out of statistics should pay an appropriate fee. However, in the case of the media, the PR aspect may justify waiving the fee. If no particular efforts are required, free of charge. If necessary, special information centre as contact point, possibly selling books etc. 208 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: ^ Where we were, where we are, where we go This list provides a basis for making decisions. The determining factor must always be the possible market - in other words whether or not there are enough people or bodies willing and able to pay. If not, it might help to compress the information on offer. For example, for sales in Western Europe and the United States a summary account of several of the countries of the former Soviet Union or a compilation of the data for several of these countries in a single volume might stand more chance of being sold than individual accounts. Because of its size and consequent importance, the Russian Federation would be the only exception. After publication, official statistics are usually not subject to copyright, and can be reproduced by anyone. However, several agencies sell important official statistics not only to the media, but directly to business partners and customers via on-line services. Because of the influence which national accounts statistics, price statistics or statistics of orders received exert on the money and commodities markets, early knowledge of data of this kind is very valuable, particularly for the stock exchange. This is particularly true of data from the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and France and in the near future similar data from the Russian Federation will be equally important, and greater account will also be taken of regional data from the rest of the CIS. It is therefore worth considering making information available to agencies - which already supply their customers more quickly - about an hour earlier, but for a fee. This would, of course, be possible only in the case of economically important countries or large regions. It would be in the interests of world-wide use of statistics if sub-areas were not only processed using standardised methods, but if the results were also published in standardised and hence comparable form. For this reason, those responsible for publications, should, at a seminar to be held following written preparations, first of all develop a model for publications by subject, frequency and breakdown. They should also establish the criteria according to which the data should be produced and evaluated in terms of reliability. The idea of developing an international \"seal of quality\" for publications meeting a given standard is also worth considering. This would promote sales. Special editions for specific purposes, on an ad hoc or regular subscription basis, would be a useful service provided by statisticians for industry, the media and organisations, whose work would thus be made substantially easier and cheaper. Special editions of this kind should be produced regularly for a fee. They would also promote an understanding of our work on the part of customers. Depending on requirements in practice, information centres should be set up in the Statistical Offices. In the simplest case, these would sell the Office's own publications together with those of neighbouring countries or countries which are important for other reasons. These centres could also answer oral questions. Also important is the possibility of arranging smaller events with customers and the parties responsible for providing information as both data suppliers and data users. This could lead to a useful encounter between theory and practice which could also be in the interests of the Statistical Office itself. I should like to invite you, my colleagues from both the east and the west, to step up, in intensive co operation with those responsible in your respective Offices, the whole system of publication in the interests of the economic growth we so much need and the increased exchange of goods and services across existing and former borders. We have the data: we must see to it that they reach the user in a comprehensible form. The subject of publications has also been proposed as the topic for the next high-level seminar. It would be useful if we could first of all develop proposals, along the lines I have mentioned, which would not only help this seminar produce clear results but would also secure the attention of the international media. 209 ",

        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go H E I K KI S A L MI - E U R O S T AT To conclude this seminar, I would like to make Eurostat proposals on the basis of this week's recommendations, discussions and the summaries of the high-level advisers. There appear to be five major issues on which we should now concentrate our efforts, in addition to our normal Tacis programme. First issue: The Practical Implementation of Statistical Laws. The background for this proposal is the thoughts introduced by Mr Holder. The idea is to go through your experiences in the implementation of the laws. In particular the following questions are important: - what is the way of doing statistical work in your country ? - how do you organise your work on data dissemination and collection ? - what is the level of integrity of data and data protection ? - how do you organise your relations with respondents ? Second issue: Standardisation and Training in Information Technology. This title is very preliminary. What we need is an information technology policy for every CIS country. Assistance may be rendered in the form of training. While drafting a policy it will be necessary to make sure that a common, standardised language is established between CIS countries. Third issue: Implementation of International Standards. The papers introduced and the subsequent discussions showed that there are a lot of unsolved questions in this area. One of them is how to make data more comparable within the CIS countries and with the European countries. It is worth asking yourselves whether you should follow the European standards or international standards. Fourth issue: Informal Economy. Its definition, data collection methods and all its complexity. This priority was stressed several times and Mr Yurkov also referred to it in his presentation. Fifth issue: Dissemination Policy and Practice. I would like to propose that we establish Working Parties or Task Forces on these topics. Several countries from the CIS, one or two countries of the European Union and also, at least in some of these areas, Phare countries should take part in them. I think that practical implementation of statistical law and standardisation and training in information technology are areas where Phare and Tacis programmes have the same problems and maybe we could combine our ideas. What kind of experts do we need for these task forces? Perhaps this does not involve direct co operation among directors general themselves. We are looking for more technical people who should be under the direct supervision of the presidents. We shall wait for your proposals. The next step should be that the conclusions of the task forces are the main items of our next high- level seminar. During the present seminar we have broadly discussed many very important statistical problems. Next time we should focus on some of them more deeply. In this case the seminar could be more like a conference of directors general as we call them in the European Union countries. At the next seminar, in addition to plenary sessions, we could also have small working groups which would work during the seminar itself and then report to the plenary session. With regard to international standards, the work could start during the already planned seminar due to take place in Minsk in February 1997. The conclusions of that seminar will serve as a guide for further work in this area. This was a very successful seminar with a lot of interesting responses. The hard work has proved to be very fruitful since we shared common problems and have learned a lot from each other. 213 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go I would like to thank all the participants, especially those who took part in discussions, our high-level advisors, the CIS Statcommittee, Goskomstat of the Russian Federation and St. Petersbourgkomstat. We have been a very effective team. I would also like to express my thanks to those who worked in the back office - CESD, my own staff of unit C5, and the interpeters who helped us to have a mutual understanding. VALERY DALIN - DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, STATE COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON STATISTICS For the last five days we have been discussing the most important issues of the development of statistics with reference to the various aspects of \"Where we were\" and \"Where we are\" so as to be able to establish \"Where we are going\". As the Chairman of Goskomstat Russia, Mr Yu. A. Yurkov, emphasized in his paper, it is now vital that we join forces in reforming the statistics of the transitional period so that we can set up state information systems in the immediate future that will be of maximum efficiency in the present circumstances. As the Director-General of Eurostat, Mr Yves Franchet, remarked, the importance of our seminar is determined by the scale of the tasks facing us. Today it is most important for us all to have a better knowledge of how the problems of the transitional period are being solved by statistical offices of the CIS countries. Concrete discussions have enabled us all to make better decisions. Colleagues from the national statistical offices have presented interesting, detailed papers on the major problems of the current development of statistics in their countries. In particular, one of the most pressing problems highlighted at the seminar was the question of completing the legislative framework for the functioning of statistics under present conditions. The process of developing legislation is at various stages of completion in the CIS countries. The way in which these questions are being tackled nationally was described in the reports of the Chairman of Goskomstat of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mr Goryachkovsky, and the Director-General of the Statistical Department of the Republic of Moldova, Mr Tobultoc. Their reports also contained an overall description of the development of statistics in each country. The overall picture of the development of statistics in Azerbaijan was presented in the paper given by the Chairman of Goskomstat of the Azerbaijani Republic, Mr Veliev, who devoted particular attention to improvement of the management structure and staff training. The problems of organising and managing statistical activities could not be discussed without dealing with co-operation between central and local statistical offices and the associated difficulties of developing information technology. Goskomstat of Russia has acquired a certain amount of experience in this field, and in her paper the deputy-chair of Goskomstat Russia, Ms Ivanova, defined the main areas for which a solution was being found and those for which solutions still had to be found. Today, when all the structures of state administration are being reformed, much emphasis is being placed on the co-operation between statistical offices and other national authorities. In their papers on current statistical developments in their countries this aspect was examined closely by the head of the State Department for Statistics, Registration and Analysis of the Republic of Armenia, Mr Agadjanov, the representative of Minstat of the Ukraine, Mr Kompalov and the deputy Director-General of the main computer centre of Goskomprognozstat of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Mr Dolgopolov. 214 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go The development of statistics in our countries cannot and must not take place in isolation from international experience, and consequently particular value is placed on adherence to international standards in our practices. In this context we heard an interesting paper from the CIS Statistical Committee, presented by the Deputy-Chairman of the Committee, Mr Ivanov. The question was also discussed in the papers of the Director of the State Statistical Agency of the Republic of Tajikistan, Mr Gaybullayev and the Chairman of Goskomstat Turkmenistan, Mr Urazov. We discussed the problems of improving data collection, the use of registers and various sampling methods. While discussing the general directions of statistical reform in their countries the Chairman of the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr Akeneyev, and the representative of the State Statistical Department of Mongolia, Ms Yenkkhariuna, dealt with this question in more detail. Today we discussed another important topic concerned with the dissemination of data and relations with statistics users, and we heard the papers of our colleagues - the Minister of Statistics and Analysis of the Republic of Belarus. Mr Nichiporovich and the Chairman of the State Department of Georgia for Social and Economic Information, Mr Gigineishvili, and a statement from the Deputy- Chairman of Goskomstat of Russia, Mr Sokolin, on how these questions are being dealt with in the Russian Federation. I should like to mention the major contribution to our seminar made by participants from Germany, France, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy and Denmark. Their detailed comments were extremely helpful in bringing about a fruitful discussion of the papers. I thank the Director of the Statistical Department of the UN Economic Commission for Europe, Mr Griffin, and also the representatives of the OECD, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for their active participation in our seminar. It was thanks to the active participation of many Eurostat officials that our seminar came about, so many thanks to them for it. Let me express on behalf of all of us our hearty thanks to the St. Petersburg State Statistical Committee for performing the considerable task of organising the seminar. We were lucky to have the chance not only of getting to know this wonderful city and of working in one of its charming palaces, but also of seeing the treasures of the Peterhof Palace. I hope that this seminar will help us all to understand one another even better in the future and to solve our problems more effectively. I wish you all success, I thank all participants once again and I look forward to further fruitful co-operation and further meetings. MIKHAIL KOROLEV - CHAIRMAN OF THE INTERSTATE STATISTICAL COMMITTEE OF TFIE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES We can now answer three questions which were asked at the outset of this seminar. As we have seen, most efforts were applied to solving the second question, and it was shown very clearly what has been done and where were find ourselves now. I agree with Mr De Vries in his general assessment that we have all done an enormous amount of work during this period. In spite of the increasing difficulties, very much has been achieved and much has been introduced into statistical practice in our countries. 215 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go We have begun even more to speak the same language of statistics, and started to understand each other even better; this is our main achievement. As far as the third question is concerned, I would say we need to examine it a bit more as is its due. Of course, some questions are clear enough and we will come across them very soon in our work. For example, the population census, new technical equipment, external trade statistics and many other items. Some questions are only just coming into the forefront and in the very near future we will begin to encounter them more and more often. With these I mean interaction with other electronic systems, entry into the Internet world system and many other developments. The main thing we have to do is to add world standards and methodology to our armoury more and more and work more towards improving the quality of our information. This is what all our efforts should be aimed at. At the seminar many wishes have been expressed, proposals made and much advice given. We need to examine everything in depth and analyse all these questions at the working party meetings proposed by Eurostat, and I agree with this proposal, as well as at our conferences. We need to look at everything carefully and select a programme for the next few years. In the process we need to assess the possibilities open to us and decide what we have to do. However, the main benefit from the seminar, I think everyone will agree, consists in the fact that we have had the opportunity to talk to each other, exchange our views and create the friendly atmosphere without which any further work would be impossible. This is the main merit of the seminar, and I think that here we should thank Eurostat in particular, who did an enormous amount of work, Goskomstat of the Russian Federation, who also did a very great deal of work, and our colleagues from other international organisations - the IMF, UN ECE, OECD, World Bank as well as our colleagues from the national statistical services of foreign countries. I would also like to say a word of special thanks on behalf of all the seminar participants to our colleagues of St Petersburg who made a very substantial contribution to the seminar*s organisation. 216 ",

The main aim of the statistical service is (a) to process statistical data as fully and as objectively as possible so as to reflect the processes at work in the course of the reform of the economy, as well as developments in the social and public domain, and (b) to meet the information needs of government bodies, scientific organisations, the public at large, as well as other users of statistical data, both in Russia and abroad, including international organisations. To achieve these objectives, it will be necessary to: - supply official statistical data to the President of the government, the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, federal executive bodies, the public and international organisations; - provide all users with equal access to non-classified statistical information through the dissemination of reports on the socio-economic situation in the Russian Federation, the various entities of the Russian Federation, the different branches and sectors of the economy, and through the publication of statistical handbooks and other statistical documentation. All the data sources of the entire system of state statistical bodies are being integrated at federal level. The establishment of a data-system of statistical indicators is being realised for the purposes of a fully comprehensive analysis of the economic and social processes taking place in the country as a whole, as well as in the regions; the indicators in question are to be found in state statistical reporting (some 700 headings) and are derived from sample surveys, censuses and sociological investigation The organisation of statistical observation is governed by the Federal Programme for Statistics, annually approved by the Russian Federation. Under this programme each statistical avenue of enquiry is systematically sub-divided into different types of operations to be carried out over specific periods, and stipulations are made as to each individual method of work, the research tool to be employed in each case, the type of profile or cross-section deemed appropriate and the time-frame necessary for the presentation of findings. The operations as set out in the Programme are compulsory in nature and must be executed at all levels of the statistical service. The Organisation of the Various Bodies Composing the State Statistics Service Goskomstat of Russia, together with its branches in the republics, the regions (krai), the districts (oblast), the autonomous oblast and the autonomous local districts, in the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, in the smaller regions (raions) and other towns, as well as governmental agency enterprises, organisations and institutes of learning, all constitute a single state statistical system. Goskomstat of Russia is a federal executive body, responsible for the organisation of a system of statistical observation to include the collection of data on legal entities and their separate sub- 219 ",

        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Particular attention is given to ensuring the proper conditions for running the Single State Business and Organisations Register. This is to cover the totality of all businesses and enterprises throughout Russia, and relies on the latter applying identification codes based on the all-Russian nomenclature for technical, economic and social data; in addition, the register requires that unified approaches be drawn up to enable ministries and agencies to set up target registers. Goskomstat carries out comparison exercises between the Russian Federation and other countries with regard to the basic socio-economic indicators. Together with the Central Bank of Russia it draws up the balance of payments on the basis of data received from financial, foreign trade and other bodies. Goskomstat vouchsafes the completeness and objectivity of all official statistical information, offers all users equal access to non-classified statistical data through its official reports on the socio economic situation of the Russian Federation, the entities of the Russian Federation and the various branches and sectors of the economy, through its publications of statistical handbooks and other statistical documentation. The Goskomstat Computer Centre The Computer Centre (CC of Goskomstat Russia) is the body of the statistical service responsible for collection, stocking and storage, automised processing and transfer of statistical information; it uses modern technology based very largely on electronic calculation devices, communication and printing and logistic techniques. The Goskomstat CC is responsible for the design and installation of software for the electronic data- processing equipment; the creation and management of automised data-bases and registers of various sectors within statistics; the Register of the Single Business and Organisations covering all forms of ownership and economic activity (EGRPO); the monitoring of the all-Russian nomenclature of technical and economic data; the management of the sectoral algorithms and software pool; the publication and edition of statistical bulletins and other data-processing analytical publications, as well as Goskomstat's own journals; lastly, it is responsible for the statistical tools employed. It provides data-processing services on a commercial basis to organisations, institutions and enterprises, irrespective of the type of ownership involved. Goskomstat CC performs annually some 800 statistical assignments at varying intervals: more than once a month, monthly, quarterly, annually, and one-off. In volume terms, Goskomstat CC processes two billion statistical indicators per annum. Goskomstat CC is fully equipped with modern technology: an IBM 4381 mainframe installation, a mainframe based on the Super-Mini RS/6000, IBM PC/AT 486's, IBM PC/AT 386's - which allow for the incorporation of progressive collection, processing and transfer data-technology, as well as the operation of mega-data-bases, through the so-called LVS, or local computer networks, installed under the IVSS development programme. At Goskomstat CC there is a fully developed computer communication centre which works round-the- clock, using two local computer networks, or LVS: - a distance-processing local computer network using Netware Novell software and an 'Intercom Service' telecommunications mainframe, including E- Mail - a local computer network for drafting, circulating and receiving tele-type telegrams using Iolanet, Telekom-8 and ETEL-2 software. 221 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Territorial Branches of the State Statistical Service Russia's State Statistical Service consists of an extensive and multi-level system of some 2,419 organisations; these include 7 at federal level; 88 statistical committees at regional level (republics making up the Russian Federation, an autonomous oblast, local districts -okrugi, krai and oblasti) and 2,324 raion (or city) -level statistical units. The current data-processing statistics system is based on computer technology and distance data- processing using ES computers, microcomputers, and AT-486 and 386 PCs. All this equipment is linked up at federal, regional and local level through STOSI/EPS statistics E-mail. The collection, processing, saving and supply of statistical data is back-stopped by an electronic data- processing mainframe (a 386 KEOI), as well as by the data-banks at federal and regional level, which are being developed to service sub-divisions of the statistics bodies; these are required to discharge the main tasks of the state statistics service and also to provide a broader service for outside users. Russian Statistics To the Beginning of the Transition to the Market The Russian Statistics system was founded and functioned under command-economy-type conditions. As such, it was directly dependent on the methodological framework of central planning and was to all intents and purposes based on total statistical observation. The set of indicators was selected on the basis of the management requirements of ministries and agencies and was geared towards ensuring control over the completion of orders (as pre-established by the Plan) and compliance with the technical and economic prescriptions. The accounting system was designed first and foremost to reflect the economic turnover of material and labour resources within the USSR, as well as their distribution and use. Factory-production statistics moreover enjoyed unchallenged priority over all other branches of the economy. In accounting terms, in contrast to countries with a market economy, production statistics held pride of place; needless to say, this was to the detriment of other areas, such as social affairs, the banking system, money circulation, services, standard of living and other crucial aspects of social development. Our statistics were cut off from world practice, which only complicated the task of international comparison. Statistics, as a service and a component of state management, had essentially lost its initial meaning and was now confined to the accounting and control functions of the administrative-command system of government. Previously, statistics were characterised by secrecy, selectivity of the material destined for public consumption and the biassed presentation of that material for propaganda ends. Exhaustive data-collection was the predominant method. In the socio-economic field, sampling methods were virtually unknown; the response-burden on enterprises was not as a rule taken into account. Statistics were so organised as to become a rigid state system, very efficient and active in the collection of vast quantities of data through exhaustive reporting. The statistical system was founded on the application of computer-technology and distance-processing to domestic production reporting: the equipment used, however, was costly, cumbersome, labour-intensive and expensive to run. The ES EVM computers' limited memory and low-level of reliability, as well as the insufficient through-put, did not allow for the system to benefit from the advantages of the data-bank technology, or to provide distance-access to data-resources at federal and regional level. The low-level technical base and the retention of what was essentially exhaustive reporting led to the reinforcement of the already over-extended observation-base and by the same token robbed statistical practice of arguments for using the kind of progressive data-collection and processing characteristic 222 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go of market economies. Even the beginning of the transition period was marked by a growing conservatism in the way statistical observation was carried out, by a low-level of adaptation to newly emerging economic conditions, and sometimes by a complete inability to provide a set of objective data on economic reform processes using the traditional methods. The need to restructure Russian statistics was primarily determined by the radical transformation of the social and socio-economic scene, and by changes which have taken place internationally and in the governmental organisation of Russia itself. - Russia acquired state sovereignty, which in turn created the need for a national statistical service which would be consistent with the status of a sovereign state. - Russia's entry into the world community implies accessing accounting methods, nomenclature, indicators and other methodological aspects to bring it in line with world practice. - The new constitution of the Russian Federation emphasises the strengthening of the federalism and the extension of the powers granted to its various entities; hence it follows that new forms of organising statistical work must be sought which will be in line with harmonising the concerns of the service at all its various levels and which at the same time will preserve a single, unified data- space. The preservation of an integral statistical system will create the appropriate premises for improving both methodology and the basic principles underlying the processing and analysis of data. - The strenuous development of the private sector, the emergence of a market infra-structure, the acceleration of the whole process of social stratification, as well as other qualitatively new phenomena emerging within the economy as it is reformed, implies the need (a) to apply new methods of organising statistical observation, and (b) to devise both new basic tenets and a new set of economic indicators. Problems Currently Encountered in Restructuring the Statistical System The logistical basis for restructuring under the new regime was provided for by the State Programme for the Russian Federation's Transition to International Practice in the System of Accounting and Statistics, which was completed in 1995. This programme comprises a set of measures aimed at devising an overall methodological, technological and organisational framework for statistics that will provide objective data about new developments taking place in the economy. The numerous problems encountered here have essentially to do with the activity of economic agencies in the Russian Federation (the state of primary, statistical, accountancy and banking reporting, the way ministries and agencies interact, both from the standpoint of data-processing and methodology). Among those bodies responsible for implementing the Programme are: Goskomstat of Russia, The Ministry of the Economy of Russia, the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the Inland Revenue Office of Russia, the Central Bank of Russia, Gosstandard of Russia, GTK of Russia (Customs), the Ministry of Labour of Russia, yet other ministries , and the Russian Academy of Sciences research organisations etc. The first stage of statistics restructuring was carried out on the principle of maximum pooling of resources in the most important and fundamental areas. This led to a new definition of the set of statistical indicators which most adequately reflected the changing aspects of the Russian economy. Likewise it resulted in the creation of a Single State Register of Legal Entities and Independent Sub- Divisions and a Single Nomenclature and Codifying System for all technical-economic and social data. 223 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go Aggregated social indicators were elaborated (employment, wages, standard of living, and so on), as well as aggregated economic accounts, macro-economic and financial indicators (prices, industrial production, balance of payments, state accounts, and so on), all of which are crucial factors in managing the economic development of the country. The State Programme, however, did not resolve all the problems; above all , it did not tackle the basic principles underlying the system of collection, processing, aggregation and analysis of data. Statistics restructuring has hitherto been carried out on the principle of greatest priority needs and has been geared to resolving key problems in statistical and accounting methodology; essentially it has been a question of addressing the data requirements(both content and level of objectivity) of the initial stage of radical economic reforms. At present, as reforms progress, the economy can be said to have undergone considerable qualitative change; it is virtually impossible objectively to reflect this change by attempting merely to improve individual elements; a systemic restructuring is needed. The emergence of institutional change in the private sector, to such an extent indeed that the latter has become the predominant sector of the economy (accounting for 70% of GDP); the appearance of market sectors and areas which had been unknown in the pre-reform economy; the conversion of firms and businesses into major players in the creation of a competitive environment - and finally, the emergence of a demand for data from an ever- widening swathe of consumers (not forgetting the impact of other factors which come into play as economic reform bites deeper) - all this argues strongly in favour of a systemic reshaping of the way statistical observation as a whole is organised. The notion of satisfying society's needs for objective information has now come to occupy centre-stage; reshaping the statistical service has changed from being an aim in itself to a means of performing qualitatively new tasks. Thus, in the most general terms, the restructuring of Russian statistics over the period 1997-2000 is a question of creating the right conditions for fully satisfying the requirements of society for statistical information by means of a thorough-going reform of the system of statistical observation, bringing it in line with the demands of a transition- economy and emphasising the role of the market-type relations evolving in Russia. The basic prerequisites for restructuring statistics are the following: - while maintaining international standards with regard to the organisation of statistics, we must aim at building up a national information-supply model which is based on an extensive and hierarchically structured system which takes account of the relations which have traditionally evolved with other information systems. - we must strengthen Goskomstat's overall integrating role in the process of reflecting, through data- retrieval, the socio-economic developments taking place in the country as a whole, and this on the basis of objectivity and impartiality. - we must enhance the role of the regional level in the reshaping process through a re-distribution of functions between the system's federal and regional levels; - we must vouchsafe the objectivity and efficiency of statistical data; - we must ensure a progressive improvement in the level of software and technology used by the system as a whole and also guarantee the appropriate employment conditions for staff in the Russian statistical system. The main task facing us over the 1997-2000 period is a whole package of measures aimed at systematising the focus areas for statistical observation; improving collection and compiling methods; creating a meta-information system based on a range of federal and regional statistical data-bases; installing new data-processing technology to carry out the Federal Statistics Programme (to cover 224 ",

The Reform of Statistics and the Principal Directions to be Pursued 1997-2000 The economic thrust of the systemic reshaping of statistics in Russia implies a transition from a priority-based approach, consisting in the transformation of individual elements, to one based on inter-related, co-ordinated and consistent improvement of all the various stages involved in the organisation of statistical observation: - a system of statistical data-collection methods which will be based on a specific type of observation-unit; - a set of indicators devised in accordance with the notion of a 'portfolio' of data orders; - forecasts and level-management in line with analysis requirements; - a system of indicators which takes account of specific modifications (co-ordinated changes will affect the classifier-system, software and technology provision etc.) Gearing the organisation of statistical observation to the fullest possible satisfaction of data-demand and providing for public needs will determine the overall framework for reshaping the statistical system as a whole. Subsequent reform of the statistical service will entail fundamental changes in the basic principles governing the way data-resources are built up: it will mean a transition form the sectoral principle, which evolved under the pre-reform 'administrative' management system - based as it was on the fragmentary and unrelated collection of individual labour, production, financial and other indicators - to an integrated set of principles, where the main enterprise activity indicators will be collected as a whole and in compliance with the demands of an organisational unity. This will provide for quantitative, organisational and methodological comparability of indicators and will simplify the collection methods, as well as subsequent processing and analysis. This change in the approach to building up information-flows will lead to the need to embark on what is fundamentally new departure: enterprise statistics, and this in turn will entail changes in the nature of the work carried out at all the respective stages in the organisation of statistical observation. This transition to an integrated framework for building up data-resources presupposes the following: - The creation of enterprise statistics. - The evolution of new functions for the business register: it will serve as a reporting framework for businesses and firms, a tool for defining the totality of statistically observed units, as an organising principle for the observation and the processing of specific statistical data; - The utilisation of banking, financial, taxation and other types of administrative statistics in order to develop an all-encompassing statistical data-base; - The activation of statistical data-exchange with the various bodies of state government and their territorial branches - which is particularly important with regard to demonopolisation and the 225 ",

The adoption of new principles governing statistical data on enterprises...(NB lines missing in original MS) ...all forms of proprietorship will be covered; large firms will be reported on exhaustively and information will be supplied at frequent intervals, whereas small-scale firms will be covered by sample. Some of the following methods of data collection will be used in the future: - Censuses (population and households, wholesale and retail firms, agricultural - for the World Agricultural Census programme); - Sample methods, including area sampling; - Sociological and conjunctural (economic climate) surveys; - Distance sounding. Building up data-flows in an integrated framework will avoid duplication and also reduce the reporting burden on firms. To achieve comparability of foreign trade, finance, customs, banking and other types of statistics it will be necessary to develop a system of interrelated classifiers. This will provide for a pooling of society's data-resources and will help to encourage the exchange of economic data with international organisations and other national statistical offices. Currently Goskomstat is working on a fundamentally new approach to the application of computer technology in which an integrated statistical data-base will become an effective instrument for statistical analysis. The problem still remains of changing the attitude of the statistical service's power-structures to software, although it is hoped to achieve this through a phased introduction of network-technology for data-processing, as well as electronic publishing-systems. Carrying out the changes in these areas will require considerable work in complementing the equipment pool and/or re-equipping statistical bodies with modern computer- technology and telecommunications, as well as up-grading the qualifications of staff, and in some cases retraining. The development of a fully automated statistical data system at all levels, the enhancement of the data-processing, computer and telecommunications environment, the standardisation of Goskomstat's organisational, methodological, data-processing, linguistic, software and technical facilities are all essential aspects of the restructuring programme as a whole. To achieve this end the following main objectives must be fulfilled: - strengthening the statistical system must be carried out by developing it along more economical lines so as to reduce the response-burden on information sources; - improvement of the statistical data-base so it reflects as fully as possible the social and socio economic phenomena through the introduction of a single industrial management system of all federal and regional-level data-bases; 226 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go - transition to the through-put technology of collection, transfer, processing, accumulation and supply by fully automating Goskomstat's data-resource build-up, while at the same time complying with the demands of security and protection from unauthorised access; - automation of data-exchange with government bodies and territorial branches, as well as utilisation of banking, financial, taxation and other types of administrative statistics in the creation of an overall statistical data-base. It is planned to carry out the target programme in two stages. The first stage 1997-98 will be mainly devoted to resolving questions of processing, the introduction of a single system of statistical data bases and the switch-over to local computer network processing. The second stage, 1999-2000, will concentrate on integrating Russian statistics into the international community. Expected Results of the Future reshaping of Russian Statistics The main expected outcome of efficiency-enhancing measures to reshape the statistical service are as follows: A qualitative change in the economic content of the statistical work of Goskomstat through the fullest possible computer-automation of statistics so as to effect the switch-over from the priority approach consisting in the transformation of specific elements to a inter-related, co-ordinated and consistent improvement of all the various stages involved in the organisation of statistical observation: a system of statistical data methods which are in accordance with the notion of a 'portfolio' of data orders; forecasts and level-management in line with analysis requirements; a system of indicators which takes into account software and technology provision etc. A transition to new progressive economic technologies using a single system of federal and regional data-bases. The reduction of the response-burden on selected objects of statistical observation through the integration of data-flows, thus avoiding duplication of information, and the introduction of electronic documentation-turnover at all stages of data through-put - from source to end-user. At the same time the flow of statistical data from enterprises and organisations to the Goskomstat distribution-base, the aggregation of data and its economic/statistical analysis must be automated. Maximum satisfaction of the demand for statistical information, meeting society's needs, achievement of data-comparability using a system of inter-related all-Russian classifiers and combining the data- systems of federal bodies, the various agencies and ministries within the country, improvement of economic/statistical information within international organisations. By using the most modern data-technology, the restructuring program will allow the system to satisfy the demand for statistical information by tailoring its output to cope with the specific concerns of its main consumers: federal executive bodies, Russian Federation government utilities; the mass media; international organisations; the public; the scientific community; commercial concerns. In conjunction with the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, the Russian Inland Revenue Office, The Central Bank of Russia, the Ministry of Labour and other ministries, and also through the use of data derived from market research into demand in the emerging information-services market, an automated data system and a methodology for the statistical analysis of the socio-economic development of the country as a whole, as well as in its separate areas, will be devised. To this end monitoring will be carried out in the social and employment field, social phenomena (political statistics), market investments, the regulation of market relations etc. This will involve the maximum degree of automated interfacing with the data system of federal and regional executive bodies and an enhancement of the inter-agency nature of data-base creation and management, and consequently of the activity of all the various branches of the statistical service as a whole. 227 ",

Early recognition of this need motivated the first act on statistics in 1874, establishing the organisation of statistics at national level (Act XXV of 1874), followed by acts on statistics in 1897, 1929 and 1973, respectively creating a progressive tradition on the concept, institutional system and realisation of statistical activity, on which the current law in force (Act XLVI of 1993) could be based. This present Act was drafted at a time, when the fundamental renewal of Hungarian society and economy changed all the circumstances represented by statistics. During economic re-structuring the range of data suppliers was altered, both in numbers and in terms, while the social re-stratification and the new political system led to new challenges for statistics. Besides considering these internal changes legislation had to pay special attention to the European Community, whose equal member Hungary intends to be in the future. In elaborating the new law the drafters studied the legal background and experience of statistical activity in other countries, and they took into consideration the relevant recommendations of the Council of Europe. After being discussed by parliamentary committees the draft bill was adopted by the National Assembly, almost unanimously. We may say a modern act was created which deriving from Hungarian traditions, advancing them yet further, can be integrated into the European legal system to serve in the long tenn as a proper legal basis of statistical activity in practice. First the Act specifies the aim of statistics, providing constitutional guarantees for all statistical surveys, data processing and transfer. Article 2 of the Act declares that the task and aim of statistics are to reflect, truly and impartially, the state of society, economy, ownership and environment, as well as alteration to those for the National Assembly, the public administration, the social organisation and for the general public. To realise its aim the Act lays down the rules of collecting, processing, storage, transfer, analysis, supply and disclosure of data by means of statistical methods, in harmony with the Act LXIII of 1992 on protection of personal data and on disclosure of the data of public interest (Data protection Act). The above mentioned change in the range of data suppliers means that economic data have been provided by a growing number of private undertakings (sole entrepreneurs) beside state owned enterprises and co-operatives. That made necessary to modify the legal rules of compulsory data supply. The former ministerial regulations had to be replaced by a statute, which could determine an obligation to all economic data suppliers to provide the data required. In Hungarian legal system such an obligation can only be formed by an act or a government decree. Transforming the statistical system, the Act established a unified official statistical service, whose members are the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and the ministries, as well as the supreme bodies of judiciary and of the fiscal system. All data required by the statistical service are incorporated into an annual national program adopted and promulgated by the government. To be accepted by the government the program shall be well reasoned and free from overlapping and it shall satisfy the real needs by an optimal allocation of the available resources. The draft program is discussed by the National Council of Statistics, which is 228 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go an advisory body of the President of the CSO fonned by the Act to promote the operation of the official statistical service, to harmonise its activity, to represent social interest and the need of data users. Besides representatives of the official statistical service, experts nominated by the interest groups of employers and employees, as well as by the economic chambers, take part in the work of the Council, commenting on statistical issues from the point of view of data suppliers and users. However, the program for collecting statistical data can only give a clear picture of the observed phenomenon if both the survey and the processing work with the same methodology. Therefore the Central Statistical Office is vested with authority to develop mandatory and uniform statistical methods, Concepts, classifications and codes, to set up and publish data suppliers' registers. Performing these tasks, whilst continuously considering the changing requirements, the CSO can ensure the conformity of Hungarian statistics to the European standards, in order to integrate it with the European professional practice. Such a statistical system is able to provide reliable and accurate figures on social and economic processes, which is especially important in a democratic society. Therefore it is the statutory task of the CSO to inform, annually, the National Assembly and the Government about the social, economic and demographic figures of the country, as well as to provide information for local authorities and public administration, for social organisations and scientific bodies, for enterprises and interest groups, for news agencies and international organisations, as well as for the general public. Most of the data needed for surveying the situation of the country and for comprehensive information supply are provided on a compulsory basis. Anybody may organise surveys on voluntary basis under the law, however, the respondent shall be informed about the optional character of the supply. As mentioned before, the obligation to supply data is specified by government decrees in cases of surveying economic activities. But it is not adequate and sufficient legal guarantee with regard to personal data of natural persons. The Hungarian Data Protection Act declares that personal data may only be collected with the permission of the person concerned or if ordered so by a law. To comply with this provision the Act on statistics enumerates all those data that are requested from natural persons for democratic surveys, as well as the types of data, which are necessary for estimating the economic activity of private persons, in both cases data supplies are mandatory. To fully inform the respondent, the law makes it obligatory to indicate the purpose of collection and its legal basis, including its compulsory or voluntary characteristics, on the questionnaire or in other materials of the survey. In addition the legal consequences of non-response or of providing false information shall also be emphasised. In current Hungarian law a fine, up to HUF 50.000, can be imposed in these cases under the law of petty offences. Data providers do not receive any payment for the mandatory supply, although in some cases the correct completion of a questionnaire might cause much extra work. Therefore it is of vital importance that data collectors make the most of the data collected, efficiently using the gained information, so that unnecessary data collection can be avoided. To accomplish this aim the Act orders data transfer among the organs of the official statistical service and it authorises the CSO to receive data from other organs collecting information, either in connection with authentic and public registers, or with supervisory and other official activities, so that by completing its existing databases the CSO can more efficiently utilise the figures available in other fields. To integrate these data with the other existing data files the terms and classifications used and published by the CSO shall be applied to all data collections, all data collectors shall carry out their surveys and data processing according to the same methodology. These legal guarantees are completed by the Government decree N\u00b0 170/1993 (XII.3.) issued for the implementation of the Act, providing further guarantees within the statutory framework. For instance, it declares that by 15 December preceeding the year under review, the data supplier shall have the opportunity to get information about his/her obligations to supply data to be able to set the relevant 229 ",
        "Evaluation and Prospects of Transition in Statistics in the Tacis Countries since 1991: Where we were, where we are, where we go documentation accordingly. The government decree specifies the time schedule for the annual statistical program, as well as the form and date of its publication, declaring that the complete program has to be published in the official Gazette of Statistics. This legal background provides a firm basis for the present system of statistics, which is able to serve further professional activity on a higher level without considerable changes. The aim to be achieved in the near future is to set up a legitimate statistical register, which will be more suitable than the current one for registering data suppliers and for grouping them in a more objective and more precise way. The legal provisions in force provide an appropriate protection of individual rights for data suppliers at present and in the future. It is based on the Data Protection Act, which determines the basic principles and guarantees for personal data processing and for accessing to data of public interest. The Act on Statistics grants similar protection for data suppliers performing economic activities, as guaranteed to natural persons to their personal data. The law says that data relating to natural and legal persons and to data suppliers without legal entity (individual data) serving statistical purposes shall not be published. To communicate, transfer and publish individual data a prior consent of the person/supplier concerned is required. To ensure proper protection for personal data concerning natural persons the law determines the obligation of anonymisation. According to this rule all data, which make a certain person identifiable (identifiers) shall be deleted within a year after the reference period. In case of longitudinal survey the identifiers shall be separated from other parts of the file in a way that allows their reconnection to basic data only for the time of integrating new data into the file. There is only one exception under the Act. If the Act on Archives or an act on certain data processing specifies an obligation to preserve the data in archives, the data will be stored together with the identifiers in the archives for a set time. Research permission might be issued only after the legitimate period of protection expired (30, 50, 90 years). Individual data receive similar protection in cases when, due to the small number of data providers, the protected data of the suppliers might be inferred from the aggregated files. Therefore the government decree declares that if the number of data suppliers is less than three (quasi individual data) no data can be published in aggregated files. Individual data are protected as private secrets, which means in Hungarian law that violating the protection of those data implies criminal law sanctions. Data can be published with the approval of the person concerned or if the law allows disclosure to public interest. Data of public interest may be published without approval even if they are individual data or the number of the data suppliers is less than three. According to Data Protection Act data relating to the activity authorities performing state or self-government functions and other public duties are of public interest, including public and social organisation and fiscal bodies under the Act on Statistics. A precise terminology is soon being formed to ensure proper protection and clear distinction from 1997 on, providing as complete information on statistical figures as possible at the same time. The National Statistical Council set up a working committee, supported by the Central Statistical Office, to determine the range of data of public interest in the field of statistics, to unify the practice of disseminating information by the official statistical service. By formulating and defining the range of data of public interest the legal definition concerning theoretical and practical issues of statistics may be considered final for the long term. 230 ",
