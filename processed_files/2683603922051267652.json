The following amendments are being made: (cid:1) The definition in relation to a request to which head 29 applies has been altered slightly to include a reference to head 28 (5) (a) rather than just 28 (5). Head 29 deals with instances where an existing exemption is overruled by the relevant public interest test within that exemption; head 28(5) has two separate provisions and only one of them, at (a), has to do with the public interest. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends an amendment whereby the definition of a \"request to which section 29 applies\" should read \"section 28(5)(a)\" rather than \"section 28(5)\".

(8) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting a public body from publishing or giving access to a record (including an exempt record) otherwise than under this Act where such publication or giving of access is not prohibited by law. (9) A record in the possession of a person who is or was providing a service for a public body under a contract for services shall, if and in so far as it relates to the service, be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be held by the body, and there shall be deemed to be included in the contract a provision that the person shall, if so requested by the body for the purposes of this Act, give the record to the body for retention by it for such period as is reasonable in the particular circumstances.

(cid:1) The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d states that where a manual under Section 16 is published electronically, with no full paper version published, public bodies should be required to publish electronically with a print-out, if requested, a document which describes the range of material in the manual and offers to provide paper copies of the contents (or those parts of interest) to any person.. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform fully agrees that alls such manuals should be available free of charge electronically with a facility for \u2018print out\u2019. Where specific issues arise for persons who are not computer literate, public bodies have the discretion to make available a printed hard copy or part copy of the publication to a requester where necessary and should endeavour to cooperate with a requester in this regard to the greatest extent possible. A legislative provision is not necessary in this regard. (cid:1) Similarly subhead (5) is being deleted and as a consequence subheads (6), (7) and (8) are being renumbered. ",
        "50 Head 17- Amendment of records relating to personal information. Provide that 17.\u2014(1) Where personal information in a record held by a public body is incomplete, incorrect or misleading, the head of the body shall, on application to him or her in that behalf, in writing or in such other form as may be determined, by the individual to whom the information relates, amend the record\u2014 (i) by altering it so as to make the information complete or correct or not misleading, as may be appropriate, (ii) by adding to the record a statement specifying the respects in which the body is satisfied that the information is incomplete, incorrect or misleading, as may be appropriate, or (iii) by deleting the information from it. (2) An application under subhead (1) shall, in so far as is practicable\u2014 (a) specify the record concerned and the amendment required, and (b) include appropriate information in support of the application. (3) The head concerned shall, as soon as may be, but not later than 4 weeks, after the receipt by him or her of an application under subhead (1), decide whether to grant or refuse to grant the application and shall cause notice, in writing or in such other form as may be determined, of his or her decision and, if the decision is to grant it, of the manner of such grant to be given to the person concerned.

        "51 (4) (a) If the grant of an application under subhead (1) is refused, the head concerned shall\u2014 (i) attach to the record concerned the application or a copy of it or, if that is not practicable, a notation indicating that the application has been made, and (ii) include in the notification under subhead (3) particulars of\u2014 (I) rights of review and appeal under this Act in relation to the decision to refuse to grant the application, and (II) the procedure governing the exercise of those rights and any time limits governing such exercise. (b) Paragraph (a)(i) does not apply in relation to a case in which the head concerned is of opinion that the application concerned is defamatory or the alterations or additions to which it relates to the record concerned would be unnecessarily voluminous. (5) Where a record is amended pursuant to this section, the public body concerned shall take all reasonable steps to notify of the amendment\u2014 (a) any person to whom access to the record was granted under this Act, and (b) any other public body to whom a copy of the record was given, during the period of one year ending on the date on which the amendment was effected. (6) Notwithstanding subhead (1), the Minister may provide by regulations for the making of an application under that subsection\u2014 ",
        "52 (a) by the parent or guardian of an individual referred to in that subhead, if the individual belongs to a class specified in the regulations, or (b) in a case where such an individual is dead, by a member of a class specified in the regulations. (7) A head to whom a request under this head is made may refuse to grant the request if the request is, in the opinion of the head, frivolous or vexatious, or forms part of a pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests from the same requester or from different requesters who, in the opinion of the head, appear to have made the requests acting in concert. Explanatory Note This Head is based on section 17 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended by section 12 of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003. The following amendment is being made: (cid:1) Insertion of a new subhead authorising the refusal of a head to grant a request if in his or her opinion it is frivolous, vexations or forms part of a pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests from the same requester or different requesters acting in concert. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends that the \"frivolous or vexatious\" ground of refusal should be extended to section 17 and 18 applications. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform agrees with this recommendation and for the reasons underlying it. The Information Commissioner correctly highlights that while a request for records under section 7 of the FOI Act may be refused on the grounds of being \"frivolous or vexatious\", there is no equivalent provision in the case of applications made under section 17 (seeking amendment of personal information) or section 18 (seeking reasons for an act of a public body).

        "53 Head 18- Right of person to information regarding acts of public bodies affecting the person. Provide that 18.\u2014(1) The head of a public body shall, on application to him or her in that behalf, in writing or in such other form as may be determined, by a person who is affected by an act of the body and has a material interest in a matter affected by the act or to which it relates, not later than 4 weeks after the receipt of the application, cause a statement, in writing or in such other form as may be determined, to be given to the person\u2014 (a) of the reasons for the act, and (b) of any findings on any material issues of fact made for the purposes of the act. (2) Nothing in this head shall be construed as requiring\u2014 (a) the giving to a person of information contained in an exempt record, or (b) the disclosure of the existence or non-existence of a record if the non- disclosure of its existence or non-existence is required by this Act. (3) Subhead (1) shall not apply to\u2014 (a) a decision of the Public Appointments Service or other licence holder concerned under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, not to accept a person as qualified for a position referred to in that section, or (b) a decision of the Chief Executive of the Public Appointments Service made by virtue of section 7 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act ",
        "54 1926, not to recommend a person to a local authority for appointment to an office referred to in that head, if, in the opinion of the head concerned, the giving of a statement under subhead (1) in relation to the decision would be likely to prejudice the effectiveness of the process for selecting a person for appointment to the position or office. (4) If, pursuant to subhead (2) or (3), the head of a public body decides not to cause a statement to be given under subhead (1) to a person, the head shall, not later than 4 weeks after the receipt of the application concerned under subhead (1), cause notice, in writing or in such other form as may be determined, of the decision to be given to the person. (5) For the purposes of this section a person has a material interest in a matter affected by an act of a public body or to which such an act relates if the consequence or effect of the act may be to confer on or withhold from the person a benefit without also conferring it on or withholding it from persons in general or a class of persons which is of significant size having regard to all the circumstances and of which the person is a member. (5A) Notwithstanding subhead (1), the Minister may provide by regulations for the making of an application under that subhead\u2014 (a) by the parent or guardian of a person referred to in that subhead if the person belongs to a class specified in the regulations, or (b) in a case where such a person is dead, by a member of a class specified in the regulations (6) In this head\u2014 ",

(7) A head to whom a request under this head is made may refuse to grant the request if the request is, in the opinion of the head, frivolous or vexatious, or forms part of a pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests from the same requester or from different requesters who, in the opinion of the head, appear to have made the requests acting in concert. (8) (a) An application under this head must be made within twelve months of the person who is affected by the act becoming aware of it; and (b) if there are particular circumstances that, in the opinion of the head, justify an extension of the twelve month period, the head shall have discretion to grant such an extension Explanatory Note ",
        "56 This Head is based on section 18 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended by section 13 of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003, the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004. The following amendments are being made: (cid:1) As with Head 17, a new subhead (7) is inserted authorising the refusal of a head to grant a request if in his or her opinion it is frivolous, vexations or forms part of a pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests from the same requester or different requesters acting in concert. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends that the \"frivolous or vexatious\" ground of refusal should be extended to section 17 and 18 applications. Department of Public expenditure and Reform agrees with this recommendation and for the reasons underlying it. The Information correctly highlights that while a request for records under head 7 of the FOI Act may be refused on the grounds of being \"frivolous or vexatious\", there is no equivalent provision in the case of applications made under head 17 (seeking amendment of personal information) or head 18 (seeking reasons for an act of a public body). While this recommendation is not reflected in the Programme for Government, it is a practical suggestion for the better and is in order for implementation. (cid:1) Insertion of a new subhead (8) states that an application under this head must be made within twelve months of the person who is affected by the act becoming aware of it, Subhead 8 (b) does however provide that the head can authorise an extension of this period. The Information Commissioner suggested that applications under this provision must be made within twelve months of the applicant becoming aware of the \"act\" that affects him/her unless there are particular circumstances that, in the opinion of the head, justify an extension of this period. ",
        "57 (cid:1) Insertion of a definition in relation to acts of public bodies. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends that section 18 be amended to clarify that the right to a statement of reasons for an act of a public body applies only in respect of \"acts\" taken since the commencement of the FOI Act. This recommendation makes good sense and is in order for implementation. ",
        "58 PART III \u2013 EXEMPT RECORDS Head 19- Meetings of the Government. Provide that 19.\u2014(1) A head may refuse to grant a request under head 7 if the record concerned\u2014 (a) has been, or is proposed to be, submitted to the Government for their consideration by a Minister of the Government or the Attorney General and was created for that purpose, (b) is a record of the Government other than a record by which a decision of the Government is published to the general public by or on behalf of the Government, or (c) contains information (including advice) for a member of the Government, the Attorney General, a Minister of State, the Secretary to the Government or the Assistant Secretary to the Government for use by him or her solely for the purpose of the transaction of any business of the Government at a meeting of the Government. (2) A head shall refuse to grant a request under head 7 if the record concerned\u2014 (a) contains the whole or part of a statement made at a meeting of the Government or information that reveals, or from which may be inferred, the substance of the whole or part of such a statement, and ",
        "59 (b) is not a record\u2014 (i) referred to in paragraph (a) or (c) of subhead (1), Or (ii) by which a decision of the Government is published to the general public by or on behalf of the Government. (3) Subject to the provisions of this Act, subhead (1) does not apply to a record referred to in that subsection\u2014 (a) if and in so far as it contains factual information relating to a decision of the Government that has been published to the general public, or (b) if the record relates to a decision of the Government that was made more than 5 years before the receipt by the head concerned of the request under section 7 concerned. (4) A decision to grant a request under head 7 in respect of a record to which paragraph (a) or (b) of subhead (1) applies shall not be made unless, in so far as it is practicable to do so, the head concerned has, prior to the making of the decision, consulted in relation to the request with\u2014 (a) the leader of each political party to which belonged a member of the Government that made any decision to which the record relates, and (b) any member of the Government aforesaid who was not a member of a political party. (5) Where a request under head 7 relates to a record to which subhead (1) applies, or would, if the record existed, apply, and the head concerned is satisfied that the disclosure of the existence or non-existence of the record would be contrary to the public interest, he or she shall refuse to grant the request and shall not disclose to the requester concerned whether or not the record exists. (6) In this head\u2014 ",
        "60 \u201cdecision of the Government\u201d includes the noting or approving by the Government of a record submitted to them; \u201crecord\u201d includes a preliminary or other draft of the whole or part of the material contained in the record; \u2018\u2018Government\u2019\u2019 includes a committee of the Government, that is to say, a committee appointed by the Government whose membership consists of\u2014 (a) members of the Government, or (b) one or more members of the Government together with either or both of the following: (i) one or more Ministers of State, (ii) the Attorney General. Explanatory Note This Head is based on section 19 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 as amended by section 14 of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003. There are however a number of sections altered or not re enacted. (cid:1) Subhead (1) Restores subsection 19(1) (a) to what was contained in the original Act of 1997. This amendment arises from the commitment in the Programme for Government to restore the Freedom of Information legislation. It removes the mandatory power of a head of a public body to refuse an FOI request and restores the discretionary power of such a head as was contained in the original Act. ",
        "61 (cid:1) In addition, section 19(1) (aa), introduced in 2003 is not re enacted. It deals with communications between two or more Ministers dealing with matters under consideration by the Government. This amendment arises from the commitment in the Programme for Government to restore the Freedom of Information legislation. It should also be noted that the existing protections in the Act in relation to the deliberative process are sufficiently strong to deal with communications between two or more Ministers in relation to matters under consideration by the Government. (cid:1) Subhead 19 (1) (c) provides for the restoration of the word \u2018solely\u2019 by replacing the word \u2018primarily\u2019 which was introduced in the 2003 Amendment Act. This amendment arises from the commitment in the Programme for Government to restore the Freedom of Information legislation. (cid:1) Head 19 (2) (b) re enacts the original provisions of section 19(2) (b) prior to its amendment in 2003. No major consequences are foreseen as a result of the restoration. The amendment is necessary to give effect to the commitments in the programme for Government in relation to the restoration of the amendments made by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act, 2003. (cid:1) This Head also provides for the restoration of the period during which records of Government are exempt from FOI from 10 to 5 years. The restoration is in fulfilment of the Programme for Government . This amendment provides for the restoration of the original 19(4) provided for in the original Act. As the 2003 Amendment Act introduced a mandatory refusal in relation to records covered by section 19 (1) it was believed to be inconsistent to retain the requirement in subsection 4 of section 19 to consult with members of former governments prior to releasing a record covered by section 19(1)(a) or 19(1)(b). The amendment is necessary to give effect to the commitments in the programme for Government in relation to the restoration of the amendments made by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act, 2003. ",
        "62 (cid:1) The original definition of Government contained in section 19(6) is restored. The 2003 Amendment Act extended the protection available under section 19(1) to records of certain committees, including working groups where the committee concerned is certified by the Secretary General to the Government as having been established in direct support of government deliberations. No such committee was certified by the Secretary General to the Government in the intervening period. The amendment is necessary to give effect to the commitments in the programme for Government in relation to the restoration of the amendments made by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.

        "64 (c) the reasons for the making of a decision by a public body, (d) a report of an investigation or analysis of the performance, efficiency or effectiveness of a public body in relation to the functions generally or a particular function of the body, (e) a report, study or analysis of a scientific or technical expert relating to the subject of his or her expertise or a report containing opinions or advice of such an expert and not being a report used or commissioned for the purposes of a decision of a public body made pursuant to any enactment or scheme. Explanatory Note This Head is based on section 20 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended by section 15 of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003. The following alterations are being made: (cid:1) Section 20(1) and section 20(1A) are not being re enacted and subhead (1) restores section (20) (1) of the original Act in its place. The subhead removes the power of a Secretary General to issue a certificate stating that a particular record contains matters relating to the deliberative processes of a Department of State. The amendment is necessary to give effect to the commitments in the programme for Government in relation to the restoration of the amendments made by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act, 2003. Two Certificates issued to date and these remain in place. (cid:1) Further subsection 20(3) is not re enacted. This subsection was inserted by the 2003 Act and its removal restores the wording in the original Freedom of Information Act where documents in relation to the deliberative process must be ",
        "65 released unless it is shown that their release would be contrary to the public interest. This amendment is necessary to give effect to the commitments in the programmed for government in relation to the restoration of the amendments made by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.

Explanatory Note This Head is based on section 24 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended by section 19 of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003, section 9 of the Criminal Justice (Location of Victims' Remains) Act 1999, section 9 of the Independent Monitoring Commission Act 2003), The following amendments are being made: (cid:1) Section 24 be amended as follows; (i) Replace the word \u2018may\u2019 with \u2018shall\u2019 in first line in section 24(1) (ii) Insert the words \u201c(and, in particular, but without prejudice to the generality otherwise of this subsection, to a record to which subsection (2) applies) after the word \u201crecord\u201d in subsection (1) of Section 24; and (iii) Delete and replace the wording in the first line in Section 24(2) as follows: \u2018This subsection applies to a record that. ",
        "76 The amendments proposed above provide for the exemption of certain records subject to a harm test, that is, if in the opinion of the Head, access to such records could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the security, defence, international relations of the State or matters relating to Northern Ireland. This represents a strengthening of the original legislation in this respect which previously provided for a discretionary power to refuse or grant access to certain records. The amendments also provide for the removal of the mandatory class exemption for the records specified in subhead (2), namely certain categories of records relating to security, defence and international relations. A mandatory exclusion from Freedom of Information of a broad class of records can only be justified where a significant proportion of such records are so sensitive or so confidential that even consideration of their release is unlikely to ever be justified on account of the harm to the public interest that would be likely to be caused. There is international precedence in comparative jurisdictions (for example Australia, New Zealand and Canada) for not having a mandatory exemption in these matters. Furthermore, the 2001 EU regulation governing public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents does not contain a mandatory exemption for records relating to security, defence and international matters. The amendment is necessary to give effect to the commitments in the programme for Government in relation to the restoration of the amendments made by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.

Explanatory Note This Head is based on section 25 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended by section 20 of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003. The following amendments are being made: ",
        "82 (cid:1) Sections 25 (1) (b) and (2) are altered by inserting the wording \u201cincluding the Garda Commissioner\u201d. Consistent with the commitment in the Programme for Government to take account of security exceptions, any extension of Freedom of Information to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na must include the power to certify security and intelligence related material as beyond the remit of the Freedom of Information Act. The purpose of this Head is, therefore, to amend Section 25 which covers the issuance of Ministerial certificates so as to allow the Garda Commissioner as head of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to request the Minister to issue a Ministerial Certificate for a particular record thereby removing it from the scope of Freedom of Information. The objective of the Head is to provide a legal mechanism which would allow the Garda Commissioner to request the Minister for Justice to issue a Ministerial certificate under Section 25 of the Act where the Garda Commissioner believes that a record held by the Garda which is subject to Freedom of Information and at risk of release is sufficiently sensitive or serious to justify its certification as exempt from Freedom of Information. The Ministerial Certificate is issued in accordance with Section 25 of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended. This Section allows the Minister to state that the record is exempt in that it relates to law enforcement issues and the security, defence of the State. The certificates are for a period of two years and are reviewed annually by a sub- committee of the Cabinet, Taoiseach, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Where one of the above certificates has been issued, the requester cannot seek a review by the Information Commissioner. In the case of the Ministerial Certificates, the requester can appeal the decision to the High Court. ",
        "83 Head 26- Information obtained in confidence. Provide that 26.\u2014(1) Subject to the provisions of this head, a head shall refuse to grant a request under head 7 if\u2014 (a) the record concerned contains information given to a public body, in confidence and on the understanding that it would be treated by it as confidential (including such information as aforesaid that a person was required by law, or could have been required by the body pursuant to law, to give to the body) and, in the opinion of the head, its disclosure would be likely to prejudice the giving to the body of further similar information from the same person or other persons and it is of importance to the body that such further similar information as aforesaid should continue to be given to the body, or (b) disclosure of the information concerned would constitute a breach of a duty of confidence provided for by a provision of an agreement or enactment (other than a provision specified in column (3) of the Third Schedule of an enactment specified in that Schedule) or otherwise by law. (2) Subhead (1) shall not apply to a record which is prepared by a head or any other person (being a director, or member of the staff of, a public body or a person who is providing a service for a public body under a contract for services) in the course of the performance of his or her functions unless disclosure of the information concerned would constitute a breach of a duty of confidence that is provided for by an agreement or statute or otherwise by law and is owed to a person other than a public body or head or a director, or member of the staff of, a public body or a person who is providing or provided a service for a public body under a contract for services. ",
        "84 (3) Subject to head 29, subhead (1) (a) shall not apply in relation to a case in which, in the opinion of the head concerned, the public interest would, on balance, be better served by granting than by refusing to grant the request under head 7 concerned. (4) Where\u2014 (a) a request under head 7 relates to a record to which subhead (1) applies but to which subheads (2) and (3) do not apply or would not, if the record existed, apply, and (b) in the opinion of the head concerned, the disclosure of the existence or non- existence of the record would have an effect specified in subhead (1), he or she shall refuse to grant the request and shall not disclose to the requester concerned whether or not the record exists. (5) In this head a record of information shall include information conveyed in confidence in writing, or by phone and a note is taken of the phone message by an official, or other electronic means. Explanatory Note This Head is based on section 26 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended by section 21 of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003. The following amendment is made: (cid:1) A new subhead 5 is inserted which provides that a record of information shall include information conveyed in confidence in writing or by phone and a note is taken of the phone message. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d 1 states that there is an anomaly whereby confidential information sent in a letter to a public body from a third party can qualify for exemption if it meets the criteria in head 26(1)(a) while the same information received via a phone call and noted by a member of staff of a public body cannot attract such protection (because of head26(2)) unless it meets the 'duty of confidence' test in head 26(1)(b) / s 26(2). The Information Commissioner recommends that such information should attract the same protection and a distinction should be drawn 1 \"Suggested amendments to improve the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d dated March 2007 ",
        "85 between information received from a third party in such circumstances and information created or generated by a member of staff of a public body. It is worth considering for implementation subject to the legal advice of the Attorney General on the matter particularly in the light of the Supreme Court decision on the Rotunda case. Clarification with the Office of the Information Commissioner will be required also as regards the effectiveness of the suggested head above. ",

The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends an amendment whereby the definition of a \"request to which section 29 applies\" should read \"section 28(5)(a)\" rather than \"section 28(5)\".

Explanatory Note This Head is based on section 34 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended by section 26 of the Freedom of Information Act 2003. The following amendments are being made: (cid:1) Section 34(1) sets out the types of decision the Information Commissioner may review. Decisions taken under six specific sections listed can be reviewed by the Commissioner. This Head will provide simplification of the process outlined in the previous section 34. Section 34(1) (f) provides that the Commissioner may review \"a decision on a request to which section 29 applies\". A \"request to which section 29 applies\" is defined in section 2 of the Act. This allows the Commissioner to review a public body's decision in respect of the public interest element only of sections 26, 27 and 28. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends an amendment which will establish that the Commissioner is not confined to considering the public interest only in relation to a \"decision on a ",
        "111 request to which section 29 applies\". However, this approach prevents the Commissioner taking into account the possibility that information may have lost its confidentiality, commercial sensitivity, etc. in the time between the public body's decision and the Commissioner concluding her review. This would seem to undermine the view of the High Court that the Commissioner's review is de novo. Discussion with the Office of the Information Commissioner would be highly desirable on this and further exploration with the Attorney General\u2019s Office might also be appropriate. (cid:1) Subhead (5) is amended by deleting the words \u201cin writing given\u201d and inserting \u201cgiven in writing, orally or by electronic means. Section 34(5) currently requires that withdrawal of a review application must be done in writing. However, many applicants are slow to write to the Office of the Information Commissioner confirming a withdrawal of their application. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d therefore recommends that this provision be amended to allow a withdrawal to be done orally with the Commissioner confirming this in writing to the applicant and also informing the public body that this has happened. Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also recommends that \u2018withdrawals\u2019 communicated communications received via modern Information Communication Technologies (text should also be accepted as valid). There may be legal issues around electronic signature... Consultation with the Office of the Attorney General would be required. Subject to further consultation with the OIC (cid:1) A new subhead (6) (2) is inserted which provides that the Commissioner may at her discretion remove personal or confidential information which was not intended for circulation to the public body concerned, from the application of section 34 when sending a copy of the application to the public body concerned. At present section 34(6) provides that when accepting an application for review the Information Commissioner must forward a copy of the application to the public body concerned. In some cases the application from a person contains personal or confidential information which was not intended for circulation to the public body. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends that the provision should be amended to allow the Commissioner, at her discretion, remove any information from the application which the Commissioner believes was not intended by the applicant to be forwarded to the public body. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform agrees with the recommendation made. (cid:1) Insert subheads which provide for a number of circumstances in which the Commissioner may discontinue a review or refuse to grant an application. At present section 34(9) (a) provides that, in certain circumstances, the Information Commissioner may discontinue \"a review\" or refuse to grant \"an application\". In many cases the review or application involves a number of different aspects.The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the ",
        "112 Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends that the Act clarify that the Commissioner's powers include the power to discontinue a review or refuse an application in respect of some or all aspects of the overall case. The Commissioner recommends that the grounds on which the Commissioner may refuse to grant an application or discontinue a review should be widened. The Information Commissioner recommended the following additional grounds based on section 138 (1) (b) of the Planning Act, 2000; (a) where the applicant fails to provide the Commissioner with sufficient information or otherwise fails to co-operate with the Commissioner in the conduct of a review; (b) where in the course of the review, access to the records in question has been granted by the public body and where the Commissioner is satisfied that there is no longer any issue requiring adjudication by her Office; (c) where the application to the Commissioner does not contain sufficient particulars to enable the Commissioner to proceed with a review. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary also draws attention to the fact that the grounds for a public body refusing a request as frivolous or vexatious (as set out in section 10(1) (e) of the FOI Act, 1997) and expanded by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act, 2003 and recommends the terms of the amended section 10(1) (e) should apply also to the Commissioner under section 34(9) also. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform considers that the introduction of these amendments would lead to an improved functioning of the Act. (cid:1) Insert after subhead 34 (7) a subhead that provides that in determining whether to suspend a review under this head, the Commissioner shall act in accordance with his or her own discretion. At present section 34 (7) of the Act provides that the Commissioner may suspend a review only when endeavouring to effect a settlement between the parties concerned. Section 34 (7) (b) must be read in conjunction with Section 34 (7) which provides for suspension in this context. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d states that it is also appropriate to suspend reviews in other circumstances, for example, where a court judgment which would clarify the point of law at issue is awaited or where clarification of the nature of the application to the Commissioner is needed. The Information Commissioner therefore recommends an amendment to section 34 (7) that would permit the Commissioner to act in accordance with her own discretion when deciding to suspend a review. The Department of Public Expenditure agrees that it would be appropriate to give the Commissioner the necessary powers in relation to \u2018suspensions\u2019 but go no further. An amendment of Section 34 (7) would also ",
        "113 cover discontinuation of a Review which is wider than what is necessary. The amendment above is drafted on this basis. ",
        "114 Head 35-Requests for further information by Commissioner. Provide that 35.\u2014(1) Where\u2014 (a) an application for the review by the Commissioner of\u2014 (i) a decision to refuse to grant a request under head 7 , or (ii) a decision under head 14 in relation to a decision referred to in subparagraph (i), is made under head 34 , and (b) the Commissioner considers that the statement of the reasons for the decision referred to in paragraph (a) (i) in the notice under subhead (1) of head 8 or of the findings or particulars referred to in subhead (2) (d) (ii) of that section in relation to the matter is not adequate, the Commissioner shall direct the head concerned to furnish to the requester concerned and the Commissioner a statement, in writing or such other form as may be determined, containing any further information in relation to those matters that is in the power or control of the head. (2) A head shall comply with a direction under this head as soon as may be, but not later than 3 weeks, after its receipt.

        "119 (8) Where, a public body fails to comply with a binding decision of the Commissioner under this Act; the Information Commissioner may apply to the Courts for an enforcement order to oblige the public body to comply with the decision. (9) This head does not apply to a record in respect of which a certificate under head 25 is in force. (10) Subhead 2, 2 (a) and 2 (b) shall not apply in the case of information, records or premises (or parts of premises) designated by regulation under section 126 of the Garda Sioch\u00e1na Act 2005, as relating to the security of the State. Explanatory Note This Head is based on section 37 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. The powers of the Information Commissioner are set out in Section 37 of the Freedom of Information Act. The unrestricted power of entry and the power to take copies and examine records found on Garda premises raises very significant concerns in the context of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. While the Office of the Information Commissioner (OIC) has always behaved in a most reasonable fashion in examining sensitive records, the implications of extending such powers, in their current form, to Garda stations and areas where highly sensitive security/intelligence and operational files are stored are very considerable. It is inevitable that some administrative records contain information that relates to security/intelligence matters. If an official of the OIC has the power to enter any Garda premises and remove records, which could potentially be of great sensitivity, unquantifiable security risks arise. If it became known to other national and international bodies which routinely share intelligence and security information with the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na that their information could be inadvertently compromised in such a fashion ",
        "120 significant impediments may be placed in the way of the transfer of sensitive information. Information flows of this nature are central to the intelligence, and security functions of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and must be protected. Section 6(9) provides that records in the possession of a person who is or was providing a service for a public body under a \"contract for services\" are deemed to be held by the public body. However, there is currently no enforcement provision when a person who is or was providing a service for a public body under a \"contract for services\" refuses to comply with a request from a public body for records relevant to an FOI request. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends that failure by such a person to supply relevant records under section 6(9) be made an offence along the same lines as obstructing an investigation of the Commissioner in section 37(7) of the Act. The intention of the original Act is clear in that a person mentioned in Section 37(7) was intended to cover a \u2018person who is or was providing a service for a public body under contract\u2019. The amendment suggested by the Information Commissioner will put the matter beyond doubt. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d highlights that while the Commissioner has various powers to compel public bodies to provide copies of records and co-operate with her review, there is no explicit provision requiring a public body to comply with a binding decision of the Commissioner. It is unclear what the legal situation is in a case where the Commissioner directs that a public body grant an applicant access to records and, in the absence of an appeal to the High Court, the public body refuses to do so. ",
        "121 The Information Commissioner recommends that a provision to allow for the enforcement of decisions made by the Commissioner be included. In the UK, the Information Commissioner may apply to the courts for an enforcement order and failure to comply with such an order is a contempt of court. The Information Commissioner recommends that a provision to allow for the enforcement of decisions made by the Commissioner be included in the Irish legislation. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in the context of the devolution, of the Minister\u2019s operational function under the FOI Acts to the Information Commissioner, supports this provision. The mere provision of such a power should act as a positive incentive for public bodies to discharge fully any obligations to which it would apply even though the use of the powers are not foreseen as being necessary very often. The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends that the maximum fine for failing or refusing to comply with a requirement or for hindering or obstructing the Commissioner should be increased to \u20ac10,000 and/or six months imprisonment. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform supports the modernisation of fines and penalties in accordance with current norms. Policy in regard to the level of fines is a matter for the Office of the Attorney General and while a suggested amendment has been made to s.37(7), the AG\u2019s advice as regards to appropriate levels and norms for such fines and prison sentences will be followed. Section 37(8)(b) is being deleted as its unnecessary. Intentional breach of any court order is contempt so it is otiose to say so in this context. ",

The following amendments are made: ",
        "128 (cid:1) Delete 8 and insert 4 in head 42 (4). The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends that the time limit for an appeal of the Commissioner's decision to the High Court should be returned to 4 weeks. The Information Commissioner believe that the current period of 8 weeks is excessive and can further delay a right of access to records after a requester has already been through internal review and review by the Commissioner. (cid:1) Insert new subhead (8) which provides that a requester who has part of their request subject to an appeal to the High Court on a point of law shall have a further 4 weeks in which to make an appeal in law when presented with the Commissioners\u2019 decision. Section 42 (4) provides that the time limit for appealing a decision of the Commissioner to the High Court is eight weeks (introduced by amendment under the 2003 Act.) The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary points out that this provision creates an anomaly whereby, in certain circumstances, a requester who is being granted partial access to records will not receive those records until after the time for a High Court appeal has expired. In such circumstances, the requester will not know whether he or she is satisfied with the Commissioner's decision until after the time for the making of an appeal has expired. This situation may arise where a third party, other than the requester, has an interest in the release of the records and, because of the operation of head 44 there is a stay on the implementation of the Commissioner's decision. This stay is to protect the rights of the third party. However, an unintended consequence is that the requester cannot be given the records until after the appeal period has expired. The Office of the I.C. has had one instance of a High Court appeal made \"on the blind\" in such circumstances. The advice of the Office of the Attorney General would be relevant here in regard to any legal issues. (cid:1) Insert a new subhead (4) which makes provisions in relation to the payment of costs of a person in relation to an appeal under this section to the High Court.The Information Commissioner in her 2007 commentary on the operation of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003\u201d recommends that the provision at ",
        "129 section 42(6) (c) in relation to the Supreme Court should also apply to the High Court, i.e. in a successful High Court appeal by a requester, or third party, and where the point of law involved is of exceptional public importance, some or all of the requester's, or third party's costs may be borne by the public body involved. These proposals, prima facie, make eminent good sense and in the context of furthering the liberalisation of freedom of information would merit support. The views of the Office of the Attorney General would however be central on this matter. It would be particularly important that the Attorney General should be solicited to avoid any unintended consequences or creating any undesirable precedents that might among other things lead to the transfer of costs on the taxpayer at a critical juncture in the public finances of the country. The Information Commissioner\u2019s suggestion is not comprehended by the commitments in the Programme for Government. ",

The following amendments are made: ",
        "141 (cid:1) Subhead (4) provides that this Act does not apply to a record held by the Central Bank which is subject to professional secrecy obligations under the ECSB statute or EU financial Services Directives. The approach taken to exempting certain functions of certain bodies is consistent with the precedents already included in section 46(i) of the Freedom of Information Act. This provision will provide that the Freedom of Information will apply to the Central Bank of Ireland other than in relation to records which are subject to professional secrecy obligations under the ECSB Statute or EU Financial Services Directives. (cid:1) An additional subhead is included which secures the inclusion under Freedom of Information of records relating to the administrative functions of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. Administrative records are defined as records relating to finance, human resource and procurement functions of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. As certain of the records relating to these administrative functions to which it is proposed to extend Freedom of Information are likely to extend to sensitive security or intelligence matters particular exemptions will, therefore, need to be provided in Part III of the legislation within the functions specified above over and above those currently provided in the Freedom of Information Act. For example, procurement or financial information may relate to the purchase, use or specification of sensitive intelligence equipment which it may not be desirable to place in the public domain. Human resource information could reveal the identity of personnel involved in sensitive security or intelligence functions. (cid:1) All records held by the Criminal Assets Bureau and certain records held by the Garda Sioch\u00e1na and the Defence Forces are being excluded in entirety from the scope of the Act. The purpose of this Head is to exclude entirely from the scope of Freedom of Information all records relating to the Criminal Assets Bureau which has a statutory basis; all records held by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na relating to the legislation identified above and/or held by the Special Detective Unit or the Emergency Response Unit; and all records held by the Defence Forces relating to ",
        "142 the legislation identified above and/or held by specific Units, if any, to be identified by the Defence Forces. In view of the highly sensitive nature of these activities, it is considered that any access to records in relation to these areas creates a potential for release of information into the public domain of information that could prejudice or impair the prevention, detection or investigation of serious offences and seriously jeopardise the safety of significant witnesses or police informants. In the drafting of the Bill, it will be necessary to ensure consistency between the proposed exemptions in section 46 and prohibitions on the disclosure of confidential or sensitive information under other statutes. (cid:1) Insert subhead providing that this Act does not apply to a record relating to an investigation or examination carried put by the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 other than those relating to the general administration of the office ir where such record was created before the commencement of the review, investigation etc. In line with the precedent already in place in the Act, the Minister agrees that the provisions of Section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act should apply to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces as is the case with other statutory Ombudsman\u2019s\u2019 Offices. \u2022 Subsection 46(1)(ba) inserted by the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 (28/2001) has been deleted, The effect of this will be to bring records relating to the Company Law Enforcement Office within the scope for FOI and remove the limitation to purely administrative records. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform believes that the removal of bodies from the scope of Freedom of Information in this manner is highly undesirable and proposes, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, to extend Freedom of Information to such bodies in full. \u2022 46(1)(bb) inserted by the Road Traffic Act 2010 (25/2010) has been deleted. The effect of this is to bring records held or created by the Medical Bureau of Road ",

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform believes that the removal of bodies from the scope of Freedom of Information in this manner is highly undesirable and proposes, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, to extend Freedom of Information to such bodies in full. (cid:1) Subsection 46(1) (da) inserted by the Freedom of Information (Amendment Act) 2003, has been deleted. The effect of these amendments will be to bring records relating to the costing by a public body of a proposal of a political party within the scope of FOI. This is necessary to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government in relation to the restoration of the amendments made by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003. (cid:1) Section 46(1)(dc) excludes from the scope of the FOI Act records held or created by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and which relate to or arise from the HSA's enforcement functions and it has also been deleted. These records had been subject to the FOI Act prior to the commencement of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005. The Information Commissioner recommends the deletion of this provision on the basis that the existing exemptions in the FOI Act are sufficient to protect the interests involved. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 commenced on 1 September, 2005 and provides as follows; 74.\u2014The Freedom of Information Act 1997 is amended in section 46(1) (as amended by section 29 of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003), by inserting the following after paragraph (db): \u201c(dc) a record held or created under the relevant statutory provisions by the Health and Safety Authority or an employee of the Authority, relating to or arising from its enforcement functions (other than a record concerning any other functions of the Authority or the general administration of the Authority),\u201d.The rationale for exclusion of enforcement functions of HSA from FOI was because criminal prosecutions could be a result and could involve the Garda\u00ed in the investigation of certain incidents. These ",
        "144 exclusions were put in place when the Authority was established in its own right. Prior to that the functions of the HSA would have been part of the Department of Health. Such records at the time would have had full coverage under FOI as a matter of course. Without prejudice, it would be appropriate to look at this exclusion again in the context of the reform of the FOI legislation and particularly by the commitments in regard to extension in the Programme for Government. The policy reasons for the exclusion need to be reassessed as is the case for all other proposed \u2018partial coverage\u2019. ",

A body, organisation or group standing prescribed pursuant to an order for the purposes of clause 7(1)(b) above shall be a public body only as respects functions referred to in that clause. Explanatory Note This Head provides a new schedule. The following arrangements will apply in relation to proposed orders under the First Schedule. NTMA Group entities This head will provide for the following to be included in the First Schedule, with respect to the public financial bodies, namely the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission (NPRF), the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the State Claims Agency (SCA): (i) that an order will be made that the Freedom of Information Act will apply to the State Claims Agency only in respect if its administrative records (ii) that an order will be made that the Freedom of Information Act does not apply to \u201cA record held by the NTMA, NDFA, NAMA or the NPRF relating to: ",
        "158 \u2022 commercial counterparties with whom the public financial bodies engage with in performing their functions; (iii) that no reference will be made in Schedule 3 to section 202 of the National Asset Management Agency legislation (iv) that if necessary, following legal analysis to assess whether the level of protection provided by Section 31(2)(n) of the Act is sufficient in light of the scale, extent and significance of the commercial activities that may be carried out by the public financial bodies, Section 31(2)(n) will be strengthened, or 31(a), (b) or (c) will be reinforced, or another safeguard as deemed appropriate will be put in place to meet the requirements. (v) that if necessary, following an assessment of the potential damage that would be caused to the ability of the NTMA and associated bodies to continue to successfully carry out their commercial functions if individual remuneration levels were to be disclosed. individual remuneration will be withheld but information on remuneration will continue to be available on an aggregate and anonymous basis. (vi) that if necessary, following examination of an analysis to be provided by the NTMA group of the impact of a retrospective application date, a more recent application date will be considered. In view of its specific legal role and responsibilities the State Claims Agency should be treated in an equivalent way to analogous public bodies such as Chief State Solicitors Office \u2013 the Act applies only to administrative records of such bodies. The Minister proposes that the State Claims Agency should be brought within the Act on the same basis. In seeking to encourage and promote future interest in Irish Government Bonds, the NTMA is currently operating in very challenging market conditions. Credit rating downgrades and the programme of international assistance has significantly eroded the State\u2019s previous investor base. This had resulted in a requirement on the part of the NTMA to engage with investors who require confirmation of absolute confidentiality in terms of their engagement with the NTMA. In addition, in view of the State\u2019s current financial circumstances, progress towards the objective of restoring the State\u2019s re-entry to the capital markets depends to a much greater extent than previously on the ability of the NTMA to secure and maintain interest among investors in participating in future market issuances given the availability of investment opportunities elsewhere. Similar considerations arise in relation to the objectives of the other public financial bodies. Accordingly it is intended that the Freedom of Information Act would not apply to records relating to investors/potential investors. The Minister notes that in addition to the common law duty of bank/customer confidentiality under section 99 of the NAMA Act, section 202 of the NAMA Act contains comprehensive prohibitions on the releases of confidential and commercially sensitive information. The Minister does not propose that FOI would override the ",
        "159 protection of customer information under section 99 or the broader general confidentiality restrictions applying to NAMA under section 202. The Minister will assess the requirement, if any, to strengthen within the current framework of the legislation, the protection necessary for confidential information held by the NTMA and the other financial bodies to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place under the FOI Act in relation to the release of information that could put them at a competitive disadvantage. This will require an analysis Section 31(2)(n) to assess whether the level of protection provided by this provision is sufficient in light of the scale, extent and significance of the commercial activities that may be carried out by the public financial bodies and in particular to examine whether the provisions included in section 31(1)(a), (b) and (c) reinforce (or alternatively may potentially obscure) the safeguards provided by 31(2)(n). International precedents may be useful in further reviewing this issue. The scope for a phased or incremental extension of the Act to the financial bodies will be examined in view of the specific commercial concerns raised. Central Bank of Ireland This head will provide for the following to be included in the First Schedule: - that an Order will be made that the Freedom of Information Act will apply to the Central Bank of Ireland other than in relation to records which are subject to professional secrecy obligations under the ECSB Statute or EU Financial Services Directives. This Order will ensure that the Freedom of Information will apply to the Central Bank of Ireland other than in relation to records which are subject to professional secrecy obligations under the ECSB Statute or EU Financial Services Directives. VECs The Minister will make an Order to provide that the FOI Act applies to the VECs with the exception of: Any records which would enable the compilation of information (that is not otherwise available to the general public) in relation to the comparative performance of schools in respect of the academic achievement of students enrolled therein, including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing\u2014 (i) the overall results in any year of students in a particular school in an examination or assessment, or (ii) the comparative overall results in any year of students in different schools in an examination or assessment.
