        "The priorities of the EESC during the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union \u2022 July \u2013 Dec. 2010 \u2022 3 The European Economic and Social Committee: a bridge between Europe and organised civil society Established by the 1957 Treaty of Rome, the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) represents organisations of employers, employees and other components of organised civil society in the Member States, notably in socioeconomic, civic, professional and cultural areas. The EESC is a consultative body of the European Union. The role that the European treaties confer on the EESC enables economic, social and civic stakeholders in the Member States to take part in the EU's policy-framing and decision-making processes. With views occasionally being diametrically opposed, the EESC's discussions often require real negotiations involving not only the representatives of employers (Group I) and employees (Group II), but also - and this is the distinguishing feature of the EESC - all the other components of organised civil society represented (Group III). As a forum for dialogue and consultation, and for bringing together differing views, the EESC helps to make the European integration process more democratic, while also bringing the European Union closer to the general public. In this way, participatory democracy enriches parliamentary democracy, the foundation of political democracy \u2013 by enabling players from civil society to make their views heard. The EESC, in other words, plays a distinct role of its own in consolidating the democratic legitimacy and effectiveness of the EU, in concert with other European institutions. In so doing it helps to promote a genuine identification with Europe. Furthermore, the EESC contributes to the promotion and development of the dialogue with and between civil society organisations, as well as the establishment of structures for consultation beyond the borders of the European Union as part of the EU's external policy. N.B.: The next renewal of the EESC will take place in October 2010. In accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, the term of office of members of the Committee will be five years instead of four years as at present and the President will be elected by the Assembly for a term of two and a half years. In accordance with the principle of rotation between the three Groups, the next President, who will take office on 20 October 2010, will come from the \"Various Interests\" Group. ",
        "4 \u2022 The priorities of the EESC during the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union \u2022 July \u2013 Dec. 2010 The Presidency of the Council of the European Union The Council of the European Union brings together ministerial representatives of the governments of the EU Member States, meeting in various formations according to the policy area under discussion. The Council's legislative and political decisions are prepared by a large number of specialised working parties and are fed upwards through the Permanent Representatives Committee to the Council itself. Member State governments in turn chair the Council's various meetings and represent the Council vis-\u00e0-vis the EU's other institutions and the European Union vis-\u00e0-vis the larger world. These presidencies of the Council of the European Union traditionally establish a set of broad political priorities and a work programme. The Kingdom of Belgium holds the presidency for the second half of 2010. Its priorities can be found at http://www.eu2010.be. This publication sets out some of the major activities of the European Economic and Social Committee during the period of the Belgian Presidency from July to December 2010. ",

        "6 \u2022 The priorities of the EESC during the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union \u2022 July \u2013 Dec. 2010 Introduction by President Mario Sepi The Belgian Presidency of the EU will have the task of leading Europe during a tough period of economic and social crisis which poses a particularly difficult challenge for the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. The European Economic and Social Committee is strongly engaged in this process. It will continue to assist the EU institutions by paying close attention to economic and social problems, following the \"road map\" for recovery that the Committee launched in March and the EESC biennial conference in Florence on \"Education to combat social exclusion\". In the context of these very serious problems, one area of work which will be at the core of our actions and reflections is the implementation of participatory democracy. As a body that catalyses the demands and needs of European civil society, the Committee must play its role to the full in order to make participatory democracy a concrete and more effective reality. Our Biennial Conference, which involved hundreds of civil society organisations at European and local level, was a very good example of how the new rules of the Lisbon Treaty are being applied in this field. As I stated at the very beginning of the Spanish Presidency, this theme goes hand in hand with the commitment to fundamental rights. The protection of rights was one of the three main priorities of my Presidency and of the Committee, and I intend to continue to deepen the work of the Committee around this priority. The year 2010 being the year of the fight against poverty, we have a great responsibility to address the pressing problem of social exclusion at the international and European level. The European Economic and Social Committee also has a particular responsibility as the new treaty opens up new perspectives: the Committee has to invest in its capacity building in order to face all the new challenges it will encounter. This will also provide an opportunity to put into practice the provisions and proposals that we tabled in our Programme for Europe: proposals of civil society in April 2009. A renewed and reinforced dialogue with the other institutions will allow the Committee to prove the value of its proposals. In particular, the Committee underlines the need for an improvement in European and national actions to develop the \"social capital\" of Europe, via a stronger European social policy and more investment in social innovation. In addition to the topics that I have already mentioned there is another priority that is crucial for us during the Belgian Presidency of the EU: climate change as the main current global challenge to which all the EU institutions have to respond with a common approach. We expect the Belgian Presidency to do all that is necessary to address these key issues. It should also demonstrate its active commitment to sending out positive signals about a Europe which is open to the rest of the world. Here too, the EESC intends to continue its action in the framework of European external policies, in particular through the civil society round tables with third countries. We are still confident that an active approach to the current challenges of globalisation is the only way for Europe to steer our society of tomorrow by implementing its social model. I want to reaffirm once again the main message contained in the work programme of my presidency: rights and solidarity to guide globalisation. I address this message once again to the EU Presidency. On this basis we will have solid and fruitful cooperation with the Council and the other institutions.

        "The priorities of the EESC during the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union \u2022 July \u2013 Dec. 2010 \u2022 7 At President Sepi's insistence, mindful of his slogan \"Rights and so- lidarity to guide globalisation\", and under the scrutiny of the EESC's Communication Group, chaired by Vice-President Irini Pari, the Eu- ropean Economic and Social Committee will continue to pursue its role as a committed player in the EU communication context during the Belgian EU Presidency. \u2022 The EESC will pay special attention to globalisation, including the challenges of growth and jobs (Europe 2020 strategy), immigra- tion, climate change and energy, so as to defend the European so- cial model and relaunch the world economy, mobilising new sources of growth and, finally, making the Lisbon Treaty work for citizens. \u2022 In the European year of eradicating poverty it will support the in- terinstitutional communication priorities outlined above as well as improving relations with national Economic and Social Coun- cils and organised civil society, building on good service to EESC members. \u2022 It will work to help boost the communication partnership with the other European institutions, in line with its latest opinion on \"Communicating Europe in Partnership\". With its newly formulated \"Programme for Europe\", the EESC will continue to present the pro- posals of civil society to the European Parliament and the Euro- pean Commission. \u2022 In the same interinstitutional context, the EESC will actively par- ticipate in communication efforts for the new Reform Treaty (the Lisbon Treaty), thereby strengthening the principle of participa- tory democracy. \u2022 The EESC will continue to implement the operational recom- mendations contained in its opinions on Plan D, the Communica- tion White Paper and the Commission Communication \"Communicating Europe in Partnership\", and the vision set out in its 2008 opinion \"Reconciling the national and European dimen- sions of communicating Europe\". \u2022 The EESC will announce its renewal from October 2010 for a new five-year mandate. \u2022 Finally, the EESC will seek to implement the addendum on com- munication appended to the November 2005 European Commis- sion-EESC Protocol of Cooperation, signed in May 2007. That addendum emphasises decentralised cooperation and synergies with the European Commission in the area of communication. Communication contact points have been identified and will conti- nue to engage in local events.

        "8 \u2022 The priorities of the EESC during the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union \u2022 July \u2013 Dec. 2010 The achievements of the Lisbon Treaty represent progress to- wards a more democratic, cohesive, transparent, efficient and open Union that is more respectful of the values underpinning the European social model and is more able to promote those values globally and to take its place on the international stage. The Committee anticipates that all the provisions of this treaty will soon be fully operational, and that the European Union will thus have the proper tools to implement new policies and suc- cessfully address the many challenges it faces, which are of deep concern to Europe's citizens, namely the economic and financial crisis, employment, the fight against poverty and social exclu- sion, climate change and above all the future of the European social model. In this context, civil society involvement in the process of framing EU policies and decisions is a key instrument not just for streng- thening the democratic legitimacy of the European institutions and EU action, but also for encouraging the growth of a shared understanding of what Europe is for and where it is going, and ensuring that Europe's citizens play their part fully in building Europe. Through its provisions enshrining participatory democracy and introducing a citizens' right of initiative, the Lisbon Treaty creates significant potential for European democracy to develop. Parti- cipatory democracy and active citizenship are fundamental prin- ciples upon which the success of European Union policies \u2013 and hence the Union's very future \u2013 depend. The Committee there- fore calls for the Regulation on the citizens' initiative to be adop- ted without delay and states its intention to help put this new right into effect. It is essential to implement a real strategy of listening and dia- logue that allows Europe's citizens to say what precisely they ex- pect from EU policies and how they envisage their common future. However, this calls for a real and long-term commitment from all the EU institutions, in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty. For its part, and in keeping with the tasks assigned to it by the Eu- ropean treaties, the Committee is determined to pursue its ini- tiatives, in close cooperation with the EU institutions and all other civil society players, with a view to contributing on the one hand to creating a real European public space of dialogue and debate and on the other to giving new impetus to the European project based on a forward-looking vision Europe's future for its citizens. The Committee intends to make its networks and infrastructure available to all the EU institutions by way of constructive support for dialogue with civil society and the organisations represen- ting it.

Now the Commission proposal for its succes- sor, the Europe 2020 strategy, has been adopted 1 . In the Com- munication the Commission stresses: \"\u2026the Economic and Social Committee as well as the Committee of Regions should also be more closely associated. Exchange of good practices, benchmarking and networking - as promoted by several Member States - has proven another useful tool to forge ownership and dynamism around the need for reform.\" 2 The new strategy and the unprecedented challenge of the eco- nomic crisis necessitate a roadmap for civil society generally. The EESC will continue its work with the national Economic and So- cial Councils and other partner organisations guided by the prio- rities (smart, sustainable and inclusive growth) and the flagship initiatives defined in the EU 2020 strategy. A road map will be drawn up with a view to helping stakeholders translate the ob- jectives into comprehensible actions in the Member States, and which will also include global challenges, governance and com- munication aspects. Based on successful past experiences and the positive response to the reports 3 drafted for the European Council jointly with the national ESCs and other partner organisations, it is clear that or- ganised civil society has the potential to be a vehicle for shaping and implementing the new Europe 2020 strategy.

        "10 \u2022 The priorities of the EESC during the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union \u2022 July \u2013 Dec. 2010 Economic crisis: governance and policies Following the sovereign debt problems being experienced in varying degrees by Member States, policy-makers have mobilised huge guarantees, especially within the euro area. Speculation against the euro creates the need to rethink economic gover- nance and policy-making in Europe. The EESC will adopt an opin- ion on the implications of the sovereign debt crisis for EU governance. In another opinion it will discuss the state of play with economic recovery and propose practical initiatives in sup- port of the economy. These initiatives will be complemented by an opinion proposing an EU response to a changing balance of global economic power. An opinion on Mobilising private and public investment for recovery and long-term structural change: developing Public Private Partnerships will be drawn up following the recent communication from the Commission on the subject. Budget: financial perspectives A new Commission proposal is expected during the Belgian pres- idency on revision of the financial perspectives for the period after 2013. The Committee has already commented on this dossier and expects to comment again on the Commission's spe- cific proposal. This is obviously a key dossier for the future of the European Union. Taxation The EESC is currently drawing up an opinion on a financial trans- action tax, which is to be adopted in July 2010. The revision of the energy taxation Directive will also be a priority issue. Adop- tion of the Commission proposal is expected in September 2010. The upcoming legislative proposal on Tax treatment of multi- purpose vouchers and other promotion schemes and the pro- posal for a Minimum VAT standard rate applicable from 2011 on are further issues to be addressed by the EESC. As regards non-legislative initiatives, the EESC is expecting to be consulted on the Green Paper on a new VAT strategy and the Communication on a Citizen's First taxation policy initiative. Financial markets European regulation and effective surveillance must be provided for to address the current crisis in the financial markets. The Com- mission has planned a legislative proposal intended to increase the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority in the surveillance of rating agencies. A Green Paper on corporate governance in financial institutions is also planned, as well as a proposal for a directive on strengthening the quality and quan- tity of bank capital. Economic, social and territorial cohesion Having had the opportunity to state its views on cohesion policy for macro-regions, the Committee provided a detailed response to the first of these proposals, the Strategy for the Baltic Sea re- gion. It then contributed to the drawing up of a draft strategy for the Danube basin. The European Commission will officially pres- ent its strategy for the Danube macro-region during the Belgian presidency, which will enable the Committee to take a formal position on the plan. The European Commission intends to adopt its 5 th Report on Eco- nomic, Social and Territorial Cohesion in November 2010. The Committee will give its views on the recent developments in co- hesion policy presented in that report and will also address the main options for the future of this policy, which the Commission also intends to present in conjunction with the 5 th Report. The Committee has addressed in detail the issue of Governance and partnership in regional cohesion; the relevant opinion will be adopted at the beginning of the Belgian presidency. This work is also relevant to the discussion of EU cohesion policy in 2014- 2020. The Committee will continue its efforts to strengthen the involvement of partners in drawing up and implementing proj- ects co-financed through the Structural Funds, thus helping to improve the effectiveness of those projects.

The Belgian presidency will be following the debate about the consumer rights Directive and collective redress for breaches of competition law based on new Com- mission proposals. Contact: Luis Lobo +32 25469717 luis.lobo@eesc.europa.eu int@eesc.europa.eu Industrial and competition policy R&D and innovation are essential strategic assets, especially in a globalised world. The section is organising a major conference on \"Innovation and Enterprise\" in collaboration with the Belgian presidency, which has included this issue among its top priorities. The purpose of the conference is to prepare for the informal Council of Industry and Research Ministers in mid-July 2010. The European Plan for Research and Innovation will also be pu- blished by the European Commission during the Belgian presi- dency. Questions relating to copyright protection and the European pa- tent, as well as support for SMEs, economic clustering and in- dustrial policy, are other important issues on which the section is currently preparing opinions that are likely to be adopted du- ring Belgium's EU presidency. Financial services The presidency intends to work on introducing crisis exit strate- gies. This will also call for robust measures on financial markets. The Committee can expect to be asked for its views on the va- rious initiatives anticipated, e.g. on banking and insurance. Single market With the recent publication of the Monti Report, the importance of boosting the internal market is back on the agenda, and the Belgian presidency intends to support this. The section will ob- viously be ready to contribute to this relaunch, and its Single Market Observatory (SMO) can play a key role. Better regulation and the Single Market Observatory (SMO) The Single Market Observatory (SMO) was set up by the Euro- pean Economic and Social Committee (EESC) in 1994 with the support of the European Parliament, the Council and the Euro- pean Commission. Its objective is to be a \"pressure group\" made up of representatives of EU civil society organisations to identify shortcomings in the single market, propose solutions and help the legislator fine-tune its proposals. The SMO has 33 members assisted by a secretariat within the section for the Single Market, Production and Consumption (INT).

This will also include co-operation with various platforms such as the European University Institute (EUI), the Centre for Euro- pean Policy Studies (CEPS) and the European Policy Centre (EPC). The SMO database on European self- and co-regulation, which involves close cooperation with the European Commission, will also feed into external activities (e.g. The Hague Institute for the Internationalisation of Law, HiiL, and the Bertelsmann Founda- tion). The SMO will certainly contribute to the discussion on bet- ter regulation and supervision of the financial sector. Some form of cooperation with the ECO section would be recommended here.

The section will also be monitoring certain issues relating to the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice . The Lisbon Treaty has increased the importance of tourism . The EESC, which has always been very active in this area, will be asked to give its views on various tourism initiatives, including social tourism.

Two opinions about immigration and asylum will be adopted in September 2010: The added value of a common European asylum system and The role of legal immigration in the context of de- mographic challenges . A conference on the second of this will also be co-organised with the Belgian presidency by the end of Novem- ber. In the context of the 2010 European Year for combating poverty and social exclusion and the ongoing debate on the strengthening of Social Europe three opinions will be adopted: The open method of coordination and the social clause in the context of Europe 2020, The development of social welfare benefits and Child poverty and children's well-being . Drawing on its long experience in disability, the EESC will also adopt an opinion on Disability Mainstreaming . Finally, the ques- tion of how European labour markets can take better account of the challenges posed by climate change will be explored in a highly to- pical opinion on Green Jobs. Other opinions scheduled for adoption in the autumn include an own-initiative opinion on Financial participation of workers in Europe and referrals directly linked to the Committee's consultative role (Sexual abuse of children and child pornography and Trafficking in human beings) . Labour Market Observatory The Labour Market Observatory, set up in 2007, has carried out in- tensive work on a wide range of issues specific to the labour market. The programme for the second half of 2010 includes a hearing on Culture as a tool to enhance sustainable working life and competitive- ness , and on 19 November the Observatory will co-organise a high-level conference with the Seimas , the Lithuanian Parliament, in Vilnius on the impact of the crisis on employment in the Baltic States.

Certain topics - such as the revision of the Common Agriculture Policy, climate change and the 7th Environmental Action Programme \u2013 will be particularly visible. Agriculture The main focus of the Belgian Presidency will be the Common Agricultural Policy after 2013. The consultation period ends in July and the Commission is expected to issue a communication in autumn 2010. Following the EESC's own-initiative opinion on this topic adopted in March 2010, which was widely praised as a meaningful contribution that kick-starts the reform process, the Committee will continue its work and present the view of or- ganised civil society on the communication. Fisheries The ongoing review of the Common Fisheries Policy will continue during the second half of 2010: the Commission plans to finalise the impact assessment by the autumn, and the EESC will con- tinue to make the voice of civil society heard in all relevant fo- rums. Environment The Belgian presidency has announced its interest in promoting a 7 th Environmental Action Programme (7 th EAP). Following the- matic conferences in 2009 and 2010 (one of which was held in partnership with the EESC in November 2009), a major confer- ence on the 7 th EAP will be organised by the Belgian presidency in November 2010, with the EESC as one of the partners. Other topics of interest for the Belgian presidency are likely to be the Commission's planned directive for NOx and SOx emis- sion allowance trading and the communication on resource ef- ficiency.

The first two opin- ions will serve as concrete inputs to the Commission's work and the third, requested by the Belgian presidency, will be discussed at an informal meeting of the Council in September. In relation to transport , the Belgian authorities have requested another opinion from the EESC on action to encourage a wider uptake of electric vehicles (preventing the road transport sector from missing out on the green revolution). The opinion will be discussed at an informal Council meeting in July 2010. At the re- quest of the European Parliament, the EESC will draw up an ex- ploratory opinion entitled Towards a European Road Safety Area: strategic guidelines for road safety up to 2020 . On 19-22 Septem- ber 2010 the TEN section will co-organise with the EESC Sus- tainable Development Observatory (SDO) a broad public event on urban mobility, which will be held at Place Flagey in Brussels. This event, which will benefit from its association with the Bel- gian presidency, will present the views of the European civil so- ciety on a variety of new transport modes and approaches that have the potential to improve urban mobility. For the information society , the main issues to be discussed during the Belgian presidency are the Radio Spectrum Policy Pro- gramme (RSPP), the Strategy for Reinforcing Network and Infor- mation Security and the European Broadband Strategy. The Lisbon Treaty offers new policy options in relation to Services of General Interest (SGI) , which the EESC will take advantage of by adopting an own-initiative opinion on the potential usefulness of SGI in dealing with the financial and economic crisis. Building on the EESC's popular European Cycling Lexicon, the TEN Section will launch the European Sustainable Construc- tion Dictionary at the Sustainable Architecture Exhibition, to be held at the European Parliament by the Architects' Council of Eu- rope around the end of November 2010.

The CCMI will thus continue to discuss the proposals for realising the objectives of the renewed Lisbon strategy and try to predict the changes involved in switching to a competitive, socially responsible and environmentally sustain- able economic system, while taking the current context of eco- nomic crisis into account. Specifically, the CCMI will complete the opinion requested by the Belgian presidency on the impact on employment of industrial change due to environmental, energy and climate challenges. It will also look at the current situation and outlook in a number of sectors, both traditional \u2013 e.g. metal-working, rotogravure print- ing, textile services \u2013 and innovative (while highlighting the in- novative aspects of traditional industries). In the second category attention can be drawn to work on the cultural and creative in- dustries and on technological, industrial and science parks. The Consultative Commission on Industrial Change has expertise and experience in all these areas on which it is ready to draw in order to provide revised and up-to-date data to the Belgian presidency The CCMI will continue its programme of events to publicise the most effective methods used by the Member States to mitigate and pre-empt the effects of industrial change. Similarly, particu- lar attention will be paid to analysing the regional impact of global industrial change from a socio-economic and cultural per- spective, and to the transition promoted by certain regions from models based on heavy industry to socio-economic systems geared towards the creative industries.

        "The priorities of the EESC during the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union \u2022 July \u2013 Dec. 2010 \u2022 19 The European Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body set up by the Rome Treaties in 1957. It consists of repre- sentatives of organisations of employers, employees and other components of organised civil society in the Member States, no- tably in socioeconomic, civic, professional and cultural areas. Its main task is to advise the three major EU institutions (European Parliament, Council of the European Union and European Com- mission). It is mandatory for the EESC to be consulted on all those issues stipulated in the Treaties and whenever the institutions deem it appropriate. It can also be consulted on an exploratory basis by these same institutions, or can itself take the initiative to issue an opinion (around 15% of its opinions are own-initiative opinions). The EESC adopts on average 200 opinions a year on a wide range of subjects concerning European integration. It the- refore plays an active role in the European Union's policy-fra- ming and decision-making processes. The EESC also has two complementary tasks: \u2022 first, promoting the development of a more participatory, more inclusive European Union that is closer to its citizens, by acting both as the preferred intermediary between civil society orga- nisations and the European institutions and as organised civil society's institutional forum for representation, consultation, in- formation and expression, and, \u2022 second, supporting the European Union's external activities by organising and developing dialogue with civil society organisa- tions in non-EU countries and regional blocs and by helping to promote and establish structures for consultation and dialogue with organised civil society. Such countries and blocs include, The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) Mario Sepi President Irini Pari Vice-President President of the Communication Group Seppo Kallio Vice-President President of the Budget Group Henri Malosse President of the Group I \u2013 Employers Georgios Dassis President of the Group II \u2013 Employees Staffan Nilsson President of the Group III \u2013 Various Interests Martin Westlake Secretary General ",

Thanks to the EESC, building Europe is therefore the task not only of the European Union and politicians, but also of mem- bers of the public belonging to organisations involved in eco- nomic, social, civic and cultural life. The EESC is made up of 344 members split into three groups: the \"Employers\" group, the \"Employees\" group and the \"Various Interests\" group, which brings together representatives of va- rious components of organised civil society not covered by the two other groups, that is, bodies representing craftsmen, far- mers, SMEs, the professions, consumers in the social economy, family associations and associations promoting the rights of people with disabilities and combating social exclusion, the ge- neral interest, etc. The EESC's membership is not static. It changes with each renewal so as to reflect changes in civil so- ciety in the Member States as accurately as possible. Until September 2010, the EESC Presidency will be held by Mr Mario Sepi (Workers' Group, Italy), assisted by two vice-presi- dents, Ms Irini Pari (Employers Group, Greece) and Mr Seppo Kal- lio (Various Interests Group, Finland). The EESC Secretariat is headed by Mr Martin Westlake, Secretary-General. Links between the European Economic and Social Com- mittee and national economic and social councils and si- milar bodies The EESC and economic and social councils and similar institu- tions have in close cooperation built an important network of co- operation and communication at EU level. In the EU's Member States, this cooperation is based on regular meetings on specific subjects (in particular the renewed Lisbon Strategy), the exchange of information and the development of a joint website (http://eesc.europa.eu/ceslink/08-en/presentation-ceslink- en.html). It also participates actively in the work of the International As- sociation of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institu- tions (IAESCSI), whose members span 60 countries.

The EU's response to the crisis The main priority of the Belgian presidency will be to overcome the budgetary, financial, economic and social crisis.

For the latter, considerable emphasis will be placed on social issues, innovation and governance.
