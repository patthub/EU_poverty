Calls for human rights, safety and access to human rights-compliant asylum processes to be guaranteed, including by adhering to the principle of non-refoulement and providing dignified reception conditions; 6. Deplores the use of family separation, which can cause the systematic traumatisation of children and their immediate families, and is a method that appears, under the current US administration, to be a tool of immigration policy aimed at deterring people seeking safety; C 165/8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.5.2021 Thursday 18 July 2019 ",
        "7. Emphasises that family separation and immigration detention are never in the best interests of the child; 8.
