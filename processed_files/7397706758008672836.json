        "4 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 T he European Investment Bank has reached a land- mark. We are celebrating 60 years of investment in great projects that create jobs and improve lives. For 55 of those years, the Bank has been operating out- side the European Union. We have made a serious and long- term commitment to help partner countries across the world. Our world is getting smaller in some ways. Transport infra- structure connects people, while digital networks provide in- stant pathways and promote the sharing of information on levels we have never seen before. At the same time, inequali- ties are hampering economic development. Rural communi- ties are often forgotten, with women and girls and displaced populations left behind. We need a more inclusive and holis- tic approach to tackle these issues. The good news is that we are taking positive steps locally and globally. Across the African, Caribbean and Pacific regions, there is enormous potential, but each location faces its own chal- lenges. Through the Sustainable Development Goals, the world now has the framework in place to meet these chal- lenges. But we need more investment. Attitudes toward de- velopment are changing and the world is becoming more aware of what needs to be done, which players can get in- volved and how much money must be spent. The EIB and our partners are playing a very active role. In 2017, we invested EUR 1.47 billion in 40 projects in the ACP region, which is almost double the 2016 total of EUR 765 mil- lion. This increase came because many of the projects in our pipeline were approved and turned into excellent financing initiatives. It does not help to look at just the recent success- ful years. We must take a long-term view. There has been a lot of momentum to accomplish big things in the past few years. The EIB and our partners are trying to adapt to meet the new requirements that will maintain this momentum and serve the investment needs in all emerging economies. The EIB has the instruments to meet these needs and to ex- pand its impact. In 2017, we made a record investment in private equity, for example, of EUR 153 million in 12 funds and in one direct operation. We estimate that this will Foreword EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle ",
        "5 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES create 17,100 good, permanent jobs in 157 companies. We are also improving societies. We made water supplies bet- ter for 2.1 million people across the ACP countries, and pro- vided electricity to 1.7 million households. We improved transport for 179,000 passengers a day. The teams at our Luxembourg headquarters and our nine field offices in sub- Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific have worked hard to deliver these results. One key to success is private sector development. Across the world, the private sector can play a major role in sus- tainable development, as businesses create jobs and sus- tainable growth. The desire among major development banks to move from billions in development to trillions will require the EIB and our partners to attract more investment from the private sector. For this size of investment to hap- pen, we need to offer more support and a bigger toolbox to tackle the challenges. This is where the EIB comes in. Our project financing and stamp of approval attract other investors. In this way, the Bank promotes private sector development across the world. We are in a unique position. Our financial instru- ments enable us to provide the right backing for businesses of all sizes, from start-ups to large corporations with thou- sands of employees. The ACP Investment Facility revolving fund, for example, is crucial to our mission, as it lets us keep financing excellent projects and reinvesting the proceeds. The Impact Financing Envelope does the same thing, but for projects with more risk for a higher developmental im- pact. Finally, the Bank also uses its own resources. The EIB can put debt financing, equity investment, global loans and credit lines to work in support of the European Union\u2019s ex- ternal policy goals. We can help the private sector thrive by funding larger-scale infrastructure, often in the public sec- tor or in public-private partnerships. The EU\u2019s New Consensus on Development takes the previ- ous ideas about development and enhances them, aligning them with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are proud to be part of it, as it helps us stay deeply con- nected to our partner institutions, the European Commis- sion, the European Parliament and the European External Action Service. We need to be more inclusive and place more emphasis on projects that help young people, women and girls, and rural populations. We don\u2019t just want to empower people through financial solutions. We want to make conditions fair for everybody by providing the right infrastructure. Many global initiatives are seeking to do exactly this, calling for more financing and smarter investment. The EIB is ready to provide more support, working with other multilateral development banks and international financial institutions. We will bring our expertise and keep partnering with the European Commission to ensure the success of the External Investment Plan and develop even more innovative instru- ments in the future. When I travel the world and meet people who have benefit- ted from our projects, the managers of funds we have in- vested in and small business leaders, I am always struck by their ambition. The EIB and our partners also have ambition \u2014 to support sustainable development and improve lives across the world. We are always looking for new ways to ac- complish this. Across the world, the private sector can play a major role in sustainable development ",
        "6 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 Our impact in 2017 SME and mid-cap credit lines will result in 2,103 loans across the ACP regions and the Republic of South Africa. These will have an average size of EUR 188,000 and an average tenor of 4.6 years. They will sustain 67,835 jobs. Examples include I&M Bank Rwanda, Equity Bank Tanzania and the multire- gional African Export and Import Bank. Loans to microenterprises will sustain 57,500 jobs, 27% of which will be held by women and 44% by young people. Countries where these loans will make a difference include Mali, Senegal, Ethiopia and the Dominican Republic. Microfinance Investment Vehicles will create 550 jobs in the financial sector, across 14 microfinance institutions, which will issue 402,000 loans to microenterprises. Twenty five per- cent of the final beneficiaries will be women. These cover Private sector More than 2,000 loans for small businesses, better roads, cleaner water, equality, reliable electricity, improved education several regional groupings across Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, including 8,503 loans to students in the Domini- can Republic through Fundapec. Of these loans, 5,357 will go to women. Private equity funds will invest an average of EUR 4.6 mil- lion in 157 investee companies, and create direct, perma- nent employment for 17,100 people. These will include small businesses in Cameroon, Senegal, Congo, Gabon and Chad, and sectors from technology to health and agribusiness. Investment in mobile banking services will benefit 2.3 mil- lion people in Ethiopia, thanks to M-Birr. ",

        "8 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 Activities in 2017 A strong pipeline of projects T otal EIB investment in sub-Saharan Africa, the Carib- bean and the Pacific, including Overseas Countries and Territories and the Republic of South Africa reached a financial record in 2017 of EUR 1.468 billion. This is al- most double the EUR 765 million for 2016 and shows how a strong pipeline of approvals is helping projects on the ground. Approvals fell from EUR 1.384 billion in 2016 to EUR 1.277 billion in 2017. Disbursements also fell from a record high of EUR 954 million in 2016 to EUR 642 million in 2017, which is a return to the typical levels in the years before 2015. The re- cord-high disbursements in 2016 can be explained by a re- view of the portfolio of undisbursed balances. These were amended. The high levels of approvals and disbursements, compared to signatures in the previous year, can be seen in the chart below, as can the increased volume of signatures for 2017. Signed operations can be split into different sources of funding, which are generally used for different purposes. Signatures under the ACP Investment Facility, the revolv- ing fund that the EIB manages, reached EUR 716 million. A further EUR 670 million was invested from the Bank\u2019s own resources. The Bank also invested EUR 66 million in the Re- public of South Africa. Financing for South African opera- tions comes from the European Union\u2019s External Lending Mandate, managed by the EIB, where there is a separate window of EUR 462 million for projects in that country. There are challenges when lending in South Africa, includ- ing stringent requirements for local content, which do not match the EIB\u2019s procurement guidelines, and the economy and politics are volatile. The final EUR 16 million was invested in a facility \u2013 the Global Climate Partnership Fund \u2013 for the Republic of South Africa (which accounts for EUR 16 million of the EUR 66 million men- tioned above) and other countries in the ACP region and oth- er locations. In the Investment Facility figures, there are high levels of credit lines and framework loans, demonstrating the Bank\u2019s continued support for financial sectors in the ACP region. We also invested a record amount of EUR 153 million in eq - uity operations in 2017, showing that demand for these op- erations is increasing and that they are beginning to get a bigger foothold in diverse sectors of African, Caribbean and Pacific economies. Good examples are the Agri-Vie fund ",
        "9 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES and the TL COM Tide Africa Fund, one of two investments formalised under the Boost Africa initiative, the innovative platform targeting start-ups providing technological solu- tions to social and environmental problems. Under our own resource lending, the Bank extended its re- lationship with the Caribbean Development Bank, with a second climate action line of credit. Additional capacity was added this summer to support projects in disaster recovery. This was timely given the serious hurricane season across the Caribbean in 2017. We are also funding an operation in Dakar, Senegal, to modernise the city\u2019s buses, and our long- standing relationship with renewable energy production in Kenya is continuing with a further investment in the Olkaria geothermal facility. The EIB is always looking for projects that can reduce global poverty. In 2017, we signed our first investment with Afrex- imbank (The African Export Import Bank) to support SMEs and create jobs by focusing on trade-related investments across 40 African countries. The emphasis will be on sus- tainable industrialisation, as African countries want to de- velop manufacturing. This will create jobs and promote trade between African countries, but also between Africa and the European Union. The EIB is trying to support regional integration in Africa in a different way. The EIB has a number of focus areas: private sector development, vital infrastructure, climate action and regional integration. In 2017, the Bank set up the ACP Infra- structure Package, which will enable us to meet our target investment in those essential projects. The ACP Migration Package, meanwhile, is up and running with signatures to- talling EUR 228 million of the EUR 800 million total, in addi- tion to a comprehensive pipeline. 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 1.600,0 1,400.0 1,200.0 1,000.0 800,0 600,0 400,0 200,0 0,0 ACP and OCT yearly and cumulative approvals, signatures and disbursements (2003-2017) in EUR m Approvals Signatures Disbursements ",

        "14 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 M-Birr: Digital inclusion in Ethiopia A mbitious start-ups are being launched and tech funds are emerging in the hubs of Nairobi, Lagos and Kampala, as well as in Dakar. But what about the services that these platforms create? In Ethio- pia, millions of people are using a mobile money service, M- Birr, which is more advanced than the mobile banking tech- nology most Europeans use. This is how we change lives. Amadi leans back against the mud wall of her home and re- calls the days she used to spend queueing in the burning Ethiopian sun to receive her social security payments. Often the money wouldn\u2019t be there and Amadi, an elderly wom- an, trekked hours back to her remote village with no mon- ey, only to go through the same ordeal another day. \u201cThere were a lot of troubles. It was very hard,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now we\u2019re in much better condition.\u201d Amadi is one of two million Ethiopians who use M-Birr , a mo- bile banking service that takes its name from the birr, the country\u2019s currency. Now her government social payments are paid directly each month into her mobile M-Birr account at the regional Microfinance Institution (MFI). Instead of the long hike to collect her cash, she visits a nearby agent to make a with- drawal. \u201cI am respected and I get my money,\u201d she says. M-Birr plans to be the Ethiopian spearhead for the mobile phenomenon that\u2019s transforming finances for ordinary Afri- cans, alongside other players such as MTN, M-Pesa and Or- ange. Apart from those few countries that use mobile bank- ing, the continent relies heavily on cash payments. Logistics are not easy in Africa, so a mobile network makes it possible for money to move around safely and simply. Mobile plat- forms are effectively increasing financial inclusion. The digital economy is set to be a boom area in Africa ",
        "15 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES The investment was made under the Impact Financing Envelope. This is the first time the EIB has invested in mobile financial technology in Africa. This is a co-invest- ment with DEG, a subsidiary of Germany\u2019s KfW. Before its full roll-out in 2015, M-Birr ran a one-year pro- gramme that enabled five local microfinance institu- tions to offer mobile money services. The microfinance institutions offer M-Birr services in more than 7,000 loca- tions \u2013 M-Birr MFI branches and agents in shops, phar- macies or petrol stations around Ethiopia. The com- pany today processes social payments for over 750,000 households with around three million beneficiaries, as well as serving 280,000 mobile-money core clients. That\u2019s a transformation for a country where only one in five people has a bank account, while half of all adults own a mobile phone. \u201cWe play a big role in social inclu- sion,\u201d says M-Birr Executive Chairman Thierry Artaud. \u201cThe EIB investment will enable us to develop the busi- ness and help the country to grow.\u201d With the EIB investment, M-Birr plans to expand into other sectors of the Ethiopian economy, serving small businesses that can run into danger or extra expenses while moving daily cash earnings from one place to an- other. M-Birr is also supporting the microfinance institu- tions offering the M-Birr service, so they can set up more agents and branches. In a country the size of France and Spain combined, a broader network is vital. M-Birr and its partners are opening up Ethiopia to a whole world of mobile money that will have a tremendous impact on the daily lives of users. The company is really meeting a need and plans to spread access across all sectors of the economy. Communities served Bakala, a shop owner, is an M-Birr agent for the local MFI. Of 125 households in his village, all but three receive govern- ment social payments. The regularity of the M-Birr system allows recipients to plan their finances in a way that wasn\u2019t possible with the previous system. It\u2019s also good for Bakala\u2019s business. He plans to take out a loan to buy a machine for grinding corn meal and to open a restaurant where he\u2019ll em- ploy several workers, because so many people now visit his shop. But that\u2019s not the only reason he likes M-Birr. \u201cM-Birr im- proves my community,\u201d he says. \u201cI am serving my com- munity. This mobile service has made a big impact on my community.\u201d \u201cI like it better this way\u201d Outside the shop, an old woman named Mareh pulls a mo- bile phone from a pouch around her neck. Most M-Birr users buy a phone for only a few dollars, but those who can\u2019t afford even that can get a scratch card with a PIN code that they en- ter during their visit to the M-Birr agent to recover their so- cial payments. Mareh gestures emphatically with her phone as she lists the improvements to her life brought by M-Birr. Like Amadi, she used to be exhausted by long walks to distri- bution points for government money that often turned out not to be available. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for me to use a phone, but the agent helps me and I get my money through M-Birr,\u201d she says. \u201cI like it better this way.\u201d The EIB is backing the next stage of M-Birr\u2019s expansion with a EUR 3 million equity investment \u2013 and EUR 1 million may be added to this ",
        "16 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 Creating jobs and fulfilling dreams F ormally announced in 2016, Boost Africa is a joint ven- ture between the EIB, the African Development Bank and the European Commission. It is a fund of funds, designed to support entrepreneurs and innovative start-ups in the digital space in sub-Saharan Africa, and plans to create 25,000 jobs. The first investment under the initiative was made in 2017, in the TL Com Tide Africa Fund. TL Com is investing in an inter- esting platform dedicated to turning Africa into a genuine force in the next generation of software engineers. Ande- la was founded in 2014 by Christina Sass, Brice Nkengsa and Jeremy Johnson and has received investments from many sources, including the Chan Zuckerberg initiative. The EIB, through TL Com, has invested USD 3 million in Andela, which is built on the premise that talent can be found anywhere, but not opportunities. The aim is to train 100,000 African software developers in the first decade of operation. It seems to be working. Andela started out in Lagos, Nige- ria, in 2014 and has since added hubs in Nairobi, Kenya and the Ugandan capital, Kampala. Young and ambitious Af- rican people are trained by Andela in the art of coding and are then placed with companies to join development teams, usually remotely, and with salaries equivalent to the United States or Europe for people in their field. By joining these de- velopment teams, the Andela graduates gain good profes- sional experience, but also speak of being empowered to fol- low their ambitions. Around 25% of Andela\u2019s graduates are female. The global av- erage for software developers is 7%, so this is impressive. The company hopes female graduates will reach 50%. Andela\u2019s plan to train 100,000 developers is possible only if the company continues to grow at its current rate. It start- ed with six people and four students in 2014 and now has 600 people and several thousand students. Boost Africa is targeting the technology sector to create opportunities in Africa. Andela is one company meeting this ambition. As a tech start-up serving the African market, Andela has made a prolific start over its first few years. Fund manag- ers are beginning to see that Africa is primed for take-off in the field of private equity and venture capital.

More than 40 Fijians lost their lives and entire villages were left beyond repair. Thou- sands of people had no water and power afterwards. The country\u2019s economy lost the equivalent of about 20% of its gross domestic product. Climate change poses an existential threat to the Pacific Islands, through rising sea levels and the increase in ex- treme weather events such as Cyclone Winston. The ef- fects can be numerous and lethal, from ruined crop har- vests in villages and rural areas to the proliferation of waterborne diseases. In Fiji, inadequate water systems that cannot withstand the effects of flooding are a real problem, and as the pop- ulation of the capital, Suva, increases, it is crucial that the water and wastewater systems meet the needs of the people. Fiji\u2019s government has put together a comprehensive pro- gramme to meet the needs of 224,000 inhabitants of the Greater Suva Area. The EIB is supporting the programme with a loan of just under EUR 65 million, alongside assis- tance from the Asian Development Bank. It is our first op- eration in Fiji in 18 years and our first operation in an ACP country co-financed by the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations programme helping developing countries tackle climate change. Fiji\u2019s programme is being managed by the Water Authority of Fiji and will significantly increase Suva\u2019s resilience against shocks by upgrading the water infra- structure in several ways to adapt to climate change. A new water intake will be built on the Rewa, the largest river on Viti Letu. It will be located further inland, which reduces the risk of salt contamination, as existing infra- structure at the river delta is more exposed to the Pacif- ic Ocean. A treatment plant and pumping station will be added, along with a new reservoir, which will be con- nected to Suva\u2019s current water network. In addition to these new supplies of fresh water, existing wastewa- ter treatment facilities will be expanded. The capacity at the Kinoya sewerage treatment plant will be increased by 164%, meaning it will meet the requirements of an equivalent of 277,000 people. In addition to this, and to cope with the increased demands on the systems, around The battle against numerous threats ",

The waste- water network will be extended to an additional 4,500 households that are not served by the public system and have to use septic tanks. Sustainable development in Fiji depends on an inclusive and resilient approach to vital services such as the water supply and treatment facilities. Overall, this project will make clean water available to more people, and will mini- mise breaks in service, which remain an issue. This inclu- sive approach does not stop at the water supply. It also includes a plan to promote gender equality. The Water Au- thority of Fiji will employ a social impact specialist to make sure the project provides equal opportunities for women to work both on technical issues and maintenance. Suva is a vital urban centre for Fiji, but it\u2019s also important for the Pacific region, because it hosts many larger compa- nies in the private and financial sectors. This water project will provide peace of mind over the coming years, and im- prove the health and lives of people across the area.

        "20 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 A s in the Pacific, climate change is the major chal- lenge facing the Caribbean, posing major problems for the region\u2019s development. Extreme rainfall and drought are a huge danger to overall health, eco- nomic productivity, agriculture and quality of life. Increased sea and air temperatures lead to climate volatility which hurts the food supply and allows a resurgence in malaria as well as new diseases such as the Zika virus. The summer of 2017 offered reminders of the dangers of life in the Caribbean as Hurricanes Irma and Maria arrived. It is rare for two Category 5 storms to make landfall in one sea- son, and all the more destructive. These two storms struck within a few weeks of each other in September, adding to the burden. \u201cThis summer, almost all countries suffered damage to in- frastructure,\u201d says Cheryl Dixon, lead environmental spe- cialist at the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). \u201cThis ranges from physical infrastructure, so the roads, bridges, coastal and river defences and water and electricity trans- mission and distribution systems, to social infrastructure, damage to schools, hospitals and health centres. Resources are needed to finance these investments.\u201d A growing sense of urgency EIB\u2019s large appetite for climate action ",
        "21 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES There is a large appetite for climate action in the region. The EIB and the CDB have a long relationship spanning 40 years. Our institutions worked together on a framework loan for climate change mitigation and adaption projects that was signed in 2011. This project has invested in nine operations in eight countries, including water infrastructure in the Bahamas, the Belize Northern Highway, and a large- scale street lighting upgrade in Jamaica. In May 2017, we signed a second line of credit for climate ac- tion. At over EUR 100 million, or about USD 124 million, it is twice the size of the 2011 operation. The demand for financ- ing in these projects is huge, and the CDB had already iden- tified a pipeline of eligible projects worth around USD 300 million. \u201cThere is now a greater sense of urgency to see tan- gible expression of action on the ground in our Borrowing Member Countries,\u201d Dixon says. This call to action is taking several forms as the Caribbean countries take an active role in fighting climate change and \u201cbuilding it better,\u201d which means they are incorporating cli- mate action as much as possible into their projects. There is an understanding of the issue here that outstrips other plac- es. \u201cThe need for financing is particularly high for hardening physical infrastructure. Here I am referring to roads, drainage and coastal defences, for example,\u201d says Dixon. \u201cBut at the same time we need to improve our management of water re- sources and particularly potable water supplies.\u201d These actions will help soften the blow that comes with ex- treme weather by building resilience, but there is more to it. The project to install LED street lights in Jamaica has sev- eral benefits. Street lights are an essential public service, but in Jamaica they were the second-largest consumer of electricity in the country. The previous bulbs lasted around five years, and 20% of them had to be replaced each year. The new LED lights are more reliable and far more effi- cient, which saves energy and cuts emissions. They are also brighter, which helps make urban areas safer. The second line of credit is focusing on similar projects to the first credit line, but more of them. There will be more street lighting investment in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Lucia as well as further support for Jamaica\u2019s project. There will be extra investments in coastal defences and ed- ucation, as well as renewable energy. An investment in the former, along with some road and bridge reconstructions, have been agreed in Antigua and Barbuda. There is a lot of work to do. This is why the EIB and the CDB have set up a financing initiative for post-hurricane infra- structure reconstruction. The EIB has invested USD 24 mil- lion in this new initiative. The facility was set up in a matter of weeks as the extent of the damage from Irma and Maria became clear. The financing will also assist the urgent reha- bilitation and reconstruction of vital infrastructure, in par- ticular electricity networks, water systems and roads. \u201cThe financial resources required to address the climate change challenge comprehensively, across all aspects of mitigation and adaptation, are extremely large,\u201d Dixon says. The Caribbean Development Bank has real expertise in pro- jects in this field, and EIB and CDB technical staff have ben- efitted a lot from working together. The Caribbean region is taking the right road towards a sustainable future by pre- paring for the challenges and making its own environmen- tal footprint smaller through this holistic approach, which combines a fast response to financing with changing mind- sets. Over time, the results will speak for themselves. \u201cWe need to improve our management of water resources and particularly potable water supplies.\u201d ",

The city\u2019s transport infrastructure is under great pressure be- cause of this growth as well as a lack of investment. Under a government programme for urban modernisation, the EIB is investing EUR 80 million to support a EUR 370 mil- lion project that will rejuvenate public transport in Dakar. The project will create bus lanes along strategic routes and add 23 bus stations and 144 articulated buses. This will ease congestion in the city and assist economic development by providing fast, affordable and cleaner transport for around 65 million passengers per year.

This project is a vital part of Afri- ca\u2019s transport network plans. The structure, running nearly 1.5 kilometres, will shorten journey times and cut emissions significantly by reducing reliance on ferries, and it connects Senegal with Mauritania. As the only fixed link between the two nations, this bridge will significantly help the econo- mies in both regions. It is co-financed by the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the European Union, through the African Investment Facility (AfIF). Climate action and food production in South Africa The EIB is providing a EUR 50 million loan to the Land and Agricultural Development Bank of South Africa (Land Bank). The bank will use this money to offer loans in the agricul- ture food chain to small and medium-sized projects, up to 35% of which must have a climate action focus. This oper- ation will address Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, Zero Hunger, and SDG 13, Climate Action. Agribusiness is a significant sector of the South African economy, if not quite as important as in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. Agri-food represents about 12% of the country\u2019s gross domestic prod- uct and employs 7% to 10% of the active population. Agribusiness is underfunded in the country. Land Bank is focused entirely on the sector. As a state-owned institution, it has more capacity than traditional commercial banks, which are put off by the higher risks associated with ad- verse weather and a lack of collateral for small farmers. The EIB operation seeks to rectify this gap by attracting more finance to the sector and making it available to a range of players. This range includes emerging and small-scale farmers, who are traditionally underserved, but also larger private sector entities that want to modernise their processes or equip- ment and improve productivity. The climate action part of the operation is a new step, as it includes natural resource management, new technologies and carbon sequestering initiatives. We expect this operation to improve lives in rural areas and help food security in South Africa, while sustaining around 3,900 jobs, most of them involving younger, emerging farmers in rural communities.

It plans to diversify pro- duction and complete a comprehensive electrification pro- gramme. The EIB signed loans for projects in both of these fields in 2017, in the form of the Last Mile Connectivity Pro- gramme and a further increase in capacity at the Olkaria ge- othermal facility. These projects will contribute towards sev- eral Sustainable Development Goals, notably No Poverty, Affordable and Clean Energy, Decent Work and Economic Growth, and Climate Action. The EIB is co-financing a programme called Last Mile with the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. This project is also getting a grant from the European Union under the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund. Under the programme, power lines will be extended into rural areas of 32 of the 47 counties in Kenya. It is set to connect over 300,000 households to the grid, bringing power to around 1.5 mil- lion Kenyans. This is equivalent to more than the popula- tion of Mombasa, the country\u2019s second largest city. It makes the 2020 completion target ambitious, but also achievable thanks to the use of tried and tested equipment that can be rolled out quickly. On the power generation side, the Bank has invested in an extension to the Olkaria I geothermal plant, with the instal- lation of an additional turbine, which will add 70 MW to the facility\u2019s total output, bringing it to a level potentially pro- viding power to 529,000 households. Geothermal power is renewable and clean as it uses hot springs and geysers for energy. The EIB has worked with the promoter, KenGen, for around three decades, involving six operations. The partnership has been fruitful and together we are learning how to car- ry out projects in the best way. Following some issues re- garding the resettlement of local populations, the Bank and KenGen are ensuring high environmental and social stand- ards, while KenGen is working with the Kenyan Wildlife Ser- vice to minimise the impact on the diverse wildlife in Hell\u2019s Gate National Park, where Olkaria is located. Geothermal power is a key part of Kenya\u2019s energy mix. It can also be sus- tainable and beneficial to everyone.

New Cal- edonia\u2019s outer islands are severely disadvantaged when compared to the capital city Noum\u00e9a, on the main island, and its surrounding areas. BCI has an advantage here in that its reach is good. The operation is expected to support around 500 loans to small businesses based in the archipel- ago, averaging around EUR 40,000 each.

        "26 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 EIB Infrastructure Package for ACP I n November 2017, the EIB mobilised EUR 1.5 billion in ad- ditional resources for lending to the public sector in the ACP and OCT regions from 2018 to 2020. This will mobilise EUR 5 billion of investment for essential projects. The ACP Infrastructure Package represents a significant in- crease in EIB support for the public sector in ACP and ad- dresses the infrastructure gap in the region, which will boost the private sector by helping it develop and diversify. In the spirit of the EU Global Strategy, this will enable the EIB to maximise its support for local, national and regional economies, as well as creating opportunities for rural popu- lations, young people, and women and girls. By mobilising these funds, we provide investment where it is needed most. Through the Infrastructure Package, the EIB can increase its efforts to tackle the causes of migration as well as improving the conditions in countries along migra- tion routes. We can also speed up recovery efforts after dis- asters or conflicts and help with climate change mitigation and adaptation. This is a transition measure to boost investment until the end of 2020, taking in the last three years of the Cotonou Agreement. It builds on the significant levels of EIB financ- ing to the public and private sectors in the ACP region and complements other funding managed by the EIB. As with all the Bank\u2019s instruments, we are working with our partners to support sustainable economic growth, diversification, re- gional integration and job creation. How will the Infrastructure Package be used? The EIB Infrastructure Package can be used to provide loans to sovereigns that could then lend the money to govern- mental bodies and public sector companies. These loans to the ACP states and the OCT region will finance infrastruc- ture investments. Some loans might include interest rate subsidies and technical assistance. A big bump in financing ",

        "28 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 What sets the EIB apart Going far beyond lending T he EIB is the largest multilateral borrower and lend- er in the world. It is active in around 160 countries, investing in projects that meet stringent criteria on bankability, sustainability, environmental and social impact and potential for creating jobs and reducing poverty. We improve lives by offering financing terms that cannot be provided by the market alone and by helping prepare and implement projects. The Bank rarely finances more than 50% of the cost of a project. Instead, we hope that our pro- portion of financing toward a project will attract more in- vestment from partner institutions or other parties, such as private banks. We have managed the ACP Investment Facil- ity since it began in 2003. This facility is making a big differ- ence in the region and places us firmly at the heart of the European effort to tackle global challenges. Our role goes beyond lending. We also work on blending, which means we combine EIB loans with EU grants, and we do advising. EIB loans extend the typical repayment terms available to projects, and the terms are flexible enough to adjust on a case-by-case basis. Dedicated blending facilities are becoming ever more im- portant. The investment needs across all sectors are enor- mous, and sourcing funding from European institutions in addition to development banks will give the private sector a certain reassurance in viability, quite separate from the standards we maintain for our projects. The EIB helps fragile economies as well as robust ones. Our range of financing options is flexible enough that we oper- ate in countries facing civil and political struggles. The Bank is a long-term financial institution, and the fragile countries often require the most investment, because they lack what others take for granted. As the EU bank, we act as a catalyst for loans from oth- er organisations. We ensure that our grants and invest- ments in development provide the highest sustainable long-term impact. The use of innovative financing instruments that lever- age additional finance is crucial to ensuring the success of projects in developing countries. Subsidies enable us to support the economic and finan- cial soundness of projects with substantial environmen- tal or social impacts and to help when basic infrastruc- ture has been damaged by conflict or natural disaster in poorer or less developed countries. Technical assistance provided at all stages of the project can fund feasibility studies, project preparation and im- plementation, capacity building for financial interme- diaries and beneficiaries, and staff training to help raise environmental, social and governance standards. Thus, blending ensures the efficiency and the best use of resources available. It can improve project quality and long-term impact, optimise the Bank\u2019s service to ben- eficiaries, something we are always trying to improve, and promote donor cooperation between European aid organisations. Blending grants and loans ",
        "29 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES We can help clients mitigate foreign exchange risk by fi- nancing in local currencies. This especially helps small- er businesses, which need local currency loans more than most firms. Up to 40% of the EUR 3.7 billion capital endow- ment of the ACP Investment Facility can be lent in local cur- rencies. Lending in local currencies is a significant part of our private sector support and it is essential to getting pro- jects moving and showing results. The European Union sets the highest environmental and social standards. The EIB shares these values and wishes to see them broadened across the world. Our offerings stand apart from the market alternatives in three main areas: Long-term resources adapted to project needs: Five indicators are used: extension of typical maturity, match with asset life, local currency funding, grant element and innovative products. Technical contribution: In addition to financing, we can help improve the project characteristics in business, developmental, social, environmental or corporate govern- ance terms. Standards and resource mobilisation: Our par- ticipation in the transaction adds to the project\u2019s value by providing demonstration effects, raising standards or mo- bilising other financial resources, particularly among our European partner financing institutions. In response to global needs, the EIB continually develops in- novative instruments to ensure that its lending best meets borrowers\u2019 needs and addresses funding gaps. This applies to our support for the Sustainable Development Goals and the New EU Consensus on Development, which promotes a holistic and interconnected approach to tackling global issues. The blending of loans and grants is a key element of this, enabling the Bank to help make projects a success in chal- lenging sectors or countries. Grants are provided in various forms: technical assistance, interest rate subsidies, invest- ment grants or risk mitigation instruments. Technical assistance supports project preparation and im- plementation and capacity building for borrowers and fi- nal beneficiaries, and helps raise environmental, social and governance standards. This benefits the project cycle and improves the overall quality. In an endorsement of the EIB\u2019s technical assistance, the budget for it under the Investment Facility has reached EUR 95 million for the period 2014- 2020, compared with just over EUR 40 million for the previ- ous period. Subsidies boost the economic and financial soundness of projects offering substantial environmental or social im- pacts, or essential infrastructure projects in poorer or less developed countries, or regions suffering from conflict or natural disaster. Investment grants and risk mitigation in- struments may further help make projects bankable or re- duce their risks. Transparency and accountability are extremely impor- tant to the EIB. As a policy-driven public financial insti- tution, the Bank must be transparent about how we make decisions and implement EU policies in partner countries. We are accountable to citizens and must retain the high- est level of credibility. Our guiding principles are open- ness, good governance, participation and democratic accountability. To enhance this, our data are published in line with the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standard. This is a technical framework for publish- ing information and data on development cooperation activities. We have been doing this since 2014. On the EIB website, www.eib.org, anyone can download the details about how the information we publish on our activities compares to these international standards. Also in 2014, the EIB launched a public register. This con- tains the social and environmental project assessments of our operations. This information can also be viewed on the EIB website.

        "31 T he EIB employs different instruments to finance dif- ferent kinds of operations in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. In general, we finance public sector operations, mainly in infrastructure, in the form of senior loans. These funds can also be used for in- termediated loans. The ACP Investment Facility is geared to- wards private sector investment. In addition to senior and intermediated loans, we carry out equity and quasi-equity in- vestments, junior and subordinated loans, and provide guar- antees, interest rate subsidies and technical assistance. The Impact Financing Envelope is a separate window of the Investment Facility, and is used for higher impact projects that have bigger risks and higher returns. This is used to reach initiatives that go beyond the financial, geographical or sectoral scope of other instruments.

Our activities are in line with the EU Agenda for Change, the new EU Consensus on Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. This means that we can reach many kinds of operations, from the smallest of businesses to massive regional projects such as electricity and transport networks. Some of our fo- cus areas intertwine with other areas, meaning that pro- jects can make a difference in more than one area. The private sector Financial sectors Developing local and regional financial sectors is vital to en- hancing access to finance and to sustainable economic de- velopment. We provide credit lines in local currency, as well as guarantees, and we invest in funds and microfinance. We provide financing for the capital expenditure of financial in- stitutions and build capacity across the board. Small and medium-sized businesses We provide the financial resources, tools and advice to in- vest in small enterprises \u2013 the driving force for econom- ic growth and employment across the world. The EIB also makes financing available to mid-caps (companies with over 2,500 employees). Corporates and industry We support European businesses looking to invest in non- EU regions and sustainable industrial development pro- grammes in the ACP/OCT regions. Digital economy The EIB believes in businesses that use technology to ben- efit the poorest people, finding solutions for healthcare, education and financial services. We invest in the infrastruc- ture , but also in funds that target ambitious start-ups that are using technology to provide the essentials in innovative ways. Making a difference in vital infrastructure Sustainable infrastructure The EIB invests in sustainable infrastructure involving water and sanitation, energy, transport and telecommunications. These are the foundations that the private sector needs to develop. Cross-cutting priorities Climate action The Bank invests in climate change mitigation and adap- tation. Mitigation concerns the reduction of emissions and pollution in the fight against global temperature rises. Ad- aptation is about building resilience to climate change, in- cluding more extreme weather. The Bank has a new climate action strategy for the ACP region. Fragile economies The EIB provides long-term financing and technical assis- tance to lift economies in countries hurt by conflict, natural disasters and epidemics. Our Impact Financing Envelope also enables us to take more risk in markets that would not meet our requirements using traditional financing methods. ",
        "33 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES Regional integration The Bank supports projects bringing countries and regions together, in the financial sector and in shared infrastructure operations connecting people and businesses. The EIB\u2019s priorities in the ACP region can be broken down into the four major categories: private sector development, vital infrastructure, climate action and regional integration. Many ACP countries have a lot of potential for develop- ment, but they lack the required infrastructure. This applies for the architecture of their financial sectors, which can lack sophistication and diversity, but also for the physical infra - structure. Here, we are looking at water and sanitation, en- ergy, electrical networks, health services, as well as trans- port and communication networks. Generally, private sector operations and support for the fi- nancial sector are financed from the ACP Investment Fa- cility, the efficient revolving fund under the EIB\u2019s manage- ment. The EIB\u2019s own resource lending covers public sector projects. These are often centred on infrastructure. Econo- mies cannot develop to their full potential if the right condi- tions are not in place. In response to the global refugee and migration situation, quicker solutions are required. For the EIB, this has meant adjusting our instruments. The ACP Impact Financing Envelope has been increased from EUR 500 million to EUR 800 million, and has been turned into a revolving fund, with a fair proportion of allo- cations destined for projects with a migration focus. This separate window of the Investment Facility is used for pri- vate sector operations that go beyond the levels of risk pre- sented by traditional operations but that will have a large developmental impact for as many people as possible. People in the ACP region have the same entrepreneurial spirit and creative ideas as anywhere else. The Impact Fi- nancing Envelope is one of the ways we fuel this creativity. The ACP Investment Facility itself has been enhanced, too. Since the revolving fund began operating back in 2003, over 80% of the allocations have gone to the private sector. This includes financial sectors in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. In the same time frame, 66% of the EIB\u2019s own re- source investments in these countries have targeted the pub- lic sector, with the remainder going to private operations. In order to address the lack of infrastructure to support the private sector, the Investment Facility will allocate a further EUR 500 million to support public sector projects. Food security The EIB invests in agribusiness projects, increasing food se- curity and creating good jobs in rural areas. We are explor- ing agricultural value chains as well as investing in funds dedicated to this sector. Gender equality and youth The EIB gives priority to initiatives that support women and young people, and that level the playing field. The Bank has created a new strategy to make gender equality more prominent across all activities, and we will actively promote projects that support women and girls and create opportu- nities for them. Migration We are tackling the causes of migration by meeting the needs of smallholders and small businesses, creating dedi- cated financial instruments and exploring new and emerg- ing sectors. We finance investments that improve econom- ic resilience in ACP countries that are burdened by a large number of refugees. The EIB has created special instru- ments for these projects, notably the ACP Migration Pack- age. This supports public sector infrastructure projects as well as private sector operations that create jobs. ",
        "34 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 The decision to do this has been taken with private sector development in mind. These projects will lay the founda- tions to enable good jobs to be created, and to tackle the migration crisis, which is putting pressure on countries all over the world and, more importantly, causing lives to be lost. As demand for investment in infrastructure rises, the EIB is also responding with the ACP Infrastructure Package. This EUR 1.5 billion facility will be financed from our own re- sources, and over the next two years will leverage EUR 5 bil- lion in investment for sound infrastructure projects that meet the needs of people on the ground in the ACP region. A range of options Looking deeper into the Bank\u2019s private sector priorities, our approach is multi-pronged. This applies to the financial in- struments offered as well as to the sectors targeted. The In- vestment Facility will reduce poverty by creating jobs and sustainable growth. The EIB provides long-term finance, but it also maintains a flexible approach and brings alternative fi- nancing options to the table. This applies to the troubles re- lated to migration. It is a crisis and it is up to organisations like the EIB to offer investment and to encourage others to invest, to tackle the root causes of such issues. The ACP migration package works with the new Economic Resilience Initiative to provide a package of financing options that lift local econo- mies and bridge financing gaps for small businesses. In the ACP region, the EIB is focused on developing finan- cial sectors. With some exceptions, banks in this region of- ten are not modern in their outlook or the range of transac- tion types they can carry out. This leads them to avoid risk and fail to maximise their potential to support local econo- mies. This fear of risk can hurt local microenterprises, small firms and even larger businesses. The EIB continues to pro- vide credit lines to banks, in local currencies as well as the standard ones, to encourage support for small businesses. We are also placing more emphasis on investing in private equity funds, with SMEs and microfinance in mind. Private equity investments have increased in recent years. For the EIB, we have had some success in this domain outside and within the EU, where venture capital is more established. There is an increased appetite for equity as an alternative to traditional institutional financing. This is the case in Af- rica, where new fund managers are emerging and target- ing companies that use technology to address social and environmental issues. Boost Africa is one new initiative in this space. It is a fund of funds targeting technology sectors across the continent. As the EIB seeks to maximise its effectiveness in the ACP re- gion, the proportion of credit lines weighed against total private sector and financial sector investment will not be in- creased. The benefits to final users of EIB funding have to be maximised. These are the companies looking to evolve, but the financial sector offers them neither the means nor the expertise needed. The EIB is trying to address this gap. Bringing more We provide technical assistance to promote best practices amongst financial institutions, but we also look at the end users of the financing. These private sector companies at the end of the chain must know what they can do. Technical assistance can help in this case. For this, the EIB has to embrace multiple sectors. An exam- ple is agriculture and agribusiness. This sector employs a high proportion of people in many ACP countries. It is not a new sector for the Bank; we have long been active in it. Its importance cannot be understated as a means to produce food for growing populations, but also as a target sector for economic development and growth. There is much more to agriculture than growing crops or raising livestock. This sec- tor involves whole value chains of production. The EIB wants to invest in these whole value chains, in co- operation with our partners. Support for these business- es in the value chain is essential. It not only provides the means for established players to grow and to innovate, but also enables the economy to expand by bringing more peo- ple into it. As a multilateral and multiregional institution, the EIB learns lessons in one field or region and then applies ",
        "35 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES them in another. Over the course of the past two years, we have been working with the United Nations Industrial De- velopment Organization (UNIDO) on identifying projects in sustainable industry value chains, with some options identi- fied in Ethiopia. There are many examples of learning lessons and then ap- plying the new knowledge elsewhere. What we have learnt on a technical and procedural level by financing a project in the European Union can be applied to an investment in the same kind of facility in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean or the Pacific, and this also happens in reverse. Vital platforms In infrastructure, as with private sector investment, the EIB is aligned with the global EU strategy in the ACP region, where vital services simply are not available to all. We focus on investment for the poor as well as on regional integra- tion. On the first point, using the African continent as an ex- ample, more than half of the population does not have ac- cess to electricity. Clean water and sanitation are luxuries. Likewise, climate change is a huge challenge in the Pacific and the Caribbean. The Bank prioritises these investments in those regions. In this report, we take a closer look at two such operations: a water and sanitation project in the Fijian capital of Suva and its surrounding areas, and the second line of credit for climate action with the Caribbean Develop- ment Bank. This will support a range of initiatives in mitiga- tion and adaptation. Economic exchange between countries should be promot- ed and trade should be encouraged. Thus, all countries are helped if they have access to the same essential services. If one country is held back by poor infrastructure, another will be, too. The EIB invests in transport infrastructure, such as ports, airports and roads, to ensure there are stronger phys- ical links between countries, many of which share borders but not connections. Likewise, we invest in regional electricity distribution net- works. These are important for a number of reasons. A lack of access to power is a major obstacle for economic devel- opment. Transmission networks not only bring that electric- ity to more people across more countries, but by modernis- ing the systems there is less waste and less impact on the environment. In ACP countries, infrastructure programmes of a certain scale tend to be in the hands of the public sector. The EIB can lend directly to the public sector or to public-private partnership structures to get these programmes up and running, while we are also looking at other ways to facilitate investment. The Africa Energy Guarantee Facility, for exam- ple, is an innovative operation, as it will pool resources to create a risk-sharing facility dedicated to insurance for Sus- tainable Energy for All projects. The upshot of this should be that investors are encouraged to get involved with pro- jects that are essential but where financing is an obstacle. Green and clean Climate action is at the heart of everything the EIB does. On the occasion of COP 21 in Paris, towards the end of 2015, the European Investment Bank pledged to expand its invest- ment in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Our tar- get is to dedicate 35% of all non-EU lending to climate ac- tion projects by 2020, and naturally this will have an effect on ACP operations. We notice fluctuations from one year to the next, but on average, we are not far from our goal. The Bank\u2019s new Climate Action Strategy will provide the frame- works needed to ensure our investment goes towards more and better projects. ACP countries are especially vulnerable to climate change. Energy investments will be made with this in mind. Our fo- cus is on renewables, but whole systems need to be con- sidered, from resilient distribution networks to production that is more resistant to natural disasters. We are also in- vesting in equity funds that focus on renewable energies, and small-scale projects with climate action at their heart, and find sustainable solutions for gaps in essential services for underserved populations.

        "36 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 How we measure results Strengthening the power of our loans O utside the EU, the EIB uses its Results Measure- ment (ReM) Framework to track project results, the contribution to EU and country objectives and the difference that EIB involvement makes rela- tive to what local markets offer. This strengthens the apprais- al process, supports monitoring throughout the project cycle and complements the EIB\u2019s due diligence process. At the beginning of the project cycle, appropriate indica- tors are identified. Baselines and expected values are then set to capture economic, social and environmental out- comes of the operation. Projects are then rated according to three \u201cpillars\u201d covering the achievement of the policy ob- jectives, the quality and soundness of the operation and expected results, and the contribution of the EIB. The EIB works with other development agencies and financial insti- tutions to further improve the coordination and harmonisa- tion of the results indicators we use. Project performance against the estimates provided is monitored at different stages of a project\u2019s life. For di- rect investments, which are typically infrastructure pro- jects, results are monitored when the project is completed and again three years after completion. For intermediated operations, results are monitored at the end of the alloca- tion period in the case of credit lines, or at the end of the investment period for equity funds. Equity fund results are monitored again at the end of the fund\u2019s life. An enhanced \u201cReM+\u201d framework is used for projects financed under our Impact Financing Envelope. How ReM+ helps our monitoring ReM+ improves the monitoring of Impact Financing Enve- lope projects. This data helps with lesson learning, develop- ment effectiveness and external transparency. The EIB used ReM to develop the enhanced ReM+ framework. Pillar 1 of ReM+ covers the contribution of the project to EIB, EU and national priorities. This is similar to the ReM framework outlined above, but differs by adding an assess- ment of intent and capacity of the promoter to implement and monitor projects with high development impact and providing goods and services to the Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP). Experience has shown that these are key factors for the success of a project. ",
        "37 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES Pillar 1 impacts inputs outcomes outputs Pillar 2 Pillar 3 checks eligibility under EIB mandates and rates the contribution to the EU and country priorities. rates the quality and soundness of the operation, based on the expected results. rates the expected EIB financial and technical contribution, beyond the market alternative. ReM Framework Pillar 2 deals with the quality and soundness of the project and results. For the IFE, Pillar 2 is monitored annually, and is distinguished by the addition of deeper social and secto- ral performance indicators and by going further down the beneficiary line to track project results at the level of the small enterprises, employees, households and individuals that are the ultimate beneficiaries of the EIB projects. It also looks deeper into the profile of these beneficiaries, esti- mating the share of BoP beneficiaries as well as gender and youth dimensions. Pillar 3 covers the EIB\u2019s technical and financial contributions. The indicators recorded and tracked in the ReM+ are tai- lored to capture the relevant development results for each instrument and project context. Indicators are harmonised where possible in order to facilitate aggregation, but both the definition of direct and indirect beneficiaries and the nature of the EIB contribution to those beneficiaries vary substantially across the four IFE instruments, and as a con- sequence it is not always possible to aggregate the data. Overall, the impact of IFE investments will go well beyond that reflected by the size of the ElB's stake. Some of the IFE operations can seem comparatively small and yet reach many thousands of people. These investments will cata- lyse growth. Recognising this, ReM+ tracks the results of the overall project to which the EIB contributes, which then need to be seen in the context of the project as a whole, in- cluding project type, the amount of leverage and the infor- mation on the EIB technical and financial contribution pro- vided by Pillar 3 of the ReM. The Bank has also launched a research programme along- side the Global Development Network to apply cutting- edge techniques to project evaluation for operations un- der the IFE. In this training and mentorship programme, a group of 12 fellows will spend a year evaluating the impact of projects financed under the Bank\u2019s Impact Financing En- velope. The young researchers come from countries such as Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal. They were selected via a competitive application process for an EIB-Global Development Network (GDN) Fel- lowship in Applied Development Finance. ReM technical assistance The technical assistance used by the EIB is highly diverse and covers the full range of sectors, from small-scale private to large-scale infrastructure. This is directly or indirectly re- lated to lending operations to ensure that they are appro- priately targeted, are of good quality and are sustainable. Technical assistance also helps promoters, national authori- ties and financial intermediaries to improve set-ups, project identification, assessment methods and financial and risk management. Technical assistance operations are also assessed using a three-pillar methodology, and measuring these results ena- bles the Bank to refine and improve the process, and to un- derstand what kinds of operations work best in any given situation.

        "38 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 Partnerships and global initiatives The EIB remains committed to its work outside Europe O ur ties with EU companies, institutions and del- egations in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific regions are long-standing and stable. We take our lead from the European Commission and the Eu- ropean External Action Service, and invest in the projects and initiatives set out in the EU Agenda for Change, the Cotonou Agreement and the New Consensus on Development. The Bank has long worked with European Development Fi- nance Institutions on projects outside the European Union. These have proven vitally important. Later in this report, we cover the Mutual Reliance Initiative, our joint venture with the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and Ger- many\u2019s KfW, which tends to focus on the public sector. Our relationship with these partners is deep. In the past two decades in the ACP regions, we have co-financed 90 pro- jects with a total cost of EUR 16.3 billion with AFD and 48 for EUR 11.7 billion with KfW. These collaborations are effec- tive when it comes to crowding-in finance. The EIB\u2019s total financial contribution to the overall figures, in both cases, is less than 25%. In the cases of AFD and KfW, this figure is less than 15%, which demonstrates that by joining forces, we can catalyse significant investment from other sources. In the private sector, and especially in the growth area of private equity, the EIB has frequently co-financed projects with Proparco, which is partially owned by AFD and KfW\u2019s subsidiary, DEG. These enable us to work together and bring more financing to the underserved: small and medi- um-sized enterprises, start-ups and entrepreneurs. These sectors and people will create the bulk of the jobs needed for the young, emerging populations in Africa, the Caribbe- an and the Pacific. Our organisations share common goals: To meet the SDGs and to put together the financing the ACP region needs, it is important to form more partnerships. Achieving the SDGs across the world will require USD 11.5 trillion per year over the coming decade and a half, according to United Nations estimates. ",
        "39 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES Multilateral development banks (MDBs) and international fi- nancial institutions (IFIs) cannot do this alone. The EIB works in partnership with other organisations to share ideas and expertise as well as to collaborate on future projects in a wide range of sectors. Working together makes sure that more good projects get off the ground. European Commission and European External Action Service As a European institution, the EIB partners with the Euro- pean Commission and European External Action Service (EEAS) to promote EU development policies abroad. The Bank will continue to play a significant role in ACP countries and regions, thereby helping the Agenda for Change, the EC Private Sector Development strategy (PSD) and the New European Consensus on Development. The new consensus is especially important today as it is adapted to include Agenda 2030 and the 17 Sustainable De- velopment Goals, finding a balance among the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable devel- opment. This is structured around the five core themes of Agenda 2030, the \u201c5 Ps\u201d: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. Sustainable Energy for All The Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) objectives of uni- versal access, doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and doubling the share of renewable en- ergy are now reflected in SDG 7, Affordable and Clean En- ergy. This represents a major landmark in the recognition of the links between energy and sustainable development. The EIB\u2019s substantial loan portfolio, and strategic focus on renewable energy, takes into account the sector\u2019s pivotal role for development and the EIB\u2019s involvement in the EU response to the UN\u2019s SEforALL initiative and to the SDGs. The Bank is actively helping the EU respond to this initiative and it is working with the European Commission to scale up efforts in the energy sector significantly, notably through dedicated use of grant-loan blending and initiatives to at- tract private sector investment. Within the ACP region, this includes a number of facilities to support SEforALL in sub- Saharan Africa that have benefitted from reallocated EDF and Member State funding. The EIB has also developed a number of financing initia- tives to address specific gaps in the energy market and con- straints to private sector investment in meeting SEforAll ob- jectives. These include: \u2022 The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF) is a EUR 220 million risk-tiered fund-of- funds that provides risk capital to mobilise private invest- ments in renewable energy and energy efficiency pro- jects in developing countries. By raising an equal amount of public and private capital, GEEREF was one of the first vehicles to demonstrate how to use public risk capital to attract the private sector in development and climate fi- nance. At the end of 2017, GEEREF had invested in 13 funds across developing markets, five of which are dedi- cated to projects in sub-Saharan Africa, with one also tar- geting the Caribbean as well as Latin America. In total, GEEREF-backed funds have developed around 90 pro- jects, which represent over 1.6 GW of clean energy capac- ity, including 330 MW in sub-Saharan Africa. \u2022 GEEREF NeXt , the successor to GEEREF, has received an approval for USD 265 million from the Green Climate Fund (USD 250 million for a junior equity tranche and USD 15 million for technical assistance). With the pub- lic capital in place, GEEREF NeXt will raise an additional USD 500 million from a diversified pool of private inves- tors, including pension funds. The fund is expected to have its first close in mid-2018 and then start investment activities. In its five-year investment period, GEEREF NeXt will commit capital to over 20 funds and catalyse up to USD 30 billion for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in developing countries. \u2022 The EIB signed a deal in December 2017 to invest up to USD 75 million in the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF) . The Bank\u2019s participation will help the fund in- vest more money in sub-Saharan Africa for energy ef- ficiency and renewable energy projects. The GCPF is a stand-alone operation, but it will complement other EIB initiatives to support SEforALL, notably the Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP) , which has been developed by the EIB and the United Nations Environ- ment Programme (UNEP) in response to the SEforALL ini- tiative. REPP is a donor platform that will help develop at least 150 MW of small-scale renewable energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa. It provides access to existing risk mit- igation instruments, technical assistance, financial struc- turing and due diligence services, and results-based fi- nancial support. The EIB has not invested directly in REPP. ",
        "40 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 The Africa Energy Guarantee Facility Softening the aversion to risk G etting infrastructure projects off the ground in Af- rica remains a challenge, given the distance be- tween the need for investment and the appetite. There are different obstacles facing different fi- nanciers and insurance providers, risk aversion being a signifi- cant one. The EIB and Munich Re are working with the African Trade Insurance Agency (ATI) to soften this risk and make Afri- can energy projects more appealing to investors and insurers. The Africa Energy Guarantee Facility, signed in December 2017, will bring peace of mind to investors. It will be a boon to the sustainable energy market across the continent, and encourage the private sector to increase funding across the board for SEforALL-eligible investments that also meet the EIB\u2019s own environmental and social standards. The annual shortfall in investment to meet Africa\u2019s energy needs is estimated to be around USD 20 billion, and yet the continent has enormous potential to become a global lead- er in sustainable, renewable energy production. Energy ef- ficiency and access needs are also chronically underfunded. With a rapidly expanding young population expected to reach almost two billion in 2030, it is time to put the correct infrastructure in place. Around 600 million people in sub- Saharan Africa lack access to electricity, while power short- ages are frequent and highly disruptive. There are several ways to tackle these challenges. Some- times, small-scale, personal solutions will work. In other in- stances, large infrastructure is needed, but the financing is often not available because of perceived long-term politi- cal risks. Different steps must be taken to address the large funding gaps for infrastructure. \u201cA country\u2019s ability to provide reliable and clean energy to companies and its citizens is at the heart of sustainable growth,\u201d says George Otieno, the head of African Trade In- surance. \u201cFor the past five years, we have placed the energy sector at the core of our business development and growth objectives. This strategic focus has evolved as a result of lis- tening to our African government stakeholders who have clearly stated that improving energy access is one of their key priorities in the foreseeable future.\u201d The Africa Energy Guarantee Facility is a move towards im- proving energy access. Although in its infancy, the AEGF will enable more projects to be financed, and potentially benefit millions of people by increasing the availability of investment insurance for financiers looking at projects in Africa. In our first operation of this kind, the EIB is contrib- uting USD 50 million from the Impact Financing Envelope, enabling Munich Re to mobilise other investors and provide a pot of USD 1 billion for long-tenor investment insurance. By doing this, insurers will be able to offer more risk cover- age that is better suited to the African market, where ca- pacity needs to be increased. This will enable more good projects to come to fruition as promoters will have more opportunities to buy insurance for their equity investment. Banks and institutional investors will have increased capaci- ty to operate in these sectors, and there will be more equity and debt financing available. The facility is designed to share political and sovereign risk in PPPs, and help increase the availability of insurance prod- ucts in ATI member countries. The risks will be underwrit- ten by ATI, which has local knowledge of the markets in its member countries and can thus tailor the products accord- ingly, while risk monitoring will be up to Munich Re and EIB standards. These products will include insurance against sovereign or sub-sovereign non-payment and traditional political risk in- ",
        "41 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES surance perils such as expropriation or currency inconvert- ibility. Capacity will be built thanks to the facility\u2019s open architecture, which enables different investors to play dif- ferent parts in a cohesive unit, all under the management of one agency, the purpose-made Sustainable Finance Risk Consulting. Financial institutions will be able to participate at the guarantee level, which underpins the whole model, while insurers, reinsurers and export credit agencies will be able to play the roles of insurers and reinsurers in countries in which they may not previously have been active, and of- fer products to project investors that were not previously available in those markets. Africa requires significant investment in energy if it is go- ing to meet its own ambitions. This facility will help get new SEforALL-eligible investments off the drawing board, but it also offers a blueprint for risk sharing between insurers and international financial institutions. This model can help mo- bilise reinsurer balance sheets to mitigate key investment risks in emerging countries. There is significant potential development impact in sustainable energy for Africa, but also in other sectors and regions in need of further private investment. Mutual Reliance Initiative In the ACP countries, since completion of the pilot phase, 23 new operations have started applying the Mutual Reli - ance Initiative (MRI) approach. Three had to be withdrawn as the investment project stalled or the lenders\u2019 financ- ing approach changed. The EIB is involved in 14 of the re- maining 20 operations. The Bank is the lead financier in six of these, including water sector projects in the Seychelles, Tanzania and Zambia, an electricity project in Mozambique, and a port development project in Kenya. Overall, the MRI builds stronger ties with our partners AFD and KfW, and promotes more effective European finance outside the EU. It improves the relationship with project promoters and re- duces their administrative burdens. Ways of scaling up the initiative are being explored. European Financing Partners and Interact Climate Action Facility At the operational level, the EIB and other European devel- opment finance institutions (EDFIs) cooperate wherever jus- tified with joint financing, but mostly in the context of two initiatives: The European Financing Partners (EFP) initiative: as of 2017, out of the IF\u2019s total contribution of EUR 490 million for EFP I to V, a total of EUR 205 million had been committed to 33 projects. The bulk of these commitments were to finan- cial intermediaries (35%), communication (20%) and indus- try (17%) sectors. The largest proportion of investments were made in Nigeria (29%) and Kenya (22%). The Interact Climate Action Facility (ICCF) is a EUR 300 mil- lion climate change fund, set up in 2011 with a EUR 50 mil- lion commitment from the IF, and it builds on the concept of the EFP with the participation of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. As of 2017, nine projects in the ACP region at a value of EUR 135 million had been approved or were under appraisal. The EIB is participating in three of these projects through ICCF with a total commitment of EUR 12.8 million, and is directly financing three others. The bulk of ICCF projects are in the wind (43%) and solar (27%) sectors. The EIB is also managing the EU-EDFI Private Sector Devel- opment Facility (EEDF) for the European Commission. This EUR 45 million facility provides partial credit guarantees for eligible projects under SEforALL that are submitted for fi- nancing to EFP or ICCF. To date, the EIB has issued one guar- antee of EUR 5.35 million for an ICCF project with Mobisol, which sells pay-as-you-go solar home systems for low-in - come customers in Rwanda and Tanzania. A second project, involving a solar plant in Kenya, was approved by the ICCF Investment Committee in November 2015 and is expected to be signed this year. ",
        "42 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 The Compact with Africa The EIB is involved in discussions on investment priorities, at the global and country levels, under the German G20 presi- dency initiative \u201cCompact with Africa\u201d (CwA), which reflects a shift in development cooperation and finance that requires collective action and enhanced complementary actions among countries, donors and financial institutions. This is in harmony with the New EU Consensus on Development and with the EIB\u2019s own ambitions for the coming years. The CwA is intended to offer significant opportunities for the comprehensive planning of complementary interven- tions, combining policy dialogue, capacity building and sector-focused investment programmes. It is vital for the governance of the compact to allow for complementary in- struments, based on expertise and strengths. The EIB can take an active role at different levels, from policy dialogue to knowledge sharing and co-financing. The Bank is tak- ing an active role at country-level missions and in discus- sions with national authorities as well as other international organisations. A list of all MDBs\u2019 instruments that support the private sec- tor is available on the CwA website, with a view to providing more information for partner countries and beneficiaries. MDB initiatives In the context of Agenda 2030, the MDBs, including the EIB, are scaling up financing for development as well as increas- ing their capacity to support the SDGs by leveraging, mo- bilising and catalysing resources at all levels. SDG 17, which will mobilise additional finance for developing countries from multiple sources, calls on the MDBs for coordinated action. The EIB cooperates with the other MDBs in the context of the G20 and G7. This includes the request by member countries to discuss the best ways to enhance cooperation among MDBs and reinforce policy objectives. At the G7 in Bari in May 2017, member countries agreed to principles requiring a progressive alignment of safeguards and more cooperation. The G20 asked MDBs to work jointly on infrastructure financing and on the mobilisation of pri- vate sector resources for the next three years. Over the past two years, the G20 has also been working on actions to op- timise MDB balance sheets in view of the demand for new capital from the growing institutions. Climate Coordination with the MDBs is particularly intense in the area of climate action. The EIB tracks climate finance using definitions developed in cooperation with peer institutions. There are five voluntary principles: committing to climate strategies, managing climate risks, promoting climate smart objectives, improving climate performance, and accounting for climate action. In 2017, the EIB and the Green Climate Fund signed an Ac- creditation Master Agreement (AMA), enabling them to work together to finance climate action in developing coun- tries. The signing of AMAs is a prerequisite to implement- ing GCF-approved projects in collaboration with National Designated Authorities. The adoption of this AMA enables collaboration to advance on two EIB-led projects already approved by the GCF Board: Sustainable Landscapes in Eastern Madagascar and the aforementioned GEEREF NeXt.

The EIB cooperates with other MDBs on initiatives launched by individual institutions to address economic migration and forced displacement, including the WBG Global Con- cessional Financing Facility, the EIB ERI and the G20 en- dorsement of the Compact for Africa and the further devel- opment of the External Investment Plan (EIP). Infrastructure In 2016, of the USD 350 billion that the MDBs jointly fi- nanced and mobilised from other investors for investment projects, USD 150 billion went to infrastructure projects, in- cluding power, water, transportation, telecoms, IT and so- cial infrastructure such as schools and hospitals. During the 2017 Global Infrastructure Forum organised by the EIB and the Islamic Development Bank in Washington in April 2017, leaders of the MDBs agreed to deepen their collaboration to encourage private sector investment in vi- tal infrastructure to support sustainable and inclusive eco- nomic growth throughout the world. The MDBs pledged to join forces to co-finance projects. They also vowed to help generate interest among private sector investors in public- private partnerships and in the development of infrastruc- ture as an asset class for institutional investors. Initiatives are underway in this regard, and there is much potential in the Africa Energy Guarantee Facility, covered elsewhere in this report. Mobilisation of private investment and finance In the context of Agenda 2030, and considering the objec- tive to move from billions to trillions in development invest- ment, the mobilisation of private sector investment and fi- nance has become a focal area for MDBs. A joint MDB Task Force was set up to define common metrics and come up with joint reporting on mobilising private investment. De- velopment of institutional cooperation among MDBs and DFIs will involve refining principles on the use of blended finance and developing new approaches to prioritising the use of public funds and ensuring that they leverage private investment. This includes initiatives on \u201cde-risking\u201d and risk- sharing instruments and guarantee schemes to crowd-in private finance. Cooperation with the UN system To maximise the impact of our projects, and to explore new ways of doing things and new sectors to target on the road to the 2030 Agenda, the Bank is partnering with several or- ganisations to combine our financial know-how with their technical expertise and local knowledge. Taken together, we are boosting our capabilities in several sectors entirely relevant to the SDGs. The EIB collaborates with a number of UN agencies in these sectors. One agency is the United Nations Industrial Devel- opment Organization (UNIDO), in the field of industrialisa- tion and support for value chains in Ethiopia, for example, where the government has asked the EIB to finance two projects relating to the industrialisation strategy of the country \u2014 Modjo Leather City and the Agri-Business Parks. For the first project, UNIDO will work on the value chain un- der EC funding. UNIDO will also be the main partner of EIB Africa Day in November 2018 in Addis Ababa. The partnership with the United Nations Development Pro- gramme (UNDP) is expanding rapidly at institutional and operational levels. UNDP is playing an increasing role in engaging MDBs and DFIs at an early stage in the frame of national development plans, in order to foster the mobili- sation of international resources. The EIB and UNDP hold regular discussions on operating regions (Africa/Caribbe- an), and on potential joint operations, in particular under GCF. Other promising exchanges are being explored with our other UN partners, the United Nations Capital Develop- ment Fund (UNCDF), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The EIB and IFAD are ex- ploring joint operations under the ACP Smallholder Financ- ing Facility. ",
        "44 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 ACP Blending facilities Reducing poverty and improving infrastructure Ten years later: the EU Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund Starting off as an idea between the late EIB president Philippe Maystadt, and the EU Commissioner for Devel- opment, Louis Michel, the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund marked 10 years of operations in 2017. The fund has covered a lot of ground towards its goal to reduce poverty by promoting infrastructure investment in sub- Saharan Africa, supporting more than 80 infrastructure projects in transport, energy, water and information and communication technology (ICT). This support comes from grants, provided by the donors of the Trust Fund, namely the European Commission and several EU Member States, and blended with long-term finance from the EIB and other participating financiers. Each euro provided by the EU-AITF has unlocked EUR 18.1 of new infrastructure investment, for a total investment of EUR 8.1 billion. Here are some of the milestones of EU-AITF: \u2022 From 10 initial donors (the European Commission and nine EU Member States) and EUR 87 million in contributions, the fund has grown to 14 donors and EUR 813 million of paid- in contributions. From four grants worth EUR 15.5 million approved in the EU-AITF\u2019s first year, 2007, 119 grants total- ling EUR 733.9 million have now been approved. \u2022 The focus in the early years was on regional projects pro- moting interconnectivity, trade and regional integration, as well as projects listed as priorities in the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA). Funded from an original \u201cregional\u201d envelope of EUR 483 million, most of these projects have been implemented by the public sec- tor. Grant funding for one transport project with a regional dimension was approved in 2017 for EUR 9.4 million. \u2022 In 2013, the Sustainable Energy For All funding envelope was created, worth EUR 330 million. An expanding number of national energy projects have been supported and there has been an increasing focus on the private sector. The EU- AITF has helped a growing variety of operations in rural electrification or in situations where an intermediary finan- cial institution lends funds with advantageous conditions to final beneficiaries towards energy efficiency or renewa- ble energy investments. In 2017, the EU-AITF approved sup- port for six SEforALL projects worth EUR 64.2 million. \u2022 As the EU-AITF\u2019s support shifted from mostly public sector projects to private or a mix of public and private deals, the use of financial instruments has increased, from guaran- tees to risk sharing mechanisms to equity participation. In 2017, the EU-AITF approved two such types of grants. \u2022 Since the fund started, a number of projects have re- ceived several grants at different stages of their lives. EU- AITF grant support is flexible enough to address different project stages and take the form of various instruments, including technical assistance, interest rate subsidies, in- vestment grants and financial instruments.

        "45 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES \u2022 A good example of this is the third hydropower plant on the Ruzizi river, between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The EU-AITF provided a technical as- sistance grant in 2008 for feasibility studies. In 2017, with the project well advanced, an investment grant was al- located to fill a gap in the financing plan to ensure tar- geted maximum electricity tariffs are not exceeded. In between, two further grants were provided, one invest- ment and one technical assistance. The former was for the co-financing of project development costs, the lat- ter for technical reviews from the development phase to commercial operation. \u2022 In 2017, the EU-AITF allocated all of its resources, but money is still available for the facility because of savings during an operation\u2019s implementation or from cancella- tions of deals. The EU-AITF now will focus on managing this money, accelerating disbursements, implementing projects and monitoring results. Africa Investment Facility In operation since 2016, the Africa Investment Facility (AfIF) is the latest of the EU Regional Blending Facilities. The European Commission will tentatively allocate at least EUR 1.8 billion to the AfIF from 2016 to 2020. By the end of 2017, EUR 1.5 billion had been allocated to the AfIF from various programmes under the European Development Fund and the Development Cooperation Instrument (Re- gional Indicative Programmes and National Indicative Pro- grammes). More money will be allocated from the Intra- ACP programme in 2017, which will open up possibilities for blending in support of private sector development and the Boost Africa programme. Total approved grants under the Facility in 2017 amount- ed to EUR 967 million. After a modest 2016, the EIB signifi- cantly increased use of the AfIF in 2017. The board approved grants for six different projects worth a total of EUR 287 mil- lion, leveraging EIB lending of EUR 373 million. The Bank is also a co-financier in five other approved projects. Addi- tional grant applications will be prepared in 2018 and 2019. Caribbean Investment Facility We will use the Caribbean Investment Facility (CIF) on a case-by-case basis to support infrastructure, such as the en- ergy and water sectors, and potentially microfinance. One operation in the Dominican Republic with the EIB as lead financier has been approved under the CIF, with a grant of EUR 9.3 million. Total grants approved under the facil- ity amounted to EUR 92 million at the end of 2017, out of EUR 102 million allocated. There is one EIB-led operation in the Dominican Republic in the pipeline and we are seeking other co-financing opportunities. Investment Facility for the Pacific Programming of the 11th EDF includes an allocation for the Investment Facility for the Pacific (IFP) estimated at EUR 20 million. As with the Caribbean Investment Facility, the EIB will use IFP resources on a case-by-case basis, focus- ing on climate. Two operations in Fiji and Timor-Leste with the EIB as lead financier have been approved under the IFP for a total grant amount of EUR 10 million, though the lat- ter has been suspended. During an official visit to Fiji in late 2016, we signed an extension of the EIB\u2019s technical assis- tance programme with the Fiji Electricity Authority. This technical assistance will focus on Viti Levu, the larg- est island of the Fijian archipelago, which was hit hard by the category 5 Cyclone Winston in February 2016. The as- sistance will help establish a Transmission Network Devel- opment Plan, which will make the island's power supplies more resilient to problems related to climate change. This TA is part of a broader technical assistance initiative that provides a project preparation study for hydropower devel- opment on the Qaliwana river. ",

The department also implements ACP-relevant activities under spe- cial mandates. Many other people ensure the success of the ACP operations, including staff in the projects directorate, mandate management department, transaction management and restructuring, monitoring, equity and microfinance, trust funds and blending, and legal services. At the end of 2017, some 107 staff members were working on the ACP in the EIB\u2019s headquarters in Luxembourg and in regional offices and desks around the ACP region. We have external offices or desks in Addis Ababa, Abidjan, Dakar, Nairobi and Yaound\u00e9 for East, West and Central Af- rica, Pretoria for Southern Africa, Sydney for the Pacific and Santo Domingo and Barbados for the Caribbean. We employ staff members in regional offices because this helps us assess markets, organise projects, analyse work and communicate better with local partners. A local pres- ence within EU delegations, such as in the Yaound\u00e9 and Santo Domingo offices, enhances dialogue and reinforc- es synergies between the two financing arms of EU devel- opment cooperation. The Addis Ababa office, meanwhile, brings the EIB closer to the African Union headquarters, and enables the Bank to have better ties with that organisation. The West African regional office has moved from Dakar to Abidjan to bring us closer to the headquarters of the Afri- can Development Bank, a partner of real importance on the continent. ",
        "47 2017 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES The years to come Sustainable development and more jobs A s the financial arm of the European Union and as a multilateral development bank, the EIB will keep playing a key role in global development. The Bank is the world\u2019s largest lender by volume for cli- mate action and one of the largest lenders for water projects. These sectors are important for the structural development of emerging economies. We also remain committed to support- ing private sector development and have a wide range of in- struments for such projects over the coming years. The Cotonou Agreement will end in 2020, but the EIB will maintain its support for inclusive and sustainable econom- ic development in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific for decades. Over the coming years, we will focus on supporting the Sus- tainable Development Goals and creating jobs. We will also be active in helping the European Union meet its objectives on migration, sustainable growth and poverty alleviation. We have taken real steps to refine our offering from the ACP Migration Package to the Infrastructure Package and Boost Africa. With these initiatives, we expect to support many ex- cellent projects in the future. The EIB is not a stand-alone actor, nor do we wish to be. It is vital that we increase our coordination with European bi- lateral agencies, the European Commission and the Euro- pean External Action Service, as well as other global devel- opment banks. We will explore more ways to partner with other organisations and to co-finance our projects, making better use of limited public resources. This will help us sup- port private sector development and attract more capital from the private sector. We will continue to play a key role in wider initiatives, such as the European External Invest- ment Plan. Coordinated development efforts will have the greatest chances of success and have the biggest impact on people\u2019s lives. By working together, we can have the biggest impact across the world. ",

        "56 ANNUAL REPORT ON EIB ACTIVITY IN AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND THE PACIFIC, AND THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES 2017 The EIB and the Cotonou Agreement EIB operations in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (the ACPs), and those in Overseas Countries and Territories (the OCTs) are carried out under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (the \u201cCotonou Agree- ment\u201d, 2000-2020), and the Overseas Association Decision, the legal framework for EU relations with these regions. Financing under these agreements is provided from the European Development Fund (EDF) \u2013 EU Member States\u2019 budgets \u2013 and EIB own resources, which the Bank borrows on the internation- al capital markets. The Bank is entrusted with the management of the Investment Facility, a revolving fund which meets the financing needs of investment projects in the regions with a broad range of flexible risk-bearing instru- ments. To support the preparation and implementation of the projects it finances, the EIB is also able to provide grants in the form of interest rate subsidies and technical assistance to its borrowers and final beneficiaries. Under the Cotonou Agreement (signed in 2000, revised in 2005 and 2010) the central objective of ACP- EU cooperation is poverty reduction; sustainable development; and the progressive integration of the ACP countries in the world economy (Article 19.1). The agreement further provides that \u201cACP-EU cooperation strategies [\u2026] shall aim at achieving rapid and sustained job-creating economic growth, developing the private sector, increasing employment, im- proving access to productive economic activities and resources, and fostering regional cooperation and integration.\u201d (Article 20.1) In line with the new EU Consensus on Development, the UN Millennium Development Goals and now the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the EIB\u2019s activities in the ACP support projects that deliver sustain- able social, economic and environmental benefits whilst ensuring strict accountability for public funds.
