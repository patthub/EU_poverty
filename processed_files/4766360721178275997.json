The full text of the Presidency conclusions and annexes are reproduced below ( \u2192 points I.2 to I.16). Presidency conclusions I.2. The European Council met on 15 and 16 October 2008, against a backdrop of international economic and financial crisis. The European Council expressed its resolve to act in a concerted and comprehensive man- ner to protect the European financial system and depos- itors. The European Council reaffirmed the objective of an overall agreement on the \u2018energy/climate change\u2019 issue before the end of the year. It agreed to speed up work on energy security. It adopted the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum. In the external sphere, it took stock of Russia\u2019s implementation of the agree- ment of 8 September, the situation in Georgia and the EU\u2019s relations with its eastern neighbours. The Euro- pean Council heard the Irish Prime Minister\u2019s analysis of the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty; it will return to the issue in December. The European Coun- cil endorsed the composition of the Reflection Group on the Future of the Union. I.3. The meeting of the European Council was pre- ceded by an expos\u00e9 by the President of the European Parliament, Mr Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering, followed by an exchange of views. Economic and financial situation References: Council conclusions on EU arrangements for financial stability: Bull. 10-2007, point 1.10.4 Council conclusions on a coordinated EU response to the economic slowdown: point 1.7.6 of this Bul- letin Council conclusions on financial stability and financial supervision: point 1.7.5 of this Bulletin Council conclusions on the EU supervisory framework and financial stability arrangements: Bull. 5-2008, point 1.11.4 European Parliament resolution with recommen- dations to the Commission on Lamfalussy follow- up: future structure of supervision: point 1.11.5 of this Bulletin I.4. 1. Faced with the financial crisis, the European Council affirms that it is determined to take coordi- nated and thorough action to restore the smooth run- ning of the financial system, thus ensuring the normal and effective financing of the economy and returning to the path towards growth and employment. 2. The European Council welcomes the measures taken by the European Central Bank and by the relevant national central banks since the beginning of the finan- cial crisis, and the fact that they have coordinated their efforts well with the central banks of partner countries. The liquidity of the financial system will be ensured by all the authorities so as to maintain confidence and stability. 3. The European Council welcomes the concerted action plan of the euro-area countries of 12 October, of which it endorses the principles (14239/08). It also welcomes the measures adopted by the Member States, whether or not they belong to the euro area, in con- formity with the principles of that plan and in compli- ance with the Treaty. The national measures already approved by the Commission continue to be applica- ble. The European Council calls on the Member States to ensure that their future national measures also respect those principles, and to take account of the pos- sible effect of their decisions on the other Member States. 4. The European Council reaffirms its commitment that in all circumstances the necessary measures will be taken to preserve the stability of the financial system, to support the major financial institutions, to avoid bankruptcies and to protect savers\u2019 deposits. Inter alia, such measures aim, in conjunction with the central banks and supervisory authorities, to ensure sufficient liquidity for financial institutions, to facilitate their funding, and to provide them with capital resources so that they can continue to finance the economy prop- erly. The European Council considers that measures to support financial institutions in difficulty should go hand in hand with measures to protect taxpayers, to secure accountability on the part of executives and shareholders and to protect the legitimate interests of other market players.

        "Presidency conclusions Bull. EU 10-2008 9 I.5. 5. In the current exceptional circumstances, Euro- pean rules must continue to be implemented in a way that meets the need for speedy and flexible action. The European Council supports the Commission\u2019s imple- mentation, in this spirit, of the rules on competition policy, particularly State aids, while continuing to apply the principles of the single market and the sys- tem of State aids. 6. To enable speedy and effective action to be taken in a crisis situation, an informal warning, information- exchange and evaluation mechanism (the financial cri- sis cell) will be established. This mechanism will bring together representatives of the Presidency-in-office, the President of the Commission, the President of the ECB (in conjunction with the other European central banks), the President of the Eurogroup and the governments of the Member States. It will be based on existing administrative structures, may be activated at any time by a Member State faced with a crisis and will ensure that information is provided immediately and in con- fidence to the institutions and all the Member States. It will also help to ensure smooth coordination of actions taken or to be taken. The European Council requests the Council to finalise as soon as possible the procedures for the setting up and operation of the financial crisis cell. 7. Maintaining confidence in the financial and banking system and protecting the interests of depositors and investors also requires rigorous implementation by financial institutions of recommendations on the trans- parency of their commitments and risks. 8. The European Council stresses the need to strengthen the supervision of the European financial sector, partic- ularly cross-border groups, and to implement urgently the Ecofin Council\u2019s roadmap, with a view to improving the coordination of supervision at European level. In this context, the European Council welcomes the setting up of a high-level group by the Commission. To begin with, the European Council invites national supervisors to meet at least once a month, to exchange information. The European Council supports the speeding up of work to strengthen the rules on stability, including work on the capital requirements directive. In addition, the European Council calls for a speedy examination of the Commission\u2019s forthcoming legisla- tive proposal to strengthen the rules on rating agencies and their supervision at European level. It calls for speedy decisions on the development of European rules on the security of deposits to ensure that savers are protected. The European Council welcomes the deci- sion taken concerning the accounting standards appli- cable to financial institutions and their interpretation. Furthermore, the European Council calls for more general consideration, in consultation with the inter- national partners, of the effects that fair value and mark-to-market accounting would have on financial institutions and on the market, including their pro- cyclical effects. 9. In order to learn from the crisis and restore public confidence, the European Council makes a firm call for accountability on the part of all those involved in the financial system, particularly the banking sector. It emphasises that the real performance of company executives should be reflected in their remuneration, including their severance pay (\u2018golden parachutes\u2019), which should be in line with their actual contribution to the success of the company. Likewise, care should be taken to ensure that earnings from stock options or the system of remuneration, especially in the financial sec- tor, do not lead to excessive risk-taking or extreme con- centration on short-term objectives. The European Council calls on the Member States to work to put these principles into practice and calls on the Council to report back on the decisions taken by the end of the year. I.6. 10. Beyond the financial sector, the European Council underlines its determination to take the nec- essary steps to support growth and employment. It invites the Commission to make appropriate proposals by the end of the year, in particular to preserve the international competitiveness of European industry. The European Council emphasises that continued structural reform is more important than ever, to help restore growth and improve employment in Europe. Support for economic activity involves an adequate level of finance. The European Council welcomes the European Investment Bank\u2019s decision to mobilise EUR 30 billion to support European SMEs and its commitment to step up its ability to intervene in infra- structure projects. It calls on the EIB to assume a greater share of risk in the financing of SMEs. I.7. 11. Budget policies must continue to be in line with the revised Stability and Growth Pact, which should also be applied in a manner which reflects the current exceptional circumstances, as provided for in its rules. I.8. 12. The European Union must work with its inter- national partners on a genuine, all-encompassing reform of the international financial system based on the prin- ciples of transparency, sound banking, responsibility, integrity and world governance. The aim is to take early decisions on transparency, global standards of regula- tion, cross-border supervision and crisis management, to avoid conflicts of interest and to create an early warn- ing system, so as to engender confidence among savers and investors in every country. The Union will quickly take appropriate initiatives in consultation with its main partners and the relevant international financial institu- tions. These initiatives will be carefully prepared within the EU. I.9. 13. The European Council expresses its solidarity with the efforts made by Iceland, a country which is closely integrated into the EU single market through the EEA Agreement and which requires the support of ",
        "Presidency conclusions 10 Bull. EU 10-2008 the international community; it expects Iceland to hon- our its international commitments. I.10. 14. The European Council took note of a report drawn up by the Presidency, in cooperation with the Commission, on oil price volatility. It calls on the Council to press ahead with its discussions on this issue and, in the immediate future, requests the Com- mission to take the necessary action to promote the transparency of commercial oil stocks, as well as energy efficiency in conjunction with the European Investment Bank in particular. Treaty of Lisbon Reference: European Council conclusions: Bull. 6-2008, point I.3 I.11. 15. The European Council, recalling its conclu- sions of June 2008, took note of the analysis of the results of the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon pre- sented by the Irish Taoiseach, Mr Brian Cowen. The Irish government will continue its consultations with a view to contributing to finding a way to resolve the sit- uation. On that basis, the European Council agreed to return to this matter at its meeting in December 2008 with a view to defining the elements of a solution and a common path to be followed. Energy and climate change References: European Council conclusions: Bull. 3-2007, points I.9 to I.12; Bull. 3-2008, points I.14 to I.18 I.12. 16. The European Council confirms its determi- nation to honour the ambitious commitments on cli- mate and energy policy which it approved in March 2007 and March 2008. In this connection, it requests the Presidency and the Commission to organise inten- sive work over the next few weeks in order to enable the European Council in December 2008 to decide on appropriate responses to the challenge of applying that package in a rigorously established cost-effective man- ner to all sectors of the European economy and all Member States, having regard to each Member State\u2019s specific situation.

Security of energy supply is a priority for the European Union. It involves the responsibility and sol- idarity of all the Member States. To this end, taking account of the report submitted by the Presidency (14090/08), the European Council has decided to step up the work in progress, by adopting the following guidelines and requesting the Commission to submit relevant proposals or initiatives, where necessary, to: (a) finalise the legislative package on the internal mar- ket in electricity and gas before the end of the legisla- tive period; (b) expedite the implementation of the European energy efficiency action plan and the strategic energy technology plan; (c) pursue with determination the diversification of energy sources, to which the measures in the energy and climate package contribute directly; (d) promote improvement in the working of the mar- ket, in particular through greater transparency on flows and stockpiles and through sharing information on long-term requirements and resources; (e) develop crisis mechanisms to deal with temporary disruptions to supplies; ",
        "Presidency conclusions Bull. EU 10-2008 11 (f) strengthen and add to critical infrastructure, partic- ularly trans-European energy transport networks and liquefied natural gas terminals. Particular attention will be paid to interconnections and to the connection of the most isolated European countries, to the interface of European networks with supply infrastructure and to the need to diversify both sources and routes. The European Council supports the Commission initiative of establishing a plan of action to speed up intercon- nections in the Baltic region. A schedule of work will be drawn up for this purpose before the end of the year; (g) develop the Union\u2019s energy relations with producer and transit countries with a view to securing stability of supply and diversifying its energy sources and sup- ply routes. In this connection, the European Council welcomes the energy security initiatives taken by sev- eral Member States and, in particular, the meeting with the Caspian Sea countries and transit countries which will be organised by the Czech Presidency in the spring of 2009. 18. The European Council will return to this issue at its meeting in March 2009 to take stock of progress, in the light too of the Commission\u2019s forthcoming strate- gic energy review, and to adopt the necessary decisions. European Pact on Immigration and Asylum Reference: European Council conclusions: Bull. 6-2008, point I.4 I.14. 19. The European Council adopted the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum (13440/08), which expresses the commitment of the European Union and its Member States to conduct a fair, effective and con- sistent policy for dealing with the challenges and opportunities which migration represents. The pact will henceforth form the basis, for the Union and its Mem- ber States, of a common immigration and asylum pol- icy, guided by a spirit of solidarity between Member States and cooperation with third countries. This com- mon policy must be founded on proper management of migratory flows, in the interests not only of the host countries but also of the countries of origin and of the migrants themselves. 20. The fundamental principles set out in the pact are reflected in a series of measures which will have to be implemented immediately at both EU and national level. Moreover, these principles will also inform the future work programme of the European Union, which will be proposed by the Commission in May 2009 with a view to finalisation under the Swedish Presidency. Implementation of the pact will be the subject of an annual debate starting with the European Council in June 2010. Follow-up to the European Council of 1 September 2008 References: European Council conclusions: Bull. 9-2008, points I.1 and I.2 EU\u2013Ukraine summit: Bull. 9-2008, point 1.35.10 Council conclusions on relations with the Repub- lic of Moldova: point 1.35.14 of this Bulletin Council conclusions on Georgia and Russia: point 1.35.19 of this Bulletin I.15. 21. The European Council notes with satisfaction that Russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia as an essential additional step in the implementation of the agreements of 12 August and 8 September, as well as the launch- ing in Geneva of the international discussions provided for by those agreements. The European Council is ask- ing the Commission and the Council to continue a full in-depth evaluation of EU\u2013Russia relations with a view to the forthcoming summit, scheduled to take place in Nice on 14 November. It will be taken into account in the further negotiations for a new partnership agree- ment with Russia. 22. The European Union is resolved, in particular through its neighbourhood policy, to continue sup- porting its eastern neighbours in their efforts to achieve economic modernisation and democratisation. The European Council stresses in this respect the impor- tance of the outcome of the EU\u2013Ukraine summit in Paris and calls for relations between the Union and the Republic of Moldova and Georgia to be strengthened in accordance with the Council conclusions of 13 Oc- tober. It is instructing the Council to conduct an initial examination of the proposals for a future \u2018eastern part- nership\u2019 of the European Union which the Commis- sion intends to submit in November. Reflection group Reference: European Council conclusions: Bull. 12-2007, point I.5 I.16. 23. The European Council approved the proposal by the chairman of the Reflection Group and its two deputy chairmen concerning the composition of the group, as annexed to these conclusions. The group will start work as soon as possible and will conduct its dis- cussions in accordance with the mandate adopted by the European Council in December 2007. The General Secretariat of the Council will provide the group with material and logistical support. ",

It will return to the issue in December, with a view to defining the elements of a solution and a common path to be followed ( \u2192 point I.11). Transparency 1.1.2. Report from the Commission on the appli- cation in 2007 of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. Previous report: OJ C 106, 26.4.2008; COM(2007) 841; Bull. 12-2007, point 1.1.3 Reference: Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 145, 31.5.2001; Bull. 5-2001, point 1.1.2 Adopted by the Commission on 10 October. This report contains seven sections dealing with the following topics: transparency policy; Internet registers and sites; cooperation with the other institutions and Member States; analysis of access applications; application of exceptions to the right of access; complaints to the European Ombudsman; court actions. The overall picture that emerges from analysis of access applications is that a large proportion of them relate to Com- mission monitoring of the application of Com- munity law. In many cases, access was applied for in order to obtain documents likely to support the applicant\u2019s position in a complaint or an administrative or judicial action. The exception relating to protection of the Commission\u2019s deci- sion-making process is mainly cited to protect decision-making on individual issues. The excep- tion concerning the protection of commercial interests, which has shown a marked increase, is mainly cited in connection with requests for access to competition policy documents. According to the Commission, it is important to note that the Court of Justice has overturned the Court of First Instance\u2019s (CFI) interpretation as regards the right of a Member State to oppose the disclosure of documents originating from it, in that the Member State is required to state the rea- sons for its objection with reference to the excep- tions provided for in the regulation. The Commission underlined that the CFI has clarified a number of points: \u00a1 in cases where the hearing has not yet taken place, the \u2018court proceedings\u2019 exception applies without the institution having to carry out a con- crete examination of each document concerned; \u00a1 the \u2018investigation\u2019 exception in respect of infringements of Community law applies even after the hearing and until the judgment is handed down. As a rule, once the Court has handed down its judgment, this reason no longer applies; \u00a1 access to documents containing personal data falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1049/ 2001. The exception under Article 4(1)(b) concerns only personal data capable of actually and specifi- cally undermining the protection of privacy and the integrity of the individual.

Parliament supports the Commission\u2019s objective of improving the quality of Commu- nity legislation and reducing the legislative bur- den, including abolishing legislation that is unnecessary, hampers growth and inhibits inno- vation. It declared itself in favour of a principle- based legislation and expects quality to prevail over quantity. In the context of the efforts to bring about better lawmaking, Parliament stressed the importance of the principles of sub- sidiarity and proportionality, both in reducing unnecessary bureaucratic burdens on Member States and in securing broader acceptance among EU citizens for those measures which, in keep- ing with both principles, can only be taken at Community level. It deplored the fact that, despite having improved its procedures, the Commission continues to draw up separate doc- uments relating to simplification and \u2018better law- making\u2019 that contain non-identical lists of sim- plification strategies, which makes it difficult to get a complete overview of the strategy. Accord- ing to Parliament, the proliferation of such doc- uments must be avoided. It therefore called on the Commission to draw up a single annual doc- ument. In addition, Parliament confirmed its wish that the Commission adopt recasting as an ordi- nary legislative technique, even when the \u2018revi- sion\u2019 of the current text is being proposed, so as to make it possible to have, for each initiative, a complete overview of the text, including the spe- cific amendments, clearly indicating which parts are new and which parts remain unchanged. Finally, Parliament emphasised that the Com- mission\u2019s target of reducing administrative bur- dens by 25% by 2012 should be a net target, meaning that reductions in certain areas must not be nullified by new administrative burdens imposed elsewhere.

The Coun- cil underlined the importance of the principles of budget discipline and sound financial management to be applied to the financial management of decentralised agencies. On another note, the Council was concerned that according to the gen- eral findings of the Court of Auditors, the audited decentralised agencies do not plan their activities adequately nor do most of them have at their dis- posal sound tools for monitoring their activities, and that the reporting of the activities and the evaluation of the results need to be improved. It thus called on the agencies concerned to remedy this situation. Moreover, for those which have still not done it, decentralised agencies should produce a strategy document in the form of a multiannual work programme, with clear objectives and per- formance indicators of the impact and the out- comes that they aim to achieve. Decentralised agencies should also set up management control instruments linked to their work programmes and to their budgets, including all allocated resources, in order to develop the reports into genuine instru- ments of governance. In addition, the Council invited the Commission to continue providing assistance to the agencies in the most appropriate form and underlined in that context that particu- lar attention should be paid to dissemination of best practices, proper application of procedures for awarding contracts and appropriate training for the members of agencies\u2019 governing bodies. Finally, the Council invited the Court of Auditors to keep it updated on the progress made by the decentralised agencies and to extend its audits to cover executive agencies. 1.1.7.

Generally speaking, Parliament considers that the Commission\u2019s proposal is a commendable ini- tiative and is prepared to take part in the pro- ceedings of the interinstitutional working group through its representatives, but considers that the \u2018common approach\u2019 falls short of its expectations of achieving an interinstitutional agreement. It therefore proposed a list of points the programme of the interinstitutional working group should encompass. According to Parliament, the priority of the common framework for interinstitutional understanding should be to rationalise the opera- tion and maximise the added value of the regula- tory agencies by creating greater transparency, visible democratic control and improved effi- ciency. Moreover, it stressed the need to establish parliamentary control over the formation and operation of regulatory agencies. Finally, the Commission is invited to submit the conclusions of the horizontal evaluation of the regulatory agencies before the end of the 2009\u201310 period, so that the conclusions can be taken into account by the interinstitutional working group.

The Committee recalled that it supports the Commission\u2019s efforts for bet- ter lawmaking and backs the proposals to improve the way in which impact assessments are drawn up and presented. In its draft guidelines, the Commission considers three main categories of impacts: social impacts, economic impacts and environmental impacts. In this respect, the Com- mittee noted that the \u2018social impacts\u2019 category covers such a vast range of issues that it would be better to split into two subcategories: social impacts per se and impacts that have a bearing on society (anti-terrorism measures, security, jus- tice, etc.). Concerning environmental impact assessment, the Committee considers that it is not essential to place any greater emphasis on cost-benefit analyses than on other qualitative findings. In addition, it welcomed the specific account that the Commission has taken of impacts on SMEs and SMIs. Finally, according to the Committee, it is extremely important to con- sult stakeholders and their representative Euro- pean organisations, in particular, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee.

European Economic and Social Commit- tee own-initiative opinion \u2014 \u2018Beyond GDP \u2014 measurements for sustainable development\u2019. Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 22 October. The Committee con- siders that GDP is an important indicator of eco- nomic growth, but as an instrument for guiding policy it is inadequate to meet the challenges of the 21st century. According to it, what is needed above all is an instrument that will show how far Europe still is from achieving a sustainable and socially inclusive economy. Since two different issues are concerned \u2014 sustainability and wel- fare \u2014 two indicators are actually needed. There is an indicator for measuring sustainability and sustainability trends: namely the ecological foot- print which despite its shortcomings is the best available overall indicator on sustainable envi- ronmental development. The challenge is to develop an indicator for social development that can measure the various dimensions of quality of life in a way that provides a realistic picture. According to the Committee, a practicable and scientifically reliable quality-of-life indicator must be founded on the six following matters: \u00a1 physical integrity and health; \u00a1 material wealth; \u00a1 access to public services; \u00a1 social participation and incomer integration; \u00a1 leisure time; \u00a1 quality of the environment.

Since mid-2006, the Hungarian authorities have made significant efforts to correct the country\u2019s accu- mulated external and internal imbalances. Despite the tangible results achieved over the last two years, including the significant reduction in the general government deficit and the gradual decrease in the current account deficit, the Hun- garian financial markets came under severe stress as of early October 2008. The authorities rapidly announced a comprehensive policy package designed to restore investor confidence and alle- viate the stress experienced in financial markets. However, as a rapid deterioration in the capital and financial accounts induced by financial mar- kets turbulences could be expected in 2008 and especially 2009, the country will need substan- tial financial support in this period, possibly in the order of EUR 20 billion until the end of 2009. Thus, medium-term financial assistance for Hungary under the balance of payments facility for Member States appears to be appropriate under the current circumstances. The EU finan- cial assistance is provided in support of the strong commitment by the Hungarian authorities to implement a comprehensive economic policy programme, designed to restore investor confi- dence and alleviate the stress experienced in recent weeks in Hungarian financial markets. This programme will be included in the conver- gence programme update. The EU assistance would also help ensure full consistency of cur- rent policies supported by the whole financing package with EU policy recommendations. Eco- nomic policy conditionality would include reform of fiscal governance and support the increased ambition in terms of deficit reduction ensuring that the planned correction of the excessive deficit (by 2009 at the latest) is respected. It would also ",

EU 10-2008 include structural reform measures supported in the context of the Lisbon strategy, such as the reinforcement of incentives to work with a view to raising employment rates and contributing to the long-term sustainability of public finances. Against this background, following the consulta- tion of the Economic and Financial Committee, the Commission is recommending to the Council the granting of the mutual assistance foreseen by Article 119 of the EC Treaty. The Commission is furthermore proposing that, after adopting this decision, the Council adopt a decision providing under the EU facility for Member States, as gov- erned by Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002, a medium-term financial assistance to Hungary of up to EUR 6.5 billion, to underpin the sus- tainability of its balance of payments. This sup- port would be provided in conjunction with an IMF arrangement. It would be disbursed in up to five instalments and be linked to economic pol- icy conditions. The proposed decision would expire two years after entry into force. COM(2008) 716 1.7.4. Proposal for a Council regulation amend- ing Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assis- tance for Member States\u2019 balances of payments. Regulation to be amended: Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 establishing a single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States\u2019 balances of payments: OJ L 53, 23.2.2002; Bull. 1/2-2002, point 1.3.24 Adopted by the Commission on 30 October. Coun- cil regulation (EC) No 332/2002 established a facility providing medium-term financial assis- tance for Member States\u2019 balances of payments. This facility implements the mechanism foreseen by Article 119 of the EC Treaty, whereby the Community can grant a mutual assistance to a Member State \u2018in difficulties or when seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments either as a result of an overall dise- quilibrium in its balance of payments or as a result of the type of currency at its disposal\u2019, provided this Member State does not belong to the euro area. This regulation lowered the threshold exist- ing in the former regulation from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion. This decision was consis- tent with the significant reduction in the poten- tial number of recipients, with only three Mem- ber States outside the euro area at that time. Nevertheless, the evolution of the international financial context leads to the conclusion today that it may not be sufficient, should several Member States need a significant Community medium- term financial support. It is therefore proposed to raise the ceiling of the amount of loans to be granted to Member States under this facility to EUR 25 billion, with a view to increasing the capacity of the EU significantly to answer the potential needs of Member States outside the euro area. It is also proposed to establish a specific pro- cedure for revising the ceiling when there is an urgent need to take such a decision.

Taking account of the current extraordinary stress in global financial markets and the potential impact of the economic situation, the Council agreed on the need to continue pursuing a coordinated response at the European level, within the scope of Member States\u2019 respective responsibilities, to adjust their response to their individual situation, coupled with Member States\u2019 flexibility. In addi- tion, according to the Council, it is necessary to continue implementing sound structural reforms at the national level in order to strengthen resilience to future crises. In this context, the Council recalled the urgency to enhance banks\u2019 practices for the evaluation of exposures and urged supervisors and accounting standards- setters to ensure that the financial reporting frame- work functions properly, with clear guidelines on valuation that can be applied consistently across institutions. It stressed the need to continue to ",

References: Council conclusions on EU arrangements for financial stability: Bull. 10-2007, point 1.10.4 Council conclusions on financial stability and financial supervision: point 1.7.5 of this Bulletin Adopted by the Council on 7 October. The Coun- cil noticed that, to a large extent, Member States are facing common shocks. Therefore, the eco- nomic situation calls for a coordinated response at the EU level, based on a common understand- ing of the problems at hand and taking into account common features and national specifici- ties. The Council proposed a strategy for EU Member States which could be built on the fol- lowing elements: \u00a1 at the macroeconomic and structural level, ensure domestic policies are in place to support growth in a sustainable manner: European macro- economic policies need to respond in an appropri- ate and consistent way to the shocks stemming from the global economy. These shocks are to a large extent faced by all Member States, even though the precise effect on the economies may differ across economies and across groups. The Council considers that, at the current juncture, designing policies which help curb inflation, thereby protecting the purchasing power of people, fostering sustainable growth and helping restore an environment supportive to monetary policy is key; \u00a1 restore confidence on financial markets and avoid excessive tightening of credit toward SMEs in the EU: the financial turmoil is a core compo- nent of the current global economic slowdown. In the short term, the key response remains restoring confidence in the financial system through full implementation of the October 2007 roadmap. In this respect, according to the Coun- cil, financial institutions are continuously mak- ing efforts to improve disclosure of their expo- sure to risks. Nevertheless, those efforts still need to be properly assessed by banking supervisors within the Committee of European Banking Supervisors; \u00a1 on the external front, contribute to a more favourable environment: in response to the cur- rent global crisis in the financial sector, Europe should continue to act proactively in international fora, notably at the Financial Stability Forum and the IMF. The Council also agreed to increase the political impetus to the economic and financial dimension of the Union\u2019s relations with its part- ners, notably on the occasion of bilateral summits. 1.7.7. European Economic and Social Commit- tee opinion on \u2018Ethical and social dimension of European financial institutions\u2019. Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 23 October. The Committee con- sidered that the grave financial crisis and the wel- come defeat of \u2018casino capitalism\u2019 could provide an opportunity to adopt more appropriate meas- ures for safeguarding the financial system in the future while simultaneously relaunching the economy. It specified that a broad-based effort was required, commensurate with the danger that the virus detected in the financial sector might spread to the real economy as a whole. The Com- mittee noticed investment in infrastructure, in \u2018green investment\u2019 such as energy efficiency, renewable resources, and innovation and research could help bolster demand. It emphasised that a specific organisation shown to have given up, at least in part, on a structural and permanent basis, the principle of maximising profit in order to pro- mote initiatives of an ethical or social nature should be entitled to come under tax and regula- tory rules that are different from the general ones, except in the case of prudential rules, at least in part. Finally, the Committee observed that by ensuring Member States do not adopt measures that would distort competition, the Commission can help protect diversity in the supply of finan- cial, banking and insurance services.

Reference: Council conclusions on a coordinated EU response to the economic slowdown: point 1.7.6 of this Bulletin Adopted by the Commission on 29 October. According to the Commission, the unprecedented crisis in international financial markets has cre- ated major challenges for the EU. Coordinated action at EU level by all 27 Member States has been effective in stabilising Europe\u2019s banking system. However, the Commission recalled that the financial crisis is not yet over and is already feeding into a serious downturn, affecting the wider economy. Europe\u2019s strength lies in its sol- idarity and its ability to act together. All Member States will be affected, albeit in different ways and to different degrees and acting jointly means a more effective and credible response. Thus, according to the Commission, the EU should build on this success and decide to tackle the next stages of the crisis in a united, coordinated man- ner, turning these challenges into opportunities and adding selected short-term measures to the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs. This com- munication sets out an overall EU recovery action plan/framework based on three points: \u00a1 a new financial market architecture at EU level; \u00a1 dealing with the impact on the real economy; \u00a1 a global response to the financial crisis. On 26 November, the Commission will propose a more detailed EU recovery framework, under the umbrella of the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, bringing together a series of targeted short-term initiatives designed to help counter adverse effects on the wider economy and adapt- ing the medium and long-term measures of the Lisbon strategy to take account of the crisis.

The Commission has made enhancing reconciliation between professional, family and private life one of the six priority areas of action in its roadmap for equality between women and men for 2006\u201310 and measures in this area are closely linked to the related priority of achieving equal economic inde- pendence for women and men. This communica- tion reviews the current situation and sets out the steps being taken to develop the current European legislative framework.Available statistics show that there is still an important gender gap in participa- tion in the labour market and in particular that the participation of women decreases dramatically after they give birth. There is also evidence that Member States with effective reconciliation policies not only have higher fertility rates but also a higher female labour force participation rate.

The purpose of the report is to take stock of the implementation of the objectives adopted by the Barcelona European Council in March 2002 con- cerning pre-school childcare facilities and iden- tify the obstacles and challenges to the develop- ment of such facilities. The first part of the report reiterates the importance of childcare facilities in supporting employment and growth, gender equal- ity and social inclusion. It emphasises the various commitments at European level (roadmap for equality between women and men, European pact for gender equality), the cofinancing possibilities offered by the Structural Funds, and the role of the European social partners. The report then looks at the situation on the basis of new har- monised statistics. It is apparent that in all Mem- ber States the Barcelona objectives are still far from being achieved, especially in respect of the youngest (under-3) age group. In conclusion, the Commission reiterated its commitment to supporting the achievement of the Barcelona objectives and the development of affordable, accessible and quality childcare services. It announced its intention to pursue the achievement of these objectives, follow policies to balance working and family life and promote the exchange of best practices and research in this area. Finally, the Commission reaffirmed the fundamental role played by Member States, local authorities and social partners in consolidating the availability of care facilities for young children, in particular by making full use of the possibilities offered by the Structural Funds. The report is completed by a sta- tistical and technical annex in the form of a sep- arate Commission working document. COM(2008) 638 1.9.4.

Parliament welcomed the approach taken by the Commission and also called for a renewed fight against undeclared work and the under- ground economy, which damage the economy, leave workers unprotected, are detrimental to consumers, reduce tax revenue and lead to unfair competition between undertakings. It expressed deep concern over the extent of undeclared work, which accounts for as much as 20% or more of GDP in some Member States. Parliament called on Member States to consider improving incen- tives for regular work, which may include increasing the tax-free income band and, for ",
        "Employment and social policy 30 Bull. EU 10-2008 employers, reducing the non-wage costs associ- ated with legal employment. It considers that action to combat undeclared work requires a comprehensive approach which covers matters relating to monitoring and control, the economic and institutional framework and sectoral and ter- ritorial development, and involves concerted action at several levels and the participation of all stakeholders (public authorities, social partners, undertakings and workers). It called on the Com- mission to frame policies to provide for both gen- eral measures and sectoral measures to prevent undeclared work, doing so with the full involve- ment of the social partners and with special ref- erence to the most affected sectors, such as the hotel and catering industry, farming, domestic services and the construction industry. Parliament drew the attention of the Commission and the Member States to the specific situation of the domestic care sector, where there is a significant concentration of women who are third-country nationals and, in many cases, not legally resident in the Union. 1.9.5.

The Committee strongly supported the Commission\u2019s view that \u2018worker mobility is a key instrument for an efficient functioning single mar- ket and is essential for allowing more people to find better employment, a key objective of the Lisbon strategy\u2019. It underlined that \u2018mobility\u2019 in this context must be understood and promoted both in terms of geographical mobility (both within and between EU Member States) as well as economic and social mobility and mobility between jobs. The Committee supported remov- ing legal and administrative barriers and promot- ing the cross-border recognition of qualifications and also supported the setting up of a one-stop mobility information portal based on the EURES job vacancy system. It acknowledged the need to ensure policy support for the objective of job mobility from authorities at all levels: local, regional, national and European. 1.9.6.

Parliament emphasised that freedom to provide services is one of the cornerstones of the Euro- pean project but considers this should be balanced against the fundamental rights and the social objectives set out in the Treaties on the one hand, and on the other, against the right of the public and social partners to ensure non-discrimination, equal treatment, and the improvement of living and working conditions. It is of the opinion that any EU citizen should have the right to work any- where in the EU and thus should have a right to equal treatment; Parliament therefore regrets that this right is not applied uniformly across the EU. Parliament emphasised that freedom to provide services does not contradict and is not superior to the fundamental right of social partners to pro- mote social dialogue and to take industrial action, in particular since this is a constitutional right in several Member States. It questioned the intro- duction of a proportionality principle for actions against undertakings which, by relying on the right of establishment or the right to provide ser- vices across borders, deliberately undercut terms and conditions of employment.

The Council recalled that the actions designed to meet these objectives include, in particular, meet- ings and events, information, promotional and educational campaigns and surveys and studies. Actions on a Community scale may be subsidised up to 80%, while actions at local, regional or national level may be co-financed from the gen- eral budget of the EU up to a maximum of 50% of the total eligible costs. The future decision will provide for a financial framework in the Com- munity budget of EUR 17 000 000 for the con- sidered actions. Signed by the European Parliament and the Council on 22 October.

Com- bating social exclusion and poverty is among the priorities of the EU, whose action in this area is based on Article 137 of the EC Treaty. The Com- mission underlined that the active inclusion of people excluded from the workplace requires the creation of an integrated global strategy combining adequate resources, favourable workplace condi- tions and high-quality services. According to the Commission, the concept of active inclusion pre- sented in this communication fits in perfectly with the Lisbon strategy and the integrated approach that the Commission advocated for the renewed social agenda based on three principles: opportu- nities, access and solidarity. It also complements the Commission work to promote flexicurity and to respond to demographic developments and to the challenges of globalisation by easing transitions for all and mobilising the forces of production.

        "Employment and social policy Bull. EU 10-2008 33 approach to active social inclusion. It considers that the overarching aim of active social inclu- sion policies must be to implement fundamental rights in order to enable people to live with dig- nity and participate in society and the labour mar- ket. Parliament considers that active social inclu- sion policies must make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty and social exclusion, both for those in employment (the \u2018working poor\u2019) and for those not in paid employment. It agreed with the Commission that a more holistic approach to active social inclusion should be based on the fol- lowing common principles: \u00a1 income support sufficient to prevent social exclusion; \u00a1 a link to inclusive labour markets; \u00a1 a link to better access to quality services; \u00a1 gender mainstreaming, anti-discrimination and active participation. Parliament called on the Commission to consider child poverty and social exclusion in a broader context of EU policymaking, including issues such as: immigration, disability, discrimination, protection of children from all forms of mal- treatment and abuse, child and adult carers, equal- ity between men and women, family support, active social inclusion, early-years care and edu- cation, life-long learning and the reconciliation of working life, non-working life and family life. 1.9.12. European Economic and Social Commit- tee exploratory opinion on how social experi- mentation can be used in Europe to develop pub- lic active inclusion policies. Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 22 October. The Committee is con- vinced of the potentially fundamental usefulness of innovative experimentation as a national and transnational policymaking tool in the EU. It rec- ommends that consideration be given to an approach or concept that is more integrated into the various and numerous European programmes so as to promote more innovative social experi- mentation in the field of cohesion and social inclusion. The Committee considers that while the social experimentation projects to combat exclusion are primarily the preserve of local and national players, the EU institutions, and in par- ticular the Commission, can step up their action and exert a crucial leverage effect. According to it, the time is ripe for such measures. The Com- mittee suggested that active measures be taken to ensure that plans for national programmes and joint reports include information on developments in innovative social experimentation projects.

The aim of this proposal is to improve the protection offered to pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. In particular, the proposal extends the minimum length of maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks. This is to help the worker recover from the immediate effects of giving birth, while also mak- ing it easier for her to return to the labour market at the end of her maternity leave. The proposal also improves the employment rights of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. It will contribute to better reconciliation of professional, private and family life. The proposal is a priority initiative in the Commission\u2019s work programme for 2008. COM(2008) 637 1.9.17.

This proposal aims at changing the Community legal framework concerning the application of the prin- ciple of equal treatment between women and men for self-employed workers and their spouses. It will repeal Directive 86/613/EEC and will be applicable as regards those aspects not covered by Directives 2006/54/EC, 2004/113/EC and 79/7/EEC, in order to implement more effectively the principle of equal treatment between women and men engaged in an activity in a self- employed capacity, or contributing to the pursuit of such an activity. The main objectives of the proposal are to improve gender equality for self- employed workers and assisting spouses and con- sequently to increase the number of women in self-employment activities and give assisting spouses social security protection. To this end, the proposal envisages that self-employed workers and assisting spouses benefit from maternity leave of an equal duration as that of a salaried worker. COM(2008) 635 ",

        "The internal market 38 Bull. EU 10-2008 Adopted by the Commission on 9 October. The proposal provides for a modern and coherent legal framework for issuing electronic money, with the aim of promoting the emergence of a true single market for electronic money services in the EU. The main innovations proposed are as follows: \u00a1 a technologically neutral and simpler defini- tion of \u2018electronic money\u2019, covering all situations where the payment service provider (an e-money institution or a credit institution) issues a prepaid stored value in exchange of funds. Electronic money is therefore defined as monetary value stored electronically on receipt of funds and which is used for making payment transactions. This definition covers e-money held on payment devices in the holder\u2019s possession (pre-paid cards or electronic purse) or stored remotely at a server (network or software money); \u00a1 a new prudential regime, ensuring greater consistency between prudential requirements of electronic money institutions and payment insti- tutions under the payment services directive 2007/ 64/EC. The new prudential requirements include an initial capital of EUR 125 000 enabling mar- ket entrance for smaller players and a new for- mula to determine ongoing capital; \u00a1 a clarification of the application of redemp- tion requirements, with special reference to their application to mobile telecommunications. Con- sumers would have the right to claim back their electronic money at any moment, under condi- tions laid down by the new rules. COM(2008) 627 1.11.5.

The purpose of the directive on deposit-guarantee schemes is to protect a portion of depositors\u2019 sav- ings and to ensure confidence in the banking sec- tor, in order to avoid bank runs leading to severe economic consequences. According to the Com- mission, it has remained unchanged since 1994 but is now being updated in order to respond to the ongoing financial crisis. The main changes proposed are as follows: \u00a1 level of coverage for deposits: Member States are required to increase the coverage level to at least EUR 50 000 and within a further year to at least EUR 100 000. The current deposit- guarantee schemes directive covers savings up to at least EUR 20 000. According to esti- mates, about 65% of eligible deposits are cov- ered under the current regime.

European Economic and Social Commit- tee opinion on the Commission communication \u2014 \u2018Removing obstacles to cross-border invest- ments by venture capital funds\u2019.

The Committee sup- ported the 2006 Commission communication bringing together two important strands of the Lisbon programme: the focus on the formation and growth of innovative small companies; and the integration of EU capital markets as a means of financing employment and productivity growth. The Committee recommended that Mem- ber States use the taxation system to create incen- tives for private individuals to invest in small companies. It specified that this will encourage the development of stock markets in which small company shares can be traded. The Committee was insistent that the removal of obstacles to cross-border activities of venture capital should not facilitate other private equity activities such as leveraged buy-outs (LBO) without proper safe- guards. Finally it asked the Commission, in the context of this venture capital initiative, to ensure that social dialogue continues to prevail and that the directive on information and consultation of workers applies in those cases.

EU 10-2008 References: Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border pay- ments in euro: OJ L 344, 28.12.2001; Bull. 12- 2001, point 1.3.48 Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parlia- ment and of the Council on payment services in the internal market: OJ L 319, 5.12.2007; Bull. 11- 2007, point 1.10.7 Adopted by the Commission on 13 October. In view of completing the single payment space, this proposal extends the principle of equality of charges to direct debit payments, which will become available on a cross-border basis as of November 2009. As is already the case with credit transfers, ATM cash withdrawals and card payments, the cost of a cross-border direct debit in euro will become the same as the cost of a national direct debit. The proposal also provides for the setting-up of out-of-court redress bodies responsible for solving disputes related to cross- border payments, thereby enhancing the protec- tion of consumer rights in this field. Furthermore, the proposal aims at phasing out certain statisti- cal reporting obligations relating to balance of payments, thus alleviating administrative and financial burdens and facilitating the implemen- tation of the SEPA.

The Coun- cil approved Eurofisc\u2019s guidelines. These spec- ify that: \u00a1 Eurofisc would be a decentralised network for the exchange of information on VAT fraud between Member States, with each of its tasks being coordinated; \u00a1 it would observe four general principles: the freedom for each Member State to participate in any of the network\u2019s tasks; active participation in the exchange of information; confidentiality of the information exchanged; no additional burden on operators; \u00a1 it would not have legal personality. Its func- tioning would be organised by agreement of the participating Member States, with the support of the Commission. Its tasks would be carried out by liaison officials who are experts in tax fraud. Their work would be led by coordinators who they would designate amongst themselves. Eurofisc\u2019s activity would be regularly evaluated by Member States; \u00a1 Eurofisc tasks would be initially to provide a multilateral early warning mechanism for com- bating VAT fraud, and to coordinate the exchange of information and the work of participating Member States in acting on warnings received. Furthermore, the Council noted the Commis- sion\u2019s intention to present a proposal in Novem- ber 2008 on the recasting of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and invited the Commission to include in that proposal provisions to allow Eurofisc to be established in the near future in accordance with those guidelines, while respect- ing the instruments of administrative cooperation mentioned in the regulation. 1.11.11.

The Coun- cil noted that pay determination is the company\u2019s shareholders\u2019 and social partners\u2019 responsibility in a market-led environment. However, it speci- fied that national authorities have a role to play in helping to define an appropriate regulatory framework and in encouraging good practices and voluntary self regulation, for example through principles of good governance, transparency and disclosure rules, and control rights by sharehold- ers. The Council highlighted that: \u00a1 the governance framework should be con- ducive to an effective control by share holders ",

Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the final evaluation of the Fiscalis programme 2003\u201307 in accordance with Article 15 of Decision 2235/ 2002/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 3 December 2002 adopting a Com- munity programme to improve the operation of taxation systems in the internal market (Fiscalis programme 2003\u201307). Reference: Decision No 2235/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council: OJ L 341, 17.12.2002; Bull. 12-2002, point 1.3.45 Adopted by the Commission on 9 October. This final evaluation covers the entire period 2003\u201307. It concludes that the programme succeeded in improving the operation of taxation systems in the internal market by increasing cooperation between participating countries, their administra- tions and tax officials. In the area of indirect tax- ation, particularly value added tax and excise duties, the programme\u2019s objectives were: to enable officials to achieve a high common stan- dard of understanding of Community law and of its implementation in Member States; to secure efficient, effective and extensive cooperation among Member States; to improve administrative procedures. In the area of direct taxation, Fiscalis was intended to support information exchange in the field of mutual assistance and to raise aware- ness of the applicable Community law. For taxes on insurance premiums the goals of improving cooperation between Member States and of ensuring better application of the existing rules remain valid. Finally, the programme contributed to satisfying the special needs of candidate coun- tries so that they could take the necessary meas- ures for accession in the field of tax legislation and administrative capacity.

The Committee regret- ted that the initiatives taken to date to prevent and combat fraud and the counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment were not sufficient to halt the spread of this phenomenon. It called upon the Commission to simplify the exchange of data within the EU on both fraudsters and those deemed at risk by enhancing the channels of cooperation between the relevant national author- ities. Moreover, the Committee specified that an absence of uniformity in legislation regarding powers of inquiry of the various national admin- istrations constitutes another obstacle to an effec- tive fight against fraud. Lastly, it noticed that an effective harmonising of national legislation appears as the best way to effectively curb against fraud in this sector, which constitutes a typically transnational form of crime.

The Committee supported the proposal. However, it recalled that a dual proce- dure (as regards the date of entry into force depending on Member States) would be confus- ing and expensive both for the authorities and for traders. The Committee stated that an intermedi- ate solution, whilst not very satisfactory and likely to delay the excise movement control system (ECMS) in Europe indefinitely, might consist in using EMCS only for internal transactions within those Member States able to adopt the electronic procedure. Finally, the Committee proposed that a clause be inserted into the new directive speci- fying the quantitative and value limits up to which purchases made by a citizen in another Member State are considered to have been made by that person as a \u2018private individual\u2019. 1.11.16.

Parliament noted that the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation (IASCF) pro- poses to establish a monitoring group. It speci- fied that it should be entitled to recommend candidates as trustees and should be responsible for approving the selection of trustees after an agreed nomination process. Parliament believes that the monitoring group should reflect the bal- ance of the world\u2019s most significant currency areas, cultural diversity, and the interests of both developed and emerging economies and of inter- national institutions which have accountability requirements before public authorities. It also considers that the monitoring group should play an active role in promoting the transparency of financial reporting and the development and effective functioning of capital markets, as well as avoiding pro-cyclicality and ensuring financial market stability and preventing systemic risk. Finally, Parliament stressed that the members of the monitoring group have sufficient competence to ensure that they can be held politically accountable. Industrial and intellectual property 1.11.18.

According to the Commission, sustainable growth and job creation in the EU increasingly depends on excellence and innovation as the main drivers of European competitiveness. Recognis- ing this fact, in 2006 the EU adopted a broad- based innovation strategy which identified strengthening clusters in Europe as one of the nine strategic priorities for successfully promot- ing innovation. A cluster can be broadly defined as a group of firms, related economic actors and institutions that are located near each other and have reached a sufficient scale to develop spe- cialised expertise, services, resources, suppliers and skills. Cluster policies are designed and implemented at local, regional and national level, depending on their scope and ambition. The Commission considers that it is the role of the Community to facilitate and add to such efforts, notably by: improving the framework conditions; promoting research and education excellence and entrepreneurship; fostering better linkages between industry (especially SMEs) and research; encouraging mutual policy learning and cluster cooperation across the EU. In this respect, it considers that the further completion of the inter- nal market and the development of a competitive European research area are crucial. This commu- nication outlines a policy framework for better complementarities and synergies between the dif- ferent policy levels with a view to supporting the development of more world-class clusters in the EU. In particular, the Commission wanted to: establish within 2008 the high-level European Cluster Policy Group; continue to facilitate the policy dialogue between public authorities as it is currently taking place within the European Cluster Alliance; better coordinate and streamline existing Community instruments (developed under the new cohesion policy, the seventh frame- work programme for research and development (FP7) and the competitiveness and innovation programme (CIP)).

The Committee welcomed the Com- mission communication on pre-commercial pro- curement as a satisfactory first introduction to the basic concept and the way in which it can be organised, although there are certain oversights with regard to the actual implementation of the procedure proposed. It believes that designing and drawing up very technical versions of public tenders to promote innovation calls for particular knowledge and skills which local and regional authorities do not generally have. The Committee noted that even if pre-commercial procurement of R & D services ultimately proves successful, it will still be difficult to mobilise and activate citizens politically at local and regional level. It thinks that the Commission should provide a clear and detailed guide, as well as training opportunities, to contracting local and regional authorities on how to use pre-commercial pro- curement of R & D services so that European law is not infringed. The Committee urged the Com- mission to demonstrate that pre-commercial pro- curement can be useful for the regional authority managing the tender procedure, even where can- didates are not based in the region. 1.13.4.

The Committee fully endorsed the Commission\u2019s objective to promote incentives for innovation in public procurement across Europe. It agreed with the Commission that fostering opportunities for innovation and applied technology in public procurement will bear fruit for Europe in two ways. Firstly by enhancing the quality of public services and value for money, thereby benefiting tax payers; sec- ondly by opening up new opportunities for inno- vation for business, thus contributing to Europe\u2019s overall innovation performance and competi- tiveness. The Committee emphasised that, what- ever the potential benefits of new or different approaches in public procurement, the correct transposition and implementation of the 2004 directives remains a priority. It recommended caution regarding the involvement of the major- ity of public authorities in innovative processes or as early adopters. New approach, standardisation 1.13.5.

The eco-design directive (2005/32/EC) established a framework for the setting of eco-design require- ments for energy-using products. The framework directive lays down conditions and criteria for introducing implementing measures for particular products, provided they impact significantly on the environment and have high volumes of sales and trade on the internal market plus a clear potential for improvement without entailing excessive costs. Article 16(1) of the eco-design directive specifies that the Commission shall pub- lish an indicative working plan listing the energy- using product groups which will be considered priorities for the adoption of implementing meas- ures for 2009\u201311. Implementing measures may be proposed after favourable preparatory studies and impact assessments and on the condition that no valid self-regulatory measures are in place. The working plan builds on the environmental priorities and the work done since mid-2005 for the transitional priority product groups listed in Article 16(2) of the directive. Indicative list of product groups covered by this working plan are: \u00a1 air-conditioning and ventilation systems; \u00a1 electric and fossil-fuelled heating equipment; \u00a1 food-preparing equipment; \u00a1 industrial and laboratory furnaces and ovens; \u00a1 machine tools; \u00a1 network, data processing and data storing equipment; \u00a1 refrigerating and freezing equipment; \u00a1 sound and imaging equipment; \u00a1 transformers; \u00a1 water-using equipment.

Parliament noted the progress achieved by the Commission towards the elimination of rec- onciliation requirements for EU issuers in third countries. It acknowledged that steps have been taken towards the recognition of US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. Parliament took the view that third-country GAAP should be considered equivalent to IFRS as adopted pursuant to Regu- lation (EC) No 1606/2002. It believes that bring- ing about the convergence of accounting stan- dards is an important task, but underlines that the ultimate goal must be for each jurisdiction to adopt IFRS whilst respecting its own democratic and legal framework.

Commission communication: OJ C 4, 9.1.2008; COM(2007) 592; Bull. 10-2007, point 1.12.4 Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 22 October. The Committee con- siders that students need to be encouraged to recognise that starting their own business is a nor- mal employment option. According to it, the Commission along with national governments should cooperate to develop and implement a European-wide, robust system to protect intellec- tual property, inventions and innovations. The Committee encouraged national and regional governments to be more involved with the SME processes and procedures as detailed in the mid- term review. It considers that special procedures should be implemented concerning access to EU grants and project funding for micro and SMEs and that transmission of enterprises from one generation to another needs to be recognised and addressed.

The Committee envisages a common European security framework and not the keeping in place of intra-Community barri- ers with all its damageable consequences. It strongly believes that the principles proposed by the Commission to simplify the transfer of defence-related products within the Community through common licensing tools and to ensure mutual confidence between Member States regarding the effectiveness of their export con- trol, will bring significant benefits and a major simplification to this complex sector. The Com- mittee stressed that the proposed directive will retain the company\u2019s responsibility to respect possible export limitations issued in a transfer licence. 1.13.10.

Food industry 1.13.15. Own-initiative opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the restruc- turing and evolution of the household appliance industry (white goods in Europe) and its impact on employment, climate change and consumers. Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 22 October. The Committee believes that the strength of the European house- hold appliances industry lies in its ability to make high-quality and sustainable products. It firmly believes that EU legislation could have a direct influence on the competitiveness of the sector. The Committee considers that market surveil- lance is of paramount importance so as to safe- guard the European industry, the workers in this industry, consumer interest and the environment and that it should be implemented through the use of the following measures: \u00a1 devolving of more resources by Member States and the EU for a stricter verification of product compliance with European single market standards and legislation; \u00a1 eradicating unfair competition and dump- ing. Anti-dumping measures should be carefully studied so as not to be counter-productive to the European industry encouraging the reloca- tion of the industry outside Europe or the increase of imports; they should be raised not only on the whole appliance but also on the components; \u00a1 revising the labelling system so as to reflect the advances in the innovation of the technology without giving false perceptions of value changes; \u00a1 tighter control so as to reduce the counter- feiting and pass off, slavish/copies phenomena; \u00a1 controls that labels, particularly those on imported goods, are truly what they claim to be and not misleading.

The Committee is conscious of the difficulty of achieving a consensual definition of the terms \u2018illegal content\u2019 and \u2018harmful content\u2019, which are judged differently in different countries and cul- tures. It recommended, however, that at least an outline consensus on illegal content be reached by comparing criminal law norms and seeing what they have in common. The Committee also wel- comed the fact that the new programme facilitates collaboration and the pooling of experience and best practices at all levels regarding child safety on the Internet and thus enhances European added value. Nevertheless, it is disappointed that activi- ties aimed at increasing the awareness of the pub- lic, in particular children, parents, carers and edu- cators, about opportunities and risks related to the use of online technologies and means of staying safe online, do not explicitly include local and regional authorities, which are closest to the tar- get groups and have the greatest potential for communicating important information and imple- menting concrete programmes and projects. Endorsed by the European Parliament (first read- ing) on 22 October, subject to certain amend- ments concerning in particular: \u00a1 a quality label for service providers, so that users can easily check whether or not a given provider subscribes to a code of conduct; \u00a1 filters by end-users which would prevent the passing of information through online technolo- gies from undermining children\u2019s physical, men- tal or moral integrity; \u00a1 the support and promotion of measures to encourage positive content for children; \u00a1 some tools developed in cooperation with the Internet industry that enable law enforcement agencies to track down criminals on the web.

Concerning media literacy, the Com- mittee endorsed the goals and priorities set by the Commission in its communication and noted in particular that media literacy involves: \u00a1 awareness-raising at European, national, regional and local level; \u00a1 supporting active and creative use of media by citizens, especially by younger people in their dual roles as consumers and producers of creative content and developing and maintaining media literacy among older people and people of work- ing age; \u00a1 supporting a critical approach towards all media on the part of the general public; \u00a1 promoting plurality in the media; \u00a1 contributing to the debate about commercial advertising and issues of respect for and protec- tion of private life; \u00a1 promoting active involvement of citizens; \u00a1 promoting social inclusion; \u00a1 ensuring equal access to new media and technologies. Concerning online creative content in the single market, the Committee supports the two key ini- tiatives announced by the Commission in its communication: \u00a1 the proposal for a recommendation of the Parliament and the Council on creative content online; \u00a1 the creation of a stakeholders\u2019 discussion and cooperation platform, the \u2018content online platform\u2019, in order to develop dialogue on addressing the issue. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that the Commission has not taken into account the cul- tural and social implications of the emerging cre- ative online content sector and has not proposed measures that are essential to promote cultural diversity and ensure universal access to the bene- fits of ICTs. Likewise, the Committee believes that policies relating to new services and new digital media, as well as creative content, must not be framed on the basis of economic criteria alone, but must take cultural and social factors into account.

The EU harbours a rich territorial diversity, which characterises Europe\u2019s economic and social iden- tity. The concept of territorial cohesion, which has been discussed at EU level since the begin- ning of the 1990s, calls for a debate on how this diversity can be turned into an asset that con- tributes to sustainable development across the EU as a whole taking into account the challenges that Europe\u2019s territories will face over the next decades. A shared understanding of these issues could assist in improving the governance of cohe- sion policy, making it more flexible, more capa- ble of adapting to the most appropriate territorial scale, more responsive to local preferences and needs as well as better coordinated with other policies at all levels in conformity with the prin- ciple of subsidiarity. Following the conclusions of the informal meeting of the EU ministers responsible for spatial planning and regional development in Leipzig on 24 and 25 May 2007, inviting the Commission to prepare a report on territorial cohesion by 2008, this Green Paper intends to launch a public debate on territorial cohesion and its implications for policy design.

Parliament proposed, for reasons of sim- plification and effectiveness, that a study be car- ried out into the feasibility of merging the various Community funds, in particular the ERDF, the ESF, the Cohesion Fund, and the EAFRD, under the future cohesion policy for the period after 2013. Parliament also called on national, regional and local authorities to intensify their use of the integrated approach already during the current programming period. Furthermore, it noted that transparent and clear procedures are factors of good governance. Therefore, it called on the Commission and Member States, working together with regional and local authorities, to examine without delay how to simplify and ratio- nalise procedures for implementing cohesion pol- icy. Parliament also urged Member States to ensure closer cooperation between public and pri- vate sectors through the establishment of pub- lic\u2013private partnerships to implement structural funding, given that the potential benefits deriv- ing from that kind of partnership are still largely underexploited. Finally, Parliament took the view that successful multi-level governance needs to be based on a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach. In this con- text, it called upon local and regional authorities to investigate means to intensify their coopera- tion and contact with national governments as well as with the Commission. 1.16.3.

The report describes the implementation of pro- grammes co-financed by the Structural Funds in 2007, in particular: \u00a1 budget implementation broken down by Fund (ERDF, ESF, EAGGF, FIFG); \u00a1 programme implementation broken down by Objective (Objective 1, Objective 2, Objective 3, Fisheries outside Objective 1, Community initia- tives, Innovative actions); \u00a1 consistency with other Community policies (competition, internal market, environment, trans- port and gender equality); \u00a1 coordination with other financial instruments, in particular with the Cohesion Fund, European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund; \u00a1 evaluation activities; \u00a1 controls; \u00a1 activities of the Committees assisting the Com- mission in implementation of the Structural Funds. COM(2008) 659 Other regional operations 1.16.5. Committee of the Regions outlook opin- ion on partnership with respect to governance and project planning in the field of regional policy. Reference: Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/ 2006 laying down general provisions on the Euro- pean Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund: OJ L 210, 31.7.2006; Bull. 7/8-2006, point 1.15.6 Adopted by the Committee of the Regions on 9 Oc- tober. The Committee wholly supports the initia- tive to examine partnership with respect to gover- nance at national, regional and local level and project planning in the field of regional policy, in the preparation and implementation of programme and planning documents for territorial development. It further supports a comprehensive approach to structural policy governance within the EU\u2019s mul- tilevel system. The Committee regarded the moves to strengthen partnership with a view to developing a more sustainable policy for closer and stronger vertical and horizontal integration of governance and partnership at national, regional and local level as a success. In the context of preparing the new cohesion policy, it considers that it will be of cru- cial importance to ensure that local and regional authorities, above all, but also economic and social partners and civil society have an input at the ear- liest possible stages in formulating national posi- tions and priorities and in preparing documents and that their views be given appropriate weight. The Committee is convinced that it should be given a greater role in the preparation, implementation and monitoring of EU policies, through the active involvement of Committee members in their capac- ity as representatives of the interests of local and regional authorities in local and regional-level dia- logue with public and civil society organisations.

In an increasingly globalised world, the Commit- tee expressed the view that European agriculture cannot do without a powerful European common policy with market regulation mechanisms which, on the one hand, focus on strategic objectives and consumer demand, and which, on the other hand, offer possibilities for regional opportunities and involvement especially on the new challenges, which are economically, socially and environ- mentally sustainable and which contribute to rural prosperity. Furthermore, the Committee feels that if the CAP is to respect the fundamental aspects of European policy, the application of modulation must be primarily based on the conditions of pro- duction before global criteria for competition can be examined. The Committee also expressed con- cern about the lack of financial means for rural development in general and for the new chal- lenges in particular. It accordingly stated clearly that for further investment in the new challenges, in the near future the scope should not only be restricted to the resources of Pillar One and there- fore urged the inclusion of this concern in other EU policies, especially cohesion policy. Under- lining that the carrying out of all CAP measures has a local impact, the Committee finally stressed that the regional level is best placed to achieve optimal results in implementing a common pol- icy, but that distortions of competition between Member States and regions must be avoided. 1.19.4.

The Committee feels that the EU should evaluate the long-term objec- tives of agricultural and trade policy and examine whether food supply is secure in the changed conditions which now exist in the EU and the world at large. According to it, efforts should be made to establish rules for agricultural trade which guarantee food supplies in all countries and in all circumstances. In order to establish security of supply in the EU, the Committee believes that a better basic storage system needs to be put in place for key products and produc- tion inputs (protein, fertilisers, seeds, pesticides) and active measures need to be taken to strengthen cooperation between Member States, the EU and commercial players. The Committee thinks that the EU should set up joint ventures in the agriculture and fisheries sector in the devel- oping countries in order to improve economic conditions in these countries.

The Commission has decided to launch a reflection on how to ensure the most suitable policy and regulatory framework to protect and promote the quality of agricultural products, without creating additional costs or burdens. This Green Paper launched a wide consultation on whether the existing instruments were adequate, how they could be improved and what new initiatives could be created: \u00a1 part I looks at baseline farming requirements and EU marketing standards. It also launched a debate on one of several symbols or logos indi- cating compliance with EU farming requirements; \u00a1 part II examines existing EU quality schemes covering geographical indications, traditional spe- cialities, organic farming and quality products policy for the outermost regions. It also insisted on the need to develop new quality schemes at European level; \u00a1 part III covers private and regional food qual- ity certification schemes. Following the analysis of the contributions, a Commission communication on the strategic direction for agricultural product quality will be presented in May 2009. This could lead to leg- islative proposals after 2010. COM(2008) 641 1.19.8.

The Council noted that the implementation of milk quotas posed a major logistical challenge for new Member States and that a considerable effort has been made to ensure that administrative and control systems were operational in good time. It considers that most of the shortcomings noted are intrinsic to the sys- tem\u2019s start-up phase. The Council also welcomed the significant improvements that Member States have introduced in years subsequent to the Court of Auditors\u2019s enquiry to address the teething problems encountered in early years, inter alia thanks to the Commission\u2019s follow-up. It recog- nised that it is up to the Commission and Mem- ber States to continue to ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken and that proper controls are carried out at the most opportune time. Finally, the Council underlined that as a result of the enlargement, milk products have been traded more widely without destabilising the European market and without leading to budgetary drift.

The Coun- cil reached unanimous political agreement on the fishing opportunities and associated conditions applicable for certain Baltic Sea fish stocks for 2009. In accordance with the multiannual plan applicable to stocks of Baltic cod the Council endorsed a 15% increase in the TACs in the east- ern Baltic, in view of the marked improvement in the stock status and a 15% reduction in the western Baltic where the species is still vulnera- ble. For herring it was decided to reduce the TAC by 15% for the eastern Baltic and by 39% for the western Baltic. Measures to limit fishing effort were also agreed, in particular: \u00a1 a maximum number of days absent from port of 201 days in subdivisions 22\u201324 (western Baltic) and 1 604 days in subdivisions 25\u201327, i.e. a 10% reduction in both zones; \u00a1 the Commission\u2019s proposal to continue applying the transitional technical measures adopted in 2007 prohibiting retention on board of flounder and turbot during certain periods and in specific subdivisions.

The European Council adopted the Euro- pean Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which expresses the commitment of the European Union and its Member States to conduct a fair, effective and consistent policy for dealing with the chal- lenges and opportunities which migration repre- sents ( \u2192 point I.14).

The Committee recommended that the importance of regional and local authorities in the application and promotion of these rights be recognised. Accordingly, it called on the Com- mission and Parliament to capitalise on its own potential role as an observatory of the application of these rights.

Parliament approved the annual report for 2007 presented by the European Ombudsman and the form in which it is presented. It called for all EU institutions and bodies to be given the neces- sary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and peti- tions. Parliament considers that the term \u2018malad- ministration\u2019 should be broadly interpreted. It repeated its call for all EU institutions and bodies to adopt a common approach with regard to the code of good administrative behaviour. Par- liament called on the Ombudsman to ensure that the Commission makes proper use of its discre- tionary powers to initiate infringement proceed- ings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty or to pro- pose penalties under Article 228 of the EC Treaty, while taking scrupulous care to avoid delays or unjustifiable failure to take prompt action, which are incompatible with the Commission\u2019s powers to oversee the application of EU law. Finally, Par- liament welcomed the Ombudsman\u2019s initiatives to advertise widely both his own work and the work carried out by national ombudsmen, and recommended that the Ombudsman further pur- sue his efforts to raise citizens\u2019 awareness.

The Council adopted Directive 2003/86/EC laying down common rules determining the conditions for the exercise of the right to family reunifica- tion by third-country nationals residing lawfully in the territory of Member States. This report gives an overview of the transposition of the directive and identifies possible problematic issues. Overall, the directive has been transposed satisfactorily in the majority of Member States. The main application problems relate to the overly broad or excessive interpretation of some of the discretional provisions specifically with regard to requirements for the exercise of the right to family reunification (e.g. fees, stable and regular resources, integration measures). The Commission will examine all cases where prob- lems of application were identified and ensure that the provisions are correctly applied, in par- ticular in conformity with fundamental rights such as the respect for family life, the rights of the child and the right to an effective remedy.

The June 2008 communication highlighted the need to strengthen the global approach to ensure a coherent, common European migration policy, reiterating the principle that effective manage- ment of migration flows requires genuine part- nership and cooperation with third countries and that migration issues should be fully inte- grated into the EU\u2019s development cooperation and external policies, as well as incorporate issues emerging from them. This communication illustrates the relevance and efficiency of the global approach and shows that it is now neces- sary to refine the approach so that it better reflects the strategic objectives of the EU as regards migration; that it takes into account the specificities of the regions and countries it applies to; and that it makes it possible to more effectively manage the new and evolving chal- lenges and opportunities set by migration. In De- cember 2008, the European Council should give guidance on the further implementation of the proposals of this communication.

The future regulation will remove the remaining obstacles to recovery of maintenance claims within the EU. In particular, the exequatur procedure will be abolished between all Member States which apply harmonised conflict-of-law rules. Accordingly, decisions on maintenance obligations will be able to circulate freely between practically all Member States without any form of control on the substance in the Member State of enforce- ment. This will significantly speed up the recov- ery of maintenance owed. The future regulation also provides for free legal aid for all proceed- ings concerning a parent\u2019s maintenance obliga- tions in respect of a child below the age of 21. Lastly, a system of administrative cooperation between Member States\u2019 central authorities will enable the persons concerned to benefit from practical assistance, in particular through ",

The Council recalled that the Commission\u2019s commu- nication of June 2006 stressed the need to develop judicial training in order to make effec- tive and visible the progress achieved in estab- lishing the area of freedom, security and justice. The communication stressed in particular the need to improve practitioners\u2019 familiarity with the legal instruments of the EU, to improve mutual understanding of Member States\u2019 legal systems and to improve language training. While point- ing out that it is primarily up to Member States to incorporate the European dimension fully into their national activities, the communication also underlined the need to develop a more fully inte- grated type of training, conceived and imple- mented at European level. The Council added that it is also essential that other legal professions, such as lawyers, prosecutors and judicial staff, receive adequate training in the field of European law. It set out guidelines for the organisation of training courses designed to achieve the follow- ing aims: \u00a1 to contribute to the development of a gen- uine European judicial culture; \u00a1 to improve the knowledge of the EU\u2019s pri- mary and secondary law among judges, prosecu- tors and judicial staff, including fostering the knowledge of the procedures before the European Court of Justice; \u00a1 to promote the application of European law by judges, prosecutors and judicial staff, in a way which is in keeping with the fundamental rights and principles recognised in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; \u00a1 to foster the knowledge of the legal systems and law of other Member States; \u00a1 to enhance the language skills of judges, prosecutors and judicial staff throughout the EU; \u00a1 to foster a shared awareness of issues that are common to the judges, prosecutors and judicial staff; \u00a1 to promote a sharing of ideas on the devel- opment of the area of freedom, security and jus- tice and its implications for the proper operation of justice.

One of the objectives of the EU is to strengthen opera- tional cooperation between neighbouring States in order to combat all forms of crime more effec- tively, thereby participating in the consolidation of the EU. Accordingly, the Council recom- mended implementing measures designed to pro- mote familiarity with the organisation, language and working procedures of partner States. 1.21.11.

Regard- ing the situation of vulnerable adults and their cross-border legal protection, the Council invited Member States which have already concluded that it would be in their interests to accede to the Hague Convention of 13 January 2000 on the international protection of vulnerable adults to begin as quickly as possible or to actively con- tinue with procedures for its signature and/or rat- ification. It invited Member States which are still engaged in domestic consultations to conclude those consultations as soon as possible.

It underlined that local and regional authorities will be central to the implementation of the EU counter-terrorism strat- egy. The Committee welcomed efforts made by the Commission to focus attention on the pre- vention pillar of the counter-terrorism strategy, but noted that this is a significant cultural shift for counter-terrorist agencies and requires the knowledge, experience and cooperation of local and regional authorities. The Committee called upon Member States and the police to develop clear and safe systems for the exchange of infor- mation with counter-terrorist policing units. It recognised that the leadership role of local and regional authorities is critical to the delivery of terrorism prevention strategies across Member States. Finally, while welcoming the second peer review of crisis management plans being carried out by the Commission, the Committee called upon the Commission to ensure that local and regional authorities play a full and active role in the review. 1.21.17.

Concerning procedural aspects, Parliament considers that the procedure followed for the con- clusion of the agreement lacks democratic legit- imacy, as at no stage was there any meaningful democratic scrutiny or Parliamentary approval. It called on the Council and the Commission to fully involve Parliament and national parliaments in the adoption of a mandate for negotiations and the conclusion of any future agreements on the transfer of personal data. Concerning scope and purpose, Parliament noted that throughout the text a wide range of purposes is mentioned, making it impossible to establish whether the measures are justified and propor- tional. As a result, the agreement may not con- form to EU and international data protection stan- dards, or comply with Article 8 of the ECHR. Concerning data protection, Parliament wel- comed the fact that the Australian Privacy Act will apply unabridged to EU citizens, but is con- cerned about any exceptions and exemptions that may leave EU citizens with incomplete legal pro- tection. It believes that the agreement should be fully compliant not only with Australian data pro- tection laws, but also and primarily with EU laws. 1.21.18.

This working document gives an overview of anti-traf- ficking action in the EU and Norway. In particu- lar, the first section examines the state of play of national anti-trafficking policy on the basis of the replies received from 23 Member States and Nor- way; the second section concerns the implemen- tation of the action plan by EU bodies; the third contains indications for the continuation of anti- trafficking action. It suggested concentrating efforts on a few key actions concerning: national rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms, identifi- cation and referral to services of victims of traf- ficking; child protection systems; support and recognition of NGOs that provide direct assis- tance to trafficked persons; systemic training of key actors involved in the identification of traf- ficking cases especially for labour exploitation; coordination of investigation and prosecution; external relations.

Parliament called on Member States to recognise the fight against child trafficking as a priority objective in their national child protec- tion policies. It called for the provision of the necessary resources in the framework of the Commission\u2019s strategy on promoting and safe- guarding children\u2019s rights. Finally, Parliament called on Member States to continue actively cooperating and exchanging knowledge and experience with the relevant EU authorities and NGOs, in order to prevent and combat child traf- ficking, and provide adequate treatment for its victims. 1.21.21. Council conclusions on cyber-crime.

The Council recalled that one of the objectives of the EU is the progressive establishment of an area of justice, freedom and security by developing com- mon action among Member States in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal mat- ters. To attain this objective, a single communi- cations network needs to be created to improve the circulation of information on cyber-crime. According to the Council, Europol is the body best placed to promote closer cooperation between Member States in this regard, and to coordinate the action taken against cyber-crime and to set up joint structures to deal with this type of crime. The Council invited Member States to take the necessary steps to set up platforms for the purpose of centralising alerts on offences noted on the Internet, ensuring that the reported information can be transmitted to the European alert platform. It invited Europol to establish and host a European platform which will be the point of convergence of national platforms, in order to collect and centralise information about offences noted on the Internet. Finally, the Council invited the Commission to consider financial support for related national and transnational projects. 1.21.22. Council conclusions on the convergence of internal security.

The Committee highlighted that it is essential to link the European quality assurance reference framework with the needs of the local labour market and calls for the accreditation of voca- tional and training (VET) centres as part of this process. However, it emphasised that the refer- ence framework should not be restricted to being a statistical system or some kind of monitoring tool but should instead be seen as an instrument for ongoing quality development at different lev- els and by different players and stakeholders. European Economic and Social Committee opin- ion on 23 October. The Committee strongly sup- ported the Commission\u2019s proposal to create a European quality assurance reference framework (EQARF) for vocational education and training. It specified quality vocational education and training (VET) as a key and integral aspect of the revised Lisbon strategy. The Committee noticed that the EQARF is useful as it gives a particular emphasis to the improvement and evaluation of the \u2018outputs\u2019 and \u2018outcomes\u2019 of VET in terms of increasing employability, improving the match between supply and demand for training, and promoting better access to lifelong training. Finally, the Committee considered it vital to pro- vide consistency between the EQARF and other European initiatives based on mutual trust such as the European qualifications framework and the European credit system for vocational education and training. 1.22.2.

The Committee believes that the European credit system for vocational education and training (ECVET) is a necessary tool. It pointed out that the labour market in Europe needs to be char- acterised by a high degree of flexibility coupled with reliable social security as outlined in the Commission communication on flexicurity. However, the Committee highlighted that the actual implementation and take-up of the sys- tem will be the real measure of its success. It noticed that local and regional authorities will be useful partners in promoting it through their networks and to make ECVET credible and usable. European Economic and Social Committee opin- ion on 22 October. The Committee highlighted that the establishment of the European credit sys- tem for vocational education and training (ECVET) has added value in the areas of mobil- ity and lifelong learning. It noted that ECVET does not strengthen the necessary links between existing European programmes. The latter stipu- late in particular, as regards the least developed regions of the EU, that the ESF should finance the implementation of reforms in education and training systems so as to make people more aware of the importance of the needs of the knowledge society, particularly lifelong educa- tion and training, and so as to improve access to quality education. Finally, the Committee recalled that the ECVET system, which sets up a permanent process, requires a lasting commit- ment by all the players and a synergy between initiatives adapted to European, national or sec- toral levels. 1.22.3.

The Commission noted that the open method of coordination has already yielded good results in the implementation of the modernisation agenda of universities to improve the delivery of their interlinked missions of education, research and innovation. It added its intention to continue to collaborate with Member States and the higher education sector to overcome remaining obsta- cles and to develop innovative approaches. More- over, it noted that it will also contribute to the success of the Bologna process and will make use of the Erasmus programme/lifelong learning pro- gramme (LLP), the seventh framework pro- gramme for research, the competitiveness and innovation programme, as well as the Structural Funds and EIB loans to promote the modernisa- tion of European higher education.

The Committee urged the Commission to speed up approval of legislation for including air trans- port in the greenhouse gas allowance trading sys- tem of the Community (ETS) and to incorporate the maritime transport sector into the ETS without delay. It was concerned that the directive does not encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emis- sions in the waste management sector, an espe- cially critical sector both for emissions and for land-use planning. The Committee recommended that at least 30% of the revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances be earmarked by Member States for local and regional authorities in order to promote the use of renewable energies and energy efficiency in end uses. Finally, it rec- ommended measures to support certain energy intensive industries in the event of \u2018carbon leak- age\u2019. 1.23.3.

The Committee wished to ensure support schemes are accessible to all renewable energy producers and believes that, for reasons of coherence, sup- port for renewable energy should be accompanied by the phasing out of subsidies for the production and use of fossil fuels and the production and use of nuclear energy. It recommended ensuring max- imum coordination between the principal Euro- pean legislative acts in these areas. The Commit- tee pointed out that setting a 10% target for increased use of biofuels in transport will have the intended positive outcome only if biofuels are pro- duced from commodities obtained in a way that does not distort the natural balance of the envi- ronment, food supply, the economic balance of the market or social balance. It invited the Commis- sion to amend Article 4 of the proposal in order to ensure that territorial entities be associated in the development of national action plans for energy.

The objective of the protocol is to implement the section of the Barcelona Convention that aims to promote inte- grated coastal zone management, taking into account the protection of areas of ecological and landscape interest and the rational use of natural resources. The Mediterranean coastal zones con- tinue to experience high pressures on the envi- ronment and degradation of coastal resources. The protocol provides a framework to stimulate a more concerted and integrated approach which is required to address these problems more effec- tively and achieve a more sustainable develop- ment of Mediterranean coastal zones. The pro- tocol mirrors the approach and principles of integrated coastal zone management as set out in Recommendation 2002/413/EC. The protocol will allow the Community to complement its action towards a better protection and manage- ment of coastal resources and to strengthen the implementation of the recommendation in the Mediterranean. Integrated coastal zone manage- ment is one component of the EU integrated mar- itime policy. COM(2008) 527 1.23.5.

Now approved by both institutions, the proposed direc- tive sets limit values for more than 30 pollutants, including pesticides, heavy metals and biocides. These limits concern pollution peaks as well as annual average values. Member States must adopt the necessary measures to comply with these standards by 2015 in accordance with the provi- sions of the framework directive in the field of water policy (2000/60/EC). The directive requires Member States not only to monitor river pollution and establish long-term trends but also to analyse its origin and draw up an inventory.

The proposal sets out obligations for operators who ",
        "Environment Bull. EU 10-2008 81 place timber and timber products on the Com- munity market for the first time, regardless of their origin. It is based on the due diligence prin- ciple requiring the operators covered by it to apply a system (due diligence system) to min- imise the risk of placing illegally harvested tim- ber and timber products on the Community mar- ket. The due diligence system includes measures and procedures which will enable operators to track timber and timber products, to have access to information concerning compliance with the applicable legislation and to manage the risk of placing illegally harvested timber and timber products on the Community market. Whilst set- ting out clearly the principles to be taken into account when applying a due diligence system, the proposal gives operators the flexibility to choose the mechanisms to deliver the required result. The proposed measures aim at deterring operators from placing timber and timber prod- ucts on the Community market without having a reasonable assurance as regards their legality con- tributing therefore to the global efforts to fight illegal logging. They also provide consumers with greater assurance that by buying timber and tim- ber products they do not contribute to the prob- lem of illegal logging and associated trade. COM(2008) 644 1.23.9.

The Commission observes that there is an increasing global acknowledgement of the need to tackle cli- mate change, including emissions from deforesta- tion and forest degradation in developing countries. This means that the time is right for policy pro- posals through which the EU can contribute to efforts to reduce such emissions. In doing so, the EU will also contribute to other global policy goals, in particular poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation. This communication acknowledges that EU policies can influence the reduction of deforestation and thus emphasises the need for pol- icy coherence. In addition, international incentives will be needed to guarantee the protection and sus- tainable management of forest resources. To this end, the Commission proposes that a portion of revenues from the greenhouse gas emissions trad- ing allowances system be used as part of a new global forest carbon mechanism. It also suggests that in the medium to long term and under certain conditions, resources to tackle deforestation could be made available through carbon markets. COM(2008) 645 1.23.10.

Now approved by both institutions, the proposed direc- tive simplifies the current legislation by estab- lishing a new framework for waste management in the EU. By promoting the use of waste as a secondary resource, the new legislation aims to reduce landfill and greenhouse gas emissions from landfills. The new directive introduces a new approach to waste management that empha- sises prevention. Member States will have to outline and implement waste prevention pro- grammes, and the Commission will report regu- larly on progress achieved in this area. Further- more, the directive lays down a hierarchy of priorities in waste treatment, which provides for the following measures in order of priority: \u00a1 waste prevention; \u00a1 waste reuse; \u00a1 recycling; \u00a1 waste recovery (including energy recovery); \u00a1 disposal as a last resort. The new legislation regards energy-efficient waste incineration as a recovery operation. This encourages the efficient use of resources and the reduction of fossil fuel consumption. Moreover, the directive simplifies and modernises the cur- rent legislation on waste by: \u00a1 introducing an environmental objective; \u00a1 clarifying the concepts of recovery, disposal, end-of-waste status and introducing the concept of by-product to distinguish it from waste; \u00a1 defining the conditions governing the mix- ing of hazardous waste; \u00a1 providing for a procedure which is aimed at setting minimum technical standards for certain waste management operations. 1.23.12.

The Coun- cil reaffirmed its determination to achieve a reduction in the aviation sector\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions through a comprehensive approach and recalled the goal of setting up a global emis- sions trading scheme (ETS). It noted that, from an environmental perspective, the inclusion of aviation in ETS schemes has been recognised at the international level as the most cost-effective solution to reach this objective compared to other economic and fiscal measures. The proposed directive will recognise equivalent measures put in place by third countries. Therefore, the Coun- cil requested the Commission to continue to engage with third countries on the ETS to explore possibilities with them to introduce equivalent measures. 1.23.14.

Now approved by both institutions, the proposed direc- tive aims at including the aviation sector in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (ETS). The trading of emission quotas will apply to the aviation sec- tor as of 2012 and the proposal concerns all flights taking off from or landing on EU territory. The objective is to cap aircraft operators\u2019 annual emissions at 97% of historical emissions (based on the annual average of 2004\u201306 emissions) between 2012 and 2013 and at 95% of historical emissions from 2013 onwards. Every aircraft operator will be allocated an amount of CO 2 emission allowances, based on its annual average activity during 2010. Whereas 85% of allowances will be allocated for free, 15% will be auctioned by Member States as of 2013. Member States should use revenues generated from the auction- ing of allowances to: tackle climate change; reduce greenhouse gas emissions; fund R & D for the development of greener air transport; promote energy efficiency and renewable ener- gies; and for measures to tackle deforestation. The ETS system in particular excludes: flights for the purpose of scientific research; rescue flights and fire-fighting flights; military, customs and police flights; emergency medical service flights; humanitarian flights and flights by commercial air transport operators resulting in total emissions lower than 10 000 tonnes per year.

This report analyses actual emissions data from 2006, together with projections of emissions assuming scenarios \u2018with existing measures\u2019 and \u2018with additional measures\u2019. Although this report assesses the progress of the EU-27, develop- ments in the EU-15 are highlighted because of their collective reduction target of 8%. By 2006, EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions had decreased by 2.7% from the base year level. The projec- tions show that the EU-15 will reduce its emis- sions by 11.3% and over-achieve its Kyoto Pro- tocol emission reduction commitment. EU-27 greenhouse gas emissions in 2006 were 10.8% lower than the base year level. The projections show that the EU-27 will reduce their emissions by 16.3% compared to base year levels. The report concludes that the Community will reach its Kyoto target with the existing policies and additional measures, the use of Kyoto mecha- nisms and carbon sinks. In addition, the sectors covered by the EU emissions trading scheme are also expected to contribute 3.3% of reductions \u2014 currently not fully captured in the projected estimates.

The Council reaffirmed its commitment to bringing the United Nations negotiations under the Bali road map adopted at the United Nations climate change conference in December 2007 to a suc- cessful conclusion and to reaching a global and comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen in December 2009 on a strengthened multilateral climate change regime. It affirmed the EU\u2019s resolve to build a wide coalition for the future of the planet and highlighted its intention to strengthen its partnership with developing coun- tries so as to ensure that these regions benefit from the provisions of the Copenhagen agree- ment and speed up the transformation to a safe and sustainable low carbon development. The Council emphasised that the Copenhagen agree- ment should enable the global average temper- ature increase to be limited to not more than 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. It underlined that this will require a reduction in global emis- sions of at least 50% from 1990 levels by 2050. However, the Council underlined the impor- tance of an ambitious mid-term target. The Council recalled the need for a global agree- ment in Copenhagen on the treatment of the international aviation and shipping sectors as well as on emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. It underlined the need to build on the Kyoto Protocol and its achieve- ments in the multilateral architecture for tack- ling climate change after 2012. The Council highlighted the importance of making progress in Pozna n towards the establishment of a framework for action on adaptation to climate change. 1.23.17.

Parliament welcomed the Commission\u2019s initiative to launch a global climate change alliance, which represents an important recogni- tion of the effects of climate change on develop- ment but called on the Commission to clarify fur- ther the distinct added value of the alliance. It considers the alliance to be an important pillar of the EU\u2019s external action on climate change and to constitute a complementary and supportive plat- form for the ongoing process in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Cli- mate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. Parliament called on the EU to place climate change at the core of its development cooperation policy. Par- liament pointed out that the alliance should take concrete measures to address coherence between, on one hand, the impact of climate change on development, including EU agriculture, trade and fisheries policies and, on the other hand, prob- lems relating to export subsidies, such as tied aid, debt burden, export credits and commercial use of food aid, forced privatisation and liberalisation of vital economic sectors. It stressed that, if cli- mate change is to be taken seriously, new fund- ing must be made available through different bud- get lines and new financing sources. Finally, Parliament called on the Commission to ensure that decision-making throughout the elaboration, implementation, fund distribution and assessment processes takes place in partnership with devel- oping country governments, civil society and local authorities.

The Committee sees a need to improve energy efficiency through technological innova- tion and to develop environment-friendly and energy-efficient transport modes. It believes that a common language should be established within the EU for managing rail transport. The Com- mittee called on the EU and Member States to draw up an inventory of bottlenecks in the trans- port of freight and passengers by rail and work to eliminate them, seeking to make maximum use of existing and future infrastructure. It believes that, in the long term, the EU and Member States should encourage the construction of separate railway networks for freight and passenger trans- port. The Committee considers that urban trans- port planning deserves special attention from local authorities. It supported the development of logistic solutions by local and regional authorities in inland areas, by setting up logistics platforms and dry ports, which are a key tool for improv- ing the global freight distribution system and fos- tering development and cohesion in inland areas.

The directive requires contracting authorities, contracting entities as well as certain operators to take into account life- time energy and environmental impacts when purchasing road transport vehicles. The impacts to be taken into account are: \u00a1 energy consumption; \u00a1 CO 2 emissions; \u00a1 emissions of pollutants, including NOx, NMHC, and particulate matter. The amendments introduce, however, a certain flexibility giving Member States the possibility to use different options in order to fulfil the fixed requirements. ",

Parliament regretted that considerable differ- ences in the application and enforcement of Reg- ulation (EEC) No 3820/85 and shortcomings and delays in the transposition and implementation of Directive 2002/15/EC still remain. It urged Mem- ber States to step up their efforts to guarantee efficient and uniform implementation of the improved social provisions. Parliament expressed its concern at the consistently high average num- ber of infringements, particularly in the field of ",
        "Transport 90 Bull. EU 10-2008 passenger transport, and looked to Member States to improve their enforcement of the rules. It called on the Commission to display the utmost firmness in dealing with infringements of Com- munity law by Member States as regards social provisions in the road transport sector. Parliament also called on the Commission to give appropri- ate priority to the social dimension of road safety and the health and safety of drivers and other road users when preparing its legislative proposal amending Directive 2002/15/EC, as foreseen by the directive itself. 1.24.7.

When adopting Directive 2002/15/EC, the Council and Parliament agreed that it should in principle apply to self-employed drivers from 2009. In addition, the Commission was requested to present a report followed by a legislative proposal based on the report, which would either define the modalities for the inclusion or exclusion of self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive. The report concluded that there was not a decisive case for including self-employed drivers under the direc- tive, but that it was important to address the issue of definitions and to clarify them. This proposal is intended to enhance clarity, readability and enforceability of the current rules by providing a more precise definition of mobile workers. The latter includes so called \u2018false\u2019 self-employed drivers, i.e. those drivers who are not tied to an employer by an employment contract but who do not have the freedom to have relations with sev- eral customers, under the category of mobile workers, with the effect of their being covered by the directive.

The Coun- cil recalled that, in order to ensure the develop- ment of a new generation of air traffic manage- ment (ATM) systems in Europe, it is necessary to: rationalise public and private sector efforts; combine them in the SESAR programme; and conclude membership agreements with public or private undertakings or bodies. It welcomed the financial commitments made by the founding members, the EC, the Eurocontrol provisional council and the 15 current applicants for mem- bership of the joint undertaking. The Council invited Member States to adopt common posi- tions at international organisations such as ICAO or Eurocontrol in order to keep SESAR compli- ant with international standards, and to promote SESAR standard proposals for global implemen- tation of SESAR technologies. It underlined that ATM environmental efficiency is one of the key objectives of the SESAR programme and that it provides a tangible contribution within the Euro- pean policy for the reduction of the environmen- tal impact of aviation. Finally, the Council invited the Commission to: \u00a1 give particular attention to environmental effi- ciency in the evolution of the ATM master plan; \u00a1 monitor closely the progress of the SESAR programme and its conformity with the ATM ",

Reference: Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on com- mon rules in the field of civil aviation security: OJ L 97, 9.4.2008; Bull. 3-2008, point 1.24.11 Adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee on 23 October. The Committee rec- ommended creating specific and uniform stan- dards for aviation security services in addition to the existing common legal standards. It deemed it necessary to explicitly inform airlines, airports and security providers on the application of leg- islation containing security measures and provide them direct access to these rules under strict con- ditions. The Committee considers that measures should be taken to avoid redundant security checks by implementing the concept of \u2018one-stop security\u2019 across the EU and to promote the recog- nition of third countries\u2019 security measures. Finally, it believes that a more coordinated approach between Member States in the fight against terrorism and organised crime is needed.

This report observes that significant progress has been made in pursuing the objective of the wider com- mon aviation area.Although the goal is challenging, and it will probably not be possible to complete the task by 2010 as expected by the Council, negotia- tions with the majority of the eastern and Mediter- ranean partners are due to be either opened or con- cluded by the end of the decade. Stronger efforts are however necessary to ensure effective implementa- tion of the EU acquis communautaire in the field of aviation by the partner countries and harmonious enforcement of these provisions across the com- mon aviation area. The Commission will continue the development of the common aviation area, both by closely monitoring the implementation of exist- ing agreements and by identifying the next poten- tial partners for participation in the project. The western Balkans, Morocco, EEA countries and Switzerland already participate in the common avi- ation area. The Commission has also started com- prehensive air transport negotiations with Ukraine and will soon be launching talks with Israel and Jordan. In addition, it intends to launch compre- hensive air transport negotiations with Algeria and Tunisia, and will closely assess the added value of launching negotiations with Georgia and Moldova.

The European Council recalled that secu- rity of energy supply is a priority for the Euro- pean Union, which involves the responsibility and solidarity of all the Member States. Accordingly, the European Council has decided to step up the work in progress, by adopting guidelines and requesting the Commission to submit relevant proposals or initiatives, where necessary. It will return to this issue at its meeting in March 2009 to take stock of progress, in the light, also, of the Commission\u2019s forthcoming strategic energy review, and to adopt the necessary decisions ( \u2192 point I.13).

References: Agreement between the Government of Canada and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy: OJ 60, 24.11.1959, as amended by the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and the Government of Canada: OJ C 191, 31.7.1985 Agreement between Canada and the European Atomic Energy Community for cooperation in the area of nuclear research: OJ L 346, 22.12.1998; Bull. 12-1998, point 1.2.145 Recommendation for a decision on negotiating directives adopted by the Commission on 17 Oc- tober. Cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy between Euratom and Canada is governed by a bilateral agreement signed in 1959. While the agreement covers most fields of mutual inter- est, the successive modifications make it uneasy to read and cumbersome to implement. Canada is in favour of simplification of the agreement, pro- vided that additional provisions, inter alia, tech- nology transfer are incorporated. This would per- mit the simplification and standardisation of nuclear relations between individual EU Member States and Canada, which at present have sepa- rate cooperation agreements with the Government of Canada. The revised agreement shall ensure the free movement of nuclear materials, equip- ment and technology within the Community, as well as require that transfers of nuclear material and provisions of relevant services be carried out at market-related prices and under fair market conditions.

The Council reached an agreement on the key elements of the third legislative package on the internal electricity and gas markets, namely, the conditions for fair competition and the third- country clause: \u00a1 concerning fair competition: the agreement includes three different unbundling models for production and supply activities, on the one hand, and energy transmission activities on the other, that apply both for gas and electricity. Each Member State will be able to choose one of these options. The Commission\u2019s initial proposal contained two unbundling options: \u2014 integral ownership unbundling, meaning that the same company could not simultaneously own a distribution network and produce or supply energy; \u2014 allowing for an energy producing and sup- plying company to retain the ownership of the transport network on condition that they hand over the management of the transmission net- work to an independent system operator (ISO). The ISO would be an undertaking that is totally separated from the vertically inte- grated company. The Council approved a third solution whereby the control of the transmission network would be entrusted to an independent transmission network operator (ITO). This option would enable com- panies to retain ownership of transmission net- works provided that they compel to abide by rules and a structure to ensure they operate independ- ently in practice. However, undertakings involved in production or supply activities cannot hold the control over a transmission network operator acquired in a Member State that has opted for full unbundling; \u00a1 concerning control of networks by third-country companies: the Council reached an agreement on a third-country clause which ensures that third- country companies abide by the same rules as those that apply to EU undertakings and guaran- tee the same opportunities as regards market access and security of energy supply to European and foreign companies. The clause lays down cri- teria for the assessment of investments from third countries and establishes a procedure for certifi- cation of third-country investors wishing to take control of an energy distribution system or oper- ator.

The Commission\u2019s initial proposal contained two unbundling options: \u2014 integral ownership unbundling, meaning that the same company could not simultaneously own a distribution network and produce or supply energy; \u2014 allowing for an energy producing and sup- plying company to retain the ownership of the transport network on condition that they hand over the management of the transmission net- work to an independent system operator (ISO). The ISO would be an undertaking that is totally separated from the vertically inte- grated company; The Council approved a third solution whereby the control of the transmission network would be entrusted to an independent transmission network operator (ITO). This option would enable com- panies to retain ownership of transmission net- works provided that they compel to abide by rules and a structure to ensure they operate independ- ently in practice. However, undertakings involved in production or supply activities cannot hold the control over a transmission network operator acquired in a Member State that has opted for full unbundling; \u00a1 concerning control of networks by third country companies: the Council reached an agreement on a third-country clause which ensures that third-country companies abide by the same rules as those that apply to EU undertak- ings and guarantee the same opportunities as regards market access and security of energy sup- ply to European and foreign companies. The clause lays down criteria for the assessment of investments from third countries and establishes a procedure for certification of third-country investors wishing to take control of an energy dis- tribution system or operator. It specifies in detail where responsibilities lie and the role of national regulators and of the Commission. 1.25.9.

The Council welcomed the proposal for a directive establishing a framework for the setting of eco-design requirements for energy related products. It underlined the importance that the revision of the framework directive on eco- design brings clarity to the product scope of the directive, avoids overlapping or possible obsta- cles for the development of the existing EU leg- islation aiming at the same range of products. According to the Council it is necessary to pre- serve the operational and practical character of the eco-design directive in order to keep this directive an essential element in EU legislation capable of delivering practical energy savings and concrete CO 2 abatements before 2020. The Coun- cil invited the Commission to ensure that the implementing measures taken leave it up to the market to decide which technologies to use to achieve the required performance levels and that they include environmental criteria in addition to energy efficiency concerning for instance water, product life or waste. It also invited the Com- mission to consider opportunities for SMEs to organise relevant assessments of design and pro- duction processes. ",

The Committee wel- comed the memorandum endorsed by 15 Member States at the agriculture Council of June 2008, entitled \u2018Food, feed, animal and plant imports: safety and compliance with Community rules\u2019. Through this opinion, the Committee would like to contribute to the debate on the scope for improving the European safety mechanism. The WTO provides a legal framework that is essential in preventing unjustified barriers to trade. The Committee is committed to complying with these rules but also wishes to propose a number of adjustments, in particular: \u00a1 the harmonisation of import inspection prac- tices across Member States; \u00a1 the extension of health management meas- ures to cover plant products as well as animal products; \u00a1 the number of inspections for plant products be increased; \u00a1 the application of principles of risk analysis and a clear definition of appropriate levels of protection; \u00a1 an independent assessment of socio-economic factors; \u00a1 the extension of the system of traceability to cover third countries. 1.26.8. Proposal for a Council regulation imple- menting Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the use of antimicrobial substances to remove sur- face contamination from poultry carcases.

This proposal lays down very stringent conditions and criteria for the use of four substances (chlorine dioxide, acidified sodium chlorite, trisodium phosphate and peroxyacids), especially with regard to exposure time, concentration and the prohibition on the simultaneous use of more than one substance since risk assessments carried out considered individual substances and there are no data on the joint use of some of these substances. Compulsory rinsing also ensures that the sub- stance is removed from the product and has no effect on the end product. It is also foreseen that operators will introduce suitable tests to verify that as a result of the use of these substances there is neither any impact on the environment nor any appearance of bacterial resistance. In addition, in order to ensure that consumers are informed, the use of these substances must be suitably mentioned on the labels of poultrymeat and poultrymeat preparations. COM(2008) 430 1.26.9.

Parliament welcomed the Commission White Paper on an EU health strategy for the period 2008\u201313 and supports the values, principles, strategic goals and specific actions set out therein. It called on the Commission to review existing work in the field of health to determine which work streams are delivering value for the Com- munity and Member States. As part of this work, Parliament further called on the Commission to determine which working methods and practices add value to the work of Member States in the field of health and which should be better coor- dinated. It believes that, given the existence of new threats to health, there is a need to address health as a key political issue in the Lisbon strat- egy, which includes the need to provide citizens with access to decent healthcare of the highest quality available to ensure a healthy and compet- itive workforce. Parliament deplored the fact that the White Paper does not set specific quantifiable and measurable objectives whose attainment could produce tangible results and recommended that such objectives be adopted. Finally, it stressed that healthcare needs the support of ",

The Committee endorsed the Commission\u2019s proposal but noted that it should be made clear how the proposal relates to other legislation, including waste and environmental legislation. It also added that the definitions used in the regulation, as well as the provisions con- cerning the authorisation and use of animal by- products in biogas installations, need to be ren- dered clearer. According to the Committee, a number of other specific conditions need to be set out more precisely, and careful consideration given to the possibility that under certain cir- cumstances protein from pork and poultry by- products can be used in fish feed without risk to human and animal health. 1.26.14.

This proposal results from a review of existing legis- lation in the area of consumer contractual rights. It aims at revising Directives 85/577/EEC, 93/13/EEC, 97/7/EC and 1999/44/EC. The pro- posal merges these four directives into a single horizontal instrument regulating the common aspects in a systematic fashion. It also simplifies and updates the existing rules and removes incon- sistencies and gaps. The proposal moves away from the minimum harmonisation approach fol- lowed in the four existing directives (i.e. allow- ing Member States to maintain or adopt stricter national rules than those laid down in the direc- tive) to embrace a full harmonisation approach (i.e. Member States cannot maintain or adopt pro- visions diverging from those laid down in the directive). The proposal contributes to the objec- tives of the Commission as set out in its commu- nication on a single market for 21st century Europe, where the Commission stated that the single market needs to deliver better results and tangible benefits for consumers and SMEs.

Parliament is convinced that this stabilisa- tion and association agreement (SAA) consoli- dates the European prospects of Bosnia and Herzegovina and provides a unique opportunity for the country to achieve peace, stability and prosperity. Specifically, it considers that the SAA has the potential to boost the national economy since it contains provisions which commit the country to liberalising its market, thus increasing the competitiveness of its businesses and attract- ing investment, and to modernising its legal framework by making it more efficient and trans- parent. Parliament also believes that the EU instrument for pre-accession assistance must pro- vide support to the modernisation of the coun- try\u2019s social security systems and its labour legis- lation, as well as support for labour market organisations and trade unions, for the upgrading of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s transport infra- structure in order to facilitate economic develop- ment. Furthermore, Parliament believes that the EU should promote academic and research coop- eration, including exchanges of staff, between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the other countries of the region and between these and Member States. It recalled in this respect the contribution that EU programmes can make to this objective and the urgent need to establish a national agency in charge of implementing these programmes, ",

Annual report from the Commission of the instrument for structural policy for pre- accession (ISPA) 2007. Previous report: OJ C 9, 15.1.2007; COM(2007) 685; Bull. 11-2007, point 1.26.14 Reference: Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy: OJ L 161, 26.6.1999; Bull. 6-1999, point II.6 Adopted by the Commission on 27 October. This particular report relates only to Croatia as it is the last remaining beneficiary of ISPA assistance. Between 2005 and 2006, EUR 60 million was allocated from the Commission budget to the pre- accession instrument for measures in Croatia. The majority of this (EUR 57.2 million) was devoted to infrastructure projects in the fields of environ- ment and transport. No new measures were approved in 2007 as funding for the ISPA instru- ment ended in 2006. Six measures were approved for ISPA in Croatia between 2005 and 2006: three infrastructure projects (one transport and two environment); two sector-related technical assistance measures; one horizontal measure for providing assistance in programme management. No infrastructural projects have got under way in 2007, although it is important to note that three work tenders were launched at the end of the year; one for the largest environment project and two for the only transport project. A total of 10 service contract tenders were launched in 2007. As a result, by the end of the year, four service contracts had been signed for the provision of technical assistance to the ISPA implementing authority (the Central Finance and Contracting Agency) in Croatia for the management of ISPA and the preparation and approval of tender and contract documents. One further service contract was signed relating to one of the three infra- structure projects. This was for technical assis- tance in the preparation of the tender documents for the project. The year 2007 represented a mile- stone for Croatia in the environment sector with the launch of the tender for the main contract for the larger of the two environmental projects receiving ISPA support: the Karlovac water and wastewater treatment programme. The tender is for the design and construction of a waste water treatment plant in the city of Karlovac which will have a capacity of 26 000 m 3 /d. COM(2008) 671 Montenegro and Serbia 1.27.4.

European Parliament resolution on the suspension of the WTO Doha Round and the future of the Doha Development Agenda. Adopted by the European Parliament on 9 Octo- ber. Parliament recalled that a failure to conclude the Doha Round would add to the current global economic uncertainty and could challenge the credibility of the multilateral trading system, resulting in a shift towards bilateral and regional trade agreements. It called on the EU and the USA, as well as the G20 members as new major economic players, to assume their responsibili- ties in the current negotiations, to fully respect the spirit of the Doha Round, and to make every effort to reach a deal as rapidly as possible. Par- liament noticed that the difficulties relating to the Doha Development Agenda highlight the need to address urgently the question of the WTO reform that aims to make it more effective and transpar- ent and improve its democratic legitimacy, accountability, inclusiveness and integration into the wider architecture of global governance once the Doha Round is over. Finally, Parliament emphasised that its members should exercise even more vigorous and effective scrutiny in the area of international trade. Operation of the customs union 1.30.2.

The report concludes that the Customs 2007 pro- gramme has effectively reached its objectives of providing support for and fostering cooperation and coordination between the national customs administrations of Member States, who were the programme\u2019s primary beneficiaries. The pro- gramme benefits from a Community budgetary contribution of EUR 165.55 million, it relies pri- marily on joint actions (such as training, project groups, seminars, exchanges of officials), the development of information technology (IT) sys- tems, tariff-related systems and risk management and information systems.

Pending the conclusion and entry into force of the new bilateral agreement or Kazakhstan\u2019s accession to the WTO, the Commission observed that autonomous measures fixing quantitative limits starting in the year 2009 are necessary. Given that the conditions that led to the fixing of the quantitative limits for 2007 and 2008 remain largely in place, the Commission deemed it appropriate to set the quantitative limits for the year 2009 at the same level as before.

This report concerns those countries which have been granted the GSP+ incentive by Commission Decision 2005/924/EC. It gives an overview of the GSP+ beneficiary countries\u2019 progress in the implementation of their GSP+ commitments. The report shows that, as of 1 April 2008, four out of the 15 current GSP+ beneficiary countries must still ratify one out of the 27 conventions listed in part A of Annex III (Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras and Venezuela) and Georgia must still ratify two conventions. Moreover, according to the Commission, the recommendations of the international monitoring bodies show that the implementing process, in particular of the UN and the ILO conventions, generates challenges to all GSP+ beneficiary countries.

This communication seeks to highlight the importance of local authorities as key actors in development, as well as to identify the first elements of a response strategy at EU level. Its purpose is two-fold: \u00a1 on the one hand, it seeks to recognise the importance of this recently emerged phenomenon; \u00a1 on the other, it attempts to present the first elements of a response strategy that will allow capitalisation and maximisation of local authori- ties\u2019 experience as partners in development policy. Thus, this communication seeks to launch a process that will increase the participation of local authorities in the design and implementa- tion of development activities, in a coordinated and strategic manner.

Reference: Court of Auditors Special Report No 6/2008 on rehabilitation aid provided by the European Commission after the tsunami and Hur- ricane Mitch: Bull. 6-2008, point 1.38.18 Adopted by the Council on 13 October. While the Council regrets the significant delays in the implementation of rehabilitation aid following Hurricane Mitch, it noted with satisfaction the improvement in the Commission response to the tsunami. This improvement concerns, in particu- lar, the evaluation of needs in conjunction with the beneficiary entities, implementation times, and the usefulness and sustainability of the meas- ures implemented. Progress is still required to be made, however, in particular to ensure efficient monitoring of the implementation of aid and to strengthen the links between the humanitarian response, rehabilitation and development. The Council emphasised the importance of continu- ing to learn lessons from past experience with a view to further improving Commission action in the area of post-disaster rehabilitation aid. Against this background, the Council supports the conclusions and recommendations formulated by the Court of Auditors, commended the readiness of the Commission to implement them and wel- comed the measures already taken by the Com- mission to improve its response to disasters. In particular, the Council invited the Commission to continue to build on its approach adopted after the tsunami, so as to enable the rapid design of rehabilitation projects in conjunction with the beneficiaries in order to enhance ownership and ",

The Council also emphasised that giving consideration to disaster prevention meas- ures, in both the rehabilitation and development aid phases, is essential for the sustainability of the measures implemented. It reiterated its inten- tion to adopt in 2008, on the basis of proposals to be presented by the Commission, an EU strat- egy to reduce the risk of disasters in developing countries. 1.31.3.

The main objective of this communication is to inform of the progress of the European and developing countries clinical trials partnership (EDCTP pro- gramme) activities. This communication follows a recommendation in the independent external review report, also known as the Van Velzen report, that the Commission should inform the Council and Parliament about the current status of the EDCTP programme, in advance of the 2008 evaluation due at the end of the first five years of the EDCTP. The results obtained in the mentioned evaluation will be taken into account when con- sidering a renewal of the EDCTP programme for the future. In this context, the Commission noted that despite some serious initial difficulties, the performance of the EDCTP programme has improved in the last two years, with specific achievements in line with the original goals of the programme and with the recommendations of the Van Velzen report. The remaining two years of the EDCTP contract until 2010 will be crucial to determining the extent of Member States\u2019 finan- cial and political commitment and the Secre- tariat\u2019s capacity to negotiate and follow up research contracts.

Commission communication: OJ C 106, 26.4.2008; COM(2007) 774; Bull. 12-2007, point 1.32.2 Adopted by the Committee of the Regions on 9 Oc- tober. Concerning political dialogue and decen- tralisation reforms, the Committee recalled its conviction that a prosperous and secure neigh- bourhood can only be achieved through an efficient cooperation at the local and regional level. Local and regional authorities are best placed to identify and address citizens\u2019 needs and provide adequate services. The Committee called on European neighbourhood policy (ENP) countries to welcome international monitors to observe their elections in order to increase transparency of the election process and consequently improve the level of con- fidence of citizens in the democratic processes. Concerning mobility and migration, the Commit- tee reiterated that mobility and contacts between people are reinforcing the capacity of ENP coun- tries to benefit from economic integration, while progress on mutual understanding would be exceptionally difficult without increasing oppor- tunities for ENP citizens to travel to the EU. Concerning human rights and trafficking, the Committee noted considerable progress in the improvement of human rights and democracy since the beginning of the ENP and Euro- Mediterranean partnership programme and urged governments of ENP countries to continue embracing universal human rights as they consti- tute one of the core values of the EU. Concerning regional conflicts, the Committee reiterated that the EU has a direct interest in working with ENP countries in order to contribute to the resolution of so-called \u2018frozen conflicts\u2019 as they can undermine European\u2019s security through regional escalation, unmanageable migratory flows and disruption of energy supply. Concerning the regional and multilateral fora, the Committee welcomed the proposal to build closer ties with the EU\u2019s neighbours to the east (\u2018eastern partnership\u2019) and called for the development of fora of local and regional authorities of Member States and European neighbourhood policy partner countries for the eastern dimension. The Commit- tee welcomed as well the relaunch of the Euro- Mediterranean partnership (\u2018union for the Mediter- ranean\u2019) and stressed the importance of supporting dialogue between local and regional authorities of EU Member States and European neighbourhood policy partners in the southern Mediterranean.

The Committee underlined the impor- tance of the \u2018Barcelona process: union for the Mediterranean\u2019 initiative which has put the Mediterranean at the top of the European agenda and stimulated discussions and thinking com- mensurate with the stakes involved. The Com- mittee is convinced that initiatives focusing exclusively on a diplomatic approach from either side of the Mediterranean will not achieve sus- tainable solutions while local democracy is not put at the heart of the debate. It recalled that solu- tions should be devised at territorial level, in close cooperation with other institutional levels in order to simultaneously adjust and respond to the challenges posed by globalisation. Conse- quently, it repeated its call for local and regional authorities to be recognised as key partners in the Barcelona process and Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. The Committee thus decided to pro- mote the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean regional and local assembly, made up of mem- bers of the Committee of the Regions, represen- tatives of European and international associations engaged in Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and an equal number of representatives of regional and local authorities from the southern and east- ern shores of the Mediterranean. It would act as a permanent platform for dialogue, exchange and cooperation.

The sum- mit provided an opportunity to discuss a range of issues, such as the role of civil society in the \u2018Barcelona process: union for the Mediterranean\u2019. The network for cooperation between economic and social councils and similar institutions thus wishes to play an active role in defining, pro- moting and monitoring projects falling under the Barcelona process and required to be effec- tively represented in its bodies. The network also insisted on the social dimension of relations between the EU and partner countries. In this regard, it recommended that all initiatives, pro- grammes and projects carried out under Mediter- ranean policies reflect the social dimension, a key element for the sustainable development of part- ner countries. Other key issues for civil society in this region included the prospects for the creation of a free trade area in 2010, the access of women to economic and social life, intercultural dia- logue, freedom of association and consolidating participatory bodies in the region.

They are intended to provide material support for the modernisation and democratic transition process that Morocco has been engaged in for a number of years and for which it is requesting more substantial back- ing from Europe. With the adoption of these measures, Morocco has been given, from now on, \u2018advanced status\u2019 in the ENP. IP/08/1448 Tunisia 1.35.6.

Arti- cle 73 of the EU\u2013Israel association agreement pro- vides for the setting up of the necessary bodies for the implementation of the agreement. Following the elaboration and adoption of the EU\u2013Israel action plan, in the framework of the ENP, 10 subcommit- tees have been established to cope with the increas- ing technical complexity of the subjects in discus- sion. Now, the EU wishes to gradually strengthen its cooperation with Israel, both at the political and sectoral levels. In particular, reinforcing EU\u2013Israel political dialogue includes the establishment of a fully fledged subcommittee on human rights, instead of the informal working group. In view of the above, the Commission proposed to the Coun- cil that a further subcommittee entitled \u2018human rights\u2019 be established, in addition to the existing subcommittees. It will be a forum for discussion, consultation and assessment which can submit pro- posals to the association committee on matters of human rights and on humanitarian law aspects.

The Coun- cil approved a draft decision concerning the establishment of a tariff dismantling schedule for products in the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement with Jordan. The association agree- ment contains a list of products exported from the EU to Jordan. Certain exports were excluded from the immediate dismantling of customs duties when the agreement came into force on 1 May 2002. However, the agreement provides that, four years after entry into force, the joint association council must establish a tariff dis- mantling schedule for those products. This deci- sion will have to be ratified by the EU\u2013Jordan association council. Lebanon 1.35.9.

The Council decided in favour of setting up subcom- mittees provided for in the Euro-Mediterranean interim association agreement on trade and coop- eration between the EU and the PLO. The final decision, which must be confirmed by the joint committee for implementation of the agreement, provides for the setting up of four subcommittees covering the following areas: ",

Parliament expressed its satisfaction that the political prisoners Mr Kazuline, Mr Parsyuke- vich and Mr Kim have been released. It regret- ted that the significant progress which the EU had hoped for in the democratic development of Belarus did not materialise. Accordingly, Parlia- ment believes that the parliament elected in Belarus is of questionable democratic legitimacy. It recalled that on 21 November 2006 the EU declared its readiness to renew its relationship with Belarus and its people within the framework of the ENP as soon as the Belarusian government demonstrated respect for democratic values and for the basic rights of the Belarusian people. Par- liament called on the Council and the Commis- sion to take further steps towards the facilitation and liberalisation of visa procedures for Belaru- sian citizens to facilitate and intensify people-to- people contacts and to democratise the country. Finally, Parliament welcomed the approach taken so far by the Belarusian authorities, despite enor- mous pressure, not to recognise the unilateral independence declared by South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 1.35.13.

The Council noted that, despite some improvements, the parliamentary elections held on 28 September 2008 in Belarus failed to meet the democratic cri- teria of the OSCE. It called on the Belarusian authorities to remedy the shortcomings observed and to cooperate fully to that end with the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. In order to encourage dialogue with the Belaru- sian authorities and the adoption of positive measures to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights, the Council decided that the travel restrictions imposed on certain leading figures in Belarus will not apply for a period of six months, which may be reviewed. The EU reiterated that it remains ready to deepen its relations with Belarus and to review the restrictive measures taken against leading Belarusian figures in the light of progress on the path towards democracy and human rights. The Council is ready to assist Belarus in attaining these objectives. ",

The Council welcomed the recent increase in the pace of EU relations with Moldova. It is ready to have a deeper relationship in the framework of the ENP and to negotiate a new and ambitious agree- ment with Moldova soon. This agreement will go beyond the current partnership and cooperation agreement, including the aim of a comprehensive and deep free-trade area, to be put in place when Moldova is ready to sustain the effects of full lib- eralisation of its trade with the EU. The Council recalled that the pace and quality of reforms in Moldova will affect the nature of its relations with the EU. In this context, it encouraged the Moldovan authorities to make the necessary efforts to strengthen the rule of law and to imple- ment their commitments on human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Council attached par- ticular importance to the parliamentary elections in the spring of 2009 being conducted in a dem- ocratic manner. Finally, the Council reaffirmed its attachment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Moldova, and will increase its engagement in efforts to resolve the conflict in Transnistria.

The Council noted with satisfaction that, following the deployment by the EU of an independent civilian observer mission in Georgia, Russian troops have withdrawn from the zones adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It called on all parties to continue to implement their commitments. The Council reaffirms the willingness of the EU to take an active part in the international discussions provided for in the agreements of 12 August and 8 September, which are set to commence on 15 October under the auspices of the EU, the UN and the OSCE. In this context, it reiterated its support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.

The Council welcomed the progress achieved in Uzbekistan in the previous year with regard to respect for the rule of law and protection of human rights, in particular the release of a num- ber of human rights defenders. It nevertheless remains seriously concerned about the situation of human rights in some domains and urges the authorities to implement their international obli- gations fully in that regard. The Council encour- aged Uzbekistan to continue progress in the direction of human rights, democratisation and the rule of law, and it is prepared to assist it in its reforming efforts towards that goal. In this con- text, the Council decided not to renew the travel restrictions applying to certain individuals referred to in Common Position 2007/734/CFSP, which had been suspended in accordance with the Council\u2019s conclusions of 15 and 16 October 2007 and 29 April 2008.

The meeting was chaired by Mr Lavrov, Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister, and Mr Kouchner, President of the Council of the European Union, with Mr Solana, Secretary-General of the Coun- cil and High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Scharzenberg, Czech Foreign Minister, and Mr Landaburu on behalf of the Commission in attendance. The attendees fully reviewed EU\u2013 Russia cooperation with a view to the next EU\u2013Russia summit in four common areas: the economic area, particularly in relation to energy; visa and judicial cooperation; external security cooperation, and particularly the Russian contri- bution to the EUFOR-Chad operation; and lastly research, education and cultural cooperation.

Parliament was deeply concerned by the effects of climate change on the sustainability of the lives of the indigenous peoples in the region, in terms of both the general environment and the natural habitat. It underlined that any interna- tional decisions relating to these issues must fully involve and take account of all peoples and nations of the Arctic. Parliament welcomes the fact that the \u2018high north\u2019 forms part of the EU\u2019s northern dimension policy, but is convinced that awareness of the Arctic\u2019s importance in a global context needs to be raised further by delivering a standalone EU Arctic policy. It awaits with great interest the forthcoming Commission communi- cation on Arctic policy, and called on the Com- mission to address the following issues: \u00a1 the state of play in relation to climate change, and adaptation to it, in the region; \u00a1 policy options that respect the indigenous populations and their livelihoods; \u00a1 the need to cooperate with Arctic neighbours on cross-border issues, in particular maritime safety; \u00a1 options for a future cross-border political or legal structure that could provide for the envi- ronmental protection and sustainable orderly development of the region or mediate political disagreement over resources and navigable water- ways in the high north. Parliament also called on the Commission to include energy and security policy in the Arctic region on its agenda. It remained particularly con- cerned over the ongoing race for natural resources in the Arctic, which may lead to secu- rity threats for the EU and overall international instability. Finally, Parliament urged the Com- mission to take a proactive role in the Arctic by taking up \u2018observer status\u2019 on the Arctic Council, and setting up a dedicated Arctic desk.

Other recommendations of the opinion focus on issues such as: \u00a1 civil society participation; \u00a1 social cohesion; \u00a1 economic exchanges and EU\u2013Brazil trade, including agricultural questions; \u00a1 education; \u00a1 R & D; \u00a1 the role of multinational and European com- panies in Brazil; \u00a1 the environment, climate change and biofuels; \u00a1 poverty and social inclusion; \u00a1 migration.

The Council recalled that EU and Mexico have main- tained unbroken relations since 1960, and are tied by a global and ambitious economic partnership, political coordination and cooperation agreement that entered into force in 2000. It highlighted that they share the same commitment to the princi- ples of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to an effective multilateral system, the keystone of which is the UN. Trading relations and cooperation between the two sides are con- stantly intensifying to mutual advantage. The Council has therefore given a favourable response to Mexico\u2019s suggestion for the establishment of a strategic partnership. In its view, the principal objective of the strategic partnership between the EU and Mexico should be to jointly promote their values and common interests on the global scene. The partnership should in particular help both parties strengthen their dialogue and cooperation in international fora on crisis situations and global challenges. Finally, the Council believes that the partnership will give renewed impetus to cooperation between the two parties in many areas including: peace and security; the fight against terrorism, organised crime and illicit drugs as well as arms and human trafficking; human rights; social cohesion; migration; regional integration; sustainable development; environmental protection; fight against climate change.

Parliament expressed concern about the list of electoral disqualifications issued by the Venezuelan comptroller-general. It urged the Venezuelan government to examine the above administratively imposed political disqualifica- tions with reference to the provisions of Arti- cles 42 and 65 of the Venezuelan Constitution, under which such measures may be taken on a definitive basis by judicial authorities alone, as is customary in all democratic States. Parliament also asked the Venezuelan government to comply with the international agreements signed and rat- ified by Venezuela, including the American Con- vention on Human Rights, with specific reference to the provisions on political rights set out in Articles 23(1)(b) and (2) thereof, and Articles 2 and 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Furthermore, Parliament expressed firm opposition to the harassment and arbitrary expulsion of human rights activists. It considers that expulsion sets an extremely seri- ous precedent as regards respect for freedom of expression and the right to criticise, which are fundamental to any democratic society. Finally, Parliament called on the Ch\u00e1vez government to put an end to all such practices and to foster a more participatory democracy in Venezuela, in full compliance with the principles laid down in the 1999 Constitution.

Consisting of eight sec- toral partnerships, the action plan is the main operational agenda for Africa\u2013EU cooperation until the next summit, which will be held in Africa in 2010. Therefore, the purpose of this communication is threefold: \u00a1 to assess progress made during the first year of implementation of this initiative; \u00a1 to outline the main challenges ahead, thus serving as a basis for discussion among all stake- holders: EU Member States and institutions, African countries and institutions, parliaments, civil society and international partners; \u00a1 to provide input for the joint progress report for the ministerial troika meeting of November 2008. This communication provides an overview of initial progress made on the overall political objectives of the joint strategy and the imple- mentation of the eight partnerships. A forward- looking concluding section outlines the key rec- ommendations on how to move forward, better and faster. COM(2008) 617 Regional integration and cooperation General 1.35.44.

This communication aims at: \u00a1 updating and explaining the EC vision of regional integration as a tool to support develop- ment in ACP. In particular, it articulates the role of regional policy cooperation in a number of areas (political stability, natural resources man- agement, agriculture and food safety, research and development) which are essential to bring forward the concept of sustainable regional integration; \u00a1 presenting a consistent EU approach across its various policy tools: political and policy dialogue; financial cooperation; trade policy. Furthermore, the communication provides an overview for the 10th EDF regional programmes that will be adopted in the autumn; \u00a1 calling on Member States to rally around a shared vision and to strengthen and make their support to regional integration more effective, in particular, but not only, through EU regional aid for trade packages. As a response to those challenges identified above, the Commission proposed that the EU should commit to supporting five priorities, focused as appropriate to regional specificities and needs: \u00a1 strengthening regional institutions; \u00a1 building regional integrated markets; \u00a1 supporting business development; \u00a1 connecting regional infrastructure networks; \u00a1 developing regional policies for sustainable development (in particular food security and agri- cultural production, the common management of natural resources, social cohesion at regional level and science and technology capacities).

According to the Commission, the impact of China\u2019s emergence as a leading partner for Africa in the last few years on security, stability and sus- tainable development in Africa and on global governance requires a strategic policy response by the EU and an effort to improve the coherence of EU agendas regarding both Africa and China. Therefore, this communication outlines some of the objectives and principles which should under- pin trilateral cooperation as well as possible areas in which dialogue could begin, such as: \u00a1 strengthening peace and security in Africa; \u00a1 supporting affordable and sustainable infra- structure; \u00a1 improving the sustainable management of natural resources in Africa; \u00a1 enhancing Africa\u2019s agricultural productivity and contributing to greater food security. The focus at this stage is therefore on initial prag- matic and realistic steps on which partners\u2019 agree- ment would be sought, rather than proposing overly formal structures or ambitious areas of cooperation at this time.

This meeting was co-chaired by Mrs Samate, Deputy Minister for Regional Coopera- tion, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Cooperation of Burkina Faso, and Mr Joyandet, Secretary of State in charge of Cooperation and Francophone Affairs of France. Participants con- sidered the following issues: \u00a1 concerning peace and security, Ecowas and the EU considered the current situations in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and the Sahel region; \u00a1 concerning democratic consolidation and elections, Ecowas welcomed the decision of the EU to deploy the first-ever EU election observa- tion mission to Ghana to observe the presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for 7 De- cember 2008; \u00a1 concerning the impact of increase in food prices, the parties exchanged views on how best to deal with rising commodity and oil prices, which pose a serious challenge to the stability of the West Africa region; \u00a1 concerning migration and development, the EU and Ecowas, together with other countries and international organisations, aim to adopt a multi- annual programme of cooperation based on the three points of the global approach to migration: legal migration; combating illegal migration; syn- ergies between migration and development policy; \u00a1 concerning drug trafficking, the EU reaf- firmed its willingness to support Ecowas in the implementation of the regional response action plan on fighting the drug trafficking and related organised crime in West Africa; \u00a1 concerning the regional economic integra- tion, the EU and Ecowas reaffirmed the impor- tance of the development dimension of economic partnership agreements; \u00a1 concerning the world financial crisis, both parties expressed their concern about the impact of the world financial crisis on the economic sit- uation of developing countries and on growth prospects as well as on foreign direct investments.

Parliament called on the Government of Uganda and the governments of the neighbouring countries, in particular the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to cooperate fully with the Interna- tional Criminal Court (ICC) in its investigations and prosecutions. It called, in particular, for coop- eration in arresting and surrendering Joseph Kony and other persons charged by the ICC, without delay. Parliament noted that the Rome Statute pro- vides that, once persons have been surrendered to the ICC, the Government of Uganda may then apply to have the cases returned to Ugandan courts, provided the ICC concludes that Ugandan courts are able and willing to genuinely investigate and prosecute the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) suspects named in the warrants of arrest. Further- more, Parliament called on Member States, espe- cially those which have been involved in Uganda and the Juba peace process, to coordinate with regional governments and the UN secretariat and peacekeeping forces with a view to the execution of the ICC warrants of arrest for LRA leaders. 1.35.48.

Parliament is extremely concerned by the renewed fighting between the Congolese army and resurgent militias in North Kivu and the pre- viously pacified region of Ituri. It expressed its deep outrage at the massacres, crimes against humanity and acts of sexual violence against women and girls which have continued for too many years in the eastern provinces of the DRC. Parliament called on the international community and the UN Security Council to strengthen the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC) by providing appropriate materials and staff to enable it to ful- fil its mandate. It encouraged all the governments of the Great Lakes region to initiate a dialogue with the aim of coordinating their efforts to lower tensions and stop the violence in the eastern parts of the DRC before this conflict spreads to the region as a whole. Parliament also called on all the parties to stand by their commitments to pro- tect the civilian population and respect human rights, as outlined in the Goma peace agreement and the Nairobi communiqu\u00e9 . It asked the Coun- cil and the Commission to implement with immediate effect large-scale medical assistance and reintegration programmes for the civilian populations in the eastern parts of the DRC and in anticipation of the reconstruction which will be required.

It also provided an opportunity to estab- lish contact with the new government and to clar- ify bilateral cooperation between the EU and the DRC. He signed the 10th EDF\u2019s national indica- tive programme, involving a total of EUR 514 mil- lion. During the visit, Mr Michel held a meeting ",

Parliament took note of Council Joint Action 2008/749/CFSP, which establishes a military coor- dination action in support of UN Security Coun- cil Resolution 1816 (2008) named EU NAVCO. It asked the Commission to set up, in the frame- work of the new integrated maritime policy, a Com- munity system for mutual cooperation and coordi- nation that would allow naval vessels flying the flag of a Member State deployed in international waters to protect fishing and merchant vessels from other Member States, at the earliest possible opportunity. Parliament highlighted, therefore, its adoption of an amendment at first reading of the Union\u2019s general budget 2009 aimed at establish- ing a new budget line to finance a pilot project to examine the possibility of funding, managing and coordinating a Community action plan to protect Community vessels transiting through or operating in areas threatened by international piracy. Zimbabwe 1.35.51. Council conclusions on Zimbabwe. Reference: Council conclusions on Zimbabwe: Bull. 9-2008, point 1.35.55 Adopted by the Council on 13 October. The Council noted the resumption of mediation by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), as announced by its current chairman, under the leadership of Mr Thabo Mbeki, and encouraged it to mobilise without delay in order to ensure that the agreement of 15 September enters into effect. The Council highlighted the importance of the active support of the interna- tional community, in particular the AU and the UN. The Council is ready to contemplate addi- tional measures should implementation of the agreement of 15 September continue to be blocked. The Council also remains concerned at the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. A further EUR 10 million in aid has just been released by the Commission. Zim- babwe\u2019s considerable needs in this area necessi- tate the continuing, by the Zimbabwean authori- ties, of unrestricted access for humanitarian purposes. The Council pointed out the EU\u2019s con- stant support for the Zimbabwean people. It reaf- firmed that the EU stands ready, once the agree- ment of 15 September is actually implemented and permits the restoration of the rule of law and respect for human rights, to adopt a package of measures to assist in the consolidation of democ- racy and in the country\u2019s economic and social rehabilitation.

        "Budgets 142 Bull. EU 10-2008 that the Council has reduced an already low-level preliminary draft budget (PDB) even further: commitment appropriations in the draft budget total EUR 133 933 million, which represents a decrease relative to the PDB of EUR 469 mil- lion, whereas payment appropriations are a full EUR 1 771 million beneath the PDB, correspon- ding to 0.89% of gross national income thus bringing payments down to an unprecedentedly low level. According to Parliament, this has even further increased the disparity between the level of commitments and payments, which is contrary to the principle of equilibrium. In consequence, it decided to increase the overall level of payments to 0.959%. In addition, Parliament feels that the EU budget, in its present format, cannot address the goals that the EU has set for climate change and is con- vinced that a serious effort should be made to increase and concentrate adequate financial resources to boost European leadership in this challenge. It therefore invited the Commission to present an ambitious plan for an adequate increase of climate change funds by 15 March 2009, including the establishment of a specific fund or the creation of a dedicated budget line which would improve budget capability to deal with these issues, especially by mitigation, adap- tation and stabilisation measures. Finally, Parlia- ment considers growth and employment, the fight against climate change and strengthening the safety and security of citizens and the EU social dimension to be important priorities of the 2009 budget and will reinforce appropriations on the budget lines concerned. 1.36.3.

The amending letter No 2 to the preliminary draft budget (PDB) 2009 contains a careful, line by line update of the estimated needs for agricultural expenditure. In addition to changing market fac- tors, the amending letter also incorporates leg- islative decisions adopted in the agricultural sec- tor since the PDB 2009 was drawn up, revised estimates of needs for some direct payments, as well as any proposals, which are expected to have an effect during the coming budget year. Thus, the overall appropriations for Heading 2 are esti- mated at EUR 56 495.5 million, leaving a margin of EUR 3 143.5 million in commitment appro- priations below the corresponding ceiling of the financial framework. The commitment appropri- ations for agricultural expenditure (including vet- erinary and fisheries expenditure financed under EAGF) amount to EUR 41 579.9 million, a reduction of EUR 1 280.4 million compared to the PDB 2009. This amending letter also pro- poses the creation of new budget lines for food facility (rapid response to food price increases in developing countries), pending the adoption of the legal base.

Parliament welcomed the Commission communication \u2018A Europe of results \u2014 Apply- ing Community law\u2019 and the Commission\u2019s undertaking to improve current working meth- ods with a view to prioritising and accelerating the handling and management of existing pro- ceedings. It called on the Commission to make every effort to shorten the relatively long delay in dealing with complaints or petitions and to find practical solutions to the problems pre- sented by deciding, upon receipt of the case, whether alternative methods such as Solvit, which is still not promoted enough, are more appropriate. Moreover, Parliament called on the Commission to apply Article 228 of the EC Treaty with greater firmness in order to ensure due compliance with judgements of the Court of Justice. It also supports the Commission\u2019s efforts to determine the areas in which addi- tional training in Community law could be use- ful for national judges, legal professionals and civil servants. Furthermore, Parliament believes agreements on monitoring the Community law and close coop- eration between the Commission, the Council, the European Ombudsman and the relevant commit- tees of the European Parliament to be essential in order to ensure effective action in all cases where a petitioner has justifiably complained on an infringement of Community law. It empha- sised the need to give consideration to the previ- ously canvassed idea of a common access point for all citizens\u2019 complaints and problems relating to the monitoring of the application of Commu- nity law. It also considers that national parlia- ments have a valuable role to play in this moni- toring, thus helping to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the EU and bring it closer to the people. Finally, Parliament pointed out that the concept of citizenship significantly broadens the scope of the principle of non-discrimination. It called on Member States to respect the rights deriving from EU citizenship, including the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament, which is of particular importance in the run-up to the 2009 elections. It also called on the Commission carefully to monitor the transposition of Directive 2000/43/ EC and of Directive 2000/78/EC concerning equal treatment and whether the transposing leg- islation adopted by Member States is in keeping with the provisions of those directives.

European Parliament decision on inser- tion in Parliament\u2019s Rules of Procedure of a new Rule 202a on the use by Parliament of the sym- bols of the Union Reference: Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament: OJ L 44, 15.2.2005 Adopted by the House on 9 October. The aim of this amendment is to include an explicit reference to the EU symbols (flag, anthem and motto) to be used by Parliament in its everyday activities. Plenary session in Brussels, 8 and 9 October 1.38.2. Parliament held an extensive debate on the preparation of the European Council on 15 and 16 October, following statements from the Council and the Commission. The debate focused essentially on the financial crisis and was fairly consensual, albeit with nuances as to the specific measures to be taken. Although most Members called for concerted action by the EU and largely supported the conclusions of the Ecofin Council held on 7 October, some members in the left ranks criticised the lack of any preventive action in the past. Several MEPs went even further to attack Mr McCreevy, Member of the Commis- sion, for years of alleged inactivity. President Barroso, whilst underlining the need for more coordination between all relevant actors, pre- sented a string of Commission proposals in the pipeline and announced the creation of a high- level group on the future financial market super- visory architecture under the chairmanship of Mr de Larosi\u00e8re, former Director-General of the IMF, as well as the establishment of a permanent steering group on the financial crisis at Commis- sion level to be chaired by himself, and including Mr Almunia, Mr McCreevy and Mrs Kroes, Members of the Commission. State Secretary Jouyet, on behalf of the French Presidency, agreed that coordination still needed to be enhanced at EU level and expressed confidence in the Commission\u2019s forthcoming proposals. He fur- ther expected the IMF to take on the role of \u2018financial watchdog\u2019 in order to ensure both financial and monetary stability at international level. The other key issues for debate included the Treaty of Lisbon, with members almost unan- imously calling for a speedy ratification by the remaining Member States and a clear roadmap for a solution of the Irish deadlock (at the latest at the December European Council). The House also discussed the energy and climate package, with a divergence of views between the Com- mission and the Council Presidency: whereas President Barroso rejected the claim that this package was unsuited for a situation of economic downturn, Mr Jouyet reiterated the idea that it had to be adapted to the current economic cir- cumstances, yet without bringing into question its broad principles. It is noteworthy that the PPE- DE group took a cautious approach, asking to \u2018move forward carefully without scaring indus- try\u2019. Should an additional year be necessary to come up with a balanced agreement, this addi- tional time should be taken. The formal sitting of the European Parliament was marked by a speech from Ingrid Betancourt, who described her traumatic experience in cap- tivity and made an appeal for raising global awareness of human rights violations (her speech coincided with the 60th anniversary of the UN Declaration on Human Rights). She concluded by praising the power of \u2018words and dialogue\u2019 as indispensable tools for bringing wars and human rights violations to an end. In the institutional field, the House held a debate on the implementation of the ruling of the Court of Justice on the Turco case regarding access to Council documents (legal opinions and delegation names). Mr Jouyet, in replying to the oral question on behalf of the Council, reassured the House that ",

EU 10-2008 the Council would fully comply with the ruling as well as with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, adding that the documents in question had already been made public. Mrs Wallstr\u00f6m, Vice-President of the Commission, underscored the fact that transparency was at the forefront of the Commis- sion\u2019s policies, with databases continuously updated and adapted to new technologies. As far as domestic policies are concerned, the debate focused on three main issues. The House adopted by a very large majority a resolution with recommendations to the Commission on \u2018Lam- falussy follow-up\u2019. It calls on the Commission to submit to Parliament, by the end of 2008, a leg- islative proposal covering the effective regulatory and supervisory arrangements for financial markets at European level as well as a wide range of meas- ures related to the proposed future financial stabil- ity and supervisory frameworks. Mr McCreevy, Member of the Commission, acknowledged that Europe was currently going through the most seri- ous financial crisis in living memory. The major challenge was to release lending throughout the economy. He reassured the House that several ini- tiatives were already under way or in the pipeline. The House reached a broad consensus on the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union. The House supported the pro- posed first set of policy initiatives. However it criticised the non-concrete nature of the envisaged set of objectives and the loose timetable for their implementation. Mr S pidla, Member of the Com- mission, welcomed that fact that the report endorsed, by and large, the measures put forward by the Commission, further recalling that the Council conclusions also went in a similar direc- tion. Parliament also adopted an own-initiative report on the Commission\u2019s White Paper \u2018Together for health: a strategic approach for the EU 2008\u201313\u2019. The debate in the House gathered broad consen- sus, the White Paper being broadly welcomed. However some Members criticised the lack of more specific and quantifiable indicators. Mr McCreevy outlined the Commission\u2019s plans in different areas related to health (nutrition, lifestyle, prevention, screening, centres of excel- lence, etc.) and reassured members that while the White Paper contained general goals and princi- ples, specific targets and quantifiable measures would be included in concrete policy initiatives. Under the new Rule 45(2) of its Rules of Proce- dure, Parliament discussed and adopted three own-initiative reports, with debates limited to short presentations by rapporteurs and replies by the Commission. The House carried by a large majority the report on stepping up the fight against undeclared work, very much supportive of the Commission\u2019s approach. Mr S pidla stressed that the problem had already been highlighted in the Green Paper on labour law, mentioning two specific initiatives in this field: the draft directive on the application of the principle of equal treat- ment between men and women and the proposal on sanctions for employers of illegally resident third-country nationals. Parliament adopted a res- olution on the implementation of the social leg- islation related to road transport, with opposition from the PPE-DE ranks. Mr S pidla explained that the problem regarding the enforcement of the leg- islation in Member States lay within the existence of \u2018false self-employed drivers\u2019, who were only formally independent. The House also carried by a large majority the report on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty in the EU. Mr S pidla underlined that combating poverty was included in the renewed social agenda, pointing to the recently adopted recommendation on active inclusion. As far as external policies are concerned, the debate focused on the suspension of the Doha Round. In its resolution, Parliament reiterates its full commitment to the multilateral approach to trade policy, placing emphasis on the fact that, in the current context of financial crisis, a success- ful conclusion of the Doha Round could prove to be a stabilising factor. In the course of the debate, some members levelled strong criticism against Mr Mandelson\u2019s resignation as Member of the Commission, which they deemed to represent a final blow to the Doha debacle. Mrs Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission, explained that although the July round of negotiations had failed, the Doha Round as such had not been sus- pended. The Commission\u2019s aim was to act con- structively to facilitate a full ministerial resump- tion once the necessary assessments were carried out on those issues still outstanding. In the field of external policies, the House also adopted by an overwhelming majority resolu- tions on the situation in Belarus, Arctic gover- nance and Ukraine\u2019s maritime commitments ",
        "European Parliament Bull. EU 10-2008 151 under the EU\u2013Ukraine partnership and coopera- tion agreement. As far as legislative issues are concerned, the fol- lowing merit being highlighted: \u00a1 under the assent procedure, Parliament endorsed by a very large majority the protocol to the EC\u2013Switzerland agreement on free move- ment of persons (participation of Bulgaria and Romania). The protocol is the \u2018logical extension\u2019 of the agreement with the EU-25 and gives Switzerland the right to maintain quantitative limits for workers and self-employed persons from Romania and Bulgaria in order to gradually ease access for those two nationalities to the Swiss labour market; \u00a1 under the consultation procedure, the House adopted two legislative resolutions. It endorsed by a very large majority the report on the preser- vation of commitments on trade in services laid down in the EC\u2013Ukraine partnership and coop- eration agreement. Mrs Kuneva, Member of the Commission, informed the House that the provi- sion adopted would be included in the free trade agreement being currently negotiated. She reas- sured members that, via the future association agreement, the Commission would endeavour to ensure Ukraine\u2019s political and economic integra- tion into the global economy as well as partner- ship with the EU. Parliament also adopted by an overwhelming majority and without debate a report on the establishment of the European crim- inal records information system (ECRIS). Plenary session in Strasbourg, 20\u201323 October 1.38.3. In a formal sitting, Parliament was addressed by the former President of Portugal and current UN High Representative for the Alliance of Civilisations Mr Jorge Sampaio, who delivered a speech on cultural diversity in the framework of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. President P\u00f6ttering presented the Dardenne broth- ers, directors of the film Le silence de Lorna , with the Lux Prize 2008. He underlined that the prize was the expression of Parliament\u2019s support for the cultural and linguistic diversity of the EU. Regarding the key debates, a significant share of the plenary session was devoted to the debate on the outcome of the European Council which had taken place in Brussels on 15 and 16 October. President Sarkozy, on behalf of the French Pres- idency, whilst recalling the disproportionate reac- tion taken by Russia vis-\u00e0-vis Georgia last Au- gust, stressed his belief in a long-term partnership of the EU with Russia. In turning to the financial crisis, he underlined that, unless speedy concerted action had been taken, the situation could well have led to the collapse of the financial system in Europe. He acknowledged that it had not been easy to assemble a coordinated European response, involving all the relevant stakeholders, namely the Commission, the biggest European economies, the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup, along with the United Kingdom and the Slovak Republic. Eventually consensus had been hammered out, including the spending of several hundred billion euro both to reassure European bank account holders and to restart interbank lending. The recipe for success was European cooperation, with a view to ensuring that Europe would not lose its industrial basis and European enterprises would not end up in the hands of non-Europeans. Regarding the energy and climate change package, President Sarkozy set out two absolute priorities: delivery on the 20- 20-20 commitments and agreement before Poz- na n . Europe would otherwise lose valuable growth opportunities from a first-mover position and its global partners would receive the wrong signal. Finally, in addressing the pact on immi- gration, which he deemed to represent a remark- able achievement among 27 Member States in troubled times, he recalled that such a pact would allow Member States leeway for flexibility within an agreed framework. He wound up by underlin- ing the need for strong European governance, notwithstanding its difficulties, especially in view of the delay in the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. President Barroso congratulated Mr Sarkozy on his hard and successful work, adding that he was proud of being at the helm of the Commission, which had cooperated very closely with the French Presidency over the past weeks and months. He explained that Europe needed to overcome the financial crisis and then focus on the reform of the international financial system as well as on bolstering and re-launching the real ",
        "European Parliament 152 Bull. EU 10-2008 economy. A global response was needed to meet the global challenges. The next steps would involve the adoption of several measures by the Commission (already under way or in the pipeline) touching upon such aspects as capital requirements, the necessary guarantees for bank deposits and new accounting standards. He announced the composition of the newly created high-level group under the chairmanship of Mr Larosi\u00e8re, which would present its first find- ings for the spring 2009 European Council. He expressed his satisfaction over the agreement reached on the pact on immigration, adding that a similar compromise should be reached before the end of 2008 on the energy and climate change package. The main political groups aired positive views on the outcome of the European Council. The PPE- DE thanked the French Presidency for its efforts, thereby allowing Europe to play a remarkable role in the world. It also underlined that managing a financial crisis should not be tantamount to the end of capitalism. However, the free market had to be subject to appropriate regulation. The PSE brought to the fore the fact that the policy of unfet- tered financial deregulation had fallen into pieces, offering a great opportunity now for Europe to insist on a better financial system at the world level. In praising the work done by Mr Sarkozy and President Barroso, the PSE held that they had rallied to positions closer to the ones held by the PSE Group for many years. The ADLE raised con- cerns whether the European Council conclusions may jeopardise Parliament\u2019s role in co-decision. The Verts-ALE felt that President Sarkozy and the Commission should show a certain amount of self- criticism because the crisis, though far from a nat- ural disaster, could have been foreseen. They called for the rethinking the very foundations of Europe\u2019s economic model. The GUE-NGL called for the adoption of a new Bretton Woods system. It should be noted that, in the margins of the ple- nary, President Barroso attended an extraordinary meeting of the Conference of Presidents of polit- ical groups which was fully devoted to the finan- cial crisis. Group heads endorsed the initiatives undertaken by the Commission President to meet successfully the challenges posed by the finan- cial turmoil. In the institutional field, five issues were dis- cussed. In the first place, Parliament endorsed by a large majority (538 in favour, 40 against, 63 abstentions) the appointment of Baroness Ash- ton of Upholland as member of the European Commission. Parliament also adopted, by an overwhelming majority verging on unanimity, the report on the annual activities of the European Ombudsman, 2007. Mr Piebalgs, Member of the Commission, recalled the Commission\u2019s com- mitment to improve its administration and strengthen its service duty, reassuring the House that it had always drawn lessons from the inquiries launched by the Ombudsman. He pointed out that a single special report touching upon the Commission had been sent to Parlia- ment in 2007. Parliament carried with broad support a resolu- tion on the monitoring of the application of Com- munity law. Mr Borg, Member of the Commis- sion, recalled that the correct application of Community law ranked high among the priorities of the Barroso Commission, which was vigilant in exercising its role of \u2018guardian of the Treaties\u2019. Against this background, the Commission had made a major effort to improve its working meth- ods for the benefit of citizens and businesses alike, including more frequent decision-taking on infringement cases to avoid delays and the intro- duction of the EU pilot project this year. Parliament adopted a resolution on better lawmak- ing 2006, supportive of the Commission\u2019s objective of improving the quality of Community legislation and reducing the legislative burden, including abol- ishing legislation which may be unnecessary, ham- per growth and inhibit innovation. The future settlement of the institutional aspects of regulatory agencies was also discussed by the House, followed by a resolution which received across-the-board agreement. Mr Borg welcomed the support expressed by Parliament of the thrust of the communication \u2018European agencies: the way forward\u2019 adopted in March 2008, notably the proposed moratorium on the creation of new agencies; the upcoming evaluation of the agency system and the creation of the interinstitutional working group. Parliament had a first reading of the budget, endorsing by and large most of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets. It should be noted that the House reintroduced the amounts laid down in the preliminary draft budget for a ",
        "European Parliament Bull. EU 10-2008 153 large number of budget lines. Likewise, the House increased payment appropriations accord- ingly, despite reticence from both the Council and the Commission. It is noteworthy that Parliament upheld the general reserve on the Commission\u2019s salaries. Regarding internal policies, in the field of avi- ation the House dealt with two issues. Follow- ing an oral question to the Commission on the impact of aviation security measures and body scanners on human rights, privacy, personal dig- nity and data protection, the House carried a resolution, with PPE-DE ranks largely abstain- ing. This resolution calls on the Commission to carry out a fundamental rights impact assess- ment as well as scientific and medical assess- ments of such technologies. The House also adopted a resolution on the EU\u2013Australia pas- senger name record agreement, calling on the Commission and Council to make sure that the relevant data would be well protected and used solely in the fight against terrorism. Vice- President Barrot reassured the House that the terms of the agreement were in line with EU law on privacy and data protection, further envisaging a plethora of safeguards regarding data storage. The Commission delivered a statement on its plans for the Polish shipyards at Gda n sk, Gdynia and Szczecin. It was pointed out that the under- lying goal was not simply to close them down but to make them viable to resist the current recession. The House adopted additional resolutions on gov- ernance and partnership at national and regional levels and a basis for projects in the sphere of regional policy and on the Commission\u2019s initia- tive on building a global climate change alliance. In the field of social policy, the House also adopted a report on the challenges to collective agreements in the EU, which is highly critical of the rulings of the European Court of Justice in the cases Viking-Line , Laval and R\u00fcffert . It further calls for the right balance to be struck between free provision of services and workers\u2019 rights. Mr S pidla, Member of the Commission, explained that the Commission was eager to assess the impact of the said ruling with all the parties involved, whilst keeping an eye on any further developments. Regarding external policies , Parliament held a lengthy debate on EU\u2013Russia relations, subse- quent to the statements delivered by the Com- mission and the Council. The debate showed a geographical divide: whereas eastern and north- ern European MEPs defended Georgia and called for more support, central and western European MEPs called for a \u2018non-confrontational\u2019 reaction from the EU. This was further compounded by an additional divide across the political spectrum: PPE-DE, ADLE, UEN deemed the Russian inter- vention in Georgia to be disproportionate and constituting a violation of its territorial integrity. Although a dialogue with Russia was necessary, the negotiation of a new agreement should not be resumed until Russia complied with the commit- ments agreed upon in August and September (withdrawal to the positions held prior to 7 Au- gust). However, the PSE aired far fewer critical views and endorsed the need for continuous dia- logue, stressing the interaction between energy, investments and human rights. Mrs Ferrero- Waldner, Member of the Commission, while con- demning the disproportionate Russian reaction in the conflict and its unilateral decision to recog- nise the breakaway provinces, highlighted the complex interdependence between the EU and Russia as regards energy and trade as well as on the international stage (Iran, Middle East, climate change, etc.). Mr Jouyet, on behalf of the French Presidency, welcomed the withdrawal of Russian troops from the zones adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia as a first step for the solution of the conflict. He added that the forthcoming sum- mit with Russia would represent an invaluable opportunity to examine the state of play of bilat- eral relations. Parliament also adopted resolutions on the part- nership and cooperation agreement with Vietnam and human rights in that country, the commemo- ration of the Holodomor (the Ukraine artificial famine 1932\u201333) and the situation in Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Myanmar (Burma). As far as legislative issues are concerned, the fol- lowing merit being highlighted: \u00a1 under the assent procedure, the House endorsed the conclusion of the stabilisation and association agreement between the European Communities and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mr Jouyet, on behalf of the French Presidency, ",
        "European Parliament 154 Bull. EU 10-2008 called on the Bosnian authorities to speed up the reforms as the majority of its citizens fully sup- ported the European perspective. Mr Rehn, Mem- ber of the Commission, was adamant that any lack of progress in the reforms would have a harmful effect on the European outlook for the country; \u00a1 at second reading under co-decision, Parlia- ment endorsed the compromise reached with the Council on airport charges. The House also endorsed without amendments the common posi- tion of the Council on temporary workers, thereby facilitating the adoption of relevant leg- islation which the House deemed to be protective vis-\u00e0-vis the workers concerned; \u00a1 at first reading under co-decision, Parliament endorsed by a large majority the compromise reached with the Council on the variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products, thereby rendering a second reading unnecessary. Vice-President Verheugen expressed his satisfaction with the envisaged simplification of rules. He also made a brief declaration on the forthcoming proposal on counterfeiting of medic- inal products. In stressing that quality was more important than speed, he reassured the House that the Commission was determined to take action and would come up with a legislative proposal in a few months. The House also adopted by an overwhelming majority the report on the protection of con- sumers in respect of certain aspects of timeshare, thereby endorsing the compromise package of amendments and paving the way for a first read- ing agreement. It envisages the extension of the scope of the concept to include long-term holiday products. Mrs Kuneva and members alike wel- comed the benefits envisaged not only for the consumers (enhanced and fully harmonised rights) but also for the industry (driving off rogue traders and restoring the sound reputation of this sector). Also at first reading, Parliament endorsed the establishment of an action programme for the enhancement of quality of higher education and the promotion of intercultural understanding through cooperation with third countries (Eras- mus Mundus 2009\u201313), with broad consensus across the political spectrum. It would support the mobility of students, assure a regional balance in participation, promote language skills and gender equality and expand the programme to the doc- toral level. Members paid particular attention to the problem of visas, stressing the need for lower fees and the ease of the administrative burden. Mr Figel', Member of the Commission, thanked the House for having reached a compromise at first reading. Likewise Parliament endorsed at first reading the report on the establishment of a multiannual Community programme on protecting children using the Internet and other communication tech- nologies, which would enable its adoption at first reading. Mrs Reding, Member of the Commis- sion, fully agreed that the creation of a safer online environment should be a priority. She fur- ther called on Member States to ratify the Con- vention on Cyber Crime. The report on the promotion of clean and energy efficient road transport vehicles also received widespread support at first reading. Parliament endorsed, by and large, the Commission\u2019s com- prehensive new strategy to enable the Union to reach its 120 g/km objective for CO 2 emissions from new passenger cars by 2012. Also at first reading, the House adopted by a large majority the reports on civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles (codified ver- sion), simple pressure vessels (codified version), supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products (codified version), safety rules and stan- dards for passenger ships (recast), genetically modified micro-organisms (recast version), sta- tistical returns in respect of carriage of goods and passengers by sea (recast) and Community sta- tistics on trade between Member States. Under consultation, Parliament adopted the report on applicable law in matrimonial matters and, fol- lowing an oral question, further discussed the eventual possible launch of \u2018enhanced coopera- tion\u2019 in this area. The House decided to exclude the possibility of using legislation which would not recognise separation or divorce or do so in a form which would be discriminatory as regards one of the spouses. Parliament also approved the possibility of changing or selecting jurisdiction. The law applicable chosen by the spouses should be in conformity with the EU fundamental rights as enshrined in the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights as well as with the principle ",
        "Council Bull. EU 10-2008 155 of public policy. Vice-President Barrot agreed with the need for legislation in this field. Also under consultation, the House adopted the reports on the recovery of cod stocks, Parliament advo- cating an outright ban on discards, and the man- agement of fishing fleets registered in the Com- munity\u2019s outermost regions. Also under consultation and without debate, the House carried the reports on application of the protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the EC Treaty (codified version), cer- tain categories of agreements and concerted prac- tices in the air transport sector (codified version), the system of the Communities\u2019 own resources, the framework decision on obtaining proof in criminal proceedings, the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the Euro- pean Community and New Zealand and cooper- ation between the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the European Community regarding security audits/inspections and related matters. Council 2893rd meeting 1.38.4. Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (Luxembourg, 2 October). Previous meeting: Bull. 6-2008, point 1.38.8 President: Mr Bertrand, Minister for Labour, Social Relations, the Family and Solidarity of France. Commission: Mr S pidla. The Council held an initial policy debate on a draft directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment outside the area of employment. It agreed on partial general approaches on two draft regulations concerning the coordination of social security systems and adopted a decision designating 2010 as the European Year for Com- bating Poverty and Social Exclusion. The Council took note of an interim report on the mission for flexicurity. 2894th meeting 1.38.5. Economic and Financial Affairs (Luxembourg, 7 October). Previous meeting: Bull. 7/8-2008, point 1.38.6 President: Ms Lagarde, Minister for Economic Affairs, Industry and Employment of France. Commission: Mrs Kroes, Mr Almunia, Mr K\u00f3vacs and Mr McCreevy. The Council agreed on a coordinated approach in response to the financial crisis. Looking ahead to the European Council meeting on 15 and 16 October, it adopted conclusions offering immediate responses to the financial tur- moil; these conclusions relate in particular to sup- port for systemic financial institutions and the definition of common principles for action. The common principles are the following: support must in principle be temporary; the Member States will be watchful regarding the interests of taxpayers; existing shareholders should bear the due consequences of the intervention; govern- ments should be in a position to bring about a change of management; management should not retain undue benefits; governments may have inter alia the power to intervene in remuneration; the legitimate interests of competitors must be protected, in particular through the State aids rules; negative spillover effects must be avoided. The Council urged the Commission to amend without delay certain accounting rules applicable to banks. The Member States agreed to move towards raising guarantees on deposits to a min- imum of EUR 50 000, since a number of Mem- ber States have now provided for more than this. The Council also noted that present rules (State aids or Stability and Growth Pact) are flexible enough to take account of the exceptional cir- cumstances obtaining in Europe. Furthermore, with a view to the European Coun- cil, the Council adopted three sets of conclusions on the economic slowdown, on financial stability and financial supervision, and on executive pay. The Presidency submitted to the Council a report drawn up in cooperation with the Commission on the response to the volatility of oil prices. This ",
        "Council 156 Bull. EU 10-2008 report will also be transmitted to the European Council. The Council agreed to leave its meeting open until 15 October to allow it to react at any time to developments in the financial situation. In addition, it approved measures to combat VAT fraud, to facilitate exchange of information between Member States\u2019 tax authorities on oper- ators suspected of fraud: the Eurofisc project. 2895th meeting 1.38.6. Transport, Telecommunications and Energy (Luxembourg, 9 and 10 October).

Commission: Mr Tajani, Vice-President, and Mr Piebalgs. In the field of transport, the Council reached political agreement on two legislative proposals forming part of the third maritime safety pack- age: flag State requirements and civil liability of shipowners in respect of maritime claims. It adopted a decision on a negotiating mandate for the Commission with a view to the conclu- sion of a Euro-Mediterranean agreement with Lebanon in the field of aviation. The Council also adopted a resolution on the launch of the development phase of the SESAR programme and conclusions on the inclusion of the aviation sector in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading. With regard to energy, the Council reached a polit- ical agreement on the package of legislative pro- posals concerning the internal energy market and has also adopted conclusions on energy efficiency. 2896th meeting 1.38.7. General Affairs (Luxembourg, 13 October). Previous meeting: Bull. 9-2008, point 1.38.4 President: Mr Kouchner, Minister for Foreign and European Affairs of France. Commission: Ms Ferrero-Waldner. Council: Mr Solana, Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP. The Council adopted conclusions welcoming the increase in the pace of its relations with the Republic of Moldova, stating that the EU was ready to have a deeper relationship in the frame- work of the European neighbourhood policy and to negotiate a new and ambitious agreement with Moldova soon. This agreement, which will go beyond the current partnership and cooperation agreement, and which will include the aim of a free trade area, will aim gradually to bring the Republic of Moldova and the EU closer together. The pace and quality of reforms in Moldova will continue to affect the nature of its relations with the EU. The Council also agreed to establish a strategic partnership with Mexico, which will enable the parties jointly to promote their values and com- mon interests on the world stage. This strategic partnership will aim to strengthen cooperation between the EU and Mexico on crisis situations and global challenges, and to give renewed impe- tus to cooperation in many areas. 2897th meeting 1.38.8. External Relations (Luxembourg, 13 October). Previous meeting: Bull. 9-2008, point 1.38.5 President: Mr Kouchner, Minister for Foreign and European Affairs of France. Commission: Ms Ferrero-Waldner. Council: Mr Solana, Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP. The Council noted that, following the deployment by the EU of a civilian observer mission in Geor- gia, Russian troops had withdrawn from the zones adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. ",
        "Council Bull. EU 10-2008 157 This was an additional step in the implementa- tion of the agreements of 12 August and 8 Sep- tember, which were concluded with the media- tion of the European Union following the conflict last summer. The Council reaffirmed the willingness of the EU to take an active part in the international discus- sions on Georgia, which are set to commence on 15 October in Geneva under the auspices of the EU, the UN and the OSCE. These discussions must focus on all the remaining problems, in par- ticular that concerning arrangements for security and stability in the region and the urgent ques- tion of displaced persons. The Council further noted that some progress had been made, compared with previous elections, during the recent electoral campaign in Belarus, even though the parliamentary elections held on 28 September failed to meet the democratic cri- teria of the OSCE. In this context, it hoped for gradual re-engagement with this country and decided to restore the contacts which it had restricted in November 2004. A meeting between the Council troika and the Belarusian Minister for Foreign Affairs took place in the margins of the meeting. Moreover, in order to encourage dialogue with the Belarusian authorities and the adoption of measures to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights, the Council decided that the travel restrictions currently imposed on certain leading figures would not apply for a period of six months, which may be reviewed. At the end of that period, the Council will reconsider the situ- ation in the light of the progress made by the Belarusian authorities. In the case of Uzbekistan, the Council welcomed the progress achieved in the last year with regard to respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights, while remaining concerned about the situation in some domains. It called on the Uzbek authorities to fulfil all their obligations in this respect and is prepared to assist Uzbek- istan in its reforming efforts. In this context, it decided not to renew the travel restrictions apply- ing to certain individuals, which had been sus- pended in October 2007 and April 2008, but would be renewing the arms embargo for a period of 12 months. An Association Council with Morocco took place in the margins of the Council, focusing particu- larly on the question of according an \u2018advanced status\u2019 to bilateral relations in the framework of the EU\u2019s neighbourhood policy. 2898th meeting 1.38.9.

Previous meeting: Bull. 6-2008, point 1.38.6 President: Mr Borloo, Minister of State, for Ecol- ogy, Energy, Sustainable Development and Town and Country Planning of France. Commission: Mr Dimas. The Council discussed the main aspects of the climate-energy legislative package and held a dis- cussion on genetically modified organisms. It adopted conclusions with a view to the negoti- ations under the United Nations Framework Con- vention on Climate Change, to be held in Pozna n (Poland) in December 2008 and a directive estab- lishing a new framework for waste management. 2899th meeting 1.38.10.

EU 10-2008 It also reviewed progress on a proposal for estab- lishing a passenger name record (PNR) system which would enable air carriers to collect per- sonal data when passengers book their trip. As regards justice items, the Council reached agreement on rules which will enable decisions on maintenance obligations given by a Member State to circulate freely in the other Member States. It also agreed on a decision providing for the establishment of a European criminal records information system (ECRIS). Lastly, the Council adopted a directive on the pro- tection of the environment through criminal law and a directive which includes aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community. 2900th meeting 1.38.11. Agriculture and Fisheries (Luxembourg, 27 and 28 October). Previous meeting: Bull. 9-2008, point 1.38.8 President: Mr Barnier, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of France. Commission: Ms Fischer Boel and Mr Borg. The Council reached political agreement on three major draft regulations relating to the fisheries sector: \u00a1 the TACs for the Baltic Sea in 2009, and certain associated measures; \u00a1 the TACs for deep water species in 2009 and 2010; \u00a1 the TACs for turbot and sprat in the Black Sea for 2009. It also gave its political agreement to the position to be adopted by the Community in the ICCAT, in particular concerning the bluefin tuna stock. The Council continued to work on a proposal to distribute fruit and vegetables in schools and on the \u2018health check\u2019 of the common agricultural policy, with a view to reaching agreement by the end of the year.

European Economic and Social Committee 448th plenary session 1.38.17. The European Economic and Social Com- mittee held its 448th plenary session on 22 and 23 October, chaired by Mr Sepi (Employees Group), who was elected President, taking over from Mr Dimitriadis for the 2008\u201310 term. Mrs Pari (Employers Group) and Mr Kallio (Vari- ous Interests Group) were elected Vice-Presidents. In his inaugural speech, underpinned by a new focus on the future, the President first called for the speedy ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. At a time of change within the European institu- tions, he stressed the advisory role of the Com- mittee, making full use of the popular right of ini- tiative and putting into practice the requirement to consult and inform civil society. He also expressed his intention to build more structured relationships with the European Parliament and the Council, along the lines of the protocol with the Commission, and improve cooperation with the Committee of the Regions and national par- liaments. In this time of crisis, the Committee should insist on its role and ambition to become a bridge between Europe and civil society, thus bridging the gap between citizens and institu- tions. In this context, the President intends to hold a conference to bring together banks, industry and civil society. The President\u2019s programme will tackle three priorities: \u00a1 the Lisbon Treaty and the question of partic- ipatory democracy, which must be translated into legislation. The Committee should also insist on the application of the Charter of Rights contained in the Treaty, and its role in responding to the problems of immigration; \u00a1 the European social model, which not only exists but is also sustainable and working; \u00a1 the Lisbon strategy, which is the most effec- tive response to the challenge of globalisation. It will have to be renewed based on synergy between programmes and coordinated action on economic policy, social progress and respect for the environment. The Community method should ",
        "Committee of the Regions 162 Bull. EU 10-2008 be favoured, with the Committee using the net- work of national committees that it has created. A prerequisite to the President\u2019s priorities is assessing the real impact of European policies. In parallel, the Committee must develop an effec- tive internal and external communication strategy. Mr S pidla, Member of the Commission, took part in the debate on \u2018Rights and solidarity to guide globalisation\u2019. He lent his full support to the pri- orities of the new presidency. He underlined the key role of the Committee and encouraged exploratory opinions. The Committee adopted 32 opinions, including 3 exploratory opinions and 11 initiative opinions. The opinion on the ethical and social dimension of the financial institutions was largely amended in relation to the current crisis. The Committee debated models for global trade and financial relationships. Members regretted the simplistic vision laid out in the amendment and volunteered to work on a more balanced project. Others blamed the advocates of rampant liberalism and market self-regulation, and considered that it was high time for review, with actual supervision of the financial institutions. Regrets were expressed on the gap between the reality of the situation and this opinion, considered it as philosophical and not fit to meet current needs, asking for the opin- ion to be given added strength and postponed. Members suggested preparing a resolution to be adopted in December. Nevertheless, this opinion was adopted by a weak majority. Members debated the \u2018medical check-up\u2019 of the CAP. The adopted opinion, which had a broader outlook than the Commission proposal, called for a more detailed analysis of possible future devel- opments in the dairy market as the current legis- lation on milk quotas is to expire in 2015. The Committee advocated setting up a European milk network in order to bring supply into line with demand. The opinion on the Northern Ireland peace process emphasised the role of the EU, through the PEACE programme, as being unprecedented in history. It recalled that the EU funds helped support the efforts of civil society towards rec- onciliation between communities. The opinion on the EU and the global food chal- lenge was drawn up upon request by the French Presidency. Members agreed such a topic was too challenging for a simple opinion. The information report on development with equity and environmental responsibility met wide approval. Committee of the Regions 76th plenary session 1.38.18. The Committee of the Regions held its 76th session, on 8 and 9 October , in the frame- work of the sixth Open Days, in the presence of numerous local and regional political leaders. The meeting devoted a great deal of attention to polit- ical discussions, charged both with hope and con- cerns. The Committee adopted 15 opinions. Mr Van den Brande, President of the Commit- tee, welcomed Ms Mavrou, Representative of the Greco-Cypriot community in Nicosia, and Mr Cagakan, representative of the Turco-Cypriot Community of the city. He stated that he was par- ticularly proud to be able to receive them together at this historic moment, contributing in this way to a strengthening of mutual confidence. He stressed the importance of the local authorities\u2019 initiatives leading to remarkable results and passed on all the Committee\u2019s solidarity with their efforts. The two Cypriot participants reaffirmed their agreement to work together towards the common aim of peace and cohesion by forgetting the dis- agreements which separated both communities. They also evoked the Committee\u2019s role which helps fill the gap between citizens and institutions. The political groups underlined their mutual obli- gation towards the alignment of the communities and hope that these first steps stimulate a more ambitious development for the future. Ms H\u00fcbner, Member of the Commission, sub- mitted the Green Paper concerning territorial cohesion during the opening session of the Open Days. She stressed that this initiative supported the territorial diversity of the EU as a vital asset ",
        "Committee of the Regions Bull. EU 10-2008 163 and that it was likely to contribute, generally, to the durability of its development, to the access to quality public services for all and to economic growth and employment. Ms H\u00fcbner declared that this initiative, in addition, launched the debate on territorial cohesion as a basis for study for the future of the regional policy post-2013. The result should achieve better comprehension of the diver- sity of the subject and a better evaluation of its implications on the policy implemented. Mr Verheugen, Vice-President of the Commission, commented on the current financial crisis and informed local representatives that regions would probably be the first actors most affected. In the current state of markets, the urgency was to return confidence to citizens to prevent the spread of the problem. According to him, the EU is better armed than other parts of the world in this context: a very developed internal market, which makes it possi- ble to contain dependence in relation to the fluc- tuations of the world markets and which seeks the continuation of enlargement; a single currency in the \u2018euro area\u2019, which encourages stronger dynam- ics than elsewhere; a growth and employment strategy, which is based on mechanisms which make it possible to progress; decisions which should be taken at the next European Council with a view to meeting the needs for better governance. This difficult economic situation has to encourage Europe to act for SMEs, in view of their growth potential to be developed. Mr Verheugen put the emphasis on the importance of reaffirming the objectives laid down, of getting rid of certain obstacles and of connecting the ecological con- straints to the economic objectives. Mr Verheugen recalled that the \u2018Small Business Act\u2019, which envisages numerous instruments, will constitute the basis of the rebuilding of companies, with the aid of the EIB which agrees to put more means in terms of provisions to guarantee the access of SMEs to new outlets. The draft opinion on proposals concerning the CAP, following the \u2018medical check-up\u2019, supports the position of the Commission (to loosen the link between direct subsidies and production lev- els more in order to allow producers better access to markets) while stressing a careful approach which makes it possible to avoid volatile markets and which take account of regional differences and production systems. Producers do not have to make the payments of the aid reform of the CAP, and the rapporteur proposes an annual increase in the quota of 2%. As regards the com- plexity of the matter, and considering that the amended text would make it possible to ensure a better level of durability, the rapporteur invited the Committee to adopt a common front in order to give a clear message with respect to the posi- tion of the Commission. The debate demonstrated the disparity of the positions and the divergences in regional inter- ests. It resulted in a high number of amendments. Some members commented on the annual increase in the quotas, on the importance given to the regions and on the new correlations between market prices and milk quotas. Members were alerted to the risk of depletion of a rare resource. According to them, the CAP does not have the role to support territorial cohesion pacts inside the ERDF. Finally, the amended report was adopted. The partnership as regards governance and plan- ning of projects in the field of regional policy gave the Committee the opportunity to reaffirm that the current model of governance of the structural policy constitutes a good base to determine its future orientation. The Committee points out that in the absence of methodology common to the whole of Europe regarding recourse to partnerships (to draw up, carry out, follow and evaluate the programming documents and planning on regional planning), it is not pos- sible to evaluate if a partnership were really incorporated into the step nor to see what the genuine impact was. The opinion drawn up on the exchange of emis- sion quotas had the role of influencing the result of the current co-decision procedure. It therefore has a strong political connotation: whilst wanting to support a sustainable economy, it wants also to protect the competitiveness of industry (SME) as well as the interests of consumers, by introducing new actors (including the transport sector) into the system of exchange of quotas. Some participants decided against the Commis- sion proposal by stressing that the reduction in the incomes of companies could well involve them also reducing their investments in innova- tion and in environmental protective measures. According to the speakers, the measures proposed ",
        "Committee of the Regions 164 Bull. EU 10-2008 by the Commission are likely to involve signifi- cant deterioration in employment and it is espe- cially important to defend the competitive posi- tion of the European policy. Following the withdrawal of some amendments, the project was adopted. During the discussions, the opinion on industrial emissions was approved, without amendments. The Committee supports without reservation the prevention of pollution and the \u2018polluter-payer\u2019 principle; consequently, it favourably welcomed the objective of the directive on industrial emis- sions. The directive on this subject constitutes an important measure to make it possible for Mem- ber States to achieve their objectives as regards reduction of emissions between now and 2020, but the Committee considers that as regards air pollution, the directive is not ambitious enough. The opinion on the promotion of energy use pro- duced from renewable sources was the subject of several amendments due to various forums, in particular in Parliament, where the project was discussed. The final version takes account of the results of all these discussions. The Committee approved the opinion at a Euro- pean action level for job mobility (2007\u201310). It provided strong support for the position of the Commission. It stresses that \u2018mobility\u2019 has to be included and promoted as much in terms of geo- graphical mobility (within the Member States and among themselves) as in terms of economic and social mobility or of mobility in the labour mar- ket. Lastly, the Committee argued for the removal of all the legal and administrative obstacles to freedom of movement of the labour force by the end of the action plan, in 2011, including for the new Member States (Bulgaria and Romania). In the field of foreign affairs, an opinion on a strong European neighbourhood policy was also approved. The Committee reaffirmed here its conviction according to which a prosperous and secure neighbourhood necessarily involves an effective cooperation at the local and regional level; consequently it calls on the countries con- cerned with the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) to give a favourable response to interna- tional observers who are responsible for follow- ing their elections, in order to strengthen the transparency of the electoral process and so improve the degree of citizens\u2019 confidence in the democratic processes. The opinion on the Barcelona process: \u2018A union for the Mediterranean\u2019 favourably welcomed certain measures and initiatives that this process has so far generated; nevertheless, it regrets the lack of significant projections in the field of peace, security, human and social development, and the lack of involvement of local and regional authorities. In the field of education to the media, the Com- mission communication on the online creative contents received a favourable reception. On this basis, the Committee supports the priorities and the objectives laid down by the Commission on the matter and underlines precisely that education to the media involves citizens\u2019 support for active and creative use of the media (and especially regarding the young generation), the support of citizens\u2019 critical approach with regard to all media, the promotion of diversity of points of view in the media and the contribution to the dis- cussion relating to commercial notices and to questions related to respect and on the protection of privacy. Still in the same field, the opinion on a pro- gramme for a safer Internet proposes a whole series of amendments to the Commission pro- posal: to better advertise direct lines (hotlines) to end-users and to benefit from the possibilities of dissemination of essential information from local authorities. It also suggests, on the one hand, intensifying cooperation between direct lines, repressive services and Internet service providers and, on the other hand, involving other actors such as suitable social organisms and NGOs. Lastly, it recommends that programmes of com- puter teaching and of education to the media also attach an appropriate importance to a secure online environment and makes clear the dangers of illicit contents and prejudicial behaviour. In the opinion on citizens\u2019 rights: \u2018promotion of the fundamental rights and of the rights deriving from European citizenship\u2019 the Committee observed that the European model of protection of fundamental rights, such as arising in particular from the Charter, appears among the most advanced because it includes civil and political laws and economic, social and cultural rights.
