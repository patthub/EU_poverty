Carlos Moedas Dear Reader, In 2015, the 14 th Association Agreement to Horizon 2020 was concluded and several co-funding mechanisms were established. In the Horizon 2020 work programme for 2016-2017, there is an increase of 25% in the number of topics targeting international cooperation. We hope that all these facts will facilitate and encourage the participation of non-EU entities in H2020. Demonstrating the vitality of EU cooperation with all regions of the world, around 20 Joint Committee Meetings were held and several implementing arrangements were signed and will allow for future enhanced cooperation, towards a Global Research Area. In the meantime, the Evaluation Report on FP7 was just delivered to the European Commission. These and other highlights of the year can be found in this special issue of our International Research Newsletter. Let us also profit from this occasion to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy 2016! Best regards, The Editors ",

The Commissioner encouraged the audience, made up of leaders from academia, research institutions and companies, to use their voices to explain to policy makers that the only way to create the conditions for society to progress is by enhancing economic productivity through innovation. The Commissioner\u2019s speech focused on the 3 O\u2019s strategy: open science, open innovation and open to the world and the EU-Brazil strategic partnership. Recently, FAPESP has set up a special mechanism to increase cooperation with the European Union through H2020. Researchers affiliated with universities and research institutions in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo may avail of support offered by the Foundation to fund their participation in Horizon 2020 projects. On the Brazilian side, FAPESP is also funding, along with the National Council of Research Support Foundations (Confap) and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI), a coordinated call for research in advanced biofuels in cooperation with the European Commission..

The event was organized by the Centre for Strategic Studies (CGEE) to compare and discuss EU and Brazilian initiatives for sustainable urbanization. After the welcome speeches of the President of CNPq and the President of CGEE, Birgit de Boissezon, representing the Commission, introduced the EU R&I agenda for re-naturing cities and new opportunities for Brazilian partners in H2020, notably in large demonstration projects on cities. Successful past and ongoing EU-Brazil research projects in the field of environment, climate change and transition to sustainability were then presented by European and Brazilian experts. The agenda also included Brazilian speakers from the Ministries for Science, Technology and Innovation, for Environment, for Cities, and from successful Brazilian urban initiatives, such as the Platform for Sustainable Cities and the Porto Digital for Recife. About 70 representatives from Brazilian ministries, cities, universities and civil society organizations attended the main plenary and around 100 people followed the event via web streaming. The seminar was an important opportunity to present to the Brazilian audience the ongoing EU-Brazil Sector Dialogue on \u2018Nature-based solutions for sustainable cities\u2019 run by the Commission/RTD and the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. It was also the first milestone of that dialogue, which will be followed by further joint workshops, a study tour in Europe and other activities to enhance mutual learning and sharing of knowledge and experience in the field of sustainable urbanisation.

        "3 I S S U E 6 2 | D E C E M B E R 2 0 1 5 Research and Innovation EU-Brazil coordinated call on advanced biofuels in the Energy WP2016-17 The European Commission actively supports research and development in technologies that lead to the beneficial use of biomass resources for the production of biofuels. An important impetus for this is the Renewable Energy Directive of 2009, notably its binding target of 10% renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020. Worldwide, biofuels represent 5% of renewable energy. The United States of America is the world leader in biofuels production having a 46% share, while together Europe and Brazil produce 44% of biofuels of almost equal parts. EU is the worldwide leader in biodiesel production with a market share of 60%, while the United States and Brazil dominate in bioethanol production with a combined market share of 85%. The world market for biofuels is expecting a rise in global biofuel production, accounting for 3.9% of global oil demand for road transport in 2018. The EU 2050 Energy roadmap foresees an increase in biofuels consumption in EU transport of up to 3 times by 2050. However, the development and deployment of biofuels is interconnected with the growing demand for food, feed and fibre and their expansion must therefore be sustainable. Competition for land and for raw material with other biomass uses must be carefully managed. Further technological innovation is needed for more efficient and cleaner conversion of a more diverse range of feedstock as biofuels must compete with other energy sources and options. In October 2015 the European Commission launched a coordinated call with Brazil which aims to exploit synergies between Brazil and Europe in scientific expertise and resources on advanced biofuels. By means of coordinated projects, the collaboration will advance research and innovation in specific areas, such as production of advanced liquid biofuel and aviation fuel from bagasse, feedstock diversification and logistics of biomass production, fermentation and separation processes for advanced biofuels, and process energy efficiency. The collaboration excludes biofuels produced from starch, sugar and oil fractions of food and feed crops as the European Commission no longer supports research and innovation for these so-called \u00abfirst generation\u00bb bio-fuels which are based on food sources such as grains and seeds. Focus is now on advanced biofuels which can be produced from a wider range of biomass sources, like woody material and algae, and which are more environmentally-friendly technologies. Advanced biofuel technologies avoid competition with food, reduce land demand and enlarge the range of biomass feedstock on the basis of non-food resources, like agricultural residues. Through feedstock diversification, we aim to lower feedstock costs, decoupling feedstock from oil prices, enhance energy security and ultimately increase the competitiveness of advanced biofuels with fossil fuels. Brazil, as the largest sugarcane ethanol producer worldwide (a \u00abfirst generation biofuel\u00bb, as it concerns ethanol produced directly from the sugarcane itself), has agreed to start collaboration with the EU on advanced biofuels. Joint work is expected to build upon the Brazilian sugarcane ethanol model, thus benefiting from both the Brazilian and European experience in biofuels. Significant global socio-economic and environmental impacts are expected to result from the collaborative effort. The assessment of these impacts is an essential part of the work and will be based on life-cycle analysis. The coordinated call will strengthen cooperation between key researchers, institutions and industries active in biofuel research in the EU and Brazil. For this purpose, the proposals have to clearly demonstrate how coordination among them will bring the expected added scientific value. To ensure a project implementation that reflects genuine cooperation, proposals must properly embrace coordinated research activities between Europe and Brazil in the research plan of the two coordinated projects. Proposals will be selected on condition that the corresponding coordinated project is also selected for funding. DG RTD is supporting the coordinated call with a total contribution of EUR 5 million. A balanced effort between Europe and Brazil vis-\u00e0-vis the two coordinated projects is expected. On the Brazilian side the call is managed by Sao Paolo Research Foundation (FAPESP) on behalf of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, and the Brazilian National Council of State Research and Innovation Support Foundation (CONFAP). FAPESP is a public foundation located in Sao Paolo with the aim of providing grants, funds and programs to support research, education and innovation in public and private institutions and companies in the state of Sao Paolo. CONFAP is a non-profit organisation set up to articulate the interests of Brazilian state research and innovation support foundations among other goals. On both sides, the participation of industry through co-funding of the research is highly desirable. International collaboration between the EU and Brazil in advanced biofuels represents an opening of EU Research and Innovation to the world with the potential to strengthen the economies of both sides and contribute to the development of their respective markets as regards sustainable energy production.

The objective of the event was to develop common expertise and scientific knowledge on the Atlantic Ocean and its dynamic systems, to discuss how to further engage in joint research projects, to improve reciprocal access to infrastructures, and to provide a new momentum for enhancing marine cooperation between Brazil and Europe. In his speech, Commissioner Moedas spoke about the EU and Brazil as a partnership in the Blue Enlightenment century. \u201cWe are at the beginning of a process of generalization of knowledge about the oceans. At the beginning of the rational integration of this knowledge in our decisions. In other words, we begin to witness what we could call the \u2018Blue Enlightenment\u2019. This is the day where we defined the strategy to exploit this period of \u2018Blue Enlightenment\u2019\u2026 And with it, we draw the future of our common heritage: the South Atlantic Ocean.\u00bb Commissioner Moedas said: \u00abtoday we have launched the first anchor of a new collaboration. But we can go further. This may be the first step in building a broader collaboration: a Research Partnership in the South Atlantic\u00bb. This well attended event included leading scientists, representatives from marine and oceanographic institutes, funding agencies, research performing organisations and industry from Brazil and Europe. It was jointly organised and supported by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of the Federative Republic of Brazil (MCTI), Brazil National Academy of Science and COPPE, the European Commission and the European Delegation to Brazil, as well as by representatives from 7 Member. The High Level Atlantic Ocean Research meeting was preceded by a meeting at FENACAM&LACQUA\u201915 in Fortaleza. This meeting, organised in conjunction with the World Aquaculture Society (WAS), is the main South American event on aquaculture. It included a session on Brazil-EU multi-stakeholder interaction in aquaculture, where European Commission representatives presented Horizon 2020 and the opportunities available for aquaculture related research. Brazilian participants to this session were particularly interested in setting up a platform similar to the existing European Aquaculture Technology and Innovation Platform (EATIP) model. In addition, The Brazilian Agricultural Research Cooperation (EMBRAPA) are planning to inaugurate an institute dedicated to aquaculture and fisheries in April 2016. Both events raised high expectations and have further strengthened the EU-Brazil partnership. In 2016 a series of follow-up workshops will be organised both in Europe and Brazil.

How can this discrepancy be explained? Mark Graham, Associate Professor and Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute and ERC grantee presented the results of his research on the digital gap between the developed and developing countries in his lecture at Tartu University (EuroCollege), Estonia, on 9 November 2015. The event took place in the framework of European Year for Development and was part of the Kapuscinski Development Lectures -organised by European Commission\u2019s DG DEVCO and UNDP- which aim to raise awareness over development issues, such as climate change, human rights and Millennium Development Goals. This very specific lecture was the only one that highlighted the transformative and enabling role of Science, Research and Innovation in and for development. The International Cooperation Directorate of DG RTD opened the lecture at the historical University of Tartu in Estonia, reflecting on opportunities for a reinforced international cooperation between research and innovation and development which aims to provide solutions in the Sustainable Development Goals era, where new geometries and partnerships can reinforce Europe\u2019s role as a global actor. The speaker\u2019s research findings reveal unevenness in the production, distribution and access to knowledge. For example, a simple navigation in web applications like Google Maps or Panoramio shows a highly concentrated geography of information in and about certain regions of the Northern hemisphere. As it was further argued, this becomes even more apparent in Wikipedia articles, the content of which tends to be quite Eurocentric. Why does this unevenness take place? A first explanation points to the geographies of internet infrastructure, meaning that some regions of the world are more connected than others. However, as the speaker emphasised, \u00abthe narrative of connectivity is not really what we are looking for\u00bb. The impacts of post-colonial modes of informational governance, cases of explicit and implicit censorship, the gender and class constraints to access or production of knowledge and the availability or absence of a broader information ecosystem of geographic content could also help us interpret this uneven geography of information. Finally, as the speaker underlined, we should keep in mind that internet can serve as a vehicle through which imbalances and other inequalities are perpetuated. Therefore, \u00abwe need to constantly ask who is left behind and why, and develop platforms and systems to accommodate everyone in the information wire\u00bb.

This meeting was a follow up to the visit of Commissioner Moedas to Brazil of 16-17 November. The National Council for Research Support Foundations (CONFAP), the Research Foundation of S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP), of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), of Goias (FAPEG), of Santa Caterina (FAPESC) and of Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG). The main focus on the meeting was on how to strengthen research cooperation between the EU and Brazilian states under Horizon 2020. This follows the recent adoption by FAPESP of a set of guidelines to facilitate participation of Brazilian Researchers in collaborative projects funded by Horizon 2020. Other research agencies and CONFAP are interested in following a similar path and the meeting provided a very useful opportunity to discuss how to move forward in this process, taking into account the priorities and institutional specificities of each individual agency. .

The conference was organised by DG RTD in cooperation with DG GROW and DG NEAR. The meeting, which marked the 20 th anniversary of the Barcelona process, gathered more than 70 participants, including representatives from the Southern Mediterranean countries, EU Member States, the European Commission, UNIDO, academic institutions such as UNIMED and EMUNI, coordinators of industrial projects such as the Small Business Act and the R2I, as well as market stakeholders from ANIMA, Berytech-Lebanon, the MENA Business Angels Network and others. The speakers analysed the ongoing steps towards a Common Mediterranean Research and Innovation Agenda, by presenting and assessing the impact of ongoing projects in this field, like PACEIM, BLUMED, ERANETMED and the 5+5 STI GSO initiative. The participants also proposed ways to reduce the gap between research, innovation and the market; in this regard, special emphasis was put on aligning research objectives with socio- economic needs as well as on fostering ties between academia, business and industry. It is estimated that around 1,000,000 highly-skilled people originating from the MENA region live and work in the EU. In this context, the need to improve the institutional and regulatory framework which will facilitate the process of recruitment was also highlighted. Attention was also drawn to the opportunities for funding excellence and innovation through EU programmes such as COSME, as well as the increasing participation of the private sector in supporting the implementation of innovative entrepreneurial ideas. To this end, the EC reiterated its commitment to continue supporting its South Mediterranean partners in the development of a vibrant private sector able to expand its investments, innovate and create value-added-jobs.

FP7 ran from 2007 to 2013 and was structured around four Specific Programmes supporting transnational collaborative research, investigator-driven research, career development of individual researchers, as well as training and mobility, and enhancement of research capacities in Europe. The High Level Group looked at the achievements and impacts of the full range of actions financed by FP7. While the central focus of the report is on evaluating FP7, it also contains recommendations that were integrated into the current Horizon 2020 programme and will serve as a bridge to the mid-term evaluation of Horizon 2020 which is due by the end of 2017. The Commission has already applied many of these recommendations, and is pursuing them further, as seen for example in the continued strong focus of Horizon 2020 on tackling societal challenges and increasing the participation of industry and SMEs in particular. In line with its firm commitment to transparency, the Commission has already made the HLEG report public. It will formally communicate the conclusions of this report, accompanied by the Commission\u2019s observations, to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions in the form of a dedicated Communication foreseen for January 2016. Rigorous evaluation is essential in assessing how European investment in research and innovation is contributing to economic growth and job creation, as well as to our efforts to tackle major societal challenges.

The first workshop on \u00abElectrical Technologies for the Aviation of the Future\u00bb gathered 180 experts from both sides on 26 - 27 March 2015 at the EU Delegation in Tokyo. Coordinated calls with Canada, China and Japan in aviation research were conducted in 2015 and led to the selection of 11 projects expected to start in early 2016. Technology topics of mutual interest had been identified by joint expert panels and endorsed by Europe\u2019s aviation stakeholders. 16 million \u20ac were earmarked for European partners allowing funding for at least three successful projects with each third country. With Canada it was the first coordinated call, while coordinated calls with China and Japan already in FP7 led to five successful projects accomplished until 2015, in relation to safety, high-speed air transport, eco-engines, numerical modelling and Titanium green manufacturing. Another highlight of 2015 was the international flight test campaign of the FP7 project HAIC \u00abHigh Altitude Ice Crystals\u00bb, led by Airbus with 39 participants from EU, USA, Canada, Australia, Russia and Turkey. In May 2015 three fully-equipped test aircraft of CNRS (France), NRC (Canada) and Honeywell-FAA-NASA (USA) jointly chased safety-critical clouds over French Guyana and the South Atlantic every day. Precious and precise data were collected for research, aviation authorities and standardisation bodies. The first HIAC campaign had taken place in Australia in 2014 and the final campaign is scheduled for January 2016 in Indonesia. On 5-8 May 2015, the EU-China support action GRAIN2 successfully held its 2nd Open Workshop \u2018Greening Aviation \u2013 A Global Challenge\u2019 in Xi`an City, China. GRAIN 2 is jointly supported by FP7 and China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Rudolf Strohmeier, Deputy Director General of DG RTD, and Mr. MAO Weiming, Vice Minister of MIIT addressed the more than 100 experts from Europe and China.

        "9 I S S U E 6 2 | D E C E M B E R 2 0 1 5 Research and Innovation The ERC\u2019s mission ever since its establishment in 2007 has been to stimulate scientific excellence in Europe by funding the very best creative researchers of any nationality and age, and supporting their innovative ideas. This implies not only nurturing the best European research talent but also increasing brain circulation and attracting talent from the rest of the world. In 2012, the ERC launched a new initiative to boost opportunities for top scientists who are supported by foreign research funding agencies to come to Europe and join an ERC-funded team for a period between 6 and 12 months. This initiative comes in the form of Implementing Arrangements between the European Commission and a non-European research funding agency setting the framework for these visits. This opportunity helps the visiting scientist to benefit from the first-class research environment of the ERC projects. On the other hand, ERC teams get enriched with novel research methods and ideas by talented scientists trained in other research environments. As the ERC President, Prof. Jean-Pierre Bourguignon said: \u201cThe cross-fertilisation of ideas and knowledge exchange are key to progress and inherent to first-rate science.\u00bb The first initiative of this kind was signed in July 2012 with the US (National Science Foundation, NSF). So far, the ERC has seven Implementing Arrangements with the following non-European funding agencies: \u2022 National Science Foundation of the United States; (July 2012) \u2022 Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning of the Republic of Korea; (November 2013) \u2022 Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation of Argentina; (March 2015) \u2022 Society for the Promotion of Science of Japan; (May 2015) \u2022 National Natural Science Foundation of the People\u2019s Republic of China (June 2015); \u2022 National Research Foundation of the Republic of South Africa (October 2015); \u2022 National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (November 2015). Even though the conditions for this short-term brain circulation are set specifically in each Implementing Arrangement, they all follow a similar approach, i.e. the costs are shared with the non-European Agency and the ERC grantee through the already running grant. The details of each arrangement are available on the ERC website. Researchers themselves are in the driving seat when it comes to the selection procedure for the research visit. ERC is involved only to the extent that it collects the expressions of interest from its grantees once a year and submits this information to the partner funding Agencies. For 2015 there are 535 ERC grantees willing to host a researcher from one of the abovementioned countries.

Keynote speakers at these events were Commissioner Carlos Modeas (Sao Paulo), Jean Pierre Bourguignon, President of the European Research Council (Boston) and Wolfgang Burcher, Deputy Director-General of DG RTD (San Jose). Throughout the year, and in varying geometries, 17 Member States/Associated Countries, the Joint Research Centre and the European Institute of Technology were able to take advantage of the events to promote the opportunities they offer to researchers from all over the world. Several countries took part for the first time. In addition, the European Research Council and Marie Sklodowska Curie Actions were presented at each event \u2013 as were the support services offered by Euraxess. The events attracted some 700 participants \u2013 who took away a very positive image of the vibrant and attractive European research landscape and new ideas for the next steps in their careers. Information on all events is available at the Destination Europe Website.

        "10 I S S U E 6 2 | D E C E M B E R 2 0 1 5 Research and Innovation A pivotal year in EU-Latin America Cooperation in Research & Innovation 2015 was a pivotal year for EU- Latin America relations in Research and Innovation. In the dialogues with Latin America, R&I cooperation proved increasingly to be an important tool for science diplomacy and openness to the world. The region emerged as a key priority for Commissioner Moedas and this was confirmed by his visit to Mexico and Brazil in November 2015. Important progress was achieved at policy and operational level both bi-regionally and bilaterally with key Latin American countries. In Brazil, 2015 was a year of major changes with direct implications for the Science and Technology portfolio, with three different STI Ministers and a significant budget cut that put the Science without Borders programme on hold. Against this background, in 2015 dialogue and cooperation in Research & Innovation between the EU and Brazil continued to progress. Particular emphasis was put on strengthening cooperation between the EU and the federal states of Brazil. In this respect, very promising cooperation has been established with the National Council of Research Foundations (CONFAP) and the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) aiming at increasing collaboration under Horizon 2020. Guidelines have been agreed with FAPESP to promote the State\u2019s researchers funding in the Horizon 2020 programme. A coordinated call on advanced biofuels has been launched together with the FAPESP, CONFAP and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). In November, the visit of Commissioner Carlos Moedas to Brazil boosted EU-Brazil scientific cooperation and a Joint Declaration of Intent was signed with the MCTI to promote marine research cooperation in the South Atlantic. The possibility of joining the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) and the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Diseases Preparedness (GLOPID-r) was also discussed with these agencies along with their participation into the Belmont Forum besides FAPESP who will co-chair it with the Commission (RTD-I) in 2016. The momentum of EU-Mexico research cooperation increased in 2015 with the visit of Commissioner Moedas to Mexico in November 2015. Already in July 2015, in their Joint Declaration after the Mexico- EU Summit, leaders decided to update the EU-Mexico bilateral legal framework and to strengthen research & innovation capacities, in particular in the following areas: ICT, renewable energies, health and marine/maritime research. Also, a challenge was identified to incorporate enterprises in exchange activities in this field, in order to strengthen the link between innovation and competitiveness and employment. The first coordinated call between the EU and Mexico on geothermal energy was published in October in the Horizon 2020 work programme for 2016- 2017, with a total budget of \u20ac20 million with each side contributing equally. This call is expected to bring important benefits which range from accelerated technology development and increased knowledge & expertise to enhanced risk reduction. An arrangement was signed in November between Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) and the ERC to allow Mexico\u2019s researchers to join ERC-led research teams in Europe. In the field of health research, Mexico joined the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) and the Global Research Collaboration on Infectious Diseases Preparedness (GloPID-R). Conacyt is considering joining the Belmont Forum in 2016 and a possible arrangement between the Joint Research Centre and the Mexican National Centre for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED) enhancing cooperation on disaster risk reduction, EU reference labs and energy. Argentina was another Latin American country with which research cooperation significantly increased. As with Mexico, an arrangement to facilitate the participation of Argentinian researchers in ERC grant schemes was signed in March 2015. In the course of 2015, Argentina joined both the GACD and GLOPID-r and continued to play an active role in EU-CELAC bi-regional cooperation. Cooperation with CELAC also increased in 2015. At the EU-CELAC Summit of June 2015 in Brussels, Research & Innovation were re-confirmed as a core element and a success factor of the overall EU- CELAC partnership. The Summit called for strengthened cooperation and launched the idea of moving towards an EU-CELAC Common Research Area. The CRA was designed to focus on a) more thematic cooperation; b) improved access to research infrastructures and c) increased mobility of researchers. The science and technology Ministers of CELAC endorsed this design in the Ministerial meeting of 16 September in Quito, where the Commission (Director Maria Cristina Russo, RTD C) presented the concept of the Common Research Area and the possible way forward. The next Senior Official Meeting of the Joint Initiative for Research and Innovation in early 2016 will look at how the CRA can be implemented.

        "11 I S S U E 6 2 | D E C E M B E R 2 0 1 5 Research and Innovation EU-China Cooperation in Research & Innovation In 2015 the EU and China, celebrating the 40 th anniversary of bilateral relations, strengthened their cooperation in research and innovation through a series of high level policy dialogues and the launch of new joint initiatives. Research and innovation were confirmed as fundamental policy components of overall EU-China relations at the 17 th EU- China Summit and the 2nd Innovation Cooperation Dialogue (ICD) in June in Brussels co-chaired by Commissioner Carlos Moedas and Chinese Minister for Science and Technology Mr Wan Gang. At the Summit, leaders reaffirmed the importance of cooperation in the area of research and innovation as a driver for economic and social development and a key element of EU-China relations. Three R&I related documents were signed at the Summit: \u2022 A Joint Statement on the Renewal of the EU-China Science and Technology Agreement; \u2022 An Implementing Arrangement between the European Research Council and the National Natural Science Foundation of China on frontier research; \u2022 A collaborative research arrangement between the European Commission Joint Research Centre and the Chinese Academy of Science Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth. In addition, the leaders committed to ensuring reciprocal access to their respective R&I funding programmes, as well as to setting up a new Co-Funding Mechanism (CFM) based on Horizon 2020 on the EU side and relevant R&I funding programmes on the Chinese side to support joint R&I projects in strategic areas of common interest. From 6-11 September Commissioner Moedas visited China accompanied by Jean-Pierre Bourguignon, President of the European Research Council, to co- chair the Annual Meeting of the New Champions (Summer Davos Conference) in Dalian. Bilateral talks with China\u2019s Minister for Science and Technology Wan Gang in Beijing, and with Vice Premier Liu Yandong in Brussels allowed further progress on the size and scope of the Co-Funding Mechanism (CFM). Over the five-year period from 2016 till 2020 the European Commission expects to continue spending over 100 million Euros per year for the benefit of Europe-based entities in joint projects under H2020 with Chinese participants. China will match corresponding resources and expects to spend 200 million RMB per year through the CFM to fund China-based entities that will participate in projects under Horizon 2020. Another important milestone of EU-China R&I cooperation in 2015 was the 12 th EU-China Joint Steering Committee on Science and Technology Cooperation that took place in Beijing on 30 October under the co-chairmanship of Director-General for Research and Innovation Robert-Jan Smits and the Chinese Vice Minister for Science and Technology Cao Jianlin. As is customary, the two sides reviewed past cooperation. They also discussed priority areas of mutual interest such as food, agriculture and biotechnology, sustainable urbanisation, environment and climate change, nuclear energy and renewable energy, SME cooperation, research infrastructures and exchange of young scientists. Importantly, the two sides agreed guidelines for the CFM and a roadmap on reciprocal access to R&D funding programmes. Constructive dialogue on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (RD-PUNE) took place at the 4th meeting of the RD-PUNE Steering Committee of 29 October, where the two sides endorsed the \u00abThree-Year Report 2011-2014\u00bb on the effectiveness of the cooperation and discussed new activities Joint priorities identified through policy dialogue and stakeholders\u2019 consultations were translated into concrete actions under Horizon 2020. In the 2016/17 Work Programme 20 topics are dedicated to cooperation with China including five topics as part of the Flagship initiative on Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology (FAB) designed together with the Chinese Academy for Agricultural Sciences, a package of five topics on Sustainable Urbanisation and additional topics in the areas of ICT, Transport, Energy and Research Infrastructures. The great majority of the other 600 topics in Horizon 2020 work programme are also open to participation of Chinese researchers and organisations. The CFM for which MOST issued a specific call on 14 December opens the door to more balanced cooperation between Europe and China in research and innovation. The new Implementing Arrangement agreed between the ERC and the NSFC will stimulate more collaboration between talented Chinese researchers and ERC grantees. The Commission has also been working closely with EU Member States in promoting Europe\u2019s excellence in science and innovation and cooperation opportunities both at EU and Member States level. As part of the 2015 \u00abChina Tour\u00bb, the EU Delegation to China and EU Member States Science Counsellors organised awareness raising events in 16 cities, reaching out to a large audience of Chinese researchers and companies. Researchers and innovators in Europe and China will have more opportunities to work together in the future, leveraging Horizon 2020, the EU-China flagship initiatives and the new co-funding mechanism.

The meeting reviewed the progress made in bilateral cooperation in research and innovation and discussed opportunities to enhance cooperation. On the margin of the JSTCC, the EC organized a workshop in Cairo entitled \u2018Research and Innovation in the MED: EU Different Instruments toward Shared Goals\u2019. Participants included members of research and innovation clusters and projects funded under different EU programmes and instruments supporting innovation. These included the projects funded under FP7, as well as projects funded under the ENPI bilateral research and innovation programmes in the South MED region. The workshop was organized under the EYD 2015 as one of DG RTD\u2019s initiatives to foster cooperation and synergies between projects funded under EU different instruments in the South MED region. ISRAEL In a series of events throughout the year, the EU Delegation showcased Israel\u2019s long standing and highly successful R&I cooperation with the EU. From joint activities and a reception for Israel\u2019s Science Day, through the annual EU Israel Innovation Seminar to a reception for the 300+ first Horizon 2020 grantees, EU-Israel relations were presented in a positive light. This helped to counter the often negative image of the EU in Israel.

There were 44 speakers and/or discussants at the main table, from EU (9 MS), 2 AC and Japan and over 30 observers. The meeting included policy briefs on the importance and use of foresight in STI policy making by Member of the European Parliament Paul R\u00fcbig, CSTI Executive Member Yuko Harayama and Xavier Troussard from the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre. Seven eminent experts, representing both \u00abproducers\u00bb and \u00abusers\u00bb of foresight made further introductory remarks. They included three main Japanese foresight producing institutes (NISTEP, NEDO, JST/ CRDS) as well as Pascal Colombani (Vice- Chairman, National Strategic Council for Research), Mark Walport (Chief Advisor to the UK Government) and Matthias Kleiner (President, Leibniz Association). RUSSIA Despite the overall difficult political situation in 2015 (continuing western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis), Russia continued its active international outreach in R&I. Special attention has been given to the BRICS (in particular China), taking advantage of Russia\u2019s chairmanship of the BRICS in 2015. Russia\u2019s National Technology Initiative, one of several policy measures to help Russia capture a leading position in global technology markets, started to take shape, with three thematic roadmaps approved for pilot implementation as from 2016. In its cooperation with the EU, the Russian authorities started the implementation of their co-funding mechanism to support Russian participants in Horizon 2020, while the joint calls under the ERA-Net.RUS Plus initiative resulted in an impressive number of projects (63), with an overall budget of EUR 20 million. October saw the launch of the CREMLIN project, a flagship initiative in EU-Russia R&I cooperation to build and strengthen enduring scientific networks between European large-scale research infrastructures and Russia\u2019s \u2018mega-science\u2019 facilities. USA Three highlights & achievements for 2015 include: 1. the establishment of a collaborative initiative with Member State Embassies on networking US-based national scientific diaspora organisations marked by a successful first annual meeting of the initiative in November; 2. the introduction of \u00abscience diplomacy\u00bb into the transatlantic S&T discourse with the help of the final conference of the Bilat USA 2.0 project in September at which the EU Ambassador to the US delivered a keynote speech, and more particularly the successful visit of Commissioner Moedas in June during which he underlined science diplomacy as one of his top priorities; and 3. The deepening of strategic-level cooperation links with a number of key US Science agencies including NOAA, NSF and NASA, particularly in relation to marine and Arctic research collaboration.

Earlier this year the Commission became an Observer on the SESAME Council on behalf of the European Union following a visit to Jordan by the EU Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation Carlos Moedas. This status reflects the EU\u2019s considerable engagement in and contribution to the development of SESAME (more than EUR 12 million so far). The EU\u2019s support for this flagship science diplomacy initiative is highlighted in the recently published Horizon 2020 Work Programme in the area of Research Infrastructures for the period of 2016 to 2017 which foresees a specific action to support SESAME training and staff exchange efforts. A budget of EUR 2 million has been earmarked for the purpose, and the deadline for proposals is the end of March 2016. The first magnets for SESAME\u2019s main storage ring arrived in autumn 2015 \u2013 well ahead of schedule and SESAME is expected to come into full operation towards the end of 2016. The EU encourages all SESAME members and countries in the Middle East to make the services of this great research facility available to their scientific and industrial communities to support innovation and growth. By expanding its service capabilities to other scientific and technological domains, SESAME will become a great place to find many treasures of the modern world in the Middle\u2013East.

It was the first European Year to deal with the European Union\u2019s external actions and Europe\u2019s role in the world. For development organisations all over Europe it was an unparalleled opportunity to showcase Europe's commitment to eradicating poverty worldwide and to inspire more Europeans to get engaged and involved in development. 2015 has also been the year in which the international community agreed on the future global framework for poverty eradication and sustainable development. In our rapidly-changing world, the lines between the developing and developed worlds have become increasingly blurred. Some former developing countries have become emerging donors, while others remain trapped in poverty. Meanwhile, new sources of finance and new development partners have come forward. The development landscape has seen the traditional donor- recipient relationship give way to a world of cooperation, mutual responsibility and mutual interest. Helping developing countries worldwide to build peaceful and prosperous societies is not just about fairness. It will also make for a safer world with more economic and trading potential for Europe, too.

Their research focuses on so-called zoonotic diseases, which are infectious diseases that travel from animals to humans. ANTIGONE is looking at how these diseases cross three key barriers, first from animals to humans, then within a single human body, and finally from human to human. This discovery could help scientists to develop treatments for other diseases that operate the same way. EDCTP The EDCTP project aimed at accelerating the development of new/improved drugs, vaccines, microbicides and diagnostics against poverty-related diseasessuch as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. It funded clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa and also supported capacity building and networking in order to create an enabling environment to conduct these trials. Very positive results have been achieved. Among which three novel artemisinin- based combination drugs were found to be safe and effective in treating children with a certain type of malaria. GEOSS GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems) is a global infrastructure using land, sea, air and space-based Earth observation systems to provide comprehensive environmental data, information and analyses. GEOSS supports Convention and Policies as well as pioneering activity in the environmental monitoring using highly advanced e-infrastructures. NOPOOR Researchers from the NOPOOR project are taking a fresh look at poverty\u2019s multi- dimensional nature in today\u2019s world, and the reasons for its persistence. They are collecting additional statistical evidence on poverty from Africa, Asia and Latin America, leading to new insights. By the end of the project they aim to provide recommendations that governments and aid organisations can apply to improve living conditions for the extreme poor across the world. NOPOOR\u2019s research will feed into local case studies on topics such as education and cash transfer policies. These will guide the project\u2019s more general conclusions and policy recommendations. COBRA Project COBRA, funded by the EU, aimed to engage with Indigenous communities of the Guiana Shield, South America, whose territories will be affected by conservation and climate funding streams, to learn how and under what conditions they have established local solutions to challenges, in the absence of external incentives. The project used participatory visual methods of Participatory Video and Participatory Photography to engage Indigenous communities to research and document their own solutions to environmental challenges. COROADO Where water is scarce, it is particularly important to ensure that the precious drops aren\u2019t wasted. Recycling and reuse technologies can help to preserve this precious resource even in very arid regions. The COROADO project has developed a decision support tool to help communities select the solutions that offer the best fit for their needs. It proposes tailor-made solutions to water management problems. It draws on a wide range of expertise in order to identify the best possible combination of water recycling and reuse technologies for a given region. FOODSECURE Around the world, an estimated 800 million people are undernourished. The FOODSECURE project aims to shed new light on the causes of hunger and malnutrition, to understand how the situation is likely to develop and to identify possible solutions. Foodsecure will help the EU\u2019s policy - and decision-makers separate the wheat from the chaff in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. CLARA A large number of small communities and towns in Africa suffer from a lack of access to clean water and adequate sanitation - a major health risk. Project, CLARA, developed a tool by assessing the variety of low-cost, technically simple and decentralised technologies available to small communities in Africa. The tool allows planners and consultants to compare the best systems available to their communities and estimates long- term operational and maintenance costs so communities can compare the full investment needed for each system. It also suggests ways to recover resources from wastewater and human waste for re- use \u2013 such as for agricultural production. SUNRAY Project SUNRAY (Sustainable nutrition research for Africa in the years to come) produced a nutrition research agenda and a revised approach for action in sub- Saharan Africa. Main project outcomes were a selection of priorities for nutrition research in Africa and a roadmap, defined in collaboration with African stakeholders. In addition, the project will contribute to developing mitigation strategies for the impact of environmental challenges on nutrition in the continent.
