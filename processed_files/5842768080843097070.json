        "- 3 - 1. INTRODUCTION In this Enlargement Paper the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs brings together into a single document the economic chapters of the Progress Reports of 2006 on progress made towards meeting the accession criteria of each candidate and potential candidate country. The European Commission adopted these Reports on 9 November 2006. The introduction explains the methodology underlying these Reports that the Commission has been following since the publication of the 1997 Opinion, in order to carry out these assessments. The purpose of this Enlargement Paper is to facilitate the work of those scholars, researchers and analysts of the enlargement process, which are mainly interested in the economic aspects. As such, it represents only a part of the overall progress made by the candidate and potential candidate countries towards meeting the accession criteria. A proper full assessment of progress made by candidate countries towards accession will require the reader to have a comprehensive reading of progress made under all examined aspects. These can be found in the Progress Reports 2006 1 . The methodology of the Progress Reports In 1993, the Copenhagen European Council identified the economic and political requirements candidate countries will need to fulfil to join the EU. It also concluded that accession could take place as soon as they were capable of fulfilling them. The criteria are: - the political criteria - stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and respect for and protection of minorities; - the economic criteria - the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union; - the institutional criteria - the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union, which includes the whole range of policies and measures that constitute the acquis of the Union. Candidate countries must adopt, implement and enforce the acquis . This requires the administrative capacity to transpose European Community legislation into national legislation, to implement it and to effectively enforce it through appropriate administrative and judicial structures. The Commission first assessed progress made by the candidate countries with respect to these criteria in the 1997 Opinions. Thereafter, the Commission, at the request of the Council, submitted annual Regular Reports (as of 2005 called Progress Reports) to the Council assessing the further progress achieved by each candidate country on their fulfilment. These reports have 1 published by the European Commission's Directorate General for Enlargement http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/key_documents/reports_nov_2006_en.htm ",
        "- 4 - served as one of the elements for the Council to take decisions on the conduct of negotiations and on the definition of the pre-accession strategy. Regarding the economic criteria, the Commission has followed the same methodology in each Opinion and Progress Report. It has examined progress achieved during each year in order to arrive at an evaluation of the total achievement. The Commission clearly sets out its method to assess the Copenhagen economic criteria in the Opinions. The criterion for the existence of a market economy can be met now whereas the second criterion \u2013 the capacity to withstand competitive pressures and market forces within the Union \u2013 is to be met in the perspective of accession, when candidate countries become Member State. The existence of a functioning market economy requires that: - equilibrium between demand and supply is established by the free interplay of market forces; prices, as well as trade, are liberalised; - significant barriers to market entry (establishment of new firms) and exit (bankruptcies) are absent; - the legal system, including the regulation of property rights, is in place; laws and contracts can be enforced; - macroeconomic stability has been achieved including adequate price stability and sustainable public finances and external accounts; - broad consensus exists about the essentials of economic policy; - the financial sector is sufficiently well developed to channel savings towards productive investment. The capacity to withstand competitive pressure and market forces within the Union is assessed on the basis of the following factors: - the existence of a functioning market economy, with a sufficient degree of macroeconomic stability for economic agents to make decisions in a climate of stability and predictability; - a sufficient amount, at appropriate costs, of human and physical capital, including infrastructure, education and research, and future developments in this field; - the extent to which government policy and legislation influence competitiveness through trade policy, competition policy, state aids, support for SMEs, etc.; - the degree and the pace of trade integration a country achieves with the Union before enlargement. This applies both to the volume and the nature of goods already traded with Member States; - the proportion of small firms, partly because small firms tend to benefit more from improved market access, and partly because a dominance of large firms could indicate a greater reluctance to adjust. ",
        "- 5 - The Opinions and, each year after, the Regular Reports assess each candidate country in the light of progress made with respect to these conditions. Since 2005, also the potential candidate countries are assessed according to the same format and methodology. The above conditions should not be regarded as simple checklist. For it is the interplay and interaction of all conditions, and their mutually reinforcing effects on the economy, that are pertinent. There is also an important time dimension involved, meeting the economic criteria requires, certainly in the case of transition economies, deep and lasting structural reforms that take time to be accomplished. The issue of track record, which was one of the factors considered in the Agenda 2000, becomes then very relevant. In this context, track-record means the irreversible, sustained and verifiable implementation of reforms and policies for a long enough period to allow for a permanent change in the expectations and behaviour of economic agents and for judging that achievements will be lasting.

        "- 6 - 2. CROATIA 2.1. Introduction In examining the economic developments in Croatia, the Commission's approach was guided by the conclusions of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, which stated that membership of the Union requires the existence of a functioning market economy, and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. 2.2. The existence of a functioning market economy Economic policy essentials The second Pre-accession Economic Programme (PEP) was submitted by the authorities in December 2005. It sets out a generally sound medium-term macroeconomic framework and an ambitious structural reform agenda. A National Development Strategy with a strong economic reform orientation was launched for public consultation in May and adopted by the government in August 2006. Cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank has continued to be an important anchor for economic policies. However, the authorities have decided not to request an IMF successor programme when the current arrangement expires in November 2006. At times, poor communication and coordination between various line ministries and agencies have undermined the quality of economic policy making. Strong vested interests have also led to delays in the implementation of important economic reforms. Overall, consensus on the direction of economic policy has generally been maintained, but intergovernmental communication and coordination needs to be strengthened. Macroeconomic stability In 2005, real GDP growth was 4.3%, up from 3.8% in 2004, mainly driven by domestic demand. Net exports added only 0.1 percentage points to real growth. In the first half of 2006, real GDP accelerated further to 4.8% year-on-year, largely due to stronger private investment. Economic activity in the third quarter of 2006 remained strong. In the eight months to August 2006, industrial production rose by 4.1% year on year, as compared to an annual average growth of 3.2% in the first half of the year. Average per-capita income further increased to an estimated 47% of the EU-25 average (in purchasing power standards) in 2005. Overall, economic growth continued on the back of stronger private investment. The current account deficit widened from 5% of GDP in 2004 to 6.4% in 2005 and further to 7.7% 2 in the second quarter of 2006. This was mainly a result of higher oil prices, continued strong imports as well as higher net factor payments to non-residents in early 2006. A large deficit in merchandise trade in the twelve months to end-June 2006 (24.8% of GDP) was not fully compensated for by the surplus in services (16.8%). In the same period, net foreign direct investment (FDI) grew to 4.6% of GDP and covered 60% of the current account deficit. FDI were largely driven by capital increases and takeovers rather than by privatisation or greenfield 2 Four-quarter moving average ",
        "- 7 - investments. Due to strong capital inflows, official foreign exchange reserves increased 27.1% year on year at end-July 2006. External debt continued to grow, although at a slower pace than, from \u20ac 24.1 billion at end-September 2005 26.8 billion by end-August 2006. At the end of 2005, external debt amounted to 82.6% of GDP, up from 80.2% at end-2004, and continued growing to 86.7% of 2005 GDP by August 2006. Overall, external deficits have widened further.

The downward trend is confirmed by the most recent labour force survey. It recorded a decline in the unemployment rate from 13.8% in the second half of 2004 to 12.3% in the second half of 2005. According to official data, total employment grew by a small 0.6% year-on-year in April. Data of the Pension Insurance Fund suggest a stronger growth of above 3% in the same period. Still, a relatively high unemployment rate and limited job turnover and job creation remain some of the most pressing economic problems. The general monetary policy framework of a \u201cmanaged float\u201d with the primary objective of maintaining price stability has not changed. The Central Bank took a number of measures to contain strong capital inflows through foreign borrowing by commercial banks. It raised the rate of reserve requirements on the net increase in banks' foreign liabilities in three times to 55% in January 2006. It also expanded the basis for calculation. In March 2006, it introduced a special reserve requirement on banks' liabilities arising from the issuance of securities abroad. Despite these measures, credit and money aggregates continued to accelerate. Annual growth of broad money accelerated from 9.3% in September 2005 to 12% in July 2006. Annual domestic credit growth accelerated from 16.7% to 22.2% in the same period. Overall, monetary policy continued to aim at price stability and relied on additional administrative measures to curb capital inflows. ",
        "- 8 - The Central Bank continued to tightly manage the exchange rate vis-\u00e0-vis the euro. In 2005 and early 2006, the Kuna remained under appreciation pressure due to strong demand. This resulted from government bond issues, continued capital inflows as well as appreciation expectations generated by the EU accession process. The central bank intervened 10 times in the foreign exchange market between October 2005 and August 2006 to purchase a total of \u20ac 860 million from commercial banks. In the twelve months to August 2006, the Kuna appreciated by 1.4% vis-\u00e0-vis the euro, the same pace as in the year 2005. Exchange rate stability remained an important policy objective in the context of a highly euroised financial system. Average annual consumer price inflation increased significantly from to 2.1% in 2004 to 3.3% in 2005 and to 3.6% in July 2006, resulting from higher prices for energy (oil), transport and food. Annual average core inflation has remained at around 3%. Overall, price stability has been maintained. Fiscal performance in 2005 has been broadly in line with policy targets set in the PEP 2005 and agreed under the current IMF programme. 3 The general government deficit (ESA 95) fell to 3.9% of GDP in 2005 (2004: 5%). Total revenues grew by 6.9%. VAT has continued to be the main source of revenues. Growth of current spending fell to 6.6% in 2005 (2004: 8%) supported by a moderate growth of wages and social contributions. Capital spending decreased with 13.7% in 2005, adjusting towards a more sustainable level. Strong economic performance has led to favourable fiscal developments in the first half of 2006. The growth of revenues accelerated markedly to 11.4% year-on-year while current spending grew by a moderate 4%. A revised budget with a lower deficit was adopted by Parliament in July 2006. By the end of May 2006, general government debt had grown by 3.6% year-on-year, reaching 41.2% of GDP. Public sector arrears reportedly continued to grow mainly due to financial problems in the health sector. Overall, fiscal consolidation continued on the back of strong revenue growth. Some important public finance reform measures have been implemented in early 2006 to strengthen tax administration, such as the establishment of a Financial Police and an e-VAT service. Expenditure management has also improved. A reform in health care financing was adopted in July 2006 to address financial difficulties and stop further arrears accumulation. The scope of this reform was less ambitious than initially envisaged and is expected to reap lower fiscal savings than originally planned. The government has started preparatory work on the reform of the social welfare system. This encompasses proposals for consolidating numerous welfare benefits and for simplifying procedures. The reform aims to better target social benefit spending. However, the timing and scope of this reform remain uncertain as vested interests have lobbied for the exclusion from the reforms of categorical benefits. These benefits count for a large part of social spending. Significant state support to loss-making enterprises continued to put considerable strain on the budget. In June 2006, the government released the first instalment of debt repayments to pensioners, equivalent to around 0.5% of GDP. This required a significant bridge financing as earmarked revenues from privatisation did not materialise as foreseen. The transparency of public debt management remains weak. The inclusion of local governments in 3 Deficit figures for the general government reported in the context of the IMF stand-by arrangement and in the PEP 2005 differ due to different methodologies. The IMF uses GFS 1986 (modified accrual basis) and the PEP 2005 applies GFS 2001. ",
        "- 9 - fiscal reporting is still partial . Overall, public finance reforms have continued but significant fiscal risks remain. The stabilisation of the high and still rising external debt has been a key target of macroeconomic policies. Given the limited scope for monetary policy discretion under the circumstances of currency substitution, fiscal policy has continued to play an important role for macroeconomic adjustment and stabilisation. Fiscal consolidation has reduced financing needs in the public sector and has helped reducing savings-investment balances in the economy. A shift in government borrowing from external to domestic markets was intended to support this process. However, it may have led to crowding out effects and higher financing costs. Fiscal risks, high spending ratios as well as continuously increasing arrears in the public sector remain a concern. In general, the macroeconomic policy mix was largely adequate, but fiscal consolidation needs to be strengthened. Free interplay of market forces There is some evidence from available business data that the private sector\u2019s share in output has risen above earlier estimates of a 60% share. The share of the private sector in total employment increased slightly from 66.2% in 2004 to around 68% in 2005. Overall, state intervention and ownership has remained significant in important industrial sectors, such as in shipbuilding and the steel industry. Until June 2006, the State Privatisation Fund had offered 55 companies of its portfolio, comprising 48 companies with minority and seven companies with majority state ownership. However, the number was drastically short of the authorities' policy objective reaffirmed in August 2005. The intention was to sell 50% of companies with minority and a third of companies with majority state ownership by June 2006, totalling almost 500 companies. A number of factors have delayed this, such as a generally low commitment from the government as well as legal problems, low investors' interest, and sometimes unrealistic sale conditions. The authorities' intention to draft and adopt a new Privatisation Law, which allows for partial employee ownership, may have also slowed down the process. To conclude, privatisation continued at a significantly slower than envisaged pace. Free market entry and exit A network of \"one-stop-shops\" has been established and company registration procedures have been simplified. The average time needed to set up a business has been reduced. The number of newly established companies in the Register of business entities has increased by 15.3% in 2005. At the same time, the number of companies that were eliminated from the Register has declined significantly. As a result, the stock of registered businesses rose by 5% in 2005. Starting and running a business remains hampered by bureaucratic procedures and inefficiencies in administrations and courts. Recently approved amendments to the Bankruptcy Law aim to simplify and accelerate bankruptcy procedures and to enhance the transparency of the process. Overall, company registration procedures have started to improve, but administrative inefficiencies continue to hamper market entry and exit. ",
        "- 10 - Adequate legal system The judicial system has continued to suffer from slow and inefficient court proceedings, poor case management and low administrative and professional capacity. These circumstances may discourage economic actors from taking cases to court and undermine an effective enforcement of creditor and property rights. Sufficiently developed financial sector The banking sector represented 78.7% of total financial sector assets in 2005 (2004: 81.4%). Banks are mostly privately-owned (95%) and the share of foreign ownership remained high at 91.3%. In 2005, the number of banks decreased from 37 to 34, which is still relatively high. The degree of market concentration remained moderate, as the five largest banks represented a market share of 75% at the end of 2005 (2004: 74%). The further reduction of the spread between average lending and deposit rates indexed to foreign exchange (from 4.1% in mid- 2005 to 3.7% in April 2006) indicates that the current level of concentration has not been an impediment to market competition. The largely privately-owned banking sector remains the key player in the financial sector. Domestic private credit increased to 65.2% of GDP in 2005, up from 59.8% in 2004. Annual bank credit growth accelerated from 17.9% in October 2005 to 23.5% in July 2006. In 2005, commercial bank lending to households has been growing stronger (20.3%) than lending to enterprises (14.3%), but the growth of lending to both sectors accelerated to around 24% year- on-year in July 2006. The share of non-performing loans has been reduced from 4.4% in 2004 to 4.0% in 2005. However, the banking system continues to be confronted with foreign- exchange induced credit risks arising from un-hedged non-financial sector balances. Overall, financial intermediation through banks continued to expand rapidly. The share of non-banking financial sector assets in total financial sector assets increased from 18.6% at the end-2004 to 21.3% at end-2005. This was primarily the result of a strong asset growth of pension and investment funds. The shares of other market segments (insurance, leasing, saving cooperatives) have not changed significantly. Bond market capitalisation grew to 15% of GDP by end-2005, supported by a switch of government borrowing from foreign to domestic financial markets. Overall, capital markets continued to play a minor role in financing the economy. A single supervisory agency for the non-banking sector was established in November 2005. It started its operations in January 2006, but has not yet reached the required staffing level. A recently adopted insurance law still needs to be fully implemented. Overall, there remains scope for the strengthening of non-banking supervision, in particular regarding leasing companies which have become more important in financial intermediation. ",
        "- 11 - 2.3. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union Existence of a functioning market economy Croatia has generally maintained macroeconomic stability . Relatively low inflation and exchange rate stability have continued to support market mechanisms. However, fiscal and external deficits still pose potential risks to macroeconomic stability. Sufficient human and physical capital Several measures have been taken concerning the Education Sector Development Plan 2005- 2010. These aimed at improving the quality of primary and secondary education as well as of vocational education and training. Ongoing reforms were meant to tackle serious shortcomings, such as outdated curricula, low quality teaching and poor equipments, which apparently takes time. Emphasis has also been put on enhancing the scope and quality of adult education. Life long learning remained at a very low level at 2.3% in 2005 (2004: 2%). Overall, reforms of the education system have continued, but further efforts are needed to increase its efficiency and quality. The participation rate remained unchanged at around 63% in the second half of 2005. With a view to increasing participation and employment rates, the authorities introduced a new set of active labour market measures in early 2006 related to the National Employment Action Plan. These include more focussed support, training and employment subsidies for young persons without work experience, the long-term unemployed, older persons and other vulnerable groups. The unemployment rate declined by 1.5 percentage points to 12.3% in the second half of 2005. Yet, it remained high at above 30% for the young population. The long-term unemployment rate increased slightly to 7.4% in 2005 (2004: 7.3%). Overall, the economy continued to be affected by a relatively high share of inactive persons. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) continued to grow strongly in 2005 and early 2006. This led to a further increase in the investment ratio to 29% of GDP (2004: 28.6%). Private investment picked up markedly, whereas the share of general government GFCF in GDP declined to 3.9% (2004: 4.5%). Government investment continued to focus on highway construction. The motorway network was extended by 100 kilometres to 800 kilometres in 2005. Net inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) increased from 2.6% in 2004 to 3.9% in 2005. The financial sector represents the largest share of cumulative FDI inflows (27.9%), followed by manufacturing (23.4%), then telecommunication (16.3%). Banking and other services attracted most of the FDI inflows, thus reflecting a relatively slow pace of privatisation and restructuring in industry. Total spending on research and development has remained relatively high at around 1.1% of GDP. To conclude, the economy has generally benefited from stronger private investment growth. Adequate sector and enterprise structure Preparations were made for a restructuring strategy of the shipbuilding industry. The government therefore adopted general guidelines and chose an external consultant to assist in elaborating a restructuring programme. However, shipyard restructuring has been on the government's agenda for a long time and little progress has been achieved so far. Privatisation ",
        "- 12 - of the first shipyard was planned for 2005, but then postponed. Following an unsuccessful offer in March 2006, the Privatisation Fund reissued a tender for government stakes in the aluminium factory TLM. The government also established a working group to prepare a strategy for the privatisation of some remaining state owned tourist companies in March 2006. In May 2006, the government submitted \u2013 with some delay - a programme for the restructuring and privatisation of the steel sector to the Commission. In September, tenders for the sale of two state-owned steel companies were launched. Overall, the restructuring of large state-owned companies has made little progress ( see also chapter 8, competition) . The liberalisation of the telecommunication industry is well advanced and market competition has particularly increased in the mobile phone sector. Fixed line operators entered the market, but regulation of network access needs to be improved. The sale of remaining government shares in the telecom company has been delayed. This was initially foreseen for June 2006. Restructuring of the railway company has continued and led to moderate staff reductions, resulting in initial improvements in the working ratio. The legal basis for the structural separation of the railway company was established at end-2005. The privatisation of the first three subsidiaries has not advanced, due to unresolved ownership issues and uncertainties about the privatisation model to be applied. The restructuring and liberalisation of the energy sector is still in progress. The sale of some state shares in the oil company INA, announced for June 2006, has been further delayed. Restructuring and privatisation of an electricity company has not started yet. Overall, the reform of network industries has continued. Sectoral change is slowly progressing, against the background of an already strong service sector. The shares of the agricultural sector in output declined slightly to 7% in 2005 (7.2% in 2004). This was 62.2% for the services sector (62.5% in 2004). Industry's share (including construction) rose to 30.8% (2004: 30.3%). The share of employment in agriculture rose to 17% (2004: 16.2%), declined slightly for industry to 28% (2004: 28.4%), and rose further for the services to 53.7% (2004: 53.5%). A growing sector of small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) still has to cope with a difficult business environment. The relative importance of the SME sector has recently grown. It represents 99% of the total number of firms and 65.5% of total employment. SMEs generate 55% of GDP and 25% of exports. They represent 38% of total enterprise assets. Despite various government initiatives, SMEs have continued to be confronted with inefficiencies in the administrative and judicial system. Access to longer-term financing has remained problematic, particularly for small businesses. The support of SMEs has remained an important priority of the government\u2019s medium-term economic policy strategy. State influence on competitiveness Progress has been made in enhancing transparency on state aid issues through the establishment of a state aid inventory. A new state aid law came into force in late 2005, bringing legislation more in line with EU requirements. State aid granted remained high at around 2.8% of GDP in 2005. A large part represents support to specific sectors, such as shipbuilding, steel, aluminium and railways. Horizontal aid accounts for only a minor share of state aid, although its relative importance has risen recently. The government announced its intention to reduce the share of subsidies to 2.1% of GDP by 2007 in the context of the PEP 2005. This will require bolder steps in cutting state aid to non-viable, loss-making companies, either through restructuring and ",
        "- 13 - privatisation or liquidation. Overall, state intervention in the productive sector remains significant. Trade integration with the EU Croatia is an open economy with total trade representing more than 100% of GDP. In 2005, the shares of imports and exports of goods and services in GDP slightly went down to 55.8% (2004: 56.7%) and 47.1% (2004: 47.4%), respectively. Tourism remains the most important export revenue, representing 18% of GDP in 2005 (2004: 17.8%). The EU has continued to be the most important trading partner with a share of 64.6% in Croatian exports and 65.6% in imports. Both shares were slightly lower than in 2004. At the same time, Croatia has expanded its trade with developing countries and its neighbours in the Western Balkans. In summary, Trade integration is fairly high and trade with neighbouring countries has grown. Price competitiveness has been maintained. The real effective exchange rate of the Kuna measured on the basis of consumer price developments has remained stable through 2005. Wage and labour cost developments also indicate that price competitiveness has been maintained in 2005. Real unit labour costs declined by 2.3% as real wage growth (1.2%) was lower than the growth of average labour productivity (3.6%). 2.4. Conclusions Croatia can be regarded as a functioning market economy. The country should be able to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the Union in the medium term, provided that it vigorously implements its reform programme to remove the significant remaining weaknesses. Political consensus on the essentials of economic policy has generally been maintained. Stability-oriented macroeconomic policies have contributed to low inflation, exchange rate stability and a slight acceleration of growth. Private investment has risen and unemployment has declined. Gradual fiscal consolidation has continued, backed by strong revenue growth. Some measures have been taken to better control health care spending. Business registration procedures have been further simplified. The banking sector has continued to grow and a new supervisory agency for the non-banking financial sector has been established. Road infrastructure has improved. Further progress has been made in enhancing competition in the telecommunication sector. Initial steps have been taken to restructure the loss-making railway system. Croatia's economy is well integrated with that of the EU. However, significant and rising imbalances in the trade and current accounts and a high external debt imply potential risks to macroeconomic stability. Subsidies to loss-making enterprises and a high level of current spending continue to burden the government budget. The pace of structural reforms has generally been slow. Little progress has been made in implementing privatisation plans and in enterprise restructuring. The development of a more vivid private sector has been hampered by deficiencies in public administration and the judiciary, undermining market entry and exit procedures and the enforcement of property and creditor rights. State intervention in the economy remained significant. Increased efforts are required to raise participation in lifelong learning. ",

Introduction In examining the economic developments in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Commission's approach was guided by the conclusions of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, which stated that membership of the Union requires the existence of a functioning market economy, and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. 3.2. The existence of a functioning market economy Economic policy essentials All relevant political parties agree on establishing a market based economy. The government adopted the 2006 Macroeconomic Policy Document in December 2005, emphasising the objective of maintaining economic stability and promoting growth and employment. Since 2006, the country has participated in the EU's Pre-accession Fiscal Surveillance procedure. In April, the authorities submitted the first fiscal notification. They are currently preparing the first Pre-accession Economic Programme (PEP), which is due by December. Programme cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank is on track, with positive assessments on the country's progress by both institutions concerning its programme commitments. A broad political consensus on the fundamentals of economic policy has been maintained. Macroeconomic stability In the second half of 2005, real GDP grew by around 4% year-on-year, driven by exports and investment. In the first half of 2006, output growth slowed to 2.6% due to weak industrial production and decelerating construction. Industrial production only increased by 2.8% year- on-year during the first eight months of 2006, compared to 8.2% during the same period in 2005. Average per-capita GDP in purchasing power standards was 26% of the EU-25 average, compared to 25% the year before. Overall, economic performance has stayed on track, although below potential. In 2005, the current account deficit declined to 1.4% of GDP, compared to 7.7% in 2004. About half of the decline was due to higher exports. These increased from 31% of GDP in 2004 to 36% of GDP in 2005. Net private transfers increased from 13.3% of GDP in 2004 to 17.6%, which also contributed to the improvement in the current account. Foreign direct investment (FDI) declined slightly, from 2.8% of GDP in 2004 to 1.7% in 2005, but rose sharply during the first half of 2006 and reached some 6% of the GDP, projected for 2006. Exports were slightly below the pre-year level (-0.5%), whereas imports rose by 4%. Overall, external deficits have markedly narrowed, with an annualised current account deficit of around 3% of the GDP during the first half of 2006. At the end of August 2006, official reserve assets of the country's central bank (NBRM) stood at \u0404 1.3 billion, equivalent to more than 4 months of imports of goods and services. The main ",
        "- 15 - reasons for the rapid increase in reserves were the inflow of proceeds from the privatisation of the electricity distributor ESM, which amounted to about 5% GDP, and other foreign exchange inflows through the cash exchange offices. In August 2006 gross external debt stood at some 39 % of GDP, after the sale of a \u0404 150 million 10-year government Eurobond had led to a temporary increase in the debt ratio. The revenues of the bond sale were used to finance the repayment of the London Club debt, which helped to lower the costs of the debt service.

Besides seasonal effects, the impact of the recent liberalisation of labour legislation has contributed to this favourable development. Unemployment among the young is very high and the duration of unemployment in this age group is long. The existence of a substantial informal sector most may lead to a significant over-estimation of real unemployment. ( See also Chapter 19 \u2013 Social Policy and Employment .) Overall, unemployment has started to decline, although from a very high level. The recent strengthening of foreign currency reserves and the improved confidence in the stability of the financial system has allowed a marked reduction in policy interest rates. For example, Central Bank bill rates dropped to 5.5% in August 2006, compared to 10.0% a year before. In October 2005, the NBRM switched from auctioning fixed-rate Central Bank bills to flexible-rate auctions, which resulted in a marked decrease of these rates. Short-term lending rates of commercial banks have declined from 12.1% at the end of 2005 to 11.1% in August 2006. In March 2006, the NBRM started to replace its main instrument for monetary policy (28-day Central Bank bills) with 3-month treasury bills. Credit growth to the private sector continued to be high, at some 24.5% during the first half of 2006. However, the credit provision to the private sector is relatively low, around 25% of GDP. The volume of broad money (M4) rose by 15% year-on-year during the first half of 2006. Overall, monetary policy has remained sound, responding to the improved confidence in the stability of the financial system. ",
        "- 16 - Consumer price inflation has increased to 3.3% during the first nine months of 2006, compared to 0.4% during the same period in 2005. The main factors were supply driven elements, such as increases in excise taxes and higher energy costs. The country's statistical office is currently preparing an indicator of core inflation. Overall, inflation has remained under control. The NBRM has managed to maintain the exchange rate of the Denar against the euro on a level of 61.3 Denar/euro and intends to continue this de-facto peg. In order to improve the efficiency of the foreign exchange market, the NBRM has established an electronic system of exchange rate monitoring and introduced a system of market-makers. Overall, the exchange rate has remained stable towards the euro. Fiscal balances turned out better than expected in 2005, with a general government surplus of 0.3% of GDP (cash basis), compared to a targeted deficit of 0.8% of GDP 4 . As in previous years, revenue collection was better than expected, whereas expenditures remained lower than planned. A new Law on Tax Procedure entered into force in April 2006, which assists tax collection, simplifies procedures and improves the equal treatment of tax payers. In addition, the strengthening of the public debt management institutions and the adoption of the 2006-2008 Public Debt Management Strategy should result in an improved debt structure and lower expenditures for debt servicing. Fiscal decentralisation appears to be on track. The introduction of a second-pillar pension system by January 2006 puts the pension system on a sounder footing, although the decrease of social security contribution will increase fiscal pressures in the short-term. Due to a financing transaction, public debt temporarily increased from 36.6% of GDP at the end of 2004, to 40.1% of GDP at the end of 2005. However, by mid-2006 it had declined again to below 35% of GDP. Overall, public sector accounts have remained close to balance and public administration has been strengthened. Economic stability was maintained, with balanced public finances, low inflation and improving external accounts. The improved reserve position has strengthened confidence in the stability of the foreign exchange regime and has allowed for a lowering of interest rates. Overall, the macroeconomic policy mix has succeeded in maintaining economy stability, although key challenges such as high unemployment and low investment persist. Free interplay of market forces Privatisation of the last state enterprises continued. In October 2005, most of the remaining state property was transferred to four institutions for further liquidation: the Pension Fund, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Finance and a public real estate agency. Most of the companies transferred to the Ministry of Economy are subject to bankruptcy procedures. The book value of minority shares owned by the pension fund was 2.8% of GDP at the end of 2005. By June 2006, the pension fund had sold minority shares in 14 local companies, amounting to some 24% of the fund's total privatisation portfolio and accruing revenues of \u0404 16 million (0.3% of GDP). The state maintained ownership of around 30 enterprises, with an estimated value of 16% of GDP and minority shares in privatised companies. The state electricity company was divided into three sections - for generation, transmission and distribution. The distribution company was sold in March 2006 to a strategic foreign investor for the equivalent of 5% of GDP. In June 2006, the state offered most of its shares in the landline telecom 4 The data still is based on GFS and not yet fully in line with the European accounting standard ESA 95. ",
        "- 17 - company for sale on the stock exchange. This meant 45.1% of the company's shares, leaving only 2% in state hands. So far, a 9.9% stake in the company has been sold for \u0404 60.3 million (1.4% of GDP). Free market entry and exit The government significantly reduced entry barriers and accelerated exit procedures. For example, a one-stop-shop system for company registration has been established. This resulted in a marked simplification of procedures and reduced the average time for registration to seven days. The one-stop-shop system started to operate in January 2006 and handled about 18,600 applications during the first nine months 5 . Around 8% of the new companies were owned by foreign investors, who invested some \u0404 3 million (0.1% of GDP) in the country. Furthermore, the competence of the Credit Guarantee Fund was extended to cover long-term loans for SME investments. Bankruptcy legislation was amended in March 2006 to accelerate market exit procedures. This should lead to a shortening of procedures and reduce costs. However, the necessary implementing legislation is not yet fully in place. Overall, barriers to market entry and exit have been reduced. Adequate legal system The necessary legal system is largely in place. However, slow legal procedures are an important impediment to the functioning of the system, for example, delaying the clarification of ownership disputes. The time required to register a real estate transaction was \u2013reduced; for example from several weeks to one day in the case of an accelerated procedure. However, the real estate cadastre covers only about 47% of the country so far. The authorities plan to finalise the full registration by 2009. Several measures to simplify and accelerate legal procedures have been adopted, such as the law on international trade arbitration in March 2006 and the Law on Mediation in May 2006, which introduced alternative dispute settlement procedures. Progress has been made in accelerating market entry and in clarifying property rights. However, the judiciary has continued to be a bottleneck. Sufficiently developed financial sector In 2005, credits to the private sector increased from 21.5% of GDP (end 2004) to 24.4% of GDP (end 2005) The recent decline in interest rates, the establishment of a guarantee fund and the acceleration of registration of property rights contribute to increasing financial intermediation. The operational efficiency of local banks has still been relatively low. The banking sector has remained comparatively small, with banking assets amounting to about 49% of GDP, although the number of banks is still relatively high. A recent merger of two smaller banks reduced the number of banks to 19. There are also 15 savings houses. Overall, financial intermediation has deepened. The five largest banks account for 76% of total assets and 75% of total credits. Spreads between lending and deposit rates shrank from about 7.2% in early 2005 to around 6.7% in July 5 Out of this number about 7600 applications were new registrations. ",
        "- 18 - 2006. The high spreads partly reflect an unfavourable asset structure. The share of assets deposited abroad declined from 35% in 2004 to 25% in 2005, indicating a marked improvement of confidence in the financial system. All banks are controlled by private owners, with the exception of the small 100% state-owned development bank. Foreign banks are majority owners of two of the three largest banks. The state has continued to withdraw from the banking sector, by selling a number of minority shares. However, concentration in the banking sector has remained high. Banking sector capitalisation has remained high, with a capital adequacy ratio of some 20% in mid-2006 compared to 23% in 2004. Small banks have a high capital adequacy ratio of some 27% on average, while large banks register a ratio of some 13%. The share of non-performing loans declined from 13% in 2004, to 11% of total loans in 2005. The share of worst performing credits has declined from 7.6% to 4.6%. The profitability of the sector rose in 2005. Returns on assets and equity reached 1.3% and 8.1%, respectively. Overall, the stability of the financial sector has strengthened further. Market capitalisation of the 57 companies listed on the Macedonian Stock Exchange rose from 16% of GDP in 2004 to 18% in 2005. By mid-2006, the stock market capitalisation had reached some 20% of GDP. Securities trading rose by 7% in 2005. Foreign-owned brokerage houses have entered the market. However, so far no foreign investment fund has been established. Overall, the size of the non-banking financial sector has increased, but the level still remains very low. 3.3. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union Existence of a functioning market economy The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has achieved a sufficient degree of macroeconomic stability. It has made important progress in reducing barriers to market entry and exit, in strengthening the legal and institutional framework and in improving the transparency and accountability of public procedures. However, the full functioning of the market economy is still impeded by weaknesses in the judiciary, administrative bottlenecks, a low degree of legal certainty, a high number of unsettled property disputes, and considerable labour market imbalances. Preparations for the general elections slowed down the finalisation of important structural reforms, such as the implementing regulations of the bankruptcy law, delays in implementing a supervisory development plan, amendments to the law on banking supervision and the central bank law. Sufficient human and physical capital The authorities adopted a series of reform measures in 2005 to modernise curricula, to improve the training of teaching staff, to promote vocational education and training and to support life long learning. However, as a result of decades of underspending on education the infrastructure is inadequate and outdated. High unemployment rates among school leavers are an indication of the deficits in this area. Furthermore, in certain rural areas access to education remains limited. The education system does not sufficiently reflect the country's needs ( See also Chapter 26 \u2013 Education and Culture and Chapter 19 \u2013 Social Policy and Employment. ) Overall, some measures have been taken to improve education and human capital. ",
        "- 19 - Labour contracts have become more flexible. This is the result of the new labour code, which allows part-time employment and simplifies procedures in the case of redundancies, overtime, shift work etc.. Active labour market measures have also been strengthened. These developments have helped to reduce unemployment and increase employment. The existence of a substantial informal sector probably leads to an overestimation of the true dimension of unemployment. Overall, labour markets have become more flexible, but the supply and demand mismatch is still high. Gross fixed capital formation rose marginally from 17% of GDP in 2004 to about 18% in 2005. This low ratio can be seen as an indication for a weak business environment. Public investment was particularly low at 3.6% of GDP in 2005. The share of investment in GDP has remained relatively low, given the country's need to catch up with international standards. Foreign direct investment increased sharply in the first half of 2006 to around 6% of projected GDP. The main factors were payments related to the privatisation of the electricity distributor, amounting to about 5% of GDP. Apart from these privatisation-related cases, greenfield FDI inflows remained limited. Unclear property rights and fragmented responsibilities between the central and local governments have contributed to delays in FDI projects. The agency for Investment Promotion became operative in 2005, but suffers from resource constraints. Overall, FDI inflows have continued to increase; however, they were mainly driven by privatisations. Adequate sectoral and enterprise structure The last two decades of insufficient investment have eroded the quality of transport networks. An upgrading of the overall system of infrastructure has started for projects related to the European transport corridor X. The railway company has been separated into two operative companies, so as to privatise them. In the telecommunications sector, the state has embarked upon offering its remaining shares (except a 2% \"golden share\") on the Stock Exchange. Public research and development expenditures were raised to 0.7% of GDP in 2005. ( See also Chapter 14 \u2013 Transport Policy, Chapter 21 \u2013 Trans-European Networks, and Chapter 25 \u2013 Science and Research. ) Overall, infrastructure has continued to require repair and modernisation. Only minor changes have been recorded in the production structure of the economy. There has been a significant increase in the value added of wholesale and retail trade, whose share in total value added rose from 12.9% of GDP in 2004 to 13.4% in 2005. The value added of industry has remained around 29% of GDP. This pattern is confirmed by labour market data, which indicates broadly unchanged employment figures for industry at around 22% of the labour force. Overall, changes to the structure of the economy have remained limited. The number of enterprises has increased significantly during the last year. However, the number of employed in these enterprises has only risen by 2.6%, indicating that the main increase has occurred in small enterprises. There are many 'single employee enterprises' due to the absence of the legal category \"self-employed\". The authorities have tried to ease the financing constraint for SMEs by improving the functioning of the Guarantee Funds. However, the low degree of real estate registration hampers the provision of collateral for credit provision. Overall, the number of small firms has increased considerably, but their share in total employment remains relatively low. ",
        "- 20 - State influence on competitiveness The authorities have shown an increasing reluctance to intervene in market processes, for example by moving towards rule based decisions for public tenders. No precise data on the actual volume of direct state aid are available at present. However, there are indications that indirect state aid leads to significant distortions in the competitive position of enterprises in the market. These are in the form of accumulated payment arrears of taxes and social security contributions. Providing electricity below cost price or allowing the accumulation of payment arrears are examples of these indirect state interventions. Overall, direct state intervention has continued to decline, but indirect state aid still leads to distortions in relative prices. Trade integration with the EU The country is a small open economy with total trade of goods and services accounting for around 100% of GDP in 2005. During the first eight months of 2006, about 55% of all exports went to the EU-25, while about 45% of imports came from the EU-5. In 2006, the country joined CEFTA and concluded a number of free trade agreements, including with neighbouring Kosovo. Trade integration with the Western Balkan region increased, reaching 33% of the country's exports and 10% of its imports. The EU remained by far the country's main trading partner. In the region, Serbia is also an important trade partner. The export structure is still highly concentrated on a few items, with textile and clothing products amounting to about 24% of total exports, and manufactured iron and zinc products to some 26%. ( See Chapter 30 \u2013 External Relations ). Overall, trade integration is well advanced, but the commodity composition is concentrated on a few price-sensitive products. International price competitiveness improved slightly during the last year, benefiting from low inflation and a nominally stable exchange rate. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 3% in 2005, whilst labour productivity increased by 2.7%. At the same time, real wage increases remained in line with productivity growth and unit labour costs decreased by 4% in 2005. Overall, price competitiveness and labour productivity has improved. 3.4. Conclusions The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is well advanced in establishing a functioning market economy. Continued stabilisation and reform efforts are needed to enable it to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union in the medium-term. The country has maintained a broad consensus on the essentials of economic policies. As a result of a sound policy mix, macroeconomic stability and predictability have further increased. Inflation has remained under control. Public sector accounts have been kept close to balance and the relatively low level of public sector debt has declined further. Price and trade liberalisation are largely completed, and the privatisation of state-owned enterprises has proceeded. Barriers to market entry and exit have been reduced by simplifying and accelerating bankruptcy and, in line with a key priority of the European Partnership, registration procedures. The financial sector's stability has improved. Furthermore, measures have been taken to improve the quality of human capital and to upgrade the country's infrastructure. Foreign direct investment inflows increased significantly, mainly driven by privatisation efforts. Economic integration with the EU is well advanced. ",
        "- 21 - However, the functioning of the market economy is still impeded by institutional weaknesses, such as the slow speed of administrative procedures, corruption, red tape and a low degree of legal certainty. Shortcomings in the judiciary continue to be bottlenecks, impeding a faster improvement in the business climate. Furthermore, labour and financial markets are still poorly functioning, which hinders the reduction of the particularly high unemployment and hampers credit provision to enterprises. The education system does not sufficiently reflect the country's needs. These factors allowed only moderate economic growth. The considerable informal sector continues to cause major distortions in the economy. The commodity structure of exports is very concentrated. ",

Introduction In examining the economic developments in Turkey, the Commission's approach was guided by the conclusions of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, which stated that membership of the Union requires the existence of a functioning market economy, and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. 4.2. The existence of a functioning market economy Economic policy essentials The authorities managed to bolster economic policy efforts though recent agreements with international financial institutions, in particular by the Stand-By Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Programmatic Public Sector Development Policy Loan with the World Bank. The Pre-Accession Economic Programme (PEP) submitted to the Commission in December 2005 reflects good progress in institutional capacity building and important commitments to further reform. The government steered a steady reform course, although political considerations occasionally slowed down this course. The methodology and co-ordination for budgeting and medium-term economic policy making is hampered by the fragmentation of responsibilities between government bodies. Decisions are sometimes taken on an ad hoc basis. Impact assessments are either lacking or based on partial information. In sum, the government largely maintained consensus on macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reforms. Macroeconomic stability Real annual GDP growth slowed down slightly from a high 7.4% in 2005 to 7.0% in the first half year of 2006. Private consumption and investment bolstered GDP from the expenditure side. In the first half of 2006, gross fixed capital formation growth slowed down to 19% from 24% in 2005. The external sector contributed negatively to GDP, as export growth slowed to 3.9% from 7.4% in the previous year. The rapidly growing Turkish economy ran into fast growing external imbalances. This was predominantly caused by too slow structural reforms and a sizeable increase in investment spending. The authorities reacted promptly by fiscal and monetary tightening. Recent high-frequency indicators suggest that the change in fiscal and monetary policy proved out effective. Besides, the restrictive effect on growth may be alleviated by strengthening external demand. Average per capita income amounted to just over 25% of the EU-25 average in 2005. In conclusion, economic growth has remained quite strong and has become more balanced. The current account deficit increased sharply to 6.3 % of GDP in 2005. The deficit has risen further in the first half of 2006 to 7% of GDP, driven by strong domestic demand growth, higher oil prices and lower tourism earnings. Turkey can still easily finance its current account deficit. It has recently considerably increased its foreign currency reserves as a result of very high privatisation revenues, including from foreign investors. The current account deficit was also driven by higher investment, which should enhance the export capacity of the economy over the medium term, and help reducing the external vulnerability. ",
        "- 23 - In spite of the high growth , few new jobs have been created. The unemployment rate ranges between 8% and 10% . The skill mismatch between labour demand and supply and some labour market rigidities continue to hamper job creation. Unemployment was much higher among the young (around 18%) and was of a long-term nature for more than half of job-seekers. The lower unemployment rate in the agricultural sector, which includes unpaid family workers, suggests large pockets of underemployment in the economy. In addition, the employment rate fell slightly to 43% by mid-2006. In particular, female employment remains low at 23%. Overall, unemployment remains fairly high and constant, while participation in the labour market is low and falling.

This process was driven by a tight fiscal policy, major improvements in productivity, and the strength of the lira. However, a weaker lira and higher energy prices have recently reversed this process. Consumer price inflation rose to around 10% by August 2006. Additional pressures, particularly from the exchange rate make it very difficult to reach the official end-of-year target for consumer price inflation of 5%. After strong disinflation, inflation has recently increased. In previous years, the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) had been very successful in reducing inflationary pressures. The CBT implemented a new policy framework of inflation targeting as from 1 January 2006. This was to make its policy more transparent. It uses short-term interest rates as a main instrument. Most members of the monetary committee and the CBT board, including the governor, have been recently appointed. The new policy framework, together with the new board, shifted market perception of monetary risk. This change, in combination with the globally worsening perception of emerging markets, led to a sharp depreciation of the lira. The exchange rate against the euro fell by about 25% in May-June 2006, but significantly recovered in the following months. The CBT has increased overnight borrowing and lending ",
        "- 24 - rates by 425 and 625 basis points respectively. Financial markets have recently been very volatile. Consolidation of public finances has been on track. The 2005 primary surplus target of 6.5% of GNP (IMF methodology) was roughly reached, and the general government budget deficit declined from 5.7% of GDP in 2004 to 1.2% of GDP in 2005(according to EU standards). The increase in the fiscal consolidation in 2005 stems mainly from a faster decrease in real domestic interest rates. The budget for 2006 is designed to achieve a similar public sector primary surplus. Targets for the first half of 2006 have almost been reached, in spite of the significant rise in interest rates. The laws on the social security framework were approved in spring 2006. These are an important step forward in the consolidation process, provided they are implemented in full. Overall, fiscal consolidation has been strong. General government gross debt fell markedly from 76.9% of GDP at the end of 2004 to 69.6% at the end of 2005 (ESA 95 methodology). The main factors have been a significant primary surplus, strong GDP growth and falling interest rates. Various rating agencies have upgraded the rating for Turkey. Turkey has subsequently launched various sovereign bonds on the international market. The average maturity of debt is therefore lengthening rapidly, including on domestic borrowing, to over 30 months by mid-2006. Almost 40% of public debt is denominated in foreign currency in mid-2006, compared to over 45% in 2003. This illustrates a further shift to domestic currency and decreasing vulnerabilities. The risk to macroeconomic and financial stability has been further reduced due to improvements in the public debt structure and maturities. Measures to increase fiscal transparency have continued. Emphasis has been put on the implementation of legislation adopted, in particular the Public Financial Management and Financial Control Law. Several coordinating and controlling bodies have been created within the Ministry of Finance to enhance efficiencies and transparency. This has resulted in an improvement in budget preparation. Overall, fiscal transparency has improved. Free interplay of market forces The government has confirmed the independence of regulatory and surveillance agencies. Special privileges of state-owned banks are being phased out. State-owned enterprises account now for about 5% of GDP and about 15% of the value added in the manufacturing sector. State banks make up nearly one third of the value added in the banking sector. Staff in state enterprises and banks comprises only 2.5% of total employment. In sum, progress has been made with the free interplay of market forces. The share of administrated prices in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket amounts presently to 10.2% of the total weight of the CPI basket. Price reform is not complete. For example, electricity prices are far f below production costs and include cross-sector subsidies Price liberalisation is fairly advanced, but has not made much further progress. Free market entry and exit Privatisation receipts amounted to about 2.8% of GDP in 2005. Largest privatizations included the T\u00fcpra \u015f oil refinery and the steel and iron producer Erdemir. The privatisation of Turk ",
        "- 25 - Telekom has been finalised. Delays in the privatisation of electricity distribution were incurred. Public ownership in the business sector downscaled to 5%, excluding agriculture. Overall, significant privatisation continued. In 2005, almost 100,000 enterprises were established. More than 26,000 firms went bankrupt. These numbers were about 5% higher than in 2004. Restrictions on foreign ownership still exist in the areas of civil aviation, maritime transport, road transport, ground-handling services, yachting, broadcasting, electricity, financial corporations, private employment offices, tourism, education and defence sectors. Barriers to market exit have not been significantly reduced. Adequate legal system The legal system, including the regulation of property rights, is in place . However , the time lag is sometimes long between the adoption of framework legislation and its implementation. Courts, in particular the commercial courts, work relatively slowly. The enforceability of the decisions of the authorities and of courts continues to prove difficult. This is the same for foreign investors. The expert witness system has evolved into a parallel semi-judicial structure. Training of judicial personnel is not always adequate. This hampers a swift settlement of commercial cases. The implementation of the legislation on property rights, including intellectual property rights, is not appropriate. Overall, the implementation of laws and contracts should be further improved. Sufficiently developed financial sector Banking credits rose to 110% of GDP in the first quarter of 2006 compared with 82% in the same period of last year. Efficiency of the financial intermediation has been increasing, as shown by the gradual decline in spreads between average lending and deposit rates from 6% in 2004 to 4.6% by end 2005. Increased foreign participation in the banking sector has enhanced competition. Majority-owned foreign banks accounted for about 15% of Turkish banking assets in mid-2006, compared with 5% in 2004. However, the return on assets and on equity declined. This indicates declining profit margins for the banks. The banking sector has strengthened considerably and financial intermediation substantially improved. The stock market has grown in recent years, but it remains small with just 289 companies listed on the main board at the end of September 2006. The companies listed include leading conglomerates and banks and a few large state-controlled companies. Market capitalisation is relatively low with about 50% of GDP in 2006. This is in spite of the massive increases in the main share price index in 2003-05. Banks and multinationals lead the small insurance sector. The insurance sector is currently regulated by the Treasury. The non-banking financial sector has further grown. Supervision of the financial sector has benefited from a new Banking Law. This law was adopted by the Parliament in October 2005. Consequently, the requirements and supervision will be significantly enhanced as soon as the law is fully implemented. Most of the secondary regulations have been put in place in 2006.The regulations which establish that the regulatory and supervisory power on financial holding, leasing, factoring and consumer finance companies are to be transferred to the Banking Regulation and Supervisory Agency (BRSA) are in place. Overall, supervision of the financial sector has been further strengthened. ",
        "- 26 - 4.3. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union Existence of a functioning market economy As a result of structural reforms and the process of macroeconomic stabilisation, the corporate and investment climate has been gradually improving. However, certain features which distort the functioning of markets, remained, such as low transparency regarding state aids. They constrain the competitiveness of the economy. Recent financial market fluctuations also added some uncertainty to the environment in which the private and public sector operates, but also in fact underlined the improved shock resilience of the economy. Overall, the functioning of market forces continued to improve. Sufficient human and physical capital Spending on education increased and some reforms were made . The government plans increased expenditure on education from 8.8% of total expenditure in 2004 to 12.4% in 2006. This increase not only reflects rising costs of a growing young population, but also started to enhance coverage and quality of education. Reforms include an increase of secondary education from three to four years. However, considerable income- gender- and regional differences in educational attainment and in the quality of education persist. The average knowledge level for pupils in secondary education is still low. Weaknesses in quality, transparency and accessibility of higher education remain significant. To summarize, reforms and increased spending on education are generating some positive impact on educational attainment, but significant problems remained. Labour force participation rates are low, particularly for women and older people, and declined further in 2005 and 2006. In addition, the fast-growing working-age population and the move out of agriculture sector create a strong need for job creation. There has been little systematic effort to reduce the substantial employment in the informal economy. No significant changes have been made to the labour framework. The legal focus remains on protecting jobs and less than 4% of unemployed workers get unemployment benefits. The non-wage costs of hiring labour remain large. Active labour market policies are small in scope and have had limited success in reducing unemployment. To conclude, the situation in the labour market remains challenging and policy responses have been limited. Investment continued to be strong in 2005. Gross fixed capital formation amounted to around 20% of nominal GDP. This reflected strong private capital formation which equalled 15.3% of nominal GDP. FDI inflows increased significantly in 2005, to 2.8% of GDP from a low 0.8% in 2004. The privatisation process proceeded in the first half of 2006 and supported continued strong inflows. The cumulative stock of FDI was around \u0404 1,300 per capita in 2005. Foreign ownership was most prominent in the wholesale and retail sectors where 36% of the companies with foreign ownership operated. Overall, investment - both domestic and foreign financed - grew strongly. Infrastructure investments have been suppressed to support the primary surplus target. No significant changes occurred concerning road and rail network. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline was finalised which was an important addition to the energy infrastructure. Mobile phone penetration continued to grow to 64% in March 2006. Internet subscribers increased from 1% to 2% of the population. Spending on R&D remained low. A strategy has been ",
        "- 27 - defined on how to strengthen efforts and outcomes in this area. Public spending on R&D is budgeted to increase by 20% in 2006. So far, improvements in infrastructure have been modest. Adequate sectoral and enterprise structure Progress was made with the structural transformation of the economy. The share of agriculture in employment decreased markedly during 2005, from 33% to 26% of total employment. This trend continued in 2006. Jobs were created in the industrial sector (including construction) and its share in the total labour force rose from 18% to 26% in 2005. However, job creation in industry and services was not strong enough to fully compensate for the reduction in agricultural employment. The share of agriculture in GDP decreased from 11.7% to 10.7%. Industry gained in importance, increasing from 29.7% of GDP to 31.2%. Services remained stable at around 58% of GDP. In summary, the process of structural transformation of the economy accelerated. Small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) accounted for over 75% of employment but only 27% of value added 6 Many SMEs operate in the informal economy, which restrains their ability to improve productivity. Access to finance for SMEs improved as the banking sector expanded its lending activities. However, bank loans still only cover about 10% of SME's financing needs. Owner's capital remains the major source of financing. Collateral requirements and high interest rates are the most important factors which hamper borrowing. Overall, small and medium-size enterprises (SME) remained an important cornerstone of the economy, but their efficiency was often low and informality widespread. Enterprise restructuring advanced and was supported by privatisation in some areas, such as the telecom sector. Some progress was achieved in restructuring and preparing privatisation of the state owned banks, but the process was delayed compared to the planned schedule. Efforts to restructure and liberalise the energy sector also fell behind schedule. Some of the main outstanding problems in the sector concerns cross-subsidies and large distribution losses. In the private sector, strong productivity gains indicated that restructuring of companies made progress. Overall, the restructuring process continued. State influence on competitiveness The work of the Competition Authority continued to be satisfactory and its role in the market was further supported by the privatisation process. Transparency in the corporate sector improved and accounting standards were upgraded although not yet fully implemented. No improvements were made concerning monitoring of state aids. The absence of transparent monitoring and policies to decrease distortions negatively affects the competitive climate. Public procurement policies continued to be undermined by further exceptions made to the regulatory framework. To conclude, some improvements in competition policy took place, but in certain areas deficiencies remained or worsened. Trade integration with the EU 6 Figures for 2004, no later data available. ",
        "- 28 - Exports and imports of goods equalled around 54% of GDP in 2005, up by about 3%. The share of exports destined for the EU declined from 54.5% in 2004 to 52.4% in 2005 as exports to some other markets rose more rapidly. Imports from the EU as a share of total imports also declined, from 46.6% to 42.2%. The EU remained Turkey's largest trading partner, but other markets are gaining in importance. Overall, trade openness continued to increase and the trade partners were diversified. Labour productivity improved and rose by 8% in the manufacturing sector during the year. Productivity in the public sector also continued to improve, where the number of employees decreased by 7% while productivity increased by 10%. The real effective exchange rate (REER) based on Unit Labour Cost rose considerably until February 2006. Due to sharp exchange rate depreciation, which started in May, this trend was then strongly reversed. Some strength was regained in July and August, but the REER was still at levels similar to end 2004. In summary, labour productivity continued to rise and the trend of increasing real effective exchange rate was strongly reversed. 4.4. Conclusions Turkey can be regarded as a functioning market economy, as long as it firmly maintains its recent stabilisation and reform achievements. Turkey should also be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union in the medium term, provided that it firmly maintains its stabilisation policy and takes further decisive steps towards structural reforms. The consensus on the essentials of a market-based economy has remained broadly intact. Stability-oriented macroeconomic policies have contributed to strong economic growth and growing resilience to shocks. Budget deficits and government debt levels have been significantly reduced and some key measures have been taken to enhance the social security system. The independence of regulatory and surveillance agencies has been confirmed and special privileges of state-owned banks are being phased out. The privatisation process has gained momentum. The banking and non-banking financial sectors have continued to deepen, and supervision has been further strengthened. The economy has become more open to foreign trade and investment. The Central Bank and the government continued to implement disinflation policy. The relatively high external and government financing needs remain highly vulnerable to investor sentiment, which implies a potential threat to macroeconomic stability. Therefore, fiscal consolidation needs to be further strengthened and effectively backed by structural measures. Combating unregistered employment requires attention. Labour market imbalances persist. Employment rates are very low and falling, in particular for the female population. Policy responses to these imbalances were limited and non-wage costs of hiring remained large. Average educational standards are relatively low and large disparities persisted. The business environment was negatively affected by barriers to exit and low transparency as regards state aids. The process of restructuring of the energy sector advanced fairly slowly. ",
        "- 29 - 5. ALBANIA 5.1. Introduction In examining the economic developments in Albania, the Commission's approach was guided by the conclusions of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, which stated that membership of the Union requires the existence of a functioning market economy, and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. 5.2. The existence of a functioning market economy Economic policy essentials Cooperation with international financial institutions continued to be an important anchor for economic policies. The previous IMF programme was successfully completed in November 2005 and a new three-year programme started in February 2006. The prudent monetary policy remained unchallenged and contributed to keeping inflation under control. The fundamentals of fiscal policies aimed at fiscal consolidation were pursued further. Consensus on the fundamentals and directions of economic policy was broadly maintained. Macroeconomic stability Albania's macroeconomic environment continued to be characterised by strong GDP growth and subdued inflation. However, the country suffered frequent power supply shortages for almost four months at the end of 2005. This was mainly as a result of the strong dependence on hydro sources for electricity supply and the failure of tenders for purchasing additional electricity from abroad. The repercussions of the crisis on economic growth were estimated at 0.5% of GDP in 2005, when combined with weakening economic activity in the construction sector and deceleration in export growth. The estimate of real GDP growth was thus revised downwards to 5.5% for 2005. Overall, Albania's stable macroeconomic environment was maintained. The share of people living in poverty decreased from around 25% in 2002 to around 18% in 2005. This represents more than 220,000 people lifted out of poverty during these three years. This is mainly due to sustained growth in disposable income. Considerable progress continued in reducing poverty. The trade deficit widened to 24.1% of GDP in 2005, compared to 21.7% of GDP in the previous year. Due to appreciation of the Albanian lek and stronger competition in the textile industry, growth in export of goods declined to 9% in 2005 from 23% in 2004. For the same period, imports of goods grew at 15%, mainly on the back of sustained growth and electricity imports at the end of the year. During the first semester of 2006, the trade deficit widened further by 19% on an annual basis. Part of this continuing deterioration also likely reflects the improvements in customs administration, with more goods going through the formal channels. Export base in Albania remained very low, narrow and undiversified, mainly due to a lack of non-price competitiveness, resulting -among others- from poor infrastructure and uninviting business environment. Due to deterioration in the trade balance, the current account deficit ",
        "- 30 - (excluding official transfers) recorded an increase to 7.8% of GDP in 2005, compared to 5.5% in 2004. In general, external deficits markedly widened.

Private transfers have thus become an important and relatively stable source of income. According to national sources, they have reached 33% of disposable income of an average family and almost 40% in rural areas. Gross reserves continued to rise throughout 2005. This was partly due to inflows of private transfers and foreign direct investment (FDI), but also to the Bank of Albania\u2019s foreign exchange market interventions in the first half of the year. Foreign currency reserves reached \u0404 1.2 billion at end-of 2005, a 17% increase compared to the end of 2004. This is equivalent to around 4 months of imports. External debt declined to 17.6% of GDP in 2005, from 18.0% in 2004. In general, significant remittances and other transfers from abroad continued to cover large part of the trade deficit. The unemployment rate (based on official data) declined marginally to 14.2% in 2005 from 14.4% at end-of 2004. Data for the first quarter of 2006 indicate a further decrease of the unemployment rate to 14%. The exact rate of unemployment is nevertheless difficult to assess due to significant informal employment, particularly in the agricultural and construction sectors. It can be concluded that the labour market situation improved marginally. In July 2005, the Bank of Albania (BoA) changed the direction of its operational instruments by starting to perform reverse repurchase agreements, injecting additional liquidity into the banking system. The direction of the BoA's intervention changed again in the first quarter of 2006, as it withdrew excess liquidity from the commercial banks. The key interest rate had remained unchanged until July 2006, when the BoA raised it to 5.25%, on the back of rising inflationary pressures and in order to contain the strong expansion in credit growth. The BoA examined prerequisites for a gradual change in its monetary policy strategy towards an explicit ",
        "- 31 - inflation targeting regime with the aim of enhancing transparency and credibility of its monetary policies. Overall, the monetary policy pursued by the BoA was credible. Buoyant growth in money supply, peaking in mid 2005, slowed down. A reduction of public borrowing was partly offset by a massive boom in credit induced by high demand for monetary assets. Annual growth of the monetary aggregate M3 7 thus decreased from 19% in mid-2005 to 14% in the last quarter 2005 and further down to 11% in May 2006. Appreciation pressures of the Albanian lek against the euro eased towards the end of 2005. The lek appreciated against the euro by approximately 3% in nominal terms during 2005, and remained relatively stable vis-\u00e0-vis the euro during the first eight months of 2006. Overall, growth of money supply moderated. Average annual inflation stood at 2.5% in August 2006. It followed an upwards trend since July 2005, when CPI inflation reached a low of 1.8% (year-on-year). It peaked in October 2005 (3.3% year-on-year) due to persistent pressure from rising oil prices on certain domestic prices. Average inflation reached 2.4% in 2005, remaining at the lower end of the BoA's informal 2- 4% target range. After a temporary decline in the first quarter of 2006, modest inflationary pressures resumed in the second quarter of 2006. These were derived from external developments, continuing excess liquidity in the banking sector and reduced supply of agricultural products. As a result, the Albanian lek appreciation moderated vis-\u00e0-vis the euro. In general, inflation remained moderate. In October 2005, the IMF and the authorities agreed on the remainder of the 2005 budget and key parameters of the 2006 budget. These envisaged a set of reforms for the tax administration and public finance management. These measures aimed at improving fiscal discipline, tax administration efficiency, tax collection as well as public expenditure and debt management. Preparation for a thorough analysis and reform of the pension system also gained momentum. The 2005 budget execution had been more favourable than expected, mainly due to better performance of revenues and only moderate increases in expenditures. At the end of 2005, the general government deficit had reached 3.6% of GDP against 5.1% in 2004. Given a favourable performance of the budget in the first half of 2006, a supplementary budget was adopted for the second half of the year to match higher tax revenues and customs duties collection. It envisaged additional expenditure of 2.2% of GDP mainly for infrastructure development. Total public debt declined to 55.3% of GDP in 2005 compared to 56.5% in 2004. However, very limited progress has been achieved in strengthening public debt management. The Ministry of Finance still lacks a comprehensive debt management strategy and an adequate risk management capacity. These would enable the maturity of the domestic debt to be lengthened and new debt instruments to be introduced. Fiscal consolidation has generally continued, but a more vigorous position for further debt reduction remains critical. The monetary policy of the BoA was broadly neutral over most of the reporting period with a minor upward adjustment of the main policy rate in July 2006. Further fiscal adjustment was pursued. Overall, the macroeconomic policy mix has remained broadly adequate. 7 M3 (broad money): measure of money in circulation which includes deposits in the Albanian lek + deposits in foreign exchange + currency outside the banking system. ",
        "- 32 - Free interplay of market forces The private sector accounted for approximately 80% of GDP in 2005, i.e. 5% of GDP higher compared to 2004. In the first quarter of 2006, private sector employment accounted for more than 80% of all working people, out of which 72% worked in the agriculture sector. The number of the new registered enterprises rose by almost 10,000 in 2005, a 4% increase compared to 2004. Another 7,500 new businesses were established and registered over the first five months of 2006, confirming the favourable trend towards a less informal economy. Private businesses were mainly active in trade (49%), services (24%), industry (11%) and transport (10%). In general, the private sector has expanded further. Delays in large-scale privatisation have continued, in particular in the telecommunication and energy sectors. The ratification of the sale agreement that would complete the privatisation of Albtelecom was rejected by the Albanian parliament in October 2005. This led to a review of the sale contract and the tender procedure. The privatisation of Albanian Refining and Marketing Oil failed in the absence of satisfactory bids. The privatisation of the state-owned insurance company INSIG has been prepared. Large-scale privatisation has continued to suffer further delays overall. Free market entry and exit Administrative barriers to market entry were reduced in 2006. The average time needed for business registration went down significantly from 30 days to 8. Other administrative formalities have been simplified and the Commercial Register decentralised. These measures were introduced on the basis of the new Action Plan for the Removal of Administrative Barriers, adopted by the Council of Ministers in March 2006. However, several major challenges still remain, especially the relatively high cost of starting and closing a business, the limitations of cadastral records and the size and scope of the informal economy 8 . The business climate has continued to suffer from a weak legal environment such as a lack of clearly defined property rights, from poor infrastructure, unreliable power supply and wide-spread corruption. The government appeared committed to addressing the latter. Overall, certain progress has been achieved in improving the business environment, however, despite determined government action, much still needs to be done in terms of combating corruption. Adequate legal system Delays in the courts have continued to have considerable negative effects on the business climate. This is due to the difficulty of obtaining court rulings and enforcing contracts on issues such as commercial litigation or enterprise liquidation. Land ownership rights have not yet been guaranteed, particularly in urban and coastal areas. The related legal uncertainty on collateral recovery still impedes bank lending, investment and economic development. Enforcement of property rights has continued to be weak and only marginal progress has been achieved in improving the efficiency of the judicial system. 8 The Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) estimated the percentage of value added produced by non observed economy at 30.6% (average for years 2001-2003). ",
        "- 33 - Sufficiently developed financial sector Total credit reached 14.6% of GDP at the end of 2005, compared to 9% of GDP at the end of 2004. The credit-to-deposit ratio surged further, up from 19% in 2004 to almost 29%. Credit provided to the private sector also recorded a rapid expansion, growing by 74% in 2005. This was twice as fast as in 2004. Fast growth in credit continued in the first half of 2006, reaching 65% year-on-year. Foreign currency denominated loans accounted for around 75% of the total lending stock in 2005. This continued to raise potential foreign exchange risks, requiring very prudent risk management in Albanian banks. Preparation for establishing a credit information bureau has advanced, with a view to increasing the availability of credit to small and medium- sized enterprises by improving the efficiency of credit risk management. Overall, the level of financial intermediation has increased from relatively low levels. The banking sector consists of 17 banks, of which three are fully-owned by local investors and 14 by foreign or joint-ventures. All banks are under private ownership, except for the state\u2019s 40% stake in the United Bank of Albania. The concentration of the sector remained relatively high, with the three largest banks in Albania dominating the market with almost three quarters of total deposits and almost two thirds of total assets at the end of 2005. The lending-deposit interest rate spread stood at 8% in mid 2006 for lek-denominated loans and deposits. The average return on assets increased to 1.4% in 2005, and the average return on equity to 22.2%. The share of non-performing loans to total credit remained moderate at 2.3% at the end of 2005 and increased to 3.0% by March 2006. The capital adequacy ratio decreased by 3% to 18.6% in 2005, which is still well above the minimum level of 12% established by the BoA. The banking sector has remained sound, liquid and profitable, with relatively high degree of concentration. The new law on the banking sector was approved by the Council of Ministers in July 2006 and was expected to be enacted before the end of the year. It brings the banking legislative framework broadly in line with international standards. The regulatory, governance and supervisory framework for the non-bank financial sector remained weak, lacking sufficient capacity, transparency and independence. Certain progress has however been recorded in preparing for the establishment of the new Financial Supervision Authority. This is expected to supervise insurance, pensions and capital markets. Financial regulation and supervision have generally improved. 5.3. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union Existence of a functioning market economy Economic growth was robust and reached a satisfactory degree of resilience, despite the energy crisis at the end of 2005. Fiscal indicators have continued to improve, monetary policy has been prudent and managed to keep inflation low. However, the deterioration in trade and current account deficits has increased the mid- and long-term vulnerability of the country's external position. The booming credit growth has remained a challenge in view of these external account imbalances. Overall, Albania has broadly achieved macroeconomic stability. This has contributed to its progress towards being a functioning market economy. ",
        "- 34 - Sufficient human and physical capital Primary education has been almost universally established. However, secondary and tertiary net enrolments stood at 55% and 18% respectively in 2005. The average school attainment increased to 9.6 years in 2005 (from 8.6 years in 2002), which is almost 5 years less than the OECD average. Serious educational and skill gaps exist between gender and regions (urban/rural). Education attainment has nevertheless increased slightly but overall educational and skill levels remain low. Labour market policies have led to some encouraging results in efforts to formalise employment and improve the functioning of the labour market. However, the effectiveness of programmes for attracting jobseekers has remained constrained by inadequate design, lack and irregularity of funding and insufficient training capacity. Labour market policies overall have continued to maintain a broadly flexible framework. Adequate sectoral and enterprise structure Management of public investment was passed from the Ministry of Economy to a newly established Directorate of Public Investment Management at the Ministry of Finance in 2005. This was to strengthen procedures and the institutional framework for public investment management planning, execution and monitoring. Albania's legal framework for procurement, privatisation and concessions has nevertheless remained weak. A slight fall in public investment to 4.6% of GDP was balanced by a respective increase in private investment, reaching 19% of GDP in 2005. FDI declined from 4.6% of GDP in 2004 to 3.1% in 2005. However, the figure for 2004 was boosted by the privatisation of the Savings Bank. Most of the FDI was directed to industry (28%) and transport (22%), and the remainder to telecommunication (18%), the service sector (17%) and other sectors (15%). Gross fixed capital formation has remained stable overall, representing 23.6% of GDP in 2005. The quality of the infrastructure network has remained inadequate, hindering economic development. Transport and communication sectors accounted for about 36.5% of total public investment in 2005, with the largest share (89%) allocated to road infrastructure. Around 67% of the road network was in poor or very poor condition in 2005, with 17% in fair and 16% in good condition. Almost two thirds of investments in road infrastructure have been allocated to new capital expenditure projects and only one third to maintenance and repair needs. The latter is estimated to be only 60% of what is needed. Infrastructure continues to require considerable investment. The service sector accounted for more than 54% of GDP in 2005, followed by agriculture (23%), industry (14%) and construction (9%). Industry\u2019s share of total production increased by about 3% in 2005. The share of agriculture, construction and services in the economy declined by approximately 1% of GDP each. The Albanian economy has continued to be geared towards the service sector, although the agriculture sector retains a significant share in total production and employment. The small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector accounted for about 99% of the total number of active private enterprises in 2005, contributing 64% to GDP and representing 66% of total employment.

        "- 35 - well as excessive credit and legal risk related to collateral enforcement are problems to be addressed. SMEs have continued to form the bulk of Albania's private sector activity. The operational and financial performance of a number of state-owned enterprises has strengthened 9 . However, the reform of their regulatory and corporate governance framework has not been completed. Significant deficiencies have continued to exist in the utility and railway sectors and the energy sector particularly remains one of the major risk factors for the economy. Measures to enhance electricity supply over the medium and long term and to improve the financial performance of KESH, the state power utility are needed to mitigate further negative impacts of major sector inefficiencies on economic development. The transmission network capacity and alternative energy sources to hydropower are also key factors. Overall, a high degree of vulnerability of the energy sector represented a significant source of risk to economic development. State influence on competitiveness The Competition Authority has continued its efforts to supplement the primary legislation in force by issuing a number of implementing regulations and explanatory guidelines in line with EC competition principles. Following the adoption of the Law on State Aid in April 2005, the institutional capacity in this area was further strengthened by the establishment of the State Aid Commission in March 2006 (a decision-making body with powers to authorize individual cases and schemes of state aid). In 2005, public subsidies represented a relatively low 1.6% of total expenditure of the budget, representing 0.4% of GDP compared to 0.7% of GDP in 2004. Further progress has been achieved in enforcing institutional capacity and the legal framework for competition and state aid. Trade integration with EU The value of exports and imports of goods and services rose to 67.4% of GDP in 2005, compared to 64.7% in 2004. Albania continues to be an import-oriented economy with total imports accounting for about 45.8% of GDP and total exports for only 21.6% of GDP in 2005. Trade openness has increased in 2005, but remained relatively low. The EU remained the main destination of exports in 2005 with 84% of total exports. Imports from the EU accounted for about 70% of imports. Trade with the countries of South East Europe has intensified substantially, helped by free trade agreements concluded in previous years. Exports to these countries increased by 19% in 2005 and accounted for approximately 9% of total exports according to national sources. Imports from this region recorded an even higher annual growth of 32% in 2005 and accounted for almost 15% of total imports. Overall, trade integration with the EU has remained high and regional trade integration has risen. The real exchange rate of the Albanian lek vis-\u00e0-vis the euro slightly appreciated by 3% in 2005, based on consumer prices. In the absence of reliable data on unit labour cost and profitability in the manufacturing sectors, change trends in labour productivity and price competitiveness based on real unit labour cost are difficult to trace. 9 except for KESH, the state power utility, and the Albanian Railways, whose operational and financial performance significantly deteriorated in 2005 ",
        "- 36 - 5.4. Conclusions Albania has broadly achieved macroeconomic stability. This has contributed to its progress towards being a functioning market economy. Further considerable reform efforts must be vigorously pursued also to enable it to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. Political consensus on the essentials of economic policy has generally been maintained. Albania broadly maintained macroeconomic stability. Economic growth continued to be strong and reduced poverty levels. The macroeconomic policy mix remained adequate. Monetary policy was credible and managed to keep inflation low. Fiscal consolidation further advanced and reforming the public and tax administration contributed to improved fiscal stance. Administrative barriers to market entry were reduced. However, the deficits of external accounts markedly widened and the export base remained very weak. Albania's legal framework for procurement, privatisation and concessions needs to be improved. Shortcomings in the business climate, such as legal uncertainty and weaknesses in law implementation, poor infrastructure, or unreliable power supply impede economic development. Enforcement of property rights continued to be weak and only marginal progress was achieved in improving efficiency of the judicial system. Strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework for the non-bank financial sector constitutes a major challenge. Efforts in tackling and formalizing the considerable grey economy need to be further accelerated. The privatisation process is not yet completed and the restructuring of state-owned enterprises, in particular of the electricity utility, needs to be pursued without delay. ",
        "- 37 - 6. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 6.1. Introduction In examining the economic developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission's approach was guided by the conclusions of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, which stated that membership of the Union requires the existence of a functioning market economy, and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. 6.2. The existence of a functioning market economy Economic policy essentials Efforts were made to improve coordination of economic and fiscal policies. The National Fiscal Council (NFC) started its work in 2005, with the aim of coordinating and setting targets for fiscal policy. However, since its establishment, the NFC has operated without a clearly defined legislative basis and lacks mechanisms to enforce and break deadlocks. As a result, it has encountered frequent stalemates and its decisions have not been considered binding. Disagreements have been frequent on how to allocate indirect tax revenues between different levels of government. Progress on finding a legal solution to strengthen fiscal coordination has been slow and no concrete results have so far been achieved. The need for improved coordination has increased with the introduction of the single account as this receives the revenues from indirect taxes. Overall, coordination of and agreement on economic and fiscal policies between different levels of government have remained problematic . The analytical capacity to support coordinated economic and fiscal policy making has improved, but from a low base. The authorities have taken over the task of compiling fiscal data from the IMF. They have also taken greater responsibility for the budget process, where the IMF and the OHR had previously played an active role. A law was adopted which creates an institutional basis for economic policy analysis at the state level. Analytical capacity at state level has also strengthened. The track record in keeping agreed policy promises has been mixed and backtracking has occurred in several cases. Bosnia-Herzegovina did not fully comply with World Bank agreements, particularly regarding the Federation. To summarize, analytical capacity improved but remained rather weak and policy coherence was often lacking. Macroeconomic stability The economy grew by an estimated 5.5% in 2005, down from 6% in 2004 10 . The economy has continued to be based strongly on raw materials and related manufacturing. Rising raw material prices as well as volume increases have played an important role in supporting growth. Privatisations, mainly in the RS, have also triggered some production increases in other sectors. In the RS total industrial production rose by nearly 20% in 2005 and had increased to 25% in 10 Estimates for growth in BiH vary between different sources. Estimates for 2005 mostly range between 5% and 6% of GDP. ",
        "- 38 - August 2006 year-on-year. The Federation experienced a more moderate growth rate in industrial production of 5% in 2005 and of 5.5% in August 2006 compared to a year earlier. However, detailed analysis of economic developments is impeded by poor availability of statistics. To conclude, economic growth remained relatively strong but the growth base was narrow. Export growth was supported by improved reporting as well as stronger performance in some sectors. Still, the merchandise trade deficit was 53.3% of GDP 11 in 2005. The current account deficit expanded from 20.8% of GDP in 2004 to 22.5% in 2005. However, a large part of the widening was driven by increased imports in the fourth quarter of 2005 in the run-up to VAT introduction. It was matched by a sizeable reduction of the current account deficit in the first half of 2006, as exports grew by 30% and imports weakened by 1.5% compared to the same period the previous year. After adjusting for the effects of VAT introduction on imports, the current account deficit seems to remain fairly stable at around 20%. In summary, despite some temporary improvements, underlying external imbalances continued to be large.

Other types of investment inflows grew significantly in 2005, to 13% of GDP, and financed over half of the current account deficit. These inflows were partly a result of transfers from foreign parent companies to their banks to finance increased lending and higher capital requirements. Such mainly banking- related investment inflows decreased somewhat in 2006, but their role in financing the current account deficit remained strong. Inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) fell from 7% of GDP in 2004 to around 5.2% in 2005 and decreased further to 3.9% of GDP in June (year-on- year). Errors and omissions in the balance of payments statistics remained large at around 20% 11 grey economy not included ",
        "- 39 - of the current account deficit. Overall, the current account deficit was mainly financed by FDI inflows and inflows via the private sector. External public debt continued to decrease and reached 27.2% of GDP at end of 2005. Most loans are on concessional terms and the debt service was therefore only 4.1% of the value of exports in 2005. However, the private sector's external indebtedness increased. Total external debt was estimated to be close to 60%. To summarise, total external debt grew as a result of increased private sector borrowing. Progress has been made in setting out new conditions of repayment for different types of claims on the government related to the war and pre-war period. For frozen foreign currency deposits, a state level framework law was adopted which outline conditions for debt restructuring. Legal frameworks concerning the restructuring of war damage claims have been adopted at entity- level. However, amendments to the law, aiming to shorten the repayment time drastically from 13 to 5 years, was put forward but not yet voted upon. An agreement to restructure the debt to the net present value of 10% of GDP was previously struck down by the courts and future arrangements will be more costly. Restitution claims are estimated to be large and the terms of restructuring therefore fiscally important, however, no solutions have yet been agreed or adopted. Overall, some progress has been made in addressing the issue of domestic debt claims, but uncertainty remains about the final fiscal impact. Official data show that unemployment rose from 43% in 2004 to 44.6% in 2005. Using ILO definitions, unemployment was estimated at 31% in April 2006. Taking informal jobs into account, unemployment is estimated to be closer to around 20% of the working-age population, although no recent official estimate is available. Unemployment remained largely of a structural nature. It also varied considerably with educational levels and was high among the young. Employment creation in the formal sector has stagnated. The informal sector has absorbed some of the new entrants and laid-off workers, increasing informal employment. In conclusion, job creation remained slow and unemployment very high. Inflation reached 7.6% in January 2006, compared with only 0.4% a year earlier. The main 12 underlying factor was price increases related to VAT introduction, but higher energy prises and increases in regulated prices also played a role and influenced price increases in other sectors. Inflation slowed down in the first months of 2006 and reached 6.8% year-on-year in March but then picked up again. In August 2006, inflation reached 7.1% in the Federation and 9.8% in the RS year-on-year. Overall, inflation rose substantially from low levels, mainly driven by supply side factors. Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to operate a currency-board arrangement. The Convertible Mark (KM) remained pegged to the euro. The main policy tool has been the rate of reserve requirements for commercial banks, which was further increased to 15% of liabilities at the end of 2005. The upward trend in foreign exchange reserves has continued. Net foreign reserves increased by 20% in euro terms during 2005 and covered 4.2 months of imports. Reserves rose another 17% in the first 7 months of 2006. In summary, the currency board remained the anchor for monetary policy and reserves continued to increase. Fiscal policy was tightened in 2005, but public spending is high and increasing. The 12 Retail Price Index ",
        "- 40 - consolidated budget balance switched from a deficit of 0.6% of GDP in 2004 to a surplus of 0.9% in 2005 13 . This change stemmed from stronger sales and excise tax revenues and a reduction in expenditures. However, the state and entity budgets for 2006 were expansionary and reflected the pre-election climate. The increases were mostly of a permanent nature. In addition, a War-Veterans Law adopted in the Federation will significantly raise expenditures. Despite some rebalancing of budgets in mid 2006, government expenditure is therefore set to increase from an already high level of around 50% of GDP 14 and the fiscal position is likely to worsen. Government expenditures remained inefficient and the large resources spent generated weak outcomes. Overall, public expenditures increased from a high level while efficiency in spending stayed low. A single VAT rate was successfully introduced across the country in January 2006. This was an important reform supporting the creation of a single economic space and the reduction of the grey economy. Total indirect taxes increased by 30% in the first seven months of 2006 compared to the previous year, but the increase was partly due to temporary factors. The size of the permanent revenue increase is therefore still uncertain but is not likely to fully cover the increases in expenditures. In summary, the introduction of VAT has been a success and has resulted in increased revenues. Exports have been increasing, but are composed of a small and mostly raw-material based range of products. This makes revenues sensitive to commodity prices and the growth base narrow. The persistence of a large current account deficit reflected high private consumption and an insufficiently dynamic and partly loss-making corporate sector. The large imbalances represent a particular challenge in the context of the currency board and require prudent fiscal policies. Looming fiscal pressures, from for example the unsettled domestic debt and costs for institution building, therefore pose a particularly significant risk. The willingness and ability have been limited in tackling the underlying structural problems and viewing fiscal policies in the long term. To conclude, despite relatively high growth and low inflation, there are threats to macroeconomic stability. Free interplay of market forces Private sector activity reached 55% of GDP in 2005, up from around 50% in 2004. In the RS, the privatisation process proceeded and 38 companies were sold. Almost all of these were larger enterprises. A detailed plan on the privatisation of Telekom Srpske was adopted in June 2006 and the tender procedures were launched in September. Amendments to the Federation's Law on Privatisation, supporting some improvements to the process, were enacted in mid 2006. From the initial nominal capital intended for privatisation in the RS, 40% 15 remains to be privatised mostly in the utilities and infrastructure sectors. The privatisation process slowed down further in the Federation and 13 companies were sold. This mainly reflected a lack of political will, a complex institutional decision-making structure and an inadequate legal framework. 60% of the initial capital nominated for privatisation in the Federation remains to 13 Includes all levels of government, off-budget funds and foreign-financed projects 14 grey economy not included 15 According to law, 15% of privatised capital needs to be given to state controlled pension and restitution funds. If the numbers are adjusted for this, around 50% of initial capital remains in state hands. ",
        "- 41 - be privatised. Overall, progress in privatisation has been uneven and the size of the public sector is still large. Coordinated efforts to improve the business climate were weak. At the State level, the Association of Employers was responsible for identifying problems and barriers but had little influence over policies. The RS started its own initiative to identify administrative barriers and initiate changes, but the process was still at an initial stage and had not yet influenced the operational climate for companies. In summary, no significant improvements of the business environment were observed. Free market entry and exit In 2005, starting a company involved 12 steps and took on average 54 days, which was 5 days more than in 2004. The cost for business registration has remained high, although it has varied across the country. Acquiring all the relevant licences and permits to start operations took on average 467 days and was particularly costly ( (25 times GDP per capita). Registering property took on average almost a year and involved 7 different steps. The laws adopted in 2004 and 2005 allowing for the creation of a single business registration system have not been fully implemented, due mainly to a lack of technical capacity. These were aimed at reducing registration times and costs. Overall, starting a business has remained time-consuming and costly. Since the adoption of new bankruptcy legislation in 2003, some gradual improvements have occurred. The average time to process a procedure has been reduced from 3 to 2 years and over 400 cases have been initiated in the courts. However, thousands of companies are still facing insolvency and have not yet been put into bankruptcy procedure. To conclude, some improvements have been achieved concerning bankruptcy procedures. Adequate legal system The country has a relatively high number of courts, but there is still a large backlog of unresolved cases. Political interference in the system has occurred. Overall, the legal system still hampers the business environment. Sufficiently developed financial sector Banking operations have continued to grow strongly and total assets have increased from 68.6% to 80% of GDP. This growth was supported by a continued expansion of lending to the private sector from 38% to 46% of GDP. The number of banks increased from 33 to 34. Foreign banks dominate the sector and their ownership increased further to 73% of total capital. Privatisation of banks has been completed in the RS, but in the Federation six banks have remained in public hands. They accounted for 13% of total banking sector capital. In 2005, the banking sector represented around 80% of total financial sector assets. Overall, the banking sector has continued to expand rapidly and is dominated by foreign banks. Interest rate spreads between loans and deposits narrowed from 6.6% in 2004 to 5.4% in 2005 amid increasing competition. Return on equity rose from 5.8% to 6.4%. The lending expansion was partly financed by the foreign parent companies. This resulted in an increase in long-term ",
        "- 42 - foreign liabilities of the sector by 34% in 2005. Increased lending also resulted in a fall of the capital adequacy ratio from 18.7% to 17.7%. The share of non-performing loans for the sector as a whole has continued to decrease. To summarise, competition in the banking sector has increased. The two stock exchanges both increased their market capitalisation by around 70% in 2005. The number of traded securities more than doubled and total capitalisation increased to around 60% of GDP at the end of 2005. However, most of the shares traded were in investment funds. The RS adopted a Securities Market Law supporting better operation of markets and tougher disclosure principles. To conclude, stock market capitalisation has grown rapidly and some improvements in the regulatory framework have occurred. Banking supervision was conducted by two separate entity banking agencies, and was coordinated by the Central Bank. The approach shows clear limitations in the increasingly integrated banking sector, but no agreement could be reached on how to merge supervision. Laws to strengthen the regulatory framework for micro finance institutions have been adopted in both entities. Supervision for other parts of the financial system, such as insurance, is fragmented and still developing. Leasing operations have remained outside the scope of supervision. Overall, supervision of the financial sector has remained fragmented and is underdeveloped in certain areas. 6.3. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union Existence of a functioning market economy The functioning of market forces is hampered by the strong influence of the public sector in the economy and the weak business environment and legal climate. Despite some improvements, markets are also sometimes fragmented between the entities. Overall, the macroeconomic setting provided a fairly stable environment for market actors, but the institutional and legal framework was often not supportive of private sector development. Sufficient human and physical capital Several laws to support reforms in the educational sector have been prepared, such as state- levels laws on Higher Education and on an Education Agency, but have not yet been adopted. The sector is being managed by a total of 23 organisations at different levels of government. The resources spent are comparatively large but outcomes are weak Enrolment rates are relatively low for secondary and higher education. There are substantial mismatches between the labour market and the knowledge provided by education, particularly for vocational training. There are also large regional disparities in student performance. This is a reflection of limited harmonisation and coordination across the country and differences in funding. To conclude, in the educational sector structures have remained inefficient and outcomes weak. Laws at entity-levels aimed at simplifying the complex direct income taxation systems have been prepared. In the RS a new legal framework has been adopted, while in the Federation proposed legislation has been rejected by the parliament. The institutional structure has remained complex. There are 12 separate organisations responsible for employment service operations and another 13 for labour market policies. Labour market legislation was fairly ",
        "- 43 - harmonised across the country, but there were still large differences in some areas, concerning unemployment benefits, for example. In addition the legal framework is rigid and non-wage labour costs high. The laws prepared in the two entities differed and taxation rules continue to be different between the entities. Overall, limited progress was achieved in improving the functioning of labour markets. Active labour market programmes existed at both state and entity levels. The scale of policies have remained modest and focussed on subsidising employment rather than enhancing skills. However, the large number of institutions involved in active labour market policies complicated the systematic development of policies. Mobility of workers has remained low and labour markets continued to be fragmented. To conclude, coordination of labour market policies was weak and the labour market remained fragmented. The FDI stock per capita reached \u0404 495. Around 58% of total FDI went to the industry and 16% were directed to the banking sector. Yearly FDI inflows decreased from over 7% of GDP in 2005 to around 4% of GDP in mid 2006, mainly as a result of lower privatisation-related inflows. The institutional framework and capacity to deal with R&D issues have remained weak and fragmented. Overall, FDI inflows remained strongly linked to the privatisation process and the R&D framework remained weak. Adequate sectoral and enterprise structure The share of employment in manufacturing decreased during 2005 by around 1%, to 22% in the Federation and 23.5% in the RS. The share of formal employment in agriculture remained low, at around 2.5% in the Federation and 3.5% in the RS 16 . However, official statistics do not include a large part of the working population. Overall, the share of different sectors in total employment seemed to remain fairly stable. Both entities have separately performed some SME related activities, but with a lack of coordination of policies. A comprehensive draft SME strategy was blocked due to opposition to the proposed creation of state-level structures. Business-government dialogues and training to support entrepreneurship have been weak. To conclude, responsibilities for SME policies continued to be fragmented. The RS adopted a law allowing enterprises to be privatised to reschedule their debt. This was to assist their restructuring and sale. In the Federation however, legal changes implied that debt can be rescheduled without any real restructuring of the company taking place. Corporate governance practices generally remained deficient. Large parts of the corporate sector, both privately and publicly owned, need restructuring. The lack of incentives for managers and owners to embark on restructuring remained a major obstacle to change. Some legal changes have been adopted in the RS concerning the Privatisation Investment Funds, to improve ownership structures and incentives to restructure mainly in the voucher-privatised companies. Overall, progress in enterprise restructuring continued to be slow although some improvements were made to the regulatory framework. 16 Labour force survey data however showed that real employment in the agricultural sector was around 20% and employment in industry 30% in April 2006, with no comparative older data available. ",
        "- 44 - Utilities and infrastructure facilities stayed publicly-owned. Generally the regulatory frameworks have improved, but remained weak with fragmented responsibilities. In the energy sector, reforms concerning unbundling of transmission have proceeded. Progress towards liberalisation and increased competition has been slow. To conclude, utilities and infrastructure remained publicly-owned and despite some improvements in regulatory structures the frameworks remained weak. State influence on competitiveness The Competition Council, created in 2004, started to play a concrete role in the market. It was given more power, improved its alignment with the acquis and expanded its regional coverage. Public procurement procedures improved and progress was made in establishing the full institutional framework foreseen in the law. However, no improvements have been made in the area of state aid and there has been no monitoring or comprehensive information on the scope of state aid. The state level has no competence in this field and state aid is mainly provided by several lower levels of government with little transparency. An Intellectual Property Institute has been established but is not yet fully operational. In summary, some progress has been achieved in improving the competitiveness climate. Trade integration with the EU Trade in goods and services as a share of GDP amounted to 122% in March 2006 year-on-year, compared to 117% in 2004. Imports constituted 83% of GDP. The EU has remained the most important trading partner. In 2005, trade with the EU increased and its share of total trade decreased and reached 53% of exports and 50% of imports. In the first quarter of 2006, exports to the EU increased considerably to 59% of total exports. Exports to neighbouring countries with Free Trade Agreements in place increased from 39% to 42% of total exports in 2005. 70% of trade has been achieved with five countries, three of which are in the EU. This points to a dependency on developments in a few markets. The composition of exports has continued to be narrow. Minerals, metals and related products accounted for 40% and chemicals and wood products accounted for another 20% of total exports. To summarise, trade openness continued to increase but with a continued dependency on a few markets and products. Real effective exchange rate (REER) of the KM depreciated slightly in January to October, but then regained its value and was close to its level a year before at the end of 2005. In the first half of 2006, the REER remained fairly stable. The main influences of the REER are fluctuations in the exchange rate with some of the neighbouring countries. These are the main trading partners outside the Euro area. Overall, price competitiveness has remained broadly stable. 6.4. Conclusions Bosnia and Herzegovina has made limited progress towards being a functioning market economy. Considerable additional efforts are also needed in order to be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. ",
        "- 45 - Coordination on fiscal policies deepened and a value added tax (VAT) was successfully introduced in January 2006 across the country. The analytical capacity to support policy making improved to some degree. Economic growth remained robust. Fiscal consolidation continued. Reported exports picked up in the first half of 2006, supported by the VAT introduction and increased production for some commodities. Privatisation continued, in particular in the Republika Srpska, and certain legal changes were adopted to support enterprise restructuring. However, reforms in many areas remained slow. Imbalances in the trade and current accounts continued to be very large, reflecting an insufficiently dynamic enterprise sector and strong private consumption. The base for economic growth continued to be narrow. The fiscal stance in the country has not properly reflected the large macroeconomic imbalances. Decision- making processes on economic and fiscal policy in the country remain complex and not sufficiently coordinated. In addition, pressures on public spending increased in spite of its already relatively large size. Also the efficiency of public expenditure is still relatively low. The business climate and corporate governance remained overall weak. Privatisation and corporate restructuring was slow, in particularly in the Federation. Large parts of the enterprise sector are still not sufficiently restructured. ",

Introduction In examining the economic developments in Montenegro, the Commission's approach was guided by the conclusions of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, which stated that membership of the Union requires the existence of a functioning market economy, and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. 7.2. The existence of a functioning market economy Economic policy essentials The government adopted an Economic Reform Agenda for Montenegro (2002-2007), which provides the guidelines and the macroeconomic framework followed by the authorities. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank fiscal frameworks and targets are adopted as references. Moreover, authorities at all levels recognise the need to harmonise with EU directives and recommendations as common goals. However, the adoption of proposed legislation often suffers significant delays in the parliament. Overall, the country has maintained a broad consensus on the essentials of economic policies. Macroeconomic stability In 2005, real GDP rose by 4.1%. This reflected strong growth in tourism and financial services and construction particularly, whereas industrial production declined. In the first half of 2006, GDP grew by 6.5% in real terms. Almost all sectors registered growth over the same period in the previous year, but especially civil engineering and tourism. Industrial production fell by 1.9% in 2005, reflecting problems in some key enterprises which have a large effect on the economic activity of Montenegro. This concerns the lack of funds for carrying out repairs and maintenance at the coalmine complex in Pljevlja, with the resulting shortage of coal to feed the associated power plant. The reversal of the privatisation of the Steelworks Niksic also had an effect, following the new owner's withdrawal in November 2005. In the first half of 2006, industrial output rose 2.9% year-on-year, driven by strong performance of mining and quarrying, industry and utilities. The manufacturing industry recovered in June, registering a 2% year-on-year growth, following two months of contraction. The highest improvement was recorded, in the industrial sub-groups of food manufacturing and wood production, as in 2005. The current account deficit widened to 12.2% of GDP in 2005, mainly due to an increase in the trade deficit, which rose to 34.2% of GDP, after 27.1% in 2004. This widening was driven by robust domestic demand, especially consumer goods, and a limited export capacity, mainly consisting of low-processing products. In contrast, the balances of services, income and transfers reached a combined net surplus of 22.1% of GDP, due to growing tourism activity and workers remittances. The privatisation of Telekom Montenegro, Podgorica Aluminium Plant and Podgoricka Banka contributed to a record FDI inflow of 22.8% of GDP in 2005. This more than offset the current account deficit. Moreover, the current account deficit further deteriorated in the first quarter of 2006. It registered a deficit amounting to 13.1% of GDP, induced by investment-related increases in imports of services. By contrast, exports of goods rose sharply ",
        "- 47 - by 43.3% year-on-year, whilst imports of goods rose by 18.6%. The ratio of exports to imports reached 49.2%, up from 42.5% in 2005. Foreign direct investment ( FDI) amounted to \u20ac173 million in the first half of 2006. The previous year\u2019s record high FDI were mostly achieved through privatisation receipts, whereas in 2006, they are mostly from additional investments following privatisation operations, as well as from greenfield projects. Important discrepancies exist between the different sources and measurement of unemployment. The registered unemployment rate fell to 18.6% in 2005 from 22.3% at the end of 2004, and recorded 15.7% in July 2006. By contrast, unemployment according to international definition was up to 30.3% in autumn 2005 (LFS data), from 27.7% in the same period of 2004; that is an increase of 8.4%. This however is likely to overestimate the actual level of unemployment as workers with non standard contracts (e.g. part-time jobs, occasional/casual work, jobs with seasonal, temporary or fixed term contracts) are not recorded as employed by the national LFS. In the same period, the decline of employment (LFS) apparently accelerated. Unemployment is dominated by very long-term unemployment and remains chronic among young people (nearly 60% of the 15-24 years old population, according to the LFS). Overall, unemployment remains high and there is a mismatch between employers' needs and workers\u2019 skills. Inflation has remained relatively subdued. Retail price inflation registered 2.3% on average during the first half of 2006, down from 3.4% in 2005. During the first six months of 2006 industrial prices rose by 2%, agricultural products' prices by 7.2% and services' prices by 1.3% year-on-year. Overall, prices of goods have remained higher in the period from January to June 2006 by 2.3%. Montenegro has continued to use the Euro as legal tender. The only monetary policy instruments are reserve requirements, and the issuing of treasury bills as an indirect possibility to influence interest rates. The Central Bank changed reserve requirements for banks to 19% for demand deposits and term deposits with up to 90 days maturity on 1 February 2006. This was raised to 5% for term deposits with maturity of more than 90 days, but less than one year. Money supply (broad money) growth accelerated to 53.3% year-on-year in June 2006. This increase and its low impact on inflation reflect the ongoing financial deepening process in the country. The general government deficit slightly widened in 2005 to 2.9% of GDP from 2.6% in 2004. In 2005 the budget benefited from exceptionally high privatisation receipts. The share of VAT in total tax revenues remained substantial at 29.3%. Fiscal reforms have been accelerated, including the adoption of a centralised Treasury, and a new tax system. Budgetary revenues are further increasing, as several laws with a fiscal impact entered into force in January 2006. In the first half of 2006 the budget recorded strong revenue growth of 29.7% year-on-year and exceeded the budget plan by 13.5%. VAT proceeds were 31.7% above the target and contributed to around 50% of total revenues. However, excise revenues and personal income tax revenues were lower than expected, 6.1% and 1.9% respectively. Meanwhile, budget expenditures only grew moderately by 1.6% year-on-year. Overall, the fiscal position tightened and a budget deficit of around 0.6% of GDP was recorded during the first half of 2006, although the size of public expenditures remains relatively high. Total public debt was 39.9% of GDP at the end of June 2006. This was equivalent to 703 million (including public and socially owned enterprises). General government debt further ",
        "- 48 - decreased in 2005 to 42.6% of GDP, while debt service rose to 6.4% of GDP, twice the amount of 2004. Government debt is composed of 27% domestic and 73% foreign liabilities, the latter mainly concerning the World Bank Group. In July 2006, Montenegro reached an agreement with Serbia on the division of financial rights and obligations of the former state union. The agreement confirmed the previous estimates of the debt levels. Overall, the macroeconomic policy mix is not completely appropriate. The general government deficit widened to a relatively high level against the backdrop of falling wage competitiveness of the export sector and rising external imbalances. Free interplay of market forces In May 2006 entered into force the Law of cessation of the law on social control of prices. Only a small number of products or services relating to natural monopolies or public and communal utility services are subject to administrative price control. Retail fuel maximum prices are adjusted every two weeks in line with changes of crude oil prices on international markets and exchange rate dynamics of the US dollar against the Euro. The government transferred the control of energy prices to the Energy Regulatory Agency in July 2005, in accordance with new rulebooks. Price liberalization and regulation is almost complete. The government launched a project for the restructuring of 97 companies to be either privatised or liquidated in 2005. By the end of 2005, some 80% of company capital had been privatized, and 272, of a total of 386 formerly state and social-owned enterprises are now privately-owned. There are still some 67 public and socially-owned enterprises in Montenegro. 15 are still owned by the central government. Information on the financial performance of these enterprises is not made public. Major companies in public ownership include a power utility and companies in the transport sector such as the railways, ports, airports and an airline. The share of land in private hands increased slightly in 2005 to 67.8% at the end of the year from 67.2% at the end of 2004. Overall, there has been further progress in the development of the private sector. Free market entry and exit Registration can be performed in four working days by submitting three documents. Two relevant laws were passed in December 2005: amendments to the accounting law brought this law into compliance with international accounting standards, and amendments to the Licensing law aimed at simplifying the registration procedure at local level. However, the business environment is hampered by regulatory obstacles, particularly at municipal level. There are significant price discrepancies for granting licenses for the same purpose. This is especially the case in licenses for land use, where local fees for installing power or telephone lines in some municipalities are higher than the expected commercial profit. Overall, business registration procedures are quite efficient. Adequate legal system The Commercial Court is the main institution for contract enforcement and guaranteeing property rights. More streamlined procedures have improved its efficiency. The initial backlog of more than 2000 cases inherited upon its creation in 2002 was reduced to 219 pending cases in the first half of 2006. In this period, 84% of cases were finalised, 90% of which were ",
        "- 49 - resolved within three months. Judges are obliged to solve commercial disputes within 30 days. The capacity of the judiciary to deal with commercial disputes has improved. Sufficiently developed financial sector Financial intermediation has deepened. Total credit growth rose by 34% year-on-year at the end of 2005, compared to nearly 40.3% a year earlier. In the same period, deposits rose sharply by 78.2%. Bank lending to the private sector amounted to 19.3% of GDP at the end of 2005, rising from 15.7% at the end of the previous year. The average interest rate spread of commercial banks at the end of 2005 was 6.6%, and narrowed to 3.9% at the end of June 2006. Overall, financial intermediation has improved. 86.2% of the sector is already privatised and only one bank remains to be privatised. A new foreign-owned bank entered the market in February 2006, raising the number of banks to 10. The share of foreign capital in total capital reached 61% in March 2006. The three largest banks account for about 66.4% of the assets. Two banks merged in 2005, creating the second largest bank with a 37.3% market share. The banking sector recorded a profit of \u0404 4.2 million in 2005. However, improvement in the financial performance resulted almost entirely from reducing one bank\u2019s losses. The ratio of non-performing loans rose for its part, by almost 2% at the end of 2005. Overall, the banking sector is mostly privately owned and moderately concentrated. Risk control is largely in compliance with the basic \u201cBasel principles\u201d. The Central Bank has strengthened its regulation and supervisory practices. The Credit register became operational in April 2005. However, commercial banks will need to wait until the second half of 2006 or even 2007 for the Central Bank to start exchanging data with them. E-banking services were introduced in Montenegro in 2005. However, further efforts remain necessary to manage and identify country risk and bank transactions. Overall, banking supervision complies broadly with international standards. The volume of trade on both stock exchanges increased sharply, reaching 12% of GDP in 2005, more than three times higher than in 2004. More than two thirds of the share turnover was accounted for by the shares of 10 companies. The Telekom shares are far ahead of the others. Both Stock Exchanges registered a significant increase in the prices of shares and stock indexes, following the country's independence. Overall, stock market turnover has increased sharply. 7.3. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union Existence of a functioning market economy Macroeconomic stability has been broadly maintained. However, economic growth has remained dependent on a few key sectors and enterprises and external balances have widened. Sufficient human and physical capital High dismissal costs of six months average salary and inflexible employment contracts continued to discourage companies from hiring, especially young people. Wage setting ",
        "- 50 - mechanisms only concerns nominal wages in a limited number of economic sectors. These factors are compounded by the high tax wedge of about 41% of total labour costs for employers. An increasing number of jobs are of an irregular nature or informal. The number of job seekers continues to be higher than demand at all educational levels. The highest mismatch relates to secondary education, representing 73% of total unemployment in 2005. Overall, labour markets have remained fairly inflexible. Human resource development is a pressing priority that requires additional efforts. Active measures do not sufficiently address the groups having the greatest difficulties in accessing employment, in particular young people, women and long-term unemployed. ALMP provision remains unbalanced with not enough results enhancing employability and adaptability of those unemployed. Resources are limited and not efficiently allocated. Data on capital stock and investment in the economy are not available; however, FDI inflows surged in 2005 to 22.8% of GDP compared with just 3.3% in 2004. 51% of FDI were in non- financial services. The robust FDI growth in the manufacturing and financial sectors is a consequence of accelerated privatisation. FDI inflows in 2006 are mostly due to additional investments following privatisation and greenfield projects. Government capital expenditure increased to 3% of GDP in 2005. There is virtually no investment in research and development. FDI inflows have surged overall. The telecommunications sector is fully privatised. In the energy sector, one of the two hydropower plants is under reconstruction, while the other has obtained a foreign loan for reconstruction. The privatisation process has started of the thermal power plant and part of the adjacent coalmine. The privatisation of the power company is still under preparation. The oil distribution company Montenegro Bonus still remains state-owned. Overall, privatisation of network industries is well advanced. Adequate sectoral and enterprise structure There is no information on the sectoral distribution of value added in the economy. The distribution of employment by economic sector in 2005 was 72.1% in services, 19.2% in industry and 8.6% in agriculture. Almost 20% of employment is in the public sector. Employment in industry increased by 1% and decreased in agriculture by 8%. Services increased by 1.1% whereas employment in the public sector diminished by 1.1%. The sectoral composition of employment has continued to evolve. The number of SMEs increased by 7.1% in 2004 to almost 28,000 at the end of 2005. They generated 62% of GDP in 2005 and accounted for 36.8% of the registered employment. The number of SMEs further grew by 4.5% in 2006, totalling around 30,000 at the end of June. The Self-employment Programme of the Employment Agency financed programmes for a total value of \u0404 3.5 million in 2005, creating some 1,000 new jobs. The agency also trained more than 2,000 persons in the first half of 2006. Support to small and medium-sized enterprises is mainly provided in the form of credits through a programme, which was established in 2005. Overall, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) further increased their role in the economy. A new tender for the privatisation of the steel mill was launched in July 2006. The previous buyer withdrew in November 2005 after 16 months\u2019 operation. The government cancelled the ",
        "- 51 - privatisation contract and took over the mill in January 2006. The government has taken over the total of the steelwork's debt, to facilitate the new privatisation tender. 580 workers have left through the redundancy programme. Other sectors are also in need of major restructuring. These include the railways company, the port of Bar and the power company (EPCG). Overall, some further restructuring is needed. State influence on competitiveness Budget transfers to socially-owned enterprises are negligible (1.1% of GDP in 2005), however, debt and arrears from some companies to the government remained significant and difficult to determine. A project initiated by the Government and commercial banks in 2004 has also provided more than 600 loans to SMEs. The tourism sector has benefited from a new reduced VAT rate of 7%, instead of the former 17% rate, since January 2006. Exports are also exempt from VAT. Although publicly-owned enterprises are subject to the same taxes as private firms, the sales of Montenegro Airlines and the postal company are exempt from VAT. Airline ticket sales are considered exports and postal services are considered essential. Under current legislation, foreign investors are treated the same as local ones. Overall, government intervention has diminished. Trade integration with EU The share of imports of goods and services rose to 67.1% of GDP (2004: 63.2%), and exports decreased to 44.5% (2004: 45.7%). The commodity structure of exports is fairly concentrated. Exports of raw or intermediate materials, mostly unalloyed aluminium, accounted for 56% of all exports in 2005. 48.9% of total exports went to the EU in 2005. The EU is also the main exporter to Montenegro. 40.3% of total Montenegrin imports came from the EU. Serbia accounted for 36.8% of total exports, (mostly metal products, food, beverages and tobacco), and 34.8% of imports, (principally agricultural and chemical products, and machinery). Montenegro is also a relatively large exporter of services, mainly as a growing tourist destination. Total tourism revenues amounted to 12.5% of GDP in 2005, and surged by 20% year-on-year in the first seven months of 2006. Preliminary data shows that overnight stays were 14.7% higher than in the same period of the previous year. Overnight stays for foreigners accounted for more than half of this number. Overall, trade openness has slightly risen. The CPI-based real exchange rate vis-\u00e0-vis the euro remained roughly stable. However, wages continued increasing in 2005 by 6.7% in real terms, and even by 17% year-on-year in the first half of 2006. 7.4. Conclusions Montenegro has made some progress towards being a functioning market economy. Further reform efforts must also be pursued in order to enable it to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. The country has maintained a broad consensus on the essentials of economic policies. Macroeconomic stability is getting firmer. In particular, economic growth has gained pace and inflation has remained subdued. Public debt has been reduced and budgetary revenues ",
        "- 52 - increased further. Foreign direct investment remained robust. Price liberalisation is almost complete. The privatisation programme is well advanced and business registration has been further facilitated. The capacity of the judiciary to deal with commercial disputes has improved. Financial intermediation has deepened and the restructuring of network industries is underway. However, economic growth remains dependent on a few key sectors and enterprises. External imbalances widened. The labour market remains rigid and unemployment high. The financial audit system, both for internal and external controls, needs to be upgraded. The business environment is still hampered by the regulatory environment, including at municipal level. The level of infrastructure investment is low. Debt and arrears from some public enterprises to the government are very significant. The state aid structure must be strengthened. A system of ex ante control of all new aid measures needs to be set up. Public enterprises are still awaiting further restructuring and the privatisation plan is only partly completed. Trade openness and trade integration with the EU has recently risen, but is still at fairly modest levels. Privatisation procedures need to be efficient and fair. ",
        "- 53 - 8. SERBIA 8.1. Introduction In examining the economic developments in Serbia, the Commission's approach was guided by the conclusions of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, which stated that membership of the Union requires the existence of a functioning market economy, and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. 8.2. The existence of a functioning market economy Economic policy essentials In 2005, consensus on economic policy was maintained. In 2006 however, views on the direction of economic policy began to diverge between the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of Serbia. In May 2006, the authorities adopted a comprehensive economic policy which sets out a generally sound medium-term macroeconomic framework and an ambitious structural reform agenda. Plans to increase investment from privatisation revenues starting in 2006 cast serious doubt on the Government's ability to implement this framework. Such plans could even jeopardize macroeconomic progress to date. Cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank has continued to be an important anchor for economic policy making in 2005. However, the authorities have not yet decided whether to request a successor arrangement to the recent IMF programme. The latter was successfully concluded in February 2006. Overall, consensus on the direction of economic policy and reform was generally maintained in 2005, but started to diverge in 2006. Macroeconomic stability In 2005, real GDP grew by 6.3% compared to 9.3% in 2004. Strong gains in commerce, transportation and financial services, more than offset the drop in agriculture and construction. Growth remained strong at 6.7% year-on-year in the first half of 2006. Industrial production recovered in the second half of 2005, following a slump in the first half. This resulted in a modest 0.6% annual growth rate for the whole year compared to 7.2% in 2004. The rebound in 2005 was due to a good performance by the electric power, gas and water sector (up 6.9%). The highest growth rates were achieved in those sectors which had undergone substantial privatisation or restructuring in recent years, i.e. food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals, rubber and plastic products and base metals. During the first seven months of 2006, total industrial production expanded at a rate of 7.8% year-on-year. However, manufacturing production, which accounted for 75% of industrial production, declined by 0.8%. Overall, economic recovery continued at a somewhat slower pace. In 2005, the Serbian current account deficit decreased to 9.8% of GDP, from 12.6% in 2004, due to strong growth of exports (up 13.2% year-on-year) and declining imports (down 6.7% year-on-year). The latter was partially the result of VAT introduction in January 2005 and the related acceleration of imports in December 2004. As a result, the trade deficit fell to 23.1% of GDP in 2005 compared to 29.8% of GDP a year earlier. However, imports still remain at about 2.5 times the level of exports. During the first seven months of 2006, imports resumed to ",
        "- 54 - expand at 26.4% year-on-year while export growth remained robust at about 26.2% year-on- year. Consequently, the trade balance has widened again by about 26.6% compared to a year earlier . In summary, stronger export growth has contributed to a lower deficit of the current account. Capital inflows increased in 2005 and reached \u20ac 3.6 billion compared to \u20ac 2.4 billion in 2004. Foreign direct investment (FDI) rose to about 5.7% of GDP in 2005 from 4.3% of GDP in 2004, predominantly related to privatisation. Greenfield investment remained negligible. In addition, medium- and long-term borrowing increased to \u20ac 1.5 billion from \u20ac 1.2 billion in 2004, with the largest increase in borrowing coming from the private sector . Foreign currency reserves of the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) increased by \u20ac 1.6 billion to \u20ac 4.9 billion in 2005. In the seven months to July 2006, foreign currency reserves increased further and reached \u20ac 6.7 billion, which is equivalent to more than 6 months worth of imports. However, external debt of the Serbian economy has risen again, following several years of decline. Inflows of debt-creating external financing, mostly to the private sector, accounted for about 7.1% of GDP in 2005. At end-July, total foreign debt reached about 66% of GDP. The private sector debt stock stood at about 34% of GDP and exceeded for the first time the official sector debt stock which stood at 32% of GDP. Debt service has increased to 5% of GDP. In summary, strong capital inflows and related central bank interventions in the foreign exchange market helped boosting foreign currency reserves, while external debt has risen.

Moreover, overall employment continued to decline by 197.000 to 2.7 million in 2005. The unemployment rate, adjusted for those registered unemployed not actively seeking work, rose to 20.8%. However, partly due to large informal employment, the official unemployment rate has declined to 27%. Long-term unemployment remained chronic, with an average duration of 44 months in 2005. Youth unemployment is severe and stood at a rate of about 48%. ",
        "- 55 - Agriculture, including small scale farming remains a sizeable source of employment. The informal sector remains substantial and is estimated to represent more than one third of employment. Important regional disparities exist both in employment and unemployment. High unemployment remained a significant economic problem. In response to strong capital inflows, the NBS has substantially intervened in the foreign exchange market in an attempt to prevent a real appreciation of the dinar, but also to further boost foreign exchange reserves. Domestic money market liquidity has grown strongly, linked to the foreign exchange interventions. Dinar reserve money and broad money (M3) grew by 22% and 42% year-on-year, respectively. This has fuelled strong credit growth to the private sector (57% year-on-year) and added to domestic demand pressures. To counterbalance the liquidity effect of the foreign exchange interventions, the NBS attempted to absorb liquidity by selling government and NBS bills and raising reserve requirements several times during 2005 and early 2006. The NBS has also allowed for a slower nominal depreciation of the dinar (8.7% year-on-year compared to 15.4% in 2004 vis-\u00e0-vis the euro), resulting in a moderate real appreciation (3.1% year-on-year). In early 2006, the NBS began to reduce foreign exchange interventions and allowed for greater market flexibility. As a result, the dinar has appreciated vis-\u00e0-vis the euro by about 7.9% between May and September 2006. In September 2006, the NBS has adopted a monetary policy framework of inflation targeting. Overall, monetary policy has been challenged by strong capital inflows, robust credit growth and high inflation. In December 2005, inflation stood at 17.5% year-on-year compared to 13.8% in 2004, mainly driven by increases in administered prices following the rising costs of fuel imports and the one-off effect of the VAT introduction. In addition, inflation was further affected by strong domestic demand combined with a relatively unresponsive supply side, lack of competition in domestic markets and widespread exchange rate indexation of prices. Core inflation, which excludes agricultural products, energy and services with administrative price controls, stood at 13.5% year-on-year in December 2005. In 2006, retail price inflation, without the effect of the VAT introduction and supported by the recent appreciation of the dinar, eased somewhat and reached 11.6% year-on-year in September. In general, inflation remained at double-digit rates. The consolidated general government budget reached a surplus of 0.6% of GDP in 2005, compared to a deficit of -0.9% of GDP in 2004. Revenue collection improved by 1.6% year-on- year in real terms. Apart from VAT, personal and corporate income tax grew in real terms (4.6% and 27.1%, respectively) as well as non-tax and capital revenue (9.7% and 11.2%, respectively). Other revenue categories however, saw a substantial decrease, mainly due to cuts in tax rates. For the same period, expenditures declined by 0.4%, due to permanent cuts in subsidies and transfers. The 2005 reform of the pension system will provide result in additional permanent savings in the coming years. In general, fiscal consolidation continued in 2005, but further efforts have come to a halt in 2006. For the first quarter of 2006, public revenues grew by 4.5% year-on-year in real terms, driven by strong gains in personal and corporate income tax (15.5% and 75.2%, respectively). This was more than offset by the decline in VAT revenues (by 14.8%). Expenditures grew at 4.7% during the same period, since wages and salaries, purchases of good and services, as well as capital expenditures grew stronger. In addition to increased expenditures already under way since the beginning of the year, the government has launched a national investment plan worth about \u20ac 1.6 billion for 2006 and 2007, to be completely financed by privatisation proceeds received in 2006. A continuation of recent fiscal trends could however contribute to an ",
        "- 56 - aggravation of macroeconomic imbalances, especially inflation and the current account deficit, and risks jeopardizing macroeconomic progress to date. The general government debt of Serbia has declined by 7 percentage points of GDP to 61% of GDP in 2005, 54% of which was denominated in foreign currency. This exposed Serbia to considerable foreign exchange risk. In 2006, public debt has receded following the \u20ac 600 million Paris Club debt write-off. This was linked to the successful completion of the IMF programme in February. Although structural fiscal adjustment continued in 2005, fiscal policy turned expansionary in 2006. Monetary policy has been tightened to curb credit growth, as strong capital inflows and a high degree of currency substitution have posed a challenge for policy makers. Further measures, in particular fiscal retrenchment, are needed to increase domestic savings, reduce external imbalances and help reducing inflationary pressures. Overall, the macroeconomic policy mix was largely adequate, but fiscal consolidation needs to be strengthened. Free interplay of market forces The share of the private sector in GDP remains at 55%, whereas state and social ownership still governs a large part of Serbia\u2019s output. The absence of a larger share of private sector activity is an obstacle for the provision of a dynamic supply of competitive domestic products and services, and adversely affects inflation and external accounts. Overall, despite substantial progress in privatisation in recent years a competitive and dynamic private sector has not yet been fully established. The privatisation of socially-owned companies has advanced, helped by amendments to several key laws in 2005 (laws on privatisation, share fund and financial markets). The provision which allow for the write-off of debts towards the state at the moment of sale is particularly helpful. However, the process of restructuring the large insolvent companies selected by the Government has progressed slowly. The Government still needs to resolve, through sale or bankruptcy, the core assets problem of Zastava and RTB Bor, which are two problematic socially-owned enterprises from a social and fiscal standpoint. A tender for sale was launched in September 2006 for RTB Bor. In general, privatisation has continued while enterprise restructuring advanced only slowly. Free market entry and exit Two new company registers have been set up since August 2005, covering financial leasing and personal pledges. However, delays occur due to issuing tax identification numbers. In 2005, about 1,000 bankruptcy procedures were registered, which is still a relatively small number considering the scope of the problem of ailing firms. Processing cases has also remained slow. In September 2005, a new competition law came into effect. However, much remains to be achieved as far as implementation is concerned. In general, progress has been made in the areas of company registration and bankruptcy and competition legislation. Adequate legal system The operation of commercial courts has improved in terms of number of cases handled and the average number of days needed to complete court procedures. The Government has adopted a ",
        "- 57 - national strategy for the reform of the judicial system, which is expected to have an impact on the effectiveness of commercial courts. The law on arbitration was adopted in May 2006. The operation of commercial courts has improved. However, the judicial system has scope for further improvements. Sufficiently developed financial sector In 2005 and early 2006, five state-controlled banks were sold and two further sales are expected by end-of-year. Foreign ownership in the banking sector accounts for about 77% of assets. The five largest banks account for about 50% of the market. However, in an environment of strongly expanding credit to the household and enterprise sectors (94% and 45% year-on-year, respectively), the ratio of non-performing loans stood at 23% at end-of 2005. In addition, the large share of bank lending effectively denominated in foreign currency pose a potential threat to financial stability. The National Bank of Serbia has strengthened its regulation and supervisory practices. The minimum capital adequacy ratio was increased from 10 to 12%. A new banking law, aligning current practices towards the Basel Core Principles was adopted. However, effective implementation remains an issue, as witnessed by the slow progress in the implementation of the Supervisory Development Plan. The degree of currency substitution remained high as foreign currency deposits accounted for 71% of total deposits. In general, privatisation of the banking sector has continued well. Little progress was made with the development of the capital market. Equity prices recovered in the last quarter of 2005. Activity in the secondary bond market, dominated by state bonds on frozen foreign currency deposits, has been favourable. Bond yields continued to decline due to the continuous inflow of foreign capital and the improvement in the country's credit rating. Capital market legislation has been updated with parliament adopting the law on investment funds and amendments to the law on security markets and other financial instruments in May 2006. However, volumes have remained low and traded stocks accounted for about \u20ac 500 million on the Belgrade Stock Exchange. Overall, the capital market is not yet sufficiently developed. 8.3. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union Existence of a functioning market economy Macroeconomic stability has been broadly maintained. However, the functioning of market mechanism to allow for an efficient allocation of resources has been hampered by the still strong involvement of the public sector in the economy. Sufficient human and physical capital Foreign direct investment (FDI) reached a record level of \u20ac1,192 million in 2005. In the first seven months of 2006, FDI amounted to about \u20ac 770 million. The sectors benefiting most from FDI were the financial sector, construction and the processing industry. FDI per capita more than doubled to \u20ac 390 compared to \u20ac 165 in 2004. Government expenditure on research and development accounted for about \u20ac 50 million or 0.25 of GDP in 2005. Serbia's future association with the 7 th research framework programme will generate positive effects in this ",
        "- 58 - area. Gross capital formation declined to 18.7% compared to 21.4% in 2004. Public investment declined to 2% of GDP, compared to 2.8% a year earlier. In general, the need of physical capital remains high. Adequate sectoral and enterprise structure The restructuring of large state-owned companies continued, from a low base. Preparations for the restructuring and privatisation of several large state-owned companies have intensified concerning non-core activities and assets as well as the reduction in overstaffing. Some privatisation strategies are under preparation. However, major problems regarding the operations of these companies have not yet been addressed. Such problems include the inadequate institutional and legal set-up, over-employment, weak transparency and accountability, as well as substantial vested interests. The authorities have not shown their full commitment to address these issues. In summary, the restructuring of large state-owned companies is still in an early phase. Serbia made preparations for a proper regulatory framework for network industries. The Telecommunication Agency started operations at the beginning of 2006. The Energy Regulatory Agency currently employs 25 staff and receives support from the European Agency for Reconstruction. Its current work programme focuses on the development of methodologies and tariffs structures. There was progress in the creation of a necessary regulatory framework and establishment of regulatory agencies for network industries. The structural composition of the economy changed. In 2005 and early 2006, strong gains were recorded in commerce, transportation and financial services whereas agriculture, construction and industry declined. In 2005, transportation and communication grew by 23%, wholesale and retails trade expanded by 22% and financial intermediation reported gains of 17% over the previous year. The agriculture sectors share in total output decreased by 5% mainly due to unfavourable weather conditions that substantially reduced production of some crops. However, the share of the agricultural sector in the total output remains high at about 15%. In general, the structural shift of the economy continued towards the service sector. Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) activity has been growing and SMEs now account for about 55% of total employment, 32% of total capital and 53% of total revenue. Although credit to the private sector has been growing strongly, access to long term financing continues to adversely affect SMEs' fixed capital investments. In addition, SMEs are hampered by a low level of financial liquidity and a high degree of indebtedness. The relevance of (SMEs) is growing. This sector faces financing difficulties. State influence on competitiveness There have been instances of substantial direct government interference with the economy. In January 2006, the government revoked the licence of a mobile phone operator and temporarily took control of its operations. This was achieved by overriding the telecommunication regulatory agency's competences. In general, direct government intervention in the economy remains prevalent. ",
        "- 59 - Net average earnings grew by 23.6% and 6.4% year-on-year in 2005 in nominal and real terms, respectively. Wage growth accelerated during the first five months of 2006 and net average earnings recorded an increase of 25.4% and 9.5% year-on-year in nominal and real terms, respectively. In summary, wage growth remained strong, but broadly in line with productivity gains. Trade integration with the EU In 2005, exports and imports to and from the EU accounted for 56% and 49% of total exports and imports respectively. For the first five months of 2006, exports to the EU grew to 59% of total exports, while imports from the EU fell marginally to 48% of total import. The other major trading partners of Serbia remain the Central and Eastern European countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States, accounting for 30% and 7% of exports and for 12% and 21% of imports respectively. Overall, foreign trade continued to grow and integration with the EU advanced. 8.4. Conclusions Serbia has made notable progress towards being a functioning market economy. Stabilisation and reform efforts need also be continued in order to enable it to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. Consensus on the direction of economic policy and reform has generally been maintained in 2005. Economic growth has continued. The current account deficit has narrowed, helped by recovering exports. Foreign currency reserves have been boosted by strong capital inflows in the form of privatization proceeds as well as corporate and commercial banks\u2019 foreign borrowing. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has continued to grow predominantly related to privatisation. Monetary policy has been tightened and fiscal consolidation continued in 2005 due to cuts in expenditure and strong tax receipts. General government debt has declined. Tangible progress has been made in pension reform and company registration. Privatisation of socially-owned companies and of the banking sector has advanced. Preparations for restructuring and privatisation of state-owned companies have intensified. There was a certain progress in creating the necessary regulatory framework for network industries. Economic integration with the EU advanced. However, inflation and external deficits remained relatively high. Since early 2006, fiscal consolidation has stopped. The envisaged acceleration of public investment risks jeopardising further fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability. External debt has risen as borrowing of the private sector has increased. Unemployment has further risen. Greenfield investment remained negligible. The enterprise sector remained overall weak, also due to lack of competition in domestic markets and slow progress in corporate restructuring, privatisation and market exit procedures. The new bankruptcy legislation is not yet applied frequently. Capital markets remained in an infant stage. State intervention in the economy has remained prevalent. ",
        "- 60 - 9. KOSOVO (UN 1244) 9.1. Introduction In examining the economic developments in Kosovo, the Commission's approach was guided by the conclusions of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, which stated that membership of the Union requires the existence of a functioning market economy, and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. 9.2. The existence of a functioning market economy Economic policy essentials The budget remained the main macro-economic variable of adjustment under the current monetary situation with the euro as legal tender. The authorities finalised the first Medium- Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in March 2006 on the basis of which a donor meeting took place in early April 2006. In line with the requests from the international community, this MTEF consolidated all budget and off-budget expenditure and resources and covered both recurrent and investment expenditures, including public investment projects. A medium-term economic policy framework was defined with the support of the IMF by a Letter of Intent and a Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies, which aims to ensure a sustainable fiscal path. It was then signed by UNMIK and Provisional Institutions of Self Government (PISG) in November 2005. Consensus on the fundamentals and directions of economic policy was maintained. However, substantial weaknesses in compliance with the agreed policies and commitments surfaced in the first half of 2006 as their implementation lacked guidance and monitoring. Macroeconomic stability Economic developments continued to be shaped by a decline in donors\u2019 support and a lack of dynamism of the economy. According to IMF estimates 17 , GDP is estimated to have declined by 0.2% in 2005. There have nevertheless been some signs of recovery over the first half of 2006, mainly due to the resilience of private sector activity. Significant increases in the number of new businesses registered, tax revenues, and trade, as well as steady growth in credits provided to businesses are underlying this trend. Kosovo has a per-capita GDP of around \u0404 1,100. The World Bank estimates that around 37% of the population live in poverty, with around 15% living in extreme poverty. The negative growth in 2005 is a particular concern in view of the territory's considerable development needs. The overall economic situation in Kosovo remained bleak. The trade deficit of Kosovo continued to be considerably high, at around 43% of GDP in 2005. The current account deficit -after foreign assistance- remained close to 15% of GDP in 2005. The exports remained extremely low (14 times lower than imports in 2005), mainly due to a lacking export capacity and competitiveness. Given the limited foreign direct investment (FDI) 17 Macroeconomic data in this report are based on the IMF staff estimates, except otherwise indicated. ",
        "- 61 - inflows, the financing of the current account deficit continued to rely on foreign assistance (decreasing from 24% of GDP in 2004 to 21% of GDP in 2005) and, to a lesser extent, on private capital transfers (17% of GDP in 2005). Still, a modest gradual increase in FDI inflows has been recorded, in the wake of acceleration of the privatisation process. It reached 3.0% of GDP in 2005. This positive trend continued in the first half of 2006. Overall, the external accounts of Kosovo have remained precarious.

However, the real unemployment rate might be lower due to the existence of a sizeable informal economy. Long-term unemployed represented 90% of the total registered unemployed. The number of registered job seekers increased by 6% year-on-year to around 320,000 in 2005 and further to over 323,000 by June 2006 18 . Labour costs in Kosovo remained excessively high in regional terms, dampening private sector development and export competitiveness. Registered female unemployment accounted for almost two thirds of the total. Overall, the level of registered unemployment remained high. The euro continued to be the main currency in circulation. The Central Banking Authority of Kosovo (CBAK) 19 is in charge of regulating foreign exchange operations, providing payments services and supervising banks and other financial institutions. The CBAK closely monitors liquidity in the banking sector and credit expansion, with liquidity ratios and reserve 18 M2: measure of money in circulation which includes all physical denominations of coins and currency, demand deposits, and travellers' checks, plus net time deposits (other than large certificates of deposits) 19 In August 2006, the SRSG signed a new regulation transforming the Banking and Payments Authority of Kosovo (BPK) into the CBAK. ",
        "- 62 - requirements as main tools of intervention. The monetary aggregate M2 20 declined by 3% in 2005 and remained stable in the first seven months of 2006. The monetary framework remained anchored on the use of the euro as sole legal tender. The downsizing of the international community's presence continued and led to deflation. The international community in Kosovo had boosted prices in the early years of UNMIK's mandate. Its downsizing resulted in adjustments downwards, also reflecting the weakness in economic activity. Consumer price index inflation fell on average by 1.9% in 2005. The relative price adjustment continued also in 2006 as the general price level further decreased by 1.3% over the first seven months of 2006 21 . Inflation remained negative. The budget deficit was curbed down after a peak in 2004 at 6.0% of GDP to 3.2% of GDP in 2005. The share of capital expenditure fell from 23% in 2004 to 19% in 2005. The reserve of accumulated cash deposits, the only source of financing the deficit, fell by \u0404 70 million in 2005, reaching \u0404 113 million at end-of-year. Given a foreseeable exhaustion of this reserve in the near future and the impossibility of the PISG under the current UN mandate to finance the deficit through public borrowing, the fiscal situation has become particularly tense. In the first half of 2006, revenue collection met the budget target, while expenditure was realized only up to 71% for the same period 22 . This resulted in a budget surplus of \u0404 76 million by 2006, which was higher by 139% than in the same period in 2005. Capital investment realized over the first semester of 2006 registered the most significant decrease and amounted to 45% compared to the same period last year. Fiscal policy has been tightened. Good progress was achieved at the end of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 in the authorities' efforts in complying with Letter of Intent commitments. However, the second quarter of 2006 saw lesser efforts by the authorities, particularly in promoting and facilitating a sustainable fiscal position over the medium term. This concerns the promulgated Law on War Martyrs. Implementation of this Law would have considerable costs and lead to an unsustainable fiscal situation. In addition, little progress has been achieved in targeting social benefits to the most needy and in developing the civil service reform. Co-operation with the IMF and full compliance with the commitments in the Letter of Intent needs to remain an absolute priority for the authorities of Kosovo. Overall, the macroeconomic policy mix was broadly adequate. However serious challenges remain in implementing the policy framework contained in the Letter of Intent. Free interplay of market forces Private sector investment accounted for 20% of GDP in 2005. Privatisation of socially-owned enterprises progressed markedly in 2005 and continued in 2006: the 18 th wave was launched in August 2006. The Kosovo Trust Agency aimed at privatising 90% of total assets and 50% of the total number of socially-owned enterprises by the end of 2006. By June 2006, 178 enterprises have been tendered and 143 sales contracts have been signed. As a result, total 20 Source: Kosovo Business Register 21 Source: Statistical Office of Kosovo (SOK). In 2006, the SOK changed the methodology for calculating the CPI. The historical data were however not revised accordingly and thus, the reliability of annual inflation estimate for July 2006 was limited. 22 Data of the Ministry of Economy and Finance ",
        "- 63 - privatisation proceeds amounted to 10.5% of GDP by September 2006. The sale of Ferronikeli, an industrial minerals company, was concluded in April 2006, and represented the most important privatisation operation so far. The private sector further expanded, also on the back of acceleration of the privatisation process. Free market entry and exit The number of new businesses registered increased considerably, by 29% in 2005, corresponding to over 11,000 new registrations. The total number of registered businesses stood at 53,700 at the end of June 2006 23 . Kosovo had a short (on average 23 days 24 ) and lean (requiring 5 procedures) market entry process in 2005. In addition, the average cost of starting a business (5.5% of income per capita), rigidity of employment index and number of days needed to register a property appeared to be relatively low. However, due to an inefficient judiciary and to legal uncertainty with respect to enforcement of property rights, Kosovo showed high levels of indicators measuring costs to create collateral, the average number of procedures to resolve a dispute (requiring on average 22 procedures) as well as regards costs to close a business (18% of the respective estate). Kosovo continued to offer a business-friendly environment in terms of minimum administrative requirements for market entry. However, deficiencies in law enforcement and the judicial system, corruption, uncertainty over property rights and the status, as well as poor infrastructure and unreliable electricity supply, continue to impede investment and economic activity. Adequate legal system The efficiency of the judiciary system and law implementation remained low and only little progress was made in enforcement of court rulings and the establishment of property rights. The business environment and investment activity in particular continued to suffer from legal uncertainty. This was also due to the unresolved status of Kosovo, contingent liabilities and wide-spread fraudulent practices. Overall, the fundamentals of the legal framework of Kosovo remained sound and market-oriented. However, significant shortcomings in the rule of law continued to hamper economic activity and investment. Sufficiently developed financial sector The level of financial intermediation remained low. At the end of 2005, loans reached only 21% of GDP and assets 39% of GDP. The main factors behind are high interest rates (the spread between the deposit and loan rates is more than 12%), low competition in the banking sector and legal uncertainty, including concerning the recovery of collateral. Credit growth remained substantial (38% year-on-year in 2005 and 30% year-on-year as of July 2006, down from 61% in 2004). In particular, loans with a maturity of over one year grew by around 50%. Recently the structure of credits shifted towards long-term credits and credits provided to non- financial corporations. However, most of the loans have still been of a rather short-term maturity, mainly due to the reluctance of banks to take significant risks. 23 Source: Kosovo Business Register 24 Indicators covering quality of the business environment mentioned in this report are based on the World Bank's \"Doing Business\" business conditions index methodology ",
        "- 64 - The volume of non-performing loans decreased slightly to 2.5% in 2005. The CBAK launched the Kos-giro project in 2005, which introduced a new system for processing domestic payments. The aim was to develop low value / high volume retail transactions. Although the system was fully operational, it was not yet accepted by all commercial banks. The Credit Register of Kosovo was established to improve the efficiency of the banking sector. Credit expansion continued, nevertheless from relatively low levels. The capital adequacy ratio of commercial banks was 14.7% at the end of 2005, down from 16.7% in 2004. Local banks remained very liquid, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of around 61% at the end of 2005 and 70% in July 2006. This was partly as a result of high prudential requirements set by the CBAK. The CBAK also increased minimum capital requirements for banks to \u0404 5 million in 2005 to bring capital standards more in line with EU directives. The minimum liquidity reserve ratio remained at 10% of the banks' deposits. The competition in the banking sector remained limited. In March 2006, the CBAK revoked the licence and ordered the closure of the Credit Bank of Pristina, with little detrimental impact on the credibility and liquidity of the overall financial sector. Since then, there have been only six commercial banks operating in Kosovo. As a result, the degree of concentration of the three largest banks further increased in terms of assets by 6%, reaching almost 80% of total banking sector deposits. Around 55% of the equity of all banks was owned by foreign capital at the end of 2005. The banking sector in Kosovo appeared to be sound, profitable and well capitalised. Still, the available financial indicators should be interpreted with caution. 9.3. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union Existence of a functioning market economy A continuous and rapid shift from donor-financed investment to investment financed from the budget has created substantial pressure on both fiscal and external sustainability. Macroeconomic stability has not yet been satisfactorily achieved in Kosovo so far, mainly due to the fragile fiscal and unsustainable external position. Sufficient human and physical capital The education system in Kosovo suffered from a lack of necessary capital investment. The adult illiteracy rate in Kosovo remained high, at around 6% of the population. The municipalities, which had the administrative and financial responsibility for primary and secondary schools, continued to lack adequate resources which were previously provided by donors as well as necessary administrative skills. The overall education expenditure provided from the Consolidated Budget amounted to 4.7% of GDP in 2005. It remained stable as compared to 2004. In addition to capital investment, the quality of education needs to be further enhanced. Local infrastructure continued to urgently need maintenance, repairs, upgrading and extension, especially the energy and transport infrastructure. Investments were often delayed, leading to under-spending in budgeted capital expenditure in 2005. This was, mainly due to a lack of institutional capacity for procurement. The power supply infrastructure remained unreliable and frequent power cuts negatively affected private sector productivity. Local companies ",
        "- 65 - considered this as the biggest single impediment to enterprises performance and investment. KEK, the electricity utility, was not able to reduce operational and technical losses and substantially improve its financial situation. It was only able to respond partly to local energy consumption needs and a large share of KEK's considerable financing needs could not be met. As a consequence, electricity had to be imported. Infrastructure remained insufficient and often of poor quality, in particular in the energy sector. Investment dropped somewhat in 2005 and was estimated at around 27% of GDP. Private investment nevertheless picked up in 2005 and accounted for about 72% of the total in 2005, increasing from 61% in 2004. Half of private investment was allocated to housing. However, these figures should, in the absence of reliable economic statistics, be interpreted with caution. They could be revised considerably in future revisions. Investment provided by foreign donors more than halved in 2005, accounting for 6% of the total. Government capital expenditure decreased by 23% to 5.9% of GDP in 2005 and by 45% in the first half of 2006 compared to the same period last year. Gross fixed capital formation remained insufficient in view of the considerable investment need. Adequate sectoral and enterprise structure Only limited reliable data on the sectoral structure of production and employment were available for the reporting period. The share of the main sectors was relatively stable according to the first set of national accounts prepared by the Statistical Office of Kosovo for the years 2002-2004. The contributions to GDP in 2004 were as follows: agriculture and fishing 9% of GDP, mining, manufacturing, electricity and water 15% of GDP and services 76% of GDP. Shifts in sectoral structures in the Kosovo economy are not well recorded. Small firms continued to represent the bulk of businesses in Kosovo. The number of enterprises of less than 9 employees accounted for 99% of all registered enterprises in 2005. Sole traders or single owner businesses represented 94% of total number of enterprises. Almost half of the SMEs undertake trade-related activities 32% production facilities, while 18% are service based, according to a survey conducted in 2005 by the Department of Private Sector Development under the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Nearly 61% of SMEs were managed by their owner. Kosovo Investment Promotion Agency was established following the introduction of the Law for SMEs in September 2005, to support and assist foreign investors. Overall, high cost and difficult access to external finance, unreliable power supply and underdeveloped infrastructure remain the main barriers to business. State influence on competitiveness Incorporation of publicly-owned enterprises (POEs) progressed markedly. The Kosovo Post and Telecommunications utility and Pristina Airport were incorporated in June 2005, while the incorporations of KEK, UNMIK Railways (re-named Kosovo Railways) and two District Heating enterprises were completed at the end of 2005. Preparations for another round of incorporation started in the last quarter of 2005. These will include water, waste and irrigation enterprises, with the support of international donors. Progress was made in unbundling KEK ",
        "- 66 - into two subsidiary enterprises 25 . This is in line with provisions foreseen in the Energy Community Treaty, signed in October 2005 and put in force in mid-2006. Little progress was however recorded in bringing KEK closer to financial sustainability by improving poor billings and collections. This is a crucial issue and needs to be tackled without delay. In the current circumstances KEK is unviable and represents an impediment to economic development. KTA introduced in 2006 a Code of Corporate Governance for POEs, based on OECD guidelines which established a set of minimum corporate governance standards. Considerable subsidies continued to be provided to public enterprises and socially-owned enterprises, mainly KEK and Trepca. These constitute a major burden on the budget. Subsidies and transfers provided from the Consolidated Budget reached 3.6% of GDP or 12% of the budgeted revenues in 2005. Around 70% of the total subsidies was allocated to KEK (2.5% of GDP) and around 17% to the industrial company Trepca (0.6% of GDP). Trade integration with the EU The value of Kosovo's exports and imports of goods and services accounted for about 70% of GDP in 2005. Imports accounted for 57% of GDP, slightly higher than in 2004. Exports to the EU represented about 36% of total exports in 2005, according to national sources. Imports from the EU accounted for approximately 35% of total imported goods and services. Kosovo's exports continued to be directed mainly to South East European countries, which accounted for almost 60% of the total exports in 2005. The main countries of destination were the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (20%), Serbia and Montenegro (14%) and Albania (11%). Imports from the South East European countries represented about 48% of the total imports in 2005. The main countries of origin for the imports were the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (19%), Serbia and Montenegro (14%) and Turkey (7%). The degree of openness of Kosovo's economy somewhat increased in 2005. Kosovo\u2019s export structure continued to be geared towards lower value-added goods. Metals and scraps together with plastics and wood together account for almost 70% of Kosovo's total exports 26 . A decrease in the share of skin and leather products in total exports was compensated for by a gradual increase in food products. These also increased in absolute terms. The main commodity products imported to Kosovo in the first quarter of 2006 were mineral products (22%), machinery and electronic equipment (15%) and food products (13%). 9.4. Conclusions Kosovo has made limited progress towards being a functioning market economy. Considerable additional efforts are also needed in order to be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. 25 These are the independent Transmission, System and Market Operator JSC, owning the fixed assets relating to the transmission network, and KEK JSC, the entity dealing with power generation, distribution and supply. 26 Source: SOK, based on the first quarter 2006 data ",
        "- 67 - Consensus on the essentials of economic policy in Kosovo has been broadly maintained. Monetary stability continued to be underpinned by the use of the euro as sole legal tender. Fiscal policy has been tightened, reflecting a rapid decline in donors' support and foreseeable exhaustion of the reserve of accumulated cash deposits. In line with a key European partnership recommendations, a medium-term economic policy framework for Kosovo has been established, which aims at ensuring a sustainable fiscal stance. The first Medium-Term Expenditure Framework was adopted, providing a consolidated overview of budget and off- budget financing needs, including public investment projects. Privatisation of socially-owned enterprises progressed markedly. Considerable progress has been achieved in the incorporation of publicly-owned enterprises which is a key European Partnership priority. However, macroeconomic stability has not yet been satisfactorily achieved so far, mainly due to the fragile fiscal and unsustainable external position. Unemployment remains high, also due to excessive labour costs. These costs also dampen private sector development and export competitiveness. Serious challenges remain in implementing the policy commitments taken by the authorities, in particular as regards a sustainable fiscal policy stance over the medium term. An inefficient judiciary and legal uncertainty with respect to enforcement of property rights continue to hamper economic activity. Access of small and medium-sized enterprises to external finance is limited. Infrastructure remains insufficient and often of poor quality. The power supply remained unreliable, hindering economic development. Restructuring of publicly- owned enterprises, in particular of the Kosovo Energy Corporation, need to be further accelerated. "
