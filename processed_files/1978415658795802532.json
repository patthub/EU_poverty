        "Non-technical summary Empirical cross-country evidence on saving behaviour, various saving motives and perceived credit constraints is rare. The prominent role of the household sector in the recent financial crisis underlines the relevance to understand these important aspects of household behavior. We improve upon earlier studies and analyze a large number of saving motives and perceived liquidity constraints by using the new and comparable Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) across 15 countries in the Euro zone. A cross-country view gives insights into how country- specific institutional settings shape saving behaviour and how differently formal lending channels are developed. Since the data is from 2010-2011, strong conclusions regarding the present are difficult to draw. This is because the crisis may have affected the data, especially in countries that were severely hit. Nevertheless for the survey years 2010-2011, we find that 11% of euro area households report to have expenses above income. Mainly households whose head is female, young or divorced are significantly more likely to have expenses exceeding income; in contrast, wealthier households are less likely to incur in expenses higher than income. We also find evidence of households being rather confident in the possibility to get funded through informal lending channels, like family and/or friends. The precautionary saving and old-age provision motives are the most commonly reported motives in all countries. Preferences for other motives are then rather heterogeneous across countries. In addition to the influence of household charac- teristics, the variables related to the structure of the tax system and that of the financing/generosity of the social security and welfare systems are important deter- minants of household saving. We find a more heterogeneous impact of credit constraints that are perceived to be binding for specific groups of households living in particular geographic regions. Households living in Mediterranean countries report to be more subject to binding liquidity constraints than households living in Continental Europe. This might reflect the higher degree of market imperfections in the first macroeconomic region. As expected, the existence of personal bankruptcy laws significantly decreases the probability of being liquidity constrained, pointing to the role of guarantee of this factor on the propensity to give a loan to the household sector.

        "1 Introduction This paper focuses on household saving behaviour, with particular emphasis on why households save, how much heterogeneity in savings motives and liquidity constraints there is across households and countries, and which factors determine the importance of saving motives and liquidity constraints. These topics are particularly relevant in light of the recent financial crisis in the household sector. Studying which motives drive households\u2019 savings within countries at different stages of their life cycle is fundamental for understanding household saving behaviour. A cross-country view on savings gives insights into how country-specific institutional settings shape saving behaviour and how differently formal lending channels are developed. We use a new cross-country household data set, the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), that collects detailed information on wealth holdings, consumption and income in the 15 Euro Area countries. In addition, the data allows us to study the underlying motives for saving and relate them to household characteristics and perceived liquidity constraints. Household saving behaviour has been extensively studied in the literature. Sev- eral saving motives were first identified by Keynes (1936). Subsequent papers have primarily concentrated on precautionary saving, on life cycle or retirement saving as well as on saving for bequest. An additional saving motive, namely the \u201cDown- payment\u201d motive was added by Browning and Lusardi (1996). Most of these motives have by now been incorporated into the life cycle model (Modigli-ani and Brumberg (1954) and Friedman (1975)). Early versions of this theory explain the old-age provision motive as the main saving motive: individuals save while working in order to counteract the income drop at retirement. The basic version of the life cycle model has been extended to include also other saving motives, most prominently the precautionary savings motive. Precautionary saving can explain a large share of individual and aggregate wealth accumulation (Skinner (1988), Carroll (1997), Gourinchas and Parker (2002)). The longevity risk and large out-of-pocket expenses that may occur at different stages of the life cycle are other reasons to save (Palumbo (1999), Hubbard et al. (1995)). Further extensions of the life cycle model include a housing motive (Hayashi (1988)) and a bequest motive (Hurd (1987)). On the empirical side, large literature has linked precautionary savings to income risk, coming to mixed results for the prevalence of a precautionary savings motive (Guiso et al. (1992), Skinner (1988)). While most papers focus on one saving mo- tive only, a few papers in the economic and psychologic literature have studied the co-existence of different motivations to save (Katona (1975), Alessie et al. (1997), Lindqvist et al. (1978), Horioka and Watanabe (1997), Schunk (2009)). Only lim- ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 3 ",
        "ited evidence of saving motives and saving behaviour is available for cross-country comparable studies (with few exceptions such as Boersch-Supan and Lusardi (2003)). In the life cycle framework the existence of credit constraints has direct pre- dictions for savings (Deaton(1991)). Households that face binding borrowing con- straints are prevented from smoothing consumption as they can only consume less than they would optimally like to. Uncertainty from income shocks, medical expenditures and other factors driv- ing precautionary savings become particularly relevant when households simulta- neously face borrowing constraints (see Deaton (1991)), so there is often an in- teraction between the precautionary saving motive and imperfections in financial markets. Therefore, institutional differences across countries may play a major role for different savings behaviour and credit constraints. Countries with a higher de- gree of uncertainty in income and other (future) economic circumstances will most likely feature higher saving rates in the presence of a precautionary savings motive (Boersch-Supan and Lusardi (2003)). High replacement rates after retirement may replace the need for precautionary savings (see Browning and Lusardi (1996)), and unemployment benefits and other welfare policies which aim to reduce changes and shocks to life-time income might have the same effects (see Hubbard et al. (1995)). In addition to public safety nets, individuals may also rely on the network of relatives and friends to offset shocks. Such informal borrowing opportunities may replace for- mal capital market requirements and binding liquidity constraints and hence replace the need to save (Boersch-Supan and Lusardi (2003)). We first study how differences in individual preferences and characteristics of households in different countries affect the extent of the heterogeneity in saving mo- tives and liquidity constraints. As differences in institutions may explain a large part of cross-national differences in saving motives and perceived credit constraints, we then analyse a number of institutional variables to capture country-specific in- stitutional settings. The present paper improves upon earlier studies by analyzing a much larger number of saving motives and perceived liquidity constraints and by using new and comparable micro data across 15 countries in the Euro zone. Since the data is from 2010-2011 strong conclusions as regards the present are difficult to draw. This is because the crisis may have affected the data, especially in countries that were severely hit. Nevertheless, our findings can be summarized as follows. We find that in the years 2010-2011 for most households in the Euro Area ex- penses were perceived to be about the same as average expenses, and about the same as income. Households whose head is female, young or divorced are significantly more likely to have expenses exceeding income; in contrast, wealthier households are less likely to incur in expenses higher than income. We also find evidence of households being rather confident in the possibility to get funded through informal ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 4 ",
        "lending channels, like family and/or friends. Both household characteristics and institutional macroeconomic variables are significant and economically important determinants of both saving preferences and credit constraints households face. Precautionary saving is the most commonly reported motive in all countries, followed by saving for old-age provision. Preferences for other motives are then rather heterogeneous across countries. We observe a relevant role for education and support of children and grandchildren, home purchase and other major purchases. We also find evidence of a significant complementarity between the home-purchase saving motive and saving for old-age provision, as well as between precautionary sav- ing and saving to build up a financial wealth stock to serve as buffer against adverse financial shocks. In addition, saving for unexpected events is significantly and neg- atively correlated with saving for home purchase, and positively with the bequest motive. Saving for home purchase and precautionary saving are monotonically decreas- ingly important with age. Moreover, in accordance with the life cycle model, being retired is negatively related to the importance of saving for buying a house. Fi- nally, the variables related to the structure of the tax system and that of the financ- ing/generosity of the social security and welfare systems are important determinants of household saving. We find credit constraints to be more heterogeneous and perceived to be binding for specific groups of households living in particular geographic regions. Households living in Mediterranean countries report to be more subject to binding liquidity constraints than households living in Continental Europe. This might reflect the higher degree of market imperfections in the first macroeconomic region, as reflected in lower loan-to-value ratios. Moreover, the financial and economic crisis that hit these countries might also have played an important role, but this is not included in our analysis. As expected, the existence of personal bankruptcy laws remark- ably decreases the probability of being liquidity constrained, pointing to the role of guarantee of this factor on the propensity to give a loan to the household sector. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a description of the data set used in the empirical analysis. Section 3 focuses on self assessed, qualitative measures of household saving, with emphasis on how households perceive their saving and on how negative saving is financed. The relevance of saving motives and their main determinants are analyzed in Section 4. Liquidity constraints are analyzed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.

        "2 The data The analysis in this paper is based on data collected from households participat- ing in the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), a joint project of 15 central banks of the Eurosystem. The survey collects detailed household-level data on various aspects of household balance sheets and related eco- nomic and demographic variables, including income, pensions, employment, gifts and measures of consumption. A key distinguishing feature of the HFCS is that it provides country-representative data, which have been collected in a harmonised way in all Euro Area countries with the exception of Estonia, Ireland and Latvia for a sample of more than 62,000 households. Consequently, the survey is unique as it makes it possible to undertake detailed analyses of issues related to wealth while at the same time allowing consistent comparisons across countries. The survey was conducted from November 2008 in Spain to August 2011 in Italy. The fieldwork for most countries was 2010. Thus, the reference year of wealth is in most cases 2010 (at the point the survey was conducted) and the year prior to the survey year for income, which is 2009 for most countries. Almost all countries used CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interviews) as interview mode 1 and applied a stratified random sampling as sampling strategy. Most countries over-sampled the wealthy in order to better assess the right tail of the wealth distribution (HFCN, 2013b, section 4). 2 In this paper, we neither apply an inflation adjustment nor a purchasing power parities (PPP) adjustment of the monetary variables. Table 9.2 of HFCN (2013b) shows that inflation correction has a very small impact. Differences in PPP are taken into account since monetary control variables are included as weighted quintile dummies (calculated separately over each country). Individual answers are subject to logical consistency checks and possible corrections based on editing. Item non-response is addressed by country specific multiple imputation models, which results in five implicates for each country data set to properly adjust for imputation uncertainty (HFCN, 2013b, section 6). All descriptive and multivariate analyses combine the results obtained from each of the five implicates according to Rubin\u2019s rule (Rubin, 1987). Imputations are done for the most important variables such as wealth and income. For these questions all variables necessary to construct the aggregates are imputed in all countries. Marginal effects are calculated at the observation level and then averaged. Moreover, all descriptive statistics and marginal effects are weighted to obtain country and Euro Area representative results (HFCN, 2013b, section 5). We execute weighted regressions, as suggested in case of complex survey designs (Magee et al. , 1998). 1 In the Netherlands CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interviews) was adopted instead. 2 For a detailed overview on sampling mode and fieldwork periods see HFCN (2013b).

        "2.1 Household characteristics In our regressions we use a number of socio-demographic variables of the household, such as age, marital status, household size, employment and education, income and wealth. Personal variables for the reference person are selected according to the finan- cially knowledgeable person (FKP), considered to be the main respondent providing financial information for the whole household, since this information is collected together for the whole household instead of by individual persons (HFCN, 2013b). Table 1 displays the main variables and reports the summary statistics of the vari- ables we use as controls in the regressions throughout the paper. The sample is characterized by a slight predominance of male heads of households (54 percent). Age classes are roughly equally represented, even if we observe more household heads aged between 40 and 54 years (30 percent), and fewer household heads aged 70 years and above (20 percent). More than half of the sample is made of couples, defined as married or living with a partner (54 percent); single respondents represent 22 percent of the sample; widowed and divorced follow with 13 and 10 percent, respectively. The average household size is slightly more than 2.3 persons. About one third of household heads have a low level of education, 41 percent and 24 percent have a medium and high level of education, respectively. As for labour-related variables, we observe that 5 percent only have a tempo- rary contract. The vast majority of the sample consists of employees (45 percent), followed by retired respondents (31 percent), self-employed (8 percent) and unem- ployed (5 percent). About 12 percent work in the public sector, and 2 percent in the financial sector. The country with the highest number of weighted households is Germany (29 percent) followed by France (20 percent), Italy (17 percent) and Spain (12 percent). Table 1 about here 2.2 Institutional variables Financial institutions and capital markets are key in bringing together savers who want to lend with consumers with a shortage of funds who want to borrow. The functioning of financial intermediation is very likely to affect differences in individual saving behaviour and credit constraints, that typically arise when capital markets are imperfect (Deaton, 1991). In addition, household private savings might be influenced by the presence of mandatory public pension schemes. In a simple life-cycle framework, a public pen- sion scheme financed through payroll taxes may lead to a one-to-one crowding out ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 7 ",
        "of private saving for retirement and high future replacement rates may lead to lower private saving. However, several studies show that this theoretical prediction is not fully supported empirically (Feldstein, 1980; Koskela and and Viren, 1983; Gale, 1998). The quantitative impact of the crowding-out effect of compulsory public retirement programs on saving behaviour has been very difficult to estimate appro- priately (see Jappelli, 1995 among others), mainly for lack of proper data (Hurd et al. , 2012), and is estimated well below one. Finally, the impact of public policy on household saving behaviour and spending has gained increasing importance in recent years as reforms of both pension and tax systems in many Euro Area countries will very likely influence consumption and saving through the effects on lifetime wealth and on the rate of return on saving. To take these considerations into account, we implement a 2-step estimation pro- cedure using institutional variables that might have a direct effect on both saving behaviour and liquidity constraints. 3 We strictly follow Bover et al. (2013) in select- ing the variables of interest for credit conditions and the rules governing financial institutions. In addition, we include a set of pension-related variables, which have the advantage that they vary both across countries and across households. The full list of institutional factors used in the 2-step procedure is reported in Table 2. Differences in household saving behaviour across countries may be induced by the existence and level of property taxes in place. In particular, home ownership rates (and therefore saving for a home) may be influenced by the loan-to-value ra- tios for first-time house buyers, transaction costs of buyers and the existence of tax reliefs on mortgage payments. Income tax rates and the overall financial lit- eracy of the population in a specific country may also have effects on household saving behaviour. Life-cycle saving for retirement may be connected to the current and in particular future dependency ratios and replacement rates in each country. Moreover, factors such as the duration of foreclosure proceedings, the existence of a personal bankruptcy law and credit information on borrowers may play a role for households\u2019 liquidity constraints. Table 2 about here The 2-step procedure uses as a first step a probit model with country-level fixed effects that capture country-specific differences in the distribution of wealth and income as well as other micro factors. In a second step we calculate the predicted values linked to each probit and run regressions of these fitted values from the first step estimation on the macro indicators described above. While the first step of micro level estimations accounts for compositional outcomes within and across each country, the second step analyses pure differences at the macro level that 3 We thank an anonymous referee for suggesting this procedure.

        "influence saving motives and liquidity constraints across the sample of countries. We then derive scatter plots reporting country-specific regression coefficients with the institutional variables in order to better visualize the outcome of this methodology. 3 Self assessed measures of household saving This section focuses on how households perceive their saving behaviour and, in addition, on how they cope with negative saving. 3.1 Perception of saving We ask households to report how their overall expenses in the previous 12 months compare with the average expenses they typically face, and with their income. More than 70 percent of respondents in the Euro Area claim that in the previous 12 months their household expenses were about the same as average household expenses. About 19 percent claim current expenses were higher, and the remaining 7 percent claim they were lower than average expenses. If compared with household income, expenses turned out to be about the same for almost half of the respondents and lower for 41 percent. About 11 percent of all households report that their expenses were above their income. We perform a simple probit analysis in order to better understand who these households are more likely to be. Results (average marginal effects over the 5 implicates and t-statistics) are reported in Table 3. Some of the control variables turn out to be significant, some at the 1-percent level. Households whose head is female and divorced are significantly more likely to have expenses exceeding income (the marginal effects are 1.4 and 3.7 percentage points, respectively). Singles are significantly less likely to incur in spending more than their income, with a marginal effect of 3 percentage points. Aging is negatively correlated with having expenditures exceed income. Households whose head is in the oldest age category are less likely to have expenditures exceeding income compared to those households whose head is less than or equal to 40 years old (marginal effect is 3.9 percentage points). This finding is in line with the predictions of the life cycle model. Young households whose incomes are low and whose marginal propensity to consume is high are more likely to spend all of their income and will additionally finance their age-specific expenses by borrowing. As households grow older and their income increases, they will have enough means to cover their expenses. In addition, the retirement dummy is estimated to be positive and significant. Our result is also in line with the findings of Bover et al. (2013) who show that negative saving and holding secured debt or unsecured debt is predominant in the beginning of the life cycle and decreases after ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 9 ",
        "the age of 44. There are no significant effects for the level of education. Household size, being self-employed, unemployed, or retired are positively and significantly related to having expenses higher than income. Similarly, wealthier households (in terms of household income and household net wealth) are less likely to incur in expenses higher than income. Table 3 about here 3.2 Financing negative saving The fact that expenses are higher than income is not per se an indication of vulner- ability, as long as it is a transitory/occasional situation and it is possible to finance this negative saving somehow. Therefore, in order to better understand this issue we consider additional information available in the HFCS. The respondents who re- ported their expenses were higher than their income in the last 12 months are then asked how they dealt with those expenses. 4 The majority of households says that they mostly spent out of past savings (55 percent). The next most relevant sources of financing are a credit card/overdraft facility and assistance from relatives/friends (22 percent for each of these categories). Some 13 percent of households, for which average expenses were above average income during the last 12 months, claim they left bills unpaid. Figure 1 panel (a) shows the distribution of answers by country. A certain degree of homogeneity can be observed across countries. The most commonly reported source of financing negative saving is spending out of savings cumulated in the past in all countries, with the exception of Greece, where there is a predominance of the habit to ask for help from relatives and friends (51 percent), and in Cyprus, where it is very common to get a credit card/overdraft facility (more than 90 percent). Figure 1 about here The question allows to identify four groups of households. Negative saving can be financed out of wealth/past saving, out of formal loans (credit cards/overdraft facilities), out of informal loans (family and friends), out of unpaid bills. Therefore we are able to identify the households who have been able to cope with negative saving (either by dissaving or by relying on some forms of borrowing) and those who have not (by leaving unpaid bills), thus being financially vulnerable to adverse economic conditions and potentially \u201cat risk\u201d of poverty. 4 Data on financing negative saving have not been collected in Italy, Finland and France. Moreover, multiple answers are responsible for mean values not summing up to 100. ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 10 ",
        "We then perform a probit regression analysis for each of the four sources of financing negative saving. 5 Table 4 reports the full set of results. We observe a very significant (at the 1-percent level) wealth effect for all four sources of financing and with the expected sign. Wealthier households are more likely to cover negative saving by decumulating existing wealth or by dissaving. The marginal effects are rather high and monotonically increasing with wealth quintiles from 14 percentage points in quintuile 2 to 37 percentage points in quintile 5. Wealthier households are also significantly less likely to leave bills unpaid, although the marginal effects are lower (in the range between 9 percentage points and 18 percentage points) and non- monotonic. In addition, wealthier households are significantly less likely to take out new loans or credit cards/overdraft facilities. Similarly, higher wealth quintiles are associated to lower probabilities of asking informal loans from family and friends. The marginal effects are again rather high (between 10 percentage points and 22 percentage points) and non-monotonic. These findings are consistent with Arrondel et al. (2013), who find that the ownership rates of all asset categories generally increase with wealth, therefore allowing them to decumulate assets more flexibly in case of need. We also observe an income effect, although some findings are less intuitive than for the wealth effect. We find that the higher the income, the higher the probability of dissaving, but also the higher the probability of leaving bills unpaid, even if the significance level is very high for the former effect and much lower for the latter (only for the second income quintile). Interestingly, we observe that income is positively related with the probability to take out new formal loans, and negatively with the probability to ask informal loans. This result underlines the fact that income richer households can take out formal loans more easily while the poorer may be credit constrained and have to rely on informal loans. Overall, households who leave bills unpaid are significantly more likely to be low educated, and self-employed. Older or unemployed households and households with a temporary contract are significantly less likely to rely on formal loans or borrowing. Table 4 about here To further elaborate on the role of informal lending channels, the HFCS contains a question on the ability to get financial assistance from relatives and friends. Figure 1 panel (b) shows the distribution of the percentages reported by countries. 6 In 5 Another way to model this analysis is to perform multinomial probit regressions. However our data do not allow this since multiple answers are possible, making the four alternative forms of financing not fully mutually exclusive. 6 Data on ability to get financial assistance from relatives and friends have not been collected in Spain, Italy, Finland and France. ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 11 ",
        "all countries where this information is available there seem to be a pretty high confidence in the possibility to get financial assistance through informal borrowing. Peaks are found for Luxembourg and Portugal (70 percent). Only in Slovakia and in Slovenia the percentage is below 40. 4 Saving motives The HFCS elicits information on the importance of a number of saving motives. The question used in this paper to identify saving purposes asks respondents to report their (household\u2019s) most important reasons for saving. The list of saving motives includes home purchase, other major purchases (other residences, vehicles, furniture, etc.), set up a private business or finance investments in an existing business, invest in financial assets, provide for unexpected events, pay off debts, provide for old-age, travels/holidays, education/support of children or grandchildren, bequests, and take advantage of state subsidies (for example, a subsidy to building society savings). 7 Precautionary saving is reported as the most important motive in all countries, followed by saving for old-age provision. The percentage of households reporting precautionary saving as an important reason for saving ranges between 89 percent in the Netherlands and 42 percent in Germany. The percentage related to saving for old age ranges between 71 percent in the Netherlands and 28 percent in Spain. Preferences for other motives are then rather heterogeneous across countries. We ob- serve a relevant role for education and support of children and grandchildren, home purchase and other major purchases. Saving to pay off debts is rather important in Netherlands, a country with a relatively substantial household indebtedness. 4.1 Links among saving motives Up to this point each preference for saving has been considered separately. This implicitly points in the direction of mental accounting: individuals save either for one purpose or for another one. In reality, we may think that saving behaviour should be interpreted in a broader sense instead. It is an attitude, a personal trait. Some people save (irrespective of the specific reason why), because they can and because they are patient and prudent; some other people do not save, not only because they cannot, but also because they are impatient, or risk lovers or alike. In this section we investigate whether and how different saving motives relate to each other, by computing simple pairwise correlations. 7 Multiple answers are allowed. Respondents may also choose the \u201cDo not know\u201d option or the \u201cNo answer\u201d option. ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 12 ",
        "We observe very high significance levels for basically all pairs of saving motives. 8 Saving to provide for unexpected events is associated negatively to saving for home purchase and to saving to build up own business, indicating that these motives for saving are substitutes. A positive effect is nevertheless observed between saving for unexpected events and saving for old-age provision and saving to take advantage of state subsidies, suggesting a complementarity between precautionary saving and building up a financial wealth stock intended to be used as buffer against adverse financial shocks. The bequest motive has a positive effect on precautionary saving. This finding is in line with the literature and has an intuitive interpretation. Bequests can be unin- tentional, so that a (risk-averse) household may decide to save for \u201crainy days\u201d and leave the amount of savings left to its offsprings. Moreover, Arrondel et al. (2013) show that the significance of inheritances for wealth accumulation is remarkable and underlines its key role in the process of persistent wealth inequality. In addition, we observe that the bequest motive is associated positively with the family support motive, so that inter-vivo transfers are complements to bequests. Saving for home purchase is correlated negatively with saving for old-age provi- sion and with the bequest motive. These relationships are consistent with the idea of the home being both a consumption good (to be liquidated at late stages of the life cycle in case of need) and an investment good (to pass on to offsprings). Saving for holidays is positively related with all other motives, indicating that holidays are luxury goods. 4.2 Subjective perception of saving and importance of sav- ing motives In Section 3.1 we identified three groups of households on the basis of their subjec- tively reported saving situation, in particular whether on average their expenses were higher, about the same, or lower than their income. We now analyze the (relative) importance of the several motives for saving discussed above across these groups of households, with a particular focus on those potentially at risk of financial stress. We perform probit regressions for each of the three household categories and control for the saving motives, on top of the main background characteristics described in Table 1. Table 5 reports the results relative to the saving motives only. Putting money aside for paying off debts is significantly (at the 1-percent) more likely to be indicated as an important reason for saving by the households report- ing expenses higher than income (regression (I)). Symmetrically paying off debts is significantly (at the 5-percent level) less likely to be reported as important by the 8 The corresponding table is not reported here to save space, but it is available upon request.

        "households with positive saving (regression (III)). Another opposite finding between households with negative and positive saving relates to saving for other major pur- chases (other residences, vehicles, furniture, etc.) and saving for unexpected events: both of these motives turn out to be significantly unimportant for the former group and significantly important for the latter group. Overall, there is evidence of heterogeneity with respect to the relevance of reasons for putting money aside among households depending on their financial situation. Table 5 about here 4.3 Determinants of saving motives We now focus on three motives for saving, namely saving for home purchase, saving for old-age provision, and saving for unexpected events. 9 For each of these motives we perform probit analyses to better characterize the main determinants of saving behaviour. Table 6 reports the results. Age is a relevant determinant for saving behaviour, both in terms of significance levels and in terms of marginal effects. There is a clear pattern for home pur- chase: saving for buying a home is monotonically decreasingly important with age. Marginal effects range between 8 and 14 percentage points. Households belonging to the younger age class (defined as households aged less than 40) are significantly more likely to report saving for buying a house as a very important motive for putting money aside. Moreover, the age coefficients for saving for old-age provision are esti- mated to be significant and positive, with marginal effects monotonically decreasing with age. This implies that retirement savings are particularly important in the middle part of the life cycle, and less so for the young (defined as people up to 40 years old) and the eldest old (70 and above). Household size is significantly (at the 1-percent level) and negatively associated to saving for old-age provision, suggesting a potential substitutability between formal (via pension plans) and informal (via intra-family support) financial provisions upon retirement. Education level is a significant determinant for saving for home purchase and for saving for unexpected events. Households with mid education consider saving for buying a house less important than the low-educated households (marginal effects of about 3 percentage points), maybe because credit constraints are less relevant for them. On the other hand, high education is positively associated with the importance of precautionary saving. 9 We chose saving for home purchase as the main residence is typically the asset with the highest value in household finances in all countries. In addition, saving for old-age provision and precautionary saving are reported as very important reasons to put money aside. ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 14 ",
        "The self-employed are significantly less likely than employees to report saving for home purchase as an important motive for putting money aside. One plausible explanation could be that this motive conflicts with the project to improve their business. As expected and in accordance with the life cycle model, being retired is negatively related to the importance of saving for buying a house: presumably households are already home owners or they have sold their house to finance old- age consumption. Not surprisingly, retired households are significantly less likely to report saving for old-age provision as an important motive to set money aside. All other household characteristics, including income and wealth, have no sig- nificant impact on the probability of considering home purchase as an important motive for saving. However, there is a significant positive wealth effect (and to a minor extent, an income effect) on both old-age provision and on saving for unex- pected events. Table 6 about here When considering institutional variables (see Figure 2), we find that the gross replacement rate from the first (public) pillar remarkably decreases the importance of saving for old-age provision, suggesting a substitution effect between public and private pension savings. These findings are in line with Attanasio and Brugiavini (2003), among others, who find that saving rates increase as a result of a reduction in (public) pension wealth. We also find a significant and positive effect of financial lit- eracy on saving for unexpected events, consistently with the literature showing bet- ter/more sophisticated financial choices and higher wealth levels by the households scoring high in numeracy and financial literacy (Lusardi, Mitchell, 2007). Finally, saving for unexpected events is significantly and negatively related to (average) in- come taxes, implying that public and personal insurance mechanisms are perceived to be substitutes. Overall, our findings are line with IMF (1997) who find that variables related to t he structure of the tax system and to the financing/generosity of the social security and welfare systems are important determinants of household saving. Figure 2 about here 5 Credit constraints We strictly follow Jappelli et al. (1998) in defining liquidity-constrained households. We construct four indicators of which three are directly derived from answers given to HFCS respondents and one derives from a calculation based on household net liquid assets. The liquidity constraints indicators are described as follows: ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 15 ",
        "1. \u201cTurned down/discouraged\u201d - The first indicator includes households who gave an affirmative answer to any of the following questions: \u2022 In the last three years, has any lender or creditor turned down any request you [or someone in your household] made for credit, or not given you as much credit as you applied for? \u2022 In the last three years, did you (or another member of your household) consider applying for a loan or credit but then decided not to, thinking that the application would be rejected? 2. \u201cTurned down/discouraged and no credit card/line\u201d - The second indicator excludes from the constrained group all households that report that they have a credit card or a line of credit. 3. \u201cNo credit card/line\u201d - The third indicator of liquidity constraints considers only those households that have neither a credit card nor a line of credit. 4. \u201cLow assets\u201d - The fourth indicator includes households whose net liquid assets are worth less than six months\u2019 gross income. In order to better capture the difference across European countries with respect to both institutional settings and cultural habits in formal and informal lending chan- nels, we identify three geographic areas, namely Continental (Austria, Belgium, Ger- many, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands), Mediterranean (Cyprus, Spain, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal), Other (Slovakia, Slovenia, Finland). 10 Table 7 reports the mean values for each of the four liquidity constraints indi- cators. We first report the values for the full sample and compare them with the values found by Jappelli et al. (1998) for the US. We observe that 8.2 percent of households in the Euro Area report to have been turned down or discouraged from asking for a loan. The percentage drops to 1.4 percent when households with no credit card are considered additionally. About 23 percent of households claim they do not have any credit card or credit line. When the indirect measure of liquidity constraints (indicator 4 - low assets) is considered, we observe that 43.8 percent of households are likely to have problems in getting credit due to their low assets. The patterns of all indicators resemble those by Jappelli et al. (1998), despite the fact that they are based on a different time period and on different countries. From Table 7 we also observe that households living in Mediterranean countries perceive (and report) to be more subject to liquidity constraints than households living in Continental Europe. This might reflect the substantial difference in the 10 This classification comes from several studies in the literature about welfare systems (e.g. Esping-Andersen (1990) and Arts and Gelissen (2002), among others). In the empirical analysis Italy and Finland are excluded as data on liquidity constraints are not collected there. ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 16 ",
        "structure of formal lending markets between the two macroeconomic regions (as reflected in different levels of loan-to-value ratios), and ultimately the different role and development of informal credit channels. In addition, the financial and economic crisis hit these countries differently, but this aspect is not included in our analysis. 11 Table 7 about here We then run probit regressions for each of the four indicators on household characteristics. Table 8 shows that gender has hardly any effect on the probability of being liquidity constrained. Only when the indirect asset-based indicator of liquidity con- straints is used (column IV), females turn out to be significantly more subject to credit constraints. The marginal effect is around 2 percentage points. This finding reflects the lower amount of assets that females typically hold and the more limited credit card holdings by women. Older individuals are significantly less likely to be liquidity constrained for all indicators but the third one. Not having a credit card or a credit line is significantly and positively related to age since older households have had less exposure to these \u201cmore recent\u201d payment devices over their life cycles. Marital status has a mixed effect on liquidity constraints. Divorced households are significantly more likely to report they are liquidity constrained (indicator 1) and more likely to have low assets at disposal. Higher degrees of education are associated with significantly lower probability of facing liquidity constraints for the third and fourth indicator. For the first two indicators the sign is as expected (negative) but not significant. Household size is significantly and positively related to all indicators of liquidity constraints. Similarly, the respondents who are self-employed and un- employed are more likely to face credit constraints than employed individuals. The findings for retired respondents are mixed, as the estimates are positive and negative depending on the liquidity indicator analyzed, but almost always significant at the 1-percent level. Household income and household net wealth are negatively related to liquidity constraints. 12 Table 8 about here The analysis of the role of the institutional variables shows (Figure 3) that, not surprisingly, generous loan-to-value ratios for first-time house buyers can help relax credit constraints. In addition, the existence of personal bankruptcy laws 11 These results should be interpreted in light of the fact that \u201c data for Spain refer to availability of credit in the last two years. Due to a slightly different implementation of the questions related to credit constraints in the Greek questionnaire, there may be an upward bias towards being refused credit/being credit constrained in the respective estimate.

        "remarkably decreases the probability of being liquidity constrained, highlighting the role of guarantee of this factor on the propensity to give a loan to the household sector. Figure 3 about here 6 Concluding remarks The paper studies several aspects of household saving behaviour, of individual mo- tives for saving and of perceived liquidity constraints in 15 Euro Area countries, using the Household Finance and Consumption Survey, a new harmonized data set collecting detailed information on wealth holdings, consumption and income. We find a rather similar perception of household saving behaviour across coun- tries. The majority of respondents claims that in the previous 12 months their household expenses were about the same as average household expenses as well as their household income. Nevertheless about 11 percent of households report that their expenses were above their income. These households potentially at risk of financial vulnerability are more likely to have a head who is female, to be less than 40 years old or divorced. In contrast, wealthier households are less likely to incur in expenses higher than income. We further analyze alternative sources of financing negative saving, namely dissaving, borrowing, and leaving bills unpaid. We observe a very significant wealth effect for all sources of financing and with the expected sign. Wealthier households are more likely to cover negative saving by decumulat- ing existing wealth or by dissaving, and less likely to leave bills unpaid. We also observe an income effect: the higher the income, the higher the probabil- ity of dissaving, but also the higher the probability of leaving bills unpaid. Income is positively related with the probability to take out new formal loans, and nega- tively with the probability to ask informal loans. Overall, households who leave bills unpaid are significantly more likely to be low educated, and self-employed. Older or unemployed households and households with a temporary contract are significantly less likely to rely on formal loans or borrowing. We find evidence of some degree of homogeneity across countries with respect to saving preferences and the relative importance of several motives for saving. Sav- ing for unexpected events is the most commonly reported motive in all countries, followed by saving for old-age provision. We observe also a relevant role for edu- cation and support of children and grandchildren, home purchase and other major purchases. Our findings show evidence of heterogeneity with respect to the relevance of reasons for putting money aside among households depending on their financial ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 18 ",
        "situation. Saving for paying off debts is very important for the households reporting expenses higher than income while this motive is relatively less important for the households with positive saving. Saving for home purchase and precautionary saving are decreasingly important with age. Consistently with the life cycle model, being retired is negatively related to the importance of saving for buying a house. The gross replacement rate from the first (public) pillar significantly decreases the importance of saving for old-age provision, suggesting a substitution effect between public and private pension savings. We also find a significant and positive effect of financial literacy on saving for unexpected events. In addition, saving for unexpected events is significantly and negatively related to (average) income taxes, implying that public and personal insurance mechanisms are substitutes. Finally, we find a more heterogeneous impact of credit constraints, that are per- ceived to be binding for specific groups of respondents, namely the young, least educated, divorced and more numerous households, as well as the self-employed and the unemployed households. We also find that households living in Mediterranean countries report to be more subject to liquidity constraints than households liv- ing in Continental Europe. This might reflect different stages of the development of formal lending channels in the two macroeconomic regions. The existence of personal bankruptcy laws significantly decreases the probability of being liquidity constrained, pointing to the role of guarantee of those factors on the propensity to give a loan to the household sector. In view of the European integration process, our findings reveal that a micro perspective on household savings and liquidity constraints uncovers substantial het- erogeneity within and across the population in each country with potential effects on the monetary transmission process. Future research should focus on the changing institutional environments and its impact on household behaviour as the European integration process proceeds. ECB Working Paper 1790, May 2015 19 ",

        "Household Finance and Consumption Network This paper contains research conducted within the Household Finance and Consumption Network (HFCN). The HFCN consists of survey specialists, statisticians and economists from the ECB, the national central banks of the Eurosystem and a number of national statistical institutes. The HFCN is chaired by Oreste Tristani (ECB) and Carlos S\u00e1nchez Mu\u00f1oz (ECB). Michael Haliassos (Goethe University Frankfurt ), Tullio Jappelli (University of Naples Federico II), Arthur Kennickell (Federal Reserve Board) and Peter Tufano (University of Oxford) and act as external consultants, and S\u00e9bastien P\u00e9rez Duarte (ECB) and Jiri Slacalek (ECB) as Secretaries. The HFCN collects household-level data on households\u2019 finances and consumption in the euro area through a harmonised survey. The HFCN aims at studying in depth the micro-level structural information on euro area households\u2019 assets and liabilities. The objectives of the network are: 1) understanding economic behaviour of individual households, developments in aggregate variables and the interactions between the two; 2) evaluating the impact of shocks, policies and institutional changes on household portfolios and other variables; 3) understanding the implications of heterogeneity for aggregate variables; 4) estimating choices of different households and their reaction to economic shocks; 5) building and calibrating realistic economic models incorporating heterogeneous agents; 6) gaining insights into issues such as monetary policy transmission and financial stability. The refereeing process of this paper has been co-ordinated by a team composed of Oreste Tristani (ECB), Pirmin Fessler (Oesterreichische Nationalbank), Michalis Haliassos (Goethe University Frankfurt) , Tullio Jappelli (University of Naples Federico II), S\u00e9bastien P\u00e9rez-Duarte (ECB), Jiri Slacalek (ECB), Federica Teppa (De Nederlandsche Bank), Peter Tufano (Oxford University) and Philip Vermeulen (ECB).
