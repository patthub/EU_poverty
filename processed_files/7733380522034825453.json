        "4 The European Union is first and foremost a set of values that allow us to live together , despite our different languages, cultures, religions and customs. It\u2019s not easy for the approximately half a billion people who live in the EU to understand the people in their neighbouring countries or countries that are further away. The values of solidarity , tolerance , freedom and equality , and respect are important if we want to live as a society. VALUES Belonging to the European project Long live peace! In 2012 the European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. It decided to use the prize fund to help children who haven\u2019t had the chance to grow up in peace. So far, thousands of disadvantaged children have benefited from educational programmes. Showing solidarity means being willing to help one another; being tolerant means recognising that people can live and think in different ways . These common human values allow us to come together and feel part of the common project that is the European Union. Solidarity in practice For me, solidarity means: For me, tolerance means: + \u2023 Finish the sentences: \u2023 Give an example of solidarity and tolerance in class. \u2023 Make up your own solidarity slogan.

        "5 What is sustainable development? Sustainable development is a more respectful way of consuming: we meet our current needs but think about those who will come after us. It\u2019s important to leave behind a clean planet for our children. Sustainable development takes into account the environment, the economy and life as a society. EU citizens are also consumers who buy all sorts of products and services for their basic needs or for pleasure. We are all responsible for looking at what we\u2019re using and how we\u2019re travelling. When we make good choices and carry out small eco-friendly actions in our daily lives we are supporting sustainable development. The European Union uses many different actions to encourage the 28 Member States to apply sustainable policies that benefit all the people of Europe and of the world. ECO-CONSUMPTION Being responsible \u2023 Do you think that these small gestures are good for sustainable development? WATER It rains all the time! So I don\u2019t worry about it and I leave the taps running. \u25a0 YES \u25a0 NO FOOD I would rather eat fresh food and local produce than buy strawberries in the middle of winter. \u25a0 YES \u25a0 NO ENERGY I always leave the lights on: they create a nice atmosphere in the house. \u25a0 YES \u25a0 NO TRANSPORT When possible, I travel by bike rather than by car. \u25a0 YES \u25a0 NO ",
        "6 ENVIRONMENT Protecting nature In order to live happily together, it\u2019s important to take care of our environment : water, air, plants and animals. Human activities sometimes upset the balance of nature. So we have to change some of our behaviour. The European Union works to prevent pollution and global warming. Global warming Every person in the EU throws more than a kilo of rubbish in the bin every day. And there are more than 510 million of us! Thankfully, we have been recycling lots of products for years: plastic bottles, cans, glass, paper and cardboard. Through this simple action we are helping to fight pollution. \u2023 What would you put in each of these bins? Marking Do you recognise the CE mark? It\u2019s compulsory for many products. It means that the product meets the EU\u2019s safety, health and environmental protection requirements. You\u2019ll find it on many objects in your house, including toys. Have a look! ",
        "7 Pollution has no borders. Every second on our planet a patch of forest the size of a football pitch is destroyed to make wood or paper. This pollution is destroying the earth\u2019s \u2018green lungs\u2019 and producing too many greenhouse gases. Greenhouse effect The sun\u2019s rays travel through our atmosphere and heat our planet. But, like in a greenhouse where we grow plants or vegetables, some of the sun\u2019s rays don\u2019t leave the earth. This natural phenomenon is called the greenhouse effect. Green lungs Thanks to chlorophyll, green plants absorb greenhouse gases and release oxygen. Humans, like cars, do the opposite: they take in oxygen and expel CO 2 , or carbon dioxide. It\u2019s this gas that is most to blame for the greenhouse effect and global warming. So we do the opposite of plants. And when we destroy these plants we\u2019re destroying the green lungs that give us oxygen to live. ENERGY AND CLIMATE Producing renewable energies Protecting nature The entire world is affected by the environment and the climate. Europe does not have a lot of oil or natural gas. So it has to do everything it can to produce renewable energy. The EU countries have agreed that by 2030 they will: \u2022 reduce greenhouse gases by 40 % ; \u2022 reduce energy use by 32 % ; \u2022 produce at least 32 % of their energy from renewable sources (wind, solar or marine energy, etc.).

        "8 Better farming since the 1980s Since the 1980s farmers haven\u2019t been able to just produce whatever they want, however they want. High-quality food is the rule now. There are also rules to ensure that animals are better treated. Europe encourages its farmers to get involved in other activities. For example: \u2023 Have you heard of agritourism? \u2023 Have you ever visited a farm? \u2023 Have you ever bought food directly from a farm? Today we have a varied and high- quality diet Nowadays farmers and food shops have to put logos and labels on the packaging of \u2018farm to fork\u2019 foods. The labels tell us how the food is made and show its \u2018use by\u2019 date. For example, eggs always have a code that tells you the country where they were laid and whether the hens lived outdoors or in a cage. Eating well means eating a little of everything to satisfy our hunger, no more and no less. So ideally our farmers and breeders would produce a large range of foods, and enough to feed everyone . Brief history of the common agricultural policy In 1957 the six founding countries \u2014 Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 decided that there would be no more hunger in Europe. In 1962 they launched the CAP \u2014 the common agricultural policy . The aim was to produce enough food for everyone and to ensure that farmers could make a living off their land. European farmers received financial aid and could produce as much as they wanted. But because they produced so much, there were thousands of tonnes of food that nobody wanted to buy. What a waste! FARMING AND FOOD Eating well ",
        "9 Many products also have European logos that certify their quality or origin . The \u2018Protected Designation of Origin\u2019 logo means that the product has to be made, processed and prepared in a specific place or region. Examples are: Kalamata olive oil (Greece), Mel do Alentejo honey (Portugal), Herve cheese (Belgium) and Stupavsk\u00e9 zel\u00e9 sauerkraut (Slovakia). The \u2018Protected Geographical Indication\u2019 logo means that at least one of the stages in making the product (production, processing or preparation) has taken place in a specific place or region. Examples are: Kie\u0142basa piaszcza\u0144ska pork sausage (Poland) and Asparago di Cantello asparagus (Italy). This logo guarantees that 95 % of the ingredients are made organically and gives the name of the producer or seller. 0FRDEB01 DCR 03/06 A reference to how the hens were farmed 0 = organic 1 = free range 2 = barn 3 = cage Two letters identifying the country of origin Identification of the producer and production unit BB: best before date Eggs are extra fresh for 9 days after they are laid and fresh for 28 days \u2023 Look for some in your fridge or kitchen cupboards.

        "10 To eat healthily we need five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. It might seem like a lot, but it is possible! NO MORE JUNK FOOD! More than half of all adults in Europe are overweight. If nothing is done, Europe will face a real epidemic by 2030. Children are also affected: in 2018 one young person out of seven in Europe was overweight or obese. How can we get rid of junk food? Some schools have decided to ban hamburgers, chips, pizzas and fizzy drinks. Under the European school fruit scheme pupils are given free fruit and vegetables, and are encouraged to adopt healthy eating habits. \u2023 It\u2019s your birthday soon! Describe or draw your dream meal \u2026 and do not forget to include the five portions of fruit and vegetables you need for a healthy diet. ",
        "11 Do you know what \u2018culture\u2019 is? Culture is the expression of our way of life. Culture reflects the diversity of our traditions, our customs and our values. It encompasses the languages we speak, arts and arts venues, the architecture of our buildings, education and a whole range of other things. Discovering our own culture and the culture of others allows us to better understand one another and better live together. Creative Europe The European Union supports the development of many cultural and audiovisual sectors in the 28 Member States. Its aim is to raise awareness of talented creators in EU countries and to create numerous jobs in every cultural sector: cinema, TV, computer games, museums, music, books, etc. CULTURE Evoking emotions \u2023 Reveal your inner artist! Think of all the cultural sectors you are aware of and draw your favourite. Did you know? Every year two European cities are chosen to be the European Capitals of Culture. For 2019 they are Plovdiv (Bulgaria) and Matera (Italy). In 2020 they will be Rijeka (Croatia) and Galway (Ireland). ",

        "14 Aid for poor countries As we\u2019ve seen, one of the European Union\u2019s key values is solidarity . One example of this is the fight against poverty, which still affected one out of every five Europeans in 2018. And we\u2019re not the only ones in the world. Did you know that around 1.5 billion people live on just 1 euro a day? Many countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are victims of this kind of poverty. There are still too many people on our planet who don\u2019t have access to drinking water, healthcare or education. It\u2019s our duty to act! Together, the EU and its Member States provide more than half of all global aid. EUROPE IN THE WORLD Helping poor countries Humanitarian aid Every year around the world, millions of people are affected by natural disasters, conflicts and wars. The EU\u2019s humanitarian aid saves lives and provides food, shelter, medicine and drinking water to people in need. It is used to support families who have to leave war-torn countries and to rebuild buildings that have been destroyed. Why is this important? Living together means sharing times of joy but also showing concern for the small and large misfortunes of our neighbours, near and far. Solidarity is one of our European values ! ",
