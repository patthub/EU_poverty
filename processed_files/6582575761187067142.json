INTRODUCTION 1. On 30 May 2018, the Commission tabled the proposal for the European Social Fund Plus Regulation (ESF+ Regulation) 1 , which is part of the Cohesion Policy legislative package for 2021-2027. The overarching policy objective of the ESF+ Regulation is to help create a more performing and resilient 'Social Europe' and implement the European Pillar of Social Rights as well as the social and employment priorities endorsed by the European economic governance process. 1 Doc. 9573/18 + ADD1-2.

        "6182/21 AFG/cs 2 ECOMP.2 EN 2. The ESF+ Regulation was presented to the Structural Measures Working Party in June 2018 during the Bulgarian Presidency. The detailed examination of the ESF+ Regulation took place under the Austrian and the Romanian Presidencies. The Permanent Representatives Committee endorsed a (partial) mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament on the ESF+ Regulation on 3 April 2019 2 . 3. On 28 May 2020, following the COVID-19 outbreak, and as part of the revised MFF 2021-27 and of the Recovery Package, the Commission proposed various amendments to the Cohesion policy legislative package 2021-2027, including to the ESF+ Regulation 3 . On 22 July 2020, the Permanent Representatives Committee endorsed a (partial) mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament as regards the amended Commission proposal for the ESF+ Regulation 4 . 4. On 5 October 2020, Coreper endorsed an updated partial mandate for negotiations on the ESF+ Regulation 5 , to take account of the European Council Conclusions adopted in the special meeting of the European Council of 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 July 2020 and of all related elements included therein. 5. During the German Presidency, a provisional common understanding was reached at trilogue level on most of the provisions, only excluding thematic concentration requirements, governance and budgetary provisions. On 16 December 2020, the Permanent Representatives Committee took note of the progress made and acknowledged the results achieved with a Progress Report 6 II.

        "6182/21 AFG/cs 3 ECOMP.2 EN 7. A political agreement on the whole ESF+ Regulation was reached at the political trilogue on 28 January 2021. 8. Following the Structural Measures Working Party on 19 February 2021, the Presidency is of the view that a final and balanced compromise text has emerged which has been supported by the majority of Member States. III. CONCLUSION 9. On this basis, the Permanent Representatives Committee is, therefore, invited to: (a) endorse the final compromise text of the ESF+ Regulation as set out in the Annex to this note; (b) approve in principle the submission, at a later date, of this final compromise text as I/A item (following legal-linguistic review) for its adoption as the Council's first-reading position. This approval would be conditional upon the receipt of an offer letter from the Chair of the European Parliament's Regional Development Committee (REGI) confirming that the text set out in the Annex is acceptable to the Parliament and that, should the Council adopt the agreed text as its first-reading position, the Parliament would not adopt any amendments to it in its second reading.

        "6182/21 AFG/cs 4 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN ANNEX REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 46(d), Article 149, Article 153(2)(a), Article 164, Article 175(3) and Article 349 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 7 Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 8 , Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, Whereas: (1) On 17 November 2017, the European Pillar of Social Rights was jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission as a response to social challenges in Europe. The twenty key principles of the pillar are structured around three categories: equal opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; social protection and inclusion. The twenty principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights should guide the actions under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+). In order to contribute to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights the ESF+ should support investments in people and systems in the policy areas of employment, education and social inclusion, thereby supporting economic, territorial and social cohesion in accordance with Article 174 TFEU. 7 OJ C [\u2026], [\u2026], p. [\u2026]. 8 OJ C [\u2026], [\u2026], p. [\u2026]. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 5 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (2) At Union level, the European Semester of economic policy coordination is the framework to identify national reform priorities and monitor their implementation. Member States develop their own national multiannual investment strategies in support of those reform priorities. Those strategies should be presented alongside the yearly National Reform Programmes as a way to outline and coordinate priority investment projects to be supported by national and/or Union funding. They should also serve to use Union funding in a coherent manner and to maximise the added value of the financial support to be received notably from the programmes supported by the Union under the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund Plus, the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Investment Stabilisation Function and InvestEU, where relevant. (3) The Council of [\u2026] adopted revised guideline s for the employment policies of the Member States to align the text with the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, with a view to improving Europe's competitiveness and making it a better place to invest, create jobs and foster social cohesion. In order to ensure the full alignment of the ESF+ with the objectives of these guidelines, particularly as regards employment, education, training and the fight against social exclusion, poverty and discrimination, the ESF+ should support Member States, taking account of the relevant Integrated Guidelines and relevant country-specific recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 121(2) TFEU and Article 148(4) TFEU and, where appropriate, at national level, the national reform programmes underpinned by national strategies. The ESF+ should also contribute to relevant aspects of the implementation of key Union initiatives and activities, in particular the \"Skills Agenda for Europe\" and the European Education Area, relevant Council Recommendations and other initiatives such as the Youth Guarantee, Upskilling Pathways, Integration of the long-term unemployed and the EU Roma strategic framework on equality, inclusion and participation. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 6 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (4) On 20 June 2017, the Council endorsed the Union response to the 'UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development' - a sustainable European future. The Council underlined the importance of achieving sustainable development across the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental), in a balanced and integrated way. It is vital that sustainable development is mainstreamed into all Union internal and external policy areas and that the Union is ambitious in the policies it uses to address global challenges. The Council welcomed the Commission Communication on 'Next steps for a sustainable European future' of 22 November 2016 as a first step in mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals and applying sustainable development as an essential guiding principle for all Union policies, including through its financing instruments. The ESF+ should contribute to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals by, inter alia, eradicating extreme forms of poverty (goal 1); promoting quality and inclusive education (goal 4); promoting gender equality (goal 5); promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (goal 8); and reducing inequality (goal 10). (5) Recent and ongoing developments have aggravated the structural challenges arising from economic globalisation, social inequalities, the management of migration flows and the increased security threat, clean energy transition, technological change, demographic decline, unemployment in general and youth unemployment and an increasingly ageing workforce as well as stemming from growing mismatches between demand and supply of skills and labour in some sectors and regions, experienced especially by SMEs. The green and digital transitions and the transformation of European industrial ecosystems will entail many new opportunities, if accompanied by the right set of skills, employment and social policies and actions. Taking into account the changing realities of the world of work, the Union should be prepared for the current and future challenges by investing in relevant skills, education, training and lifelong learning making growth more inclusive and by improving employment and social policies, while taking into account economic and industrial sustainability, labour mobility and aiming for a gender balanced labour market. (6) Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] establishes the framework for action by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the Cohesion Fund, the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF), the Asylum and Migration Fund (AMIF), Internal Security Fund (ISF) and the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) as a part of the Integrated Border Management Fund (IBMF), and lays down, in particular, the policy objectives and the rules concerning programming, monitoring and evaluation, management and control for Union funds implemented under shared management. It is therefore necessary to specify the general objectives of the ESF+, and to lay down specific provisions concerning the type of activities that may be financed by the ESF+. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 7 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (7) Regulation (EU, Eurato m) No [the new FR] (the \u2018Financial Regulation\u2019) lays down rules on the implementation of the Union budget, in particular rules on all forms of financial contributions including grants, prizes, procurement, indirect implementation, financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees. Co-financing for grants may be provided from beneficiaries\u2019 own resources, income generated by the project or financial or in -kind contributions from third parties. In order to ensure coherence in the implementation of Union funding programmes, the Financial Regulation is to apply to the actions to be implemented in direct or indirect management under the ESF+. (8) The types of financing and the methods of implementation under this Regulation should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden, and the expected risk of non-compliance. For grants, this should include consideration of the use of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, as well as financing not linked to costs as envisaged in Article 125(1) of the Financial Regulation. To implement measures linked to the socio-economic integration of third country nationals, and in accordance with Article 88 of the Common Provisions Regulation, the Commission may reimburse Member States using simplified cost options including the use of lump sums. (9) In order to streamline and simplify the funding landscape and create additional opportunities for synergies through integrated funding approaches, the actions which were supported by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived ('FEAD') and the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation should be integrated into one ESF+. The ESF+ should therefore include two strands: the ESF+ strand under shared management and the Employment and Social Innovation strand implemented under direct and indirect management. This should contribute to reducing the administrative burden linked to the management of different funds, in particular for Member States and beneficiaries, whilst maintaining simpler rules for simpler operations such as the distribution of food and/or basic material assistance (10) In view of the wider scope of the ESF+, it is appropriate that the aims to enhance the effectiveness of labour markets, promote equal access to quality employment, improve equal access to and quality of education and training to aid reintegration into education systems, promote social inclusion and access to healthcare for vulnerable persons and contributing to eradicating poverty, are not only implemented through shared management, but also through direct and indirect management under the Employment and Social Innovation strand for actions required at Union level. [Recital (11) is deleted] (12) This Regulation lays down a financial envelope for the ESF+. It specifies the allocation for the ESF+ shared management strand and the allocation for actions to be implemented in direct and indirect management under the Employment and Social Innovation strand. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 8 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (12a) With a view to facilitating the implementation of the specific and operational objectives of the Employment and Social Innovation strand, the ESF+ should support activities related to technical and administrative assistance, such as preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities, while communication and dissemination activities are part of the actions eligible under the Employment and Social Innovation strand. (13) The ESF+ should aim to promote employment through active interventions enabling (re)integration into the labour market, notably for youth especially through the implementation of the reinforced Youth Guarantee, the long-term unemployed, disadvantaged groups on the labour market and the inactive, as well as through promoting self \u2013 employment and the social economy. The ESF+ should aim to improve the functioning of labour markets by supporting the modernisation of labour market institutions such as the Public Employment Services in order to improve their capacity to provide intensified targeted counselling and guidance during the job search and the transition to employment and to enhance workers\u2019 mobility. The ESF+ should promote a gender balanced participation in the labour market through measures aiming to ensure, amongst others, equal working conditions, improved work/life balance and access to childcare, including early childhood education and care. The ESF + should also aim to provide a healthy and well-adapted working environment in order to respond to health risks related to changing forms of work and the needs of the ageing workforce. (14) The ESF+ should provide support to improving the quality, inclusiveness, effectiveness, labour market relevance of education and training systems, including through promoting digital learning, validation of non-formal and informal learning, the professional development of teaching staff, in order to facilitate the acquisition of key competences notably as regards basic skills, including health literacy, media literacy, entrepreneurial skills, language skills, digital skills and competences for sustainable development which all individuals need for personal fulfilment and development, employment, social inclusion and active citizenship. The ESF+ should help progression within education and training and transition to work, support lifelong learning and employability with a view to facilitating full participation in society for all, and contribute to competitiveness including through graduate tracking, and to societal and economic innovation by supporting scalable and sustainable initiatives in these fields and adapted to different target groups such as persons with disabilities. This could be achieved for example through online learning, work-based training, traineeships, dual education and training systems, and apprenticeships9, lifelong guidance, skills anticipation in close cooperation with industry, up-to-date training materials and delivery methods, forecasting and graduate tracking, training of educators, validation of learning outcomes and recognition of qualifications and industry-based certifications. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 9 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (15) Support through the ESF+ should be used to promote equal access for all, in particular for disadvantaged groups, to quality, non-segregated and inclusive education and training, from early childhood education and care paying special attention to children coming from a socioeconomic disadvantaged background, through general and vocational education and training, notably apprenticeships, and to tertiary level, as well as adult education and learning, and including through sport and cultural activities. The ESF+ should provide targeted support to learners in need and reduce educational inequalities, including the digital divide, prevent and reduce early school leaving, foster permeability between education and training sectors, reinforce links with non-formal and informal learning and facilitate learning mobility for all and accessibility for persons with disabilities. Synergies with the Erasmus programme, notably to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged learners in learning mobility, should be supported within this context. (16) The ESF+ should promote flexible opportunities for upgrading of skills and acquiring new and different skills by all, notably entrepreneurial and digital skills, and skills for key enabling technologies as well as skills for the green economy as well as industrial ecosystems in line with the EU Industrial Strategy 10. In line with the Skills Agenda for Europe and the Upskilling Pathways Recommendation 11, the ESF+ should support flexible pathways, including accessible short targeted modular training leading to credentials, with a view to providing people with skills adjusted to labour market and industrial ecosystems needs, green and digital transitions, innovation and social and economic change, facilitating reskilling and upskilling and employability, career transitions, geographic and sectoral mobility and supporting in particular low-skilled, persons with disabilities and/or poorly qualified adults. The ESF+ should also facilitate the provision of integrated skills support to individuals, whether in employment, the unemployed or self-employed through instruments such as individual learning accounts. (17) Synergies with the Horizon Europe programme should ensure that the ESF+ can mainstream and scale up innovative curricula supported by Horizon Europe in order to equip people with the skills and competences needed for the jobs of the future. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 10 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (18) The ESF+ should support Member States\u2019 efforts to contribute to the eradication of poverty with a view to breaking the cycle of disadvantage across generations and promote social inclusion by ensuring equal opportunities for all, reducing barriers, tackling discrimination and addressing health inequalities. This implies mobilising a range of policies targeting the most disadvantaged people regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, age, religion or belief, racial or ethnic origin, in particular marginalised communities such as the Roma, people with disabilities or chronic diseases, homeless people, children and elderly people. The ESF+ should promote the active inclusion of people far from the labour market with a view to ensuring their socio- economic integration. The ESF+ should be also used to enhance timely and equal access to affordable, sustainable and high quality services that promote the access to housing and person- centred care such as healthcare and long-term care, in particular family and community-based care services. The ESF+ should contribute to the modernisation of social protection systems with a particular focus on children and disadvantaged groups and with a view, in particular, to promoting the accessibility of the systems including for persons with disabilities. (19) The ESF+ should contribute to the eradication of poverty by supporting national schemes aiming to alleviate food and material deprivation and promote social integration of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion and the most deprived. With the overall aim that at Union level a minimum of 4% of the resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management support the most deprived, Member States should allocate at least 3% of their national resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to address the forms of extreme poverty with the greatest social exclusion impact, such as homelessness, child poverty and food deprivation. The provision of food and/or basic material assistance to the most deprived should not replace existing social benefits provided to them under national social systems or according to national legislation. Due to the nature of the operations and the type of end recipients, it is necessary that simpler rules apply to support which addresses material deprivation of the most deprived. (20) In light of the persistent need to enhance efforts to address the management of the migration flows in the Union as a whole and in order to ensure a coherent, strong and consistent support to the solidarity and responsibility-sharing efforts, the ESF+ should provide support to promote the socio-economic integration of third country nationals, including migrants, which may include initiatives at local level, complementary to the actions financed under the Asylum [Integration] and Migration Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and other EU funds which can have a positive effect on the inclusion of third-country nationals. (20a) Due to the importance of access to healthcare, the ESF+ should ensure synergies and complementarities with the Health Programme, and the ESF+ scope should include access to health care for people in vulnerable situations. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 11 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (21) The ESF+ should support policy and system reforms in the fields of employment, social inclusion, access to healthcare for vulnerable persons, long-term care, education and training, contributing to poverty eradication. In order to strengthen alignment with the European Semester, Member States should allocate an appropriate amount of their resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to implement relevant country-specific recommendations relating to structural challenges which it is appropriate to address through multiannual investments falling within the scope of the ESF+ , taking into account the European Pillar of Social Rights, the Social Scoreboard and regional specificities. The Commission and the Member States should ensure coherence, coordination and complementarity between the shared-management strand of ESF+ and other Union funds, programmes and instruments such as the Just Transition Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the Health Programme, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, Erasmus+, the Asylum and Migration Fund, Horizon Europe, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the Digital Europe Programme, InvestEU, Creative Europe, the European Solidarity Corps and the Technical Support Instrument. In particular, the Commission and the Member State should ensure, in all stages of the process, effective coordination in order to safeguard the consistency, coherence, complementarity and synergy among sources of funding, including technical assistance thereof. (21a) Through the support to the specific objectives set out in Article 4(1) under policy objective 4 \u201ca more social Europe\u201d, the ESF + will continue to contribute to territorial and local development strategies in order to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights. It will support the tools set out in Article [22] of the CPR and thereby also contribute to the delivery of policy objective 5 \u201ca Europe closer to citizens\", including through poverty reduction and social inclusion measures taking into account the specificities of urban, rural and coastal regions in view of tackling the socioeconomic inequalities in cities and regions. (22) To ensure that the social dimension of Europe as set out in the European Pillar of Social Rights is duly put forward and that a minimum amount of resources is targeting those most in need Member States should allocate at least 25% of their national ESF+ resources of the ESF+ strand under shared management to fostering social inclusion. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 12 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN ( 22a) With a view to addressing the persistently high level of child poverty in the Union, and in line with principle 11 of the European Pillar of Social Rights which states that children have the right to protection from poverty, and children from disadvantaged backgrounds have the rights to specific measures to enhance equal opportunities, all Member States should programme an appropriate amount of their ESF+ resources under shared management for the implementation of the [forthcoming] Child Guarantee through activities addressing child poverty in line with the specific objectives of the ESF+ that allow for programming resources towards actions directly supporting children's equal access to childcare, education, healthcare, decent housing and adequate nutrition. Member States having an average rate of children of less than 18 years old at risk of poverty or social exclusion for the period between 2017 and 2019 above the Union average for that period, on the basis of Eurostat data, should allocate at least 5% of their ESF+ resources under shared management to the aforementioned activities. Operations contributing to this thematic concentration requirement should count towards the 25% thematic concentration requirement for social inclusion when programmed under specific objectives (vii) to (x), with the exception of support to the most deprived. (23) In order to facilitate an inclusive economic recovery after a major crisis and support youth employment in a changing world of work and in the light of persistently high levels of youth unemployment and inactivity in a number of Member States and regions, it is necessary that all Member States invest an appropriate amount of their ESF+ resources in measures to support youth employment and skills, including through the implementation of Youth Guarantee schemes. Building on the actions supported by the Youth Employment Initiative in the 2014- 2020 programming period targeting individual persons and the lessons learnt, Member States should further promote quality employment and education reintegration pathways and invest in early prevention and effective outreach by prioritising, where relevant, long-term unemployed, inactive and disadvantaged young people including through youth work. Member States should also invest in measures aimed at facilitating school-to-work transition as well as adequate capacities of employment services so as to provide tailor-made and holistic support and better targeted offers to young people. By fully integrating the Youth Employment Initiative into the ESF+, the delivery of targeted actions for youth employment will be more effective and efficient and the scope will be extended to structural measures and reforms, thus ensuring a better match between EU funding support and the implementation of the reinforced Youth Guarantee. Upgrading of skills and acquiring new and different skills shall help young people seize the opportunities of growing sectors and prepare them for the changing nature of work, while also harnessing the opportunities arising from the digital and green transitions and the transformation of the European industrial ecosystems. Therefore, Member States having a rate of young people aged 15 to 29 not in employment, education or training for the period between 2017 and 2019 above the Union average for that period on the basis of Eurostat data, should allocate at least 12,5% of their ESF+ resources under shared management to those actions. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 13 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (24) Member States should ensure coordination and complementarity between the actions supported by these funds. (25) In accordance with Article 349 TFEU and Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession, the outermost regions and the northern sparsely populated regions are entitled to specific measures under common policies and EU programmes. Due to the permanent constraints such as depopulation these regions require specific support. (26) Efficient and effective implementation of actions supported by the ESF+ depends on good governance and partnership between all actors at the relevant territorial levels and the socio- economic actors, in particular the social partners and civil society. It is therefore essential that all Member States should allocate an appropriate amount of their ESF+ resources under shared management to ensure the meaningful participation of social partners and civil society in the implementation of the ESF+ under shared management including relevant bodies representing civil society, such as environmental partners, non-governmental organisations, and bodies responsible for promoting social inclusion, fundamental rights, rights of persons with disabilities, gender equality and non-discrimination. Member States with a country-specific recommendation on capacity building of social partners or civil society should allocate at least 0.25% of ESF+ resources to that purpose due to the specific needs they have in that area. (27) With a view to rendering policies more responsive to social change and to encourage and support innovative solutions, support for social innovation is crucial. In particular, testing and evaluating innovative solutions before scaling them up is instrumental in improving the efficiency of the policies and thus justifies specific support from the ESF+. Social economy enterprises can play a key role in delivering on social innovation and in contributing to economic and social resilience. The definition of a social economy enterprise should follow the definitions given in the Member States\u2019 social economy law and in the Council Conclusions of 7 December 2015 on the promotion of the social economy as a key driver of economic and social development in Europe. Moreover, with a view to enhancing mutual learning and exchange of knowledge and practices, Member States are encouraged to continue their transnational cooperation activities under shared management in the areas of employment, education and training, and social inclusion in line with the specific objectives of the ESF+. ",
        "6182/21 AFG/cs 14 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (28) The Member States and the Commission should ensure that ESF+ contributes to the promotion of equality between women and men in accordance with Article 8 TFEU to foster equality of treatment and opportunities between women and men in all areas, including regarding participation in the labour market, terms and conditions of employment and career progression. They should also ensure that the ESF+ promotes equal opportunities for all, without discrimination in accordance with Article 10 TFEU and promotes the inclusion in society of persons with disabilities on equal basis with others and contributes to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The ESF + should contribute to promote accessibility for persons with disabilities with a view to improving integration into employment, education and training and thereby enhancing their inclusion in all spheres of life. These principles should be taken into account in all dimensions and in all stages of the preparation, monitoring, implementation and evaluation of programmes, in a timely and consistent manner while ensuring that specific actions are taken to promote gender equality and equal opportunities. The ESF+ should also promote the transition from residential/institutional care to family and community-based care, in particular for those who face multiple discrimination. The ESF+ should not support any action that contributes to segregation or to social exclusion. Regulation (EU) No [future CPR] provides that rules on eligibility of expenditure are to be established at national level, with certain exceptions for which it is necessary to lay down specific provisions with regard to the ESF+ strand under shared management . (28a) All operations should be selected and implemented in respect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Commission should do its utmost to ensure that complaints are assessed in a timely manner, including complaints related to infringements of the Charter, and should inform the complainant of the result of its assessment in line with the Commission Communication on EU Law: Better results through better application 9 . (29) In order to reduce the administrative burden for the collection of data, reporting requirements should be kept as simple as possible. Member States may, where such data are available in registers, allow managing authorities to collect data from registers. (30) With regard to the processing of personal data within the framework of this Regulation, national data controllers should carry out their tasks for the purposes of this Regulation in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The dignity and respect of privacy of end recipients of operations under specific objective (xi) should be guaranteed. In order to avoid any stigmatisation, the persons receiving food or basic material assistance should not be required to identify themselves when receiving the support and when taking part in surveys on the most deprived persons that have benefitted from the ESF+ programme. 9 C/2016/8600, OJ C 18, 19.1.2017, p. 10 \u2013 20.

        "6182/21 AFG/cs 15 ANNEX ECOMP.2 EN (31) Social experimentation is a small-scale project testing which allows gathering evidence on the feasibility of social innovations. It should be possible and encouraged for ideas to be tested at local level and for those that are feasible to be pursued on a wider scale - where appropriate - or transferred to other contexts in different regions or Member States with financial support from the ESF+ or in combination with other sources. (32) The ESF+ lays down provisions intended to achieve freedom of movement for workers on a non-discriminatory basis by ensuring the close cooperation of the public employment services of Member States, the Commission and the social partners. The European network of employment services should promote a better functioning of the labour markets by facilitating the cross-border mobility of workers, notably through cross-border partnerships, and a greater transparency of information on the labour markets. The ESF+ scope also includes developing and supporting targeted mobility schemes with a view to filling vacancies where labour market shortcomings have been identified. (33) Lack of access to finance for microenterprises, social economy and social enterprises is one of the main obstacles to business creation, especially among people furthest from the labour market. Under the EaSI strand, the ESF+ Regulation lays down provisions in order to create a market eco-system to increase the supply of and access to finance for social enterprises as well as to meet demand from those who need it most, and in particular the unemployed, women and vulnerable people who wish to start up or develop a microenterprise. This objective will also be addressed through financial instruments and budgetary guarantee under the social investment and skills policy window of the InvestEU Fund. Social economy enterprises, when defined under national law, should be regarded as social enterprises in the meaning of the EaSI strand, regardless of their legal status, as far as they comply with the definition provided in this Regulation. (34) Social investment market players, including philanthropic actors, can play a key role in achieving several ESF+ objectives, as they offer financing as well as innovative and complementary approaches to combatting social exclusion and poverty, reducing unemployment and contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, philanthropic actors such as foundations and donors should be involved, as appropriate and as long as they do not have a political or social agenda in conflict with Union ideals, in ESF+ actions in particular in those aimed at developing the social investment market ecosystem. (34a) Guidance is needed with regard to the development of social infrastructures and related services, in particular for social housing, childcare and education, healthcare and long-term care, including facilities to assist transitions from institutional to family and community-based care services and taking into account accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities.

Relevant actions will be identified during the preparation and implementation, and reassessed in the context of the mid-term evaluation. (47) Pursuant to Article [94 of Council Decision 2013/755/EU 12 ], persons and entities established in Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) are to be eligible for funding subject to the rules and objectives of the Employment and Social Innovation strand and possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant OCTs are linked. (48) Third countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA) may participate in Union programmes in the framework of the cooperation established under the EEA agreement, which provides for the implementation of the programmes by a decision under that agreement.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (52) In order to amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending and supplementing the annexes on the indictors. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. (53) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. The implementing powers relating to the model for the structured survey of end recipients should be exercised in accordance with the advisory procedure of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of European Parliament and of the Council 15 given the nature of this model. 15 Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13).

The Commission should adopt the measures that are most appropriate in light of the exceptional or unusual circumstances that a Member State is facing while preserving the objectives of the fund, but this should not include amendments to the thematic concentration requirements. Furthermore, the implementing powers in relation to the temporary measures for the use of the Funds in response to exceptional and unusual circumstances should be adopted without committee procedures given that the scope of application is determined by the Stability and Growth Pact and limited to the measures set out in this Regulation. The Commission should also monitor the implementation and assess the appropriateness of the measures. Where the Commission deems it necessary to amend the Regulation due to the exceptional and unusual circumstances, the scope of the amendment should not include the thematic concentration requirements related to youth employment nor support to the most deprived. This is due to the fact that these groups are often most adversely affected by such crisis situations therefore it is necessary to ensure that these target groups continue to receive an adequate amount of support. (55) The Commission should be assisted in the administration of the ESF+ by the Committee provided for in Article 163 TFEU. In order to enable the ESF+ committee to have all the necessary information at its disposal and obtain a wide range of views of relevant stakeholders, the ESF+ Committee should be able to invite representatives without a voting right provided the agenda of the meeting requires their participation, including representatives of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund and relevant civil society organizations. (56) In order to ensure that the specificities of each ESF+ strand continue to be addressed, the ESF+ Committee should create working groups for each of the strands. Their composition and tasks are to be established by the ESF+ Committee. The working groups should have the possibility to invite civil society representatives as a well as other stakeholders to its meetings. The tasks of the working groups may include ensuring coordination and cooperation between Member State authorities and the Commission on the implementation of the ESF+, including consultation on the EaSI strand work programme, monitoring the implementation of each strand, exchanging experience and good practice within and across the strands and fostering potential synergies with other Union Programmes. (57) In order to ensure a greater transparency regarding the implementation of the ESF+ Regulation, the Commission should establish the necessary links with relevant policy committees active in the social and employment field, such as the Employment and Social Protection Committee or the Advisory Committee on Health and Safety at Work.
