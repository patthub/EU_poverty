        "K. stressing the importance of peace education where children are victims of violent conflict, as is the case with children in refugee camps, L. believing that tackling the education crisis is one of the most effective strategies at our disposal for breaking the cycle of poverty, and is key to sustainable human development and efforts to make progress towards the internationally agreed 2015 human development targets, M. regretting the fact that since the Dakar Conference there has been minimal progress and a lack of leadership in coordinating international efforts to tackle the crisis in education, N. whereas on current trends we will not meet the 2005 target for gender equity in education, particu- larly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, and the 2015 target for universal primary education will be comprehensively missed, with an estimated 75 million children remaining out of school, O. whereas efforts are being seriously undermined by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as a result of which 10 % of teachers in the worst affected countries in Africa are expected to die over the next five years, and the number of AIDS orphans are predicted to rise to more than 20 % of all school-age children, P. whereas global economic inequalities and the burden of debt has left many governments without the resources to provide education for all children, and structural adjustment programmes have forced governments to reduce public sector spending, Q. believing that the classroom experience should be child centred, relevant to the local community and in the local language, and that curricula need to be flexible and relevant to children(cid:146)s lives, R. noting that the Global Campaign for Education has called for spending priorities to be reordered in those countries where military expenditure is high, to ensure that education has a greater emphasis in the national budget, S. believing that the achievement of basic education for all is a precondition for more equitable patterns of globalisation, and for the closure of the digital divide, T. whereas donors, including the EU, should develop joint guidelines on policy, operating procedures, accounting systems and monitoring and evaluation, and donors should end the practice of aid tying in the education sector, in both the provision of goods and services, U. noting that in view of the capacity constraints faced by developing countries it is important to set realistic time scales for the production of participatory national education plans, and that 2002 may be a difficult deadline to meet, 1.

        "4.

Calls for reform of the IMF and World Bank structural adjustment policies to ensure that they sup- port rather than undermine free, quality education; 6.

Stresses that schools should be (cid:145)zones of safety(cid:146) where the rights of children are respected and where incidents of sexual harassment and violence in and around schools are documented and taken seriously and that there is an understanding that this is a major cause of children, in particular girls, dropping out of school; 26. Points out that the poor quality of education is a major factor in pupils dropping out of school and calls for particular attention to be paid to the need to improve the quality of education provided, amongst other things by adapting the school calendar to suit local needs, taking into account the demands of seasonal labour, and teaching lessons in local languages; 27.
