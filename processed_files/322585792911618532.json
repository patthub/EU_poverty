        "3 For the fi rst time in its history \u2013 and for the fi rst time in the history of the European Union \u2013 Poland will be taking the helm of the six-month rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. It will also be carrying out this role for the fi rst time within the new structure put in place by the Lisbon Treaty. 184 days \u2013 that is how long Poland has been given to negotiate and fi nd a solution to the problems that lie at the heart of political debate in the European Union today. Poland has 4416 hours or 264 960 minutes to make its mark as a modern, creative and dynamic country. The challenge is on! Among the key items on the EU\u2019s agenda \u2013 the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the future EU budget and major reforms of such areas as cohesion policy and the CAP. Poland has ambitious plans for its presidency: it has also included on its agenda such items as strengthening the single market, the EU\u2019s neighbourhood policy and the Eastern Partnership in particular, the EU\u2019s external energy policy as well as environmental protection. Local and regional authorities will naturally be closely following the progress of the negotiations on strategic issues relating to the future of cohesion policy and the draft regulations on cohesion policy beyond 2013. Indeed, Poland has proven itself to be an exemplary Member State as regards its use of structural funds. It has managed to successfully demonstrate how the largest benefi ciary of EU funds has been able to (virtually) avoid the effects of the crisis thanks to the resources provided by cohesion policy and through intelligent governance at national level. The fact is that it is Poland\u2019s citizens who have gained the most from the added value provided by cohesion policy. I have little doubt that the example of Poland will be useful for other players on the European arena who are actively searching for new sources of economic growth in Europe. The Polish presidency will also include a review of the Baltic Sea Strategy. This will provide the Committee of the Regions with an ideal opportunity to stress the important role of the regions in the implementation of macro-regional strategies and, accordingly, the importance of territorial cooperation instruments such as the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC). And while Poland has its ambitions, the same is true for the Committee of the Regions, which will do all it can to make sure that the voice of the local and regional authorities is heard during all the political debates, which will already start getting underway in the second half of 2011. All set for an ambitious presidency 01 Mercedes Bresso President of the Committee of the Regions kg106418_inside_B.indd 1 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "4 As the largest benefi ciary of cohesion policy, Poland is aware of its responsibility for shaping the debate on the policy\u2019s future. The Polish presidency of the Council which begins in July is therefore an ideal time to actually start the negotiations on the future EU budget. We are fully prepared to take up this challenge. The implementation of cohesion policy in Poland has been a success story. Partly thanks to this policy, in the few years that have elapsed since Poland joined the EU, per capita national income has risen from 45% of the EU average to 60%. Poland was the only EU country to avoid recession in 2009 and this was in large part due to the effective implementation of the cohesion policy. Cohesion policy ensures that participation in the internal market benefi ts all EU regions. In such diffi cult and uncertain times Europe needs solidarity, not egoism. For obvious reasons, the word \u201csolidarity\u201d occupies a special place in the hearts of the Polish people. With Polish membership of the EU, solidarity took on an additional European dimension. I am convinced that against the backdrop of the new economic and social challenges facing the EU, the principle of solidarity should also be understood as intergenerational solidarity. Decisions on the future of the EU budget\u2019s fi nancial policies, including cohesion policy, will have a considerable impact on the quality of life of future generations and the competitiveness of the EU economy far beyond the lifetime of the Europe 2020 strategy. It is worth pointing out here that the projects being carried out as part of the cohesion policy are perfectly in line with the goals of this strategy, namely building an innovative European economy that makes use of all social resources. Taking account of the various levels of development of Europe\u2019s economies and the different avenues for achieving the EU\u2019s strategic goals, the success of the Europe 2020 strategy will in large part depend on the fl exibility of the steps taken and the role of local and regional authorities. Cohesion policy ties in perfectly with these requirements as well. The measures taken are not standardised, but are geared towards the development needs and potential of a given region. In the southern countries, which over the past 20 years have had the opportunity to develop one of the highest levels of basic infrastructure in the world, the EU\u2019s cohesion policy should help people to acquire new skills and to move to the knowledge-based economy. In the EU-12 countries, this policy should continue to be the main source of funding for public investment and innovation which is increasing demand. In future, the EU\u2019s task will also be to construct infrastructure links with the regions of the Western Balkans in order to prepare for the integration of these countries into the common market. Measures also need to be stepped up to integrate the Roma community, migrants and other minorities into society. In uncertain economic times, the need for a smart cohesion policy is more relevant than ever. The economic downturn of recent years has had a very uneven impact from a territorial point of view. The most affected countries have been those which are furthest from the EU\u2019s most developed regions, including the Baltic and the Balkan countries. It is for this Donald Tusk Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland Strong regions mean a competitive Europe 02 kg106418_inside_B.indd 2 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union 5 reason that the additional benefi ts of cohesion policy cannot be overestimated. At a time of strong macroeconomic upheaval, the policy has acted as a mechanism for stabilising the economy and boosting the level of consumption, while calming the turbulence in local markets and throughout the EU. Cohesion policy should therefore be one of the EU\u2019s key instruments to help it emerge from the crisis. The architects of the EU\u2019s cohesion policy never intended it to be a tax on the rich and a social transfer for the poor. It was always intended, fi rst and foremost, to create a level playing fi eld and this should remain so in future. It is therefore important to maintain a strong cohesion policy as a key element of the European socio-economic model. I believe that cohesion policy provides mechanisms which work well and have proved effective in all 271 regions of the EU. They are based on sharing tasks and on cooperation among the various levels of government and local and regional authorities as well as local stakeholders. This unique system is characterised by a high degree of fl exibility, tapping the potential of local and regional initiatives and helping to develop civil society. The cohesion policy also embodies the subsidiarity principle, since development needs are assessed and implemented at the lowest possible level. For this reason, Poland is opposed to separating sectoral funds from cohesion policy or creating new funds. Those managed from Brussels never produce the same effects as structural funds implemented at grass-roots level. Only cohesion policy can guarantee a cohesive, overarching and territorial approach to the problems of economic development. The instruments of this policy make it possible to deal effectively with the new challenges facing the EU, such as improving energy effi ciency, adapting to demographic change, combating climate change and countering the negative aspects of globalisation. I fi rmly believe that the architecture of the EU\u2019s cohesion policy should be based on the three existing fi nancial instruments, namely: the Cohesion Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. For this reason, at the initiative of Poland, the prime ministers of the Visegrad Group signed a joint letter addressed to the president of the European Commission, presenting a united front on the matter of maintaining the current architecture of the cohesion policy, which should encompass all EU regions. The forthcoming Polish presidency of the Council of the European Union will undoubtedly be an excellent opportunity to stress this position clearly in a European forum. Implementing the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy requires an integrated approach to all development policies. Therefore, when reforming cohesion policy, we must not overlook rural development policy. These areas are the most exposed to the problems of an ageing population and depopulation. The EU\u2019s cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy should therefore complement each other and not be in competition. kg106418_inside_B.indd 3 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "6 The Polish presidency, the Committee of the Regions and the future of cohesion 03 The European Union\u2019s regional policy after 2013 will be taking shape during Poland\u2019s presidency of the EU in the second half of 2011. The most severe economic crisis since World War II has put pressure on public fi nances in EU Member States. While we are not out of the woods yet, the worst seems to be over. Europe is laying foundations for stronger, fairer and more balanced growth. During this post-crisis debate, we can hear voices questioning one of the main pillars of the EU - its cohesion policy. The temptation is to cut and nationalise the regional EU\u2019s policy. We must not give in to this temptation. The European Parliament, and surely also the Committee of the Regions, will fi ght for a budget which matches the EU\u00b4s goals and ambitions. It is clear that European regional policy is not only an expression of solidarity, but that it is also benefi cial from an economic point of view. It is an instrument for investment, not a lump sum awarded to needy regions to alleviate their daily problems. Its aim is to ensure solid and sustainable growth in poorer regions that will benefi t the richer ones as well. The new regional policy should build on previous expertise, but we should address the shortcomings that have become evident in recent years. I believe three principles should guide us in our efforts to strike the balance between continuity and change for the post- 2013 cohesion policy: prioritisation, simplifi cation and Europeanness. By prioritisation I mean that we should limit the number of goals and be determined in their pursuit. Regional policy must help to fulfi l the Europe 2020 targets. We must ensure that funds are spent to create durable jobs thanks to sustained growth. We need to maintain consistency among different policies. In this respect, it will be essential to fi ne-tune the relations between the Common Agricultural Policy and Regional Policy to avoid any overlap and waste of fi nancial and human resources. Horizontal streamlining should be valid for all our policies. Simplifi cation has many advantages, but it is not a panacea. Unspent funds are not money saved by the EU. A complex allocation procedure makes regional funds notoriously diffi cult to receive. We need a more user-friendly funding system and better communication which Jerzy Buzek President of the European Parliament kg106418_inside_B.indd 4 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "7 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union would make the allocation of the funds more effective and transparent. But simplicity should reinforce, not reduce our rigour. We have seen examples of bad administration and misappropriations of funds, often due to loopholes in the rules. Simplicity should not be at the detriment of fi rmness. At the same time, regional policy must remain an example of multi-level governance, a partnership between the local, regional, national and European governing bodies in the joint effort to design, fi nance, implement and monitor the pursuit of our shared goals. The European dimension of regional policy is not up for discussion. The European Parliament has stated in its October resolution that Member States should refrain from attempts to re-nationalise regional policy. Let me conclude by wishing the Polish government every success in its handling of the presidency, which marks the start of a new trio of presidencies. The European Parliament looks forward to fruitful and intensive cooperation. kg106418_inside_B.indd 5 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "8 What is the signifi cance of cohesion policy against the backdrop of the EU\u2019s development challenges? The EU is facing diffi cult times. It is being confronted with the need to ensure an effective return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to continually improve the competitiveness of the EU economy on the international arena, to boost energy security and to deal with the effects of climate and demographic change. Meeting so many challenges requires a huge institutional and fi nancial effort. This is why it is so important to make maximum use of the latent potential of existing EU policies and instruments. It is therefore essential to coordinate measures, streamline the implementation mechanism and to gear it towards delivering concrete results. Cohesion policy fi ts in very well with this economical approach to meeting the development challenges of the European Union. First, it helps to maintain macroeconomic balance, boosting economic growth and employment in times of economic downturn. Thanks to the implementation of multi-annual development projects, the cohesion policy counteracts any sharp decline in investment and growth in unemployment. Second, cohesion policy measures help to boost the competitiveness of the European economy and build the single market and thus strengthen economic and monetary union. For the funds of the policy are used to carry out a series of projects supporting development of innovation and entrepreneurship, raising the quality and mobility of human capital, as well as infrastructure development projects. Third, under the cohesion policy, projects are carried out which tie in very well with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, i.e. constructing a green and innovative European economy which makes use of all social resources. It is therefore clear that creating new development instruments against the backdrop of budgetary diffi culties requires time, more human resources and extra fi nancial resources. Given that cohesion policy is a very important tool for implementing the EU\u2019s strategic goals, I feel that the debate on the future of this policy in the new fi nancial perspective should be conducted at political level, during formal meetings of ministers responsible for cohesion policy at the General Affairs Council. This debate should defi ne the role of cohesion policy as being crucial in the process of overcoming the crisis and restoring jobs, boosting the competitiveness of the European economy and constructing a green path of growth. Cohesion policy: a European policy that promotes development 04 El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska Minister of Regional Development kg106418_inside_B.indd 6 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "9 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union What benefi ts do European economies derive from cohesion policy funds? The cohesion policy is an integral part of the EU\u2019s development policies and should support all of its regions. Each region, regardless of its level of development, has potential which should be tapped in order to meet the EU\u2019s development goals. The objective of this policy is therefore not to support the development of only the poorest areas of the Community. Thanks to the single market, all countries and regions of the EU benefi t from it, even the richest areas. Polish research shows that over the 2004-2015 period almost EUR 38 bn, in other words over half of the structural support granted to Poland, will have returned to the EU15 countries (both directly and indirectly). Cohesion policy plays a special role in ensuring that signifi cant progress takes place more rapidly. Poland is an example of a country which, thanks to cohesion policy, is developing more quickly and in a more stable way. We are living proof that cohesion policy stabilises economic growth and employment in times of economic downturn. Over half of the economic growth in Poland in 2009 was achieved thanks to EU funds and the number of people in work increased by some 150 000. Poland is also proof that cohesion policy promotes modernisation, development and lasting structural change, creates a requirement for comprehensive development measures and encourages various groups and levels of government to carry out joint projects. There have been particularly positive results in terms of the implementation of multi-fund projects, i.e. projects supported jointly through the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. What are Poland\u2019s objectives for the presidency? In the area of cohesion policy, the biggest challenge facing the Polish presidency will be to organise a discussion on draft regulations for this policy in the next fi nancial perspective. We would like to steer the debate towards issues which will make it possible to increase the effectiveness of cohesion policy with a view to further strengthening its added value on a European scale. We hope to come up with joint solutions in the area of strategic planning, thematic concentration, mechanisms ensuring compliance with conditions and evaluation. We expect the European Commission to submit draft regulations at the start of the Polish presidency so that by the end of the period the initial results of the negotiations will already be clear. Aside from the debate on regulations, the Polish presidency intends to continue work on the territorial agenda and the integrated approach to development. In November, we would like to organise a joint informal meeting of ministers with responsibility for regional policy, cohesion, territorial cohesion and urban development with a view to adopting integrated conclusions. I am pleased that it will be during the Polish presidency that the discussion will be launched on the actual form of the cohesion policy after 2013. The successful implementation of the policy to date in Poland is a clear example of its comprehensive effectiveness in meeting EU development goals and it will certainly be an excellent starting point for an intensive and fruitful European debate. kg106418_inside_B.indd 7 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "10 The three main decision-making institutions in the EU are the European Parliament, which represents the EU\u2019s citizens and is directly elected by them, the Council of the European Union, which represents the individual Member States, and the European Commission, which upholds the interests of the Union as a whole. However, local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing the vast majority of the decisions taken at European level - around two-thirds of EU legislation is put into practice at sub-national level. That is why the Committee of the Regions (CoR) was set up in 1994, to give local and regional authorities the opportunity to express a view on the substance of EU legislative proposals at the drafting stage in order to adapt them more closely to citizens\u2019 needs. The European treaties stipulate that the Committee of the Regions must be consulted whenever proposals are made in areas likely to have repercussions at local or regional level. In practice, this means that the Committee of the Regions is consulted on most European legislation. The Maastricht Treaty (1992) laid down fi ve areas for mandatory consultation: economic and social cohesion, trans-European networks, health, education and culture. The Treaty of Amsterdam (1997) added a further fi ve areas: employment policy, social policy, the environment, vocational training and transport. Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the CoR has acquired new powers, both in the area of territorial cohesion and in terms of monitoring the subsidiarity principle The CoR now has a greater consultative role to play, and also new leverage for implementing multilevel governance. The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council must now consult the Committee of the Regions when making laws in any area with a regional impact. And the Committee\u2019s opinions now cover several new policy areas, including energy and climate change. However, all three institutions may also consult the CoR outside these areas if they see local or regional implications in their work. The Committee of the Regions can also put its priorities onto the European Union\u2019s agenda by issuing own-initiative opinions and drafting reports on subjects of interest to it. But the CoR\u2019s involvement does not stop once it has issued its opinion on a Commission proposal. The CoR also has the right to question the Commission, Parliament and Council if they fail to take on board its viewpoint. In extreme cases, the CoR also has the right to go to the European Court of Justice if it believes it has not been correctly consulted. How does the Committee of the Regions work? The Committee of the Regions is made up of 344 members and the same number of alternates. These members are appointed by the Member States for a renewable fi ve year term. They must hold elected offi ce or be politically accountable to an elected assembly. For this reason, members who cease to hold such offi ce automatically lose their seat on the Committee of the Regions. Each country chooses its members in its own way, with the proviso that members must refl ect a political and geographical balance and be taken from both regional and local levels. The CoR members elect their own president \u2013 currently Ms Mercedes Bresso from the Piedmont Region in Italy. The CoR\u2019s work is split between six specialised commissions: \u2212 Territorial Cohesion policy (COTER) \u2212 Economic and Social policy (ECOS) \u2212 Environment, Climate change and Energy (ENVE) Why a Committee of the Regions? 05 kg106418_inside_B.indd 8 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "11 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union \u2212 Culture, Education and Research (EDUC) \u2212 Citizenship, Governance, Institutional and External Affairs (CIVEX) \u2212 Natural Resources (NAT) The commissions, which are made up of CoR members, draw up draft opinions on legislative proposals submitted by the European Commission, the Council or the European Parliament. The draft is then voted on during one of the fi ve plenary sessions that take place each year. It is only adopted if it receives a majority of votes cast. The CFAA of the Committee of the Regions was set up to facilitate and encourage a closer relationship with the budget authority, in order to ensure that the CoR\u2019s priorities are taken into account and implemented in the annual budget procedure. During the years 2008- 2010, a Pole, Leszek \u015awi\u0119talski, Mayor of Stare Bogaczowice, served as CFAA chairman. Four political groups are represented at the Committee of the Regions: the European People\u2019s Party (EPP), the Party of European Socialists (PES), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) and the European Alliance (EA). The current EA President, Jerzy Zaj\u0105ka\u0142a, Mayor of \u0141ubianka, is Polish. The work of the Committee of the Regions, a truly political assembly, is based on three fundamental principles: \u2212 The subsidiarity principle: this principle requires that decisions be taken at the level of government that best serves the public interest. The European Union must not pursue initiatives that would be better carried out by national, regional or local authorities. \u2212 The proximity principle: all levels of government must work as transparently as possible and as closely as possible with the public so that citizens know who is responsible for what and how they can make their views known. \u2212 The partnership principle: European, national, regional and local authorities must work together throughout the decision-making process. Bringing the European Union closer to its citizens While much of the CoR\u2019s work lies in its involvement in the legislative process, its role does not stop there. The CoR members live and work on a day-to-day basis in their regions and cities as regional presidents, mayors or local councillors. This enables them to stay in touch with the concerns of the people they represent, which puts them in a position to bring these views to the heart of the European system when they come to Brussels for CoR meetings. In addition, the CoR regularly raises the profi le of local and regional authorities on the European stage by organising conferences, seminars and exhibitions all year round in cooperation with its regional and local partners, including the \u201cOPEN DAYS - European Week of Regions and Cities\u201d, which brings together more than 7000 stakeholders each October. kg106418_inside_B.indd 9 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "12 The Lisbon Treaty: more democracy for Europe The Lisbon Treaty was signed on 13 December 2007 and entered into force on 1st December 2009. It improves the standing of regions and cities in the European Union\u2019s political system and boosts the institutional role of their representative body in Brussels \u2013 the Committee of the Regions - throughout the legislative process. In addition to extended consultation requirements during the adoption of EU legislation, the CoR now also has the right to bring legal actions before the European Court of Justice in two instances: to protect its own institutional prerogatives; and to request the annulment of new EU legislation that it considers to be in breach of the subsidiarity principle in those policy areas where the EU Treaty requires that the CoR be consulted. For the fi rst time, \u2018territorial cohesion\u2019 is enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty as a fundamental objective of the European Union. The Treaty also recognises local and regional autonomy and provides for greater subsidiarity monitoring by national and regional parliaments with legislative powers. European legislation will also, in future, take greater account of the needs of European citizens and their elected local and regional representatives. \u201cThe European Commission has been pursuing a \u201cbetter lawmaking\u201d programme for several years. Since 70% of EU legislation is implemented by local and regional authorities, the CoR is closely involved in this effort to improve transparency and simplify lawmaking.\u201d 12 12 12 12 12 12 Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso President of the European Commission kg106418_inside_B.indd 10 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "13 The Polish CoR members at work 06 At the crossroads of Europe In the second half of 2011, Poland assumes the leadership of the European Union for the fi rst time since joining the EU in 2004. There is a lot at stake. With Europe still struggling to restore growth levels in the wake of the global economic crisis, much depends on the success of the new Europe 2020 strategy and whether it can deliver its goals of boosting employment and education, and reducing poverty. \u201cInvolving local authorities in implementing the strategy is the key issue\u201d, says Marek Wo\u017aniak . The delegation will be supporting the Polish government\u2019s initiatives throughout its six-month presidency, aiming to give them a regional and local dimension. \u201cTherefore, our activities will focus on issues such as the Europe 2020 strategy and involving local authorities in the process of their implementation; a strong position for cohesion policy and the shape of the EU\u2019s budget after 2013. It is important for us that cohesion policy embraces all EU regions. It should be equipped with fi nancial resources large enough to enable its effi cient implementation and to contribute to the further economic growth of regions.\u201d \u201cImplementing the Europe 2020 strategy is also closely linked to transport development, and transport infrastructure is an area where Poland still has a lot to do,\u201d believes Mr Wo\u017aniak. \u201cNo region has received suffi ciently high support for investments in this area. Wielkopolska, thanks to the cohesion policy, has an historic opportunity today to make considerable progress in this fi eld. From our region\u2019s point of view, it is important to take advantage of our location at the crossroads of transportation routes \u2013 not only domestic, but also European ones. Wielkopolska has one of the highest logistics and trade potentials in the country, and good transportation is a fundamental factor in competitiveness. Without it, participation in global economic trade and in taking up innovations is not possible. But unfortunately, not all Wielkopolska connections with surrounding regions are satisfactory.\u201d There is also room for progress in the social fi eld. While unemployment is lower in Wielkopolska than other regions, it is still a serious issue. \u201cEU cohesion policy funding is a perfect instrument for solving the problem,\u201d argues Mr Wo\u017aniak. \u201cThe development of entrepreneurship and innovation in the region, raising the knowledge and qualifi cations of local inhabitants, and partnerships focusing on the development of rural areas \u2013 these are the main goals of the \u2018Human Capital\u2019 Operational Programme. Since 2007, more than PLN 1 billion ( \u20ac 0.24 billion) have been spent, and the results are clearly visible.\u201d Mr Wo\u017aniak plays an active role in promoting local social entrepreneurship, as political coordinator of the Europe 2020 fl agship initiative \u2018European Platform against Poverty\u2019 within the CoR European People\u2019s Party group, of which he is also Vice-President. \u201cI am going to promote this form of fi ghting poverty in Europe as the best way of mobilising excluded people,\u201d explains Mr Wo\u017aniak. \u201cWhen analysing the content of the Europe 2020 strategy, we became more and more convinced that our region has been achieving its aims for a long time, and that the effects are now becoming visible. We have a unique human capital, and we promote smart development \u2013 particularly in the area of education and innovation. We are creating a suitable environment for effective business activity and we are investing in the natural environment. We know that we still have a long way to go to catch up with the best, but the pace is also fast.\u201d Marek Wo\u017aniak President of the Polish delegation at the Committee of the Regions President of the Wielkopolska Region kg106418_inside_B.indd 11 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "14 Good neighbours \u201cIt is important not only for Poland, but also for the whole EU, to develop good relations with our eastern neighbours: Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The stabilisation of these countries means more security for EU Member States,\u201d asserts Jacek Protas , marshall (president) of a region in the north-east of Poland. That is why the EU should invest all its efforts and resources in stimulating the democratic processes in these countries and developing their market economies. \u201cThus, one of the priorities of the Polish Presidency is to increase the signifi cance of the Eastern Partnership,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn Warmia and Mazury, there are quite a number of ethnic minorities, who arrived after the war. They are mainly Ukrainians, but also Lithuanians and Belarusians. We have various co- operation programmes with our eastern partners, especially in Ukraine. We try to provide a link between the EU and the east. My region is the only part of Poland with a 200-km border with Russia, so we want to offer an example of good relations with Russia and the other countries of the former USSR,\u201d emphasises Mr Protas. He points out that while things are moving ahead, the pace of change is different in each of the countries. Belarus, for example, is a country where democracy is slow to arrive, whereas Georgia is making greater headway. \u201cI am very impressed with the progress towards democracy, governance and a market economy in Georgia,\u201d says Mr Protas. In his opinion on co-operation between European and Georgian local governments, he called for, among other things, greater exchange of experience and people-to-people contact. \u201cSuch initiatives are very important for Europe,\u201d he adds. Until recently, Mr Protas was also president of Euroregion Baltic, which has developed fruitful co-operation over the last fi ve years with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. \u201cI think that every initiative to foster co-operation between regions in different EU countries is a good initiative,\u201d he concludes. Jacek Protas is rapporteur of a CoR opinion on local and regional government in Georgia and its co-operation with the EU. Engaged in the European process Waste management is another crucial aspect of environmental protection. \u201cWaste is a challenge for all Member States, but Poland is still behind in this fi eld,\u201d states Jerzy Zaj\u0105ka\u0142a who authored a CoR opinion on managing waste. \u201cThis gives me the opportunity to present the Polish point of view,\u201d he observes. \u201cThis opinion was adopted unanimously. We focused on the environmental perspective as a priority. Ultimately, it is local and regional authorities that are responsible for implementing EU waste management policy, and consequently they should play a key role in developing new regulations and solutions for the waste sector.\u201d With reducing poverty being one of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, Mr Zaj\u0105ka\u0142a is concerned that unemployment in this region is running at 17%, compared with a national average of 13.1%. \u201cIt is a huge challenge to create new and permanent jobs,\u201d he points out. \u201cThere are many families in diffi cult situations because they don\u2019t have work. In my locality I see it more and more often. At county level, with a population of 90 000 people, last year we spent PLN 14 million ( \u20ac 3.5 million) on training for job-seekers and raising qualifi cations among the unemployed.\u201d At regional level, EU funds support the development of human capital through adult education and lifelong learning programmes. \u201cIn my own community, the initiatives for training and encouraging inhabitants\u2019 activity have reduced unemployment to around 6%,\u201d he points out. Returning migrants add to the strain on local jobs. \u201cThis is a problem,\u201d admits Mr Zaj\u0105ka\u0142a. \u201cPeople left my region to work abroad, and because of the crisis they are now coming Jacek Protas President of the Warminsko-Mazurskie Region Jerzy Zaj\u0105ka\u0142a Mayor of Lubianka gmina, Kujawsko-Pomorskie Region President of the European Alliance political group in the CoR kg106418_inside_B.indd 12 10/06/11 10:01 ",

Some of them have no reserve fi nancial resources, but we can see that they have changed \u2013 they are not passive any more, they are actively looking for a job. This experience is an added value, although the best thing would be not to have to move in the fi rst place.\u201d \u201cIt is very important that local and regional authorities and their representatives are actively involved in European policy,\u201d he concludes. \u201cWe can articulate our needs and translate them into EU laws. It is the activity of the members of the EU\u2019s Committee of the Regions which triggers the participation of the community in the creation of European legislation. Sometimes people in my community ask why I do not provide more fi nancial resources directly for particular development projects, but they understand what I do in Brussels and they respect it.\u201d Jerzy Zaj\u0105ka\u0142a is rapporteur of a CoR opinion on the use of hazardous substances in, and managing waste from, electrical and electronic equipment. Reinforcing rural solidarity \u201cAt a time of crisis, it is more diffi cult to discuss the budget for a different Europe that embodies solidarity than it was in the past when there were abundant subsidies for Portugal, Spain and Greece, and then for Poland, Hungary and the Baltic countries,\u201d points out Leszek \u015awi\u0119talski . \u201cThe new budget should provide funds for the completion of tasks arising from the Lisbon Treaty, the Europe 2020 strategy and, above all, for implementing cohesion policy. Our obligation in these times of \u2018solidarity crisis\u2019 is to be an advocate for Europe and a budget based on solidarity.\u201d \u201cWorking on a special committee for the EU budget, I have repeatedly emphasised that Europe does not consist of regions and cities alone, but also of rural areas inhabited by approximately 40% of the population. Therefore, one should resist trends promoting the so-called urban and metropolitan focus of cohesion policy. They may result in strengthening consent for the development of cities at the expense of maintaining ethnographical parks in rural areas,\u201d warns Mr \u015awi\u0119talski. \u201cThe fi nancial support offered within the framework of the second pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP) will not help us to change the image of many rural communities and oppose the depopulation and deterioration of rural areas. Other support instruments are needed. I have raised these concerns during the work of the committee. In order to preserve cohesion at European, regional and local levels as the basis for a new European budget, it should be perceived as promoting a sustainable development policy and as the main tool of support for a Europe that is competitive, innovative and sensitive to environmental protection at all levels: regional, urban and rural.\u201d Leszek \u015awi\u0119talski is a member of the CoR\u2019s Commission for Financial and Administrative Affairs (CAFA).

        "16 Empowering the regions \u201cRegions intrinsically know the needs of their inhabitants better and have a range of individual ideas about how to meet them,\u201d argues Marek Olszewski . \u201cThose ideas could be implemented if powers and budgetary instruments were delegated to the regions more courageously. EU Structural Funds make up a signifi cant part of state and municipal authority budgets. They are a major incentive for improving labour market conditions and the situation of enterprises. The role of the Structural Funds in modernising Polish companies, and thus increasing their competitiveness in the single market and beyond, is of great importance,\u201d adds Mr Olszewski. He also believes that the areas where regions ought to have \u201ca much stronger, decisive voice\u201d include support for social infrastructure and civil society, primary, secondary and pre-school education, and the development of rural areas, excluding agriculture. Developing social infrastructure is a priority of cohesion policy. \u201cThe purpose is to improve the quality of life, thanks to the implementation of, among other things, the synergy effect,\u201d explains Mr Olszewski. \u201cInvestments in education, sports and leisure-related infrastructure will certainly result not only in better living conditions but will also defi nitely reduce social risks, for instance social dysfunctions, and increase the level of social involvement, as well as strengthen the development of a civil society.\u201d As rapporteur of a 2007 opinion, Marek Olszewski stresses the importance of education in promoting sustainable development. \u201cEnhancing opportunities for including environmental and sustainable development issues in national education systems in the Member States is particularly important, as well as in an integrated lifelong learning programme,\u201d he insists. Marek Olszewski is rapporteur of a CoR opinion on the role of education in sustainable development.

We have a lot of ground to make up in this fi eld compared to some other countries.\u201d \u201cHealthcare is the competence of individual Member States, but health issues should be approached more comprehensively,\u201d he says. \u201cHealth is a broad issue, therefore we should talk in this context about an unpolluted environment, genetically unmodifi ed food, sport for children and young people, and healthy lifestyles, as often as we talk about investment in hospitals and clinics.\u201d Access to good healthcare is crucial, he argues. The improvement of healthcare conditions in Poland to meet the standards implemented in the \u2018old\u2019 EU countries will allow Poles to feel more like citizens of Europe. This should include not only funding infrastructure, but also awareness campaigns and the exchange of knowledge and good practice. \u201cAt the moment, only a tiny part of cohesion funding goes to healthcare. This should defi nitely change. We have a lot to do.\u201d The condition of the environment that citizens live in is an important contributor to good health, and thus its protection is important, emphasises Mr Banaszak. \u201cPoland obviously uses EU funds, but we also have our own budgets allotted to this purpose. In my region, I am proud to say that we are very advanced, and compare favourably with other EU countries.\u201d For example, over 15.5% of energy consumed already comes from renewables, and of this, four-fi fths is hydroelectric. \u201cWe spend more than PLN 100 million ( \u20ac 25 million) a year on environmental protection, PLN 20 million ( \u20ac 5 million) of that amount on air quality.\u201d Mr Banaszak was also rapporteur of a CoR opinion on the EU\u2019s forest policy. Living forests absorb CO2 for free, without the need for high expenditure. \u201cWe need to maximise the benefi ts of what we already have,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis may be ensured by, among other things, better coordination of the work of the European Commission departments which handle issues related to European forests\u201d.

        "20 Administrative Division of Poland 08 During the process of political and economic transition, which began in 1989, Poland started to develop a rational and effective system of state administrative division, enabling the decentralization of power and subsidiary rules. Despite different viewpoints on the shape of the country\u2019s future administrative division, the Polish Government enacted a package of legislative acts between 1990 1998, which formed the basis for a new legal and institutional framework. Administrative reform should therefore be seen as the result of a political compromise. The new administrative division set out in the Act divided the country into 16 wojew\u00f3dztwo (regions or voivodeships), 380 1 powiat (administrative districts) and 2489 2 gmina (municipalities or communes). In many cases, Polish cities have both gmina and powiat status. Poland\u2019s administrative reform aimed to ensure the strict division of power and competences between the three levels of government and to strengthen the local and regional levels. Local and regional authorities are not controlled by central government. The aim of decentralization was to provide more power to the lowest level, which is closer to the needs of the citizen. That is why the gmina, the smallest unit of territorial division in Poland, plays a crucial role. The main role of each gmina and powiat is to provide public services to the community. Authority in the voivodeships is shared between two separate bodies. The fi rst is the Voivode , appointed by the central government in Warsaw, who occupies the post of regional governor . The Voivode acts therefore as the governmental representative in the given region and is responsible for public safety, standards and conformity of laws. Each voivodeship has its own elected regional assembly, the Sejmik . It is responsible for electing the executive board headed by Marsza\u0142ek (Marshall). The scope of competences of the Marshall\u2019s Offi ce include: programming (formulating the voivodeship\u2019s development strategies), implementing the voivodeship\u2019s development policy and controlling self- governmental executive bodies. 1 There currently are 378 powiat. 2 There currently are 2478 gmina. kg106418_inside_B.indd 18 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "21 One of the key Community policies contributing to the development of all EU regions is cohesion policy. It is worth bearing this in mind when considering the policy\u2019s future. Poland\u2019s success in using EU funding and its major economic impact not just in Poland but also in other EU countries is a perfect illustration of the policy\u2019s role in the development of the EU as a whole. This highly effective tool should be continued after 2013, especially given that it ties in closely with the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. As the largest benefi ciary of cohesion policy, Poland has an important role to play in demonstrating the impact of the policy and actively debating its future. One in every fi ve euros earmarked in the current EU budget for cohesion policy will be spent in Poland; in view of this, developments in our country will be closely followed by the entire EU. To a large extent, the future of cohesion policy depends on how we use the funds which we have been allocated for the 2007-2013 period. For the EU Member States, our country is a yardstick for the success of cohesion policy. Overall, cohesion policy has had a positive effect in Poland. We are an example of a country which, thanks to this policy, is developing more quickly and in a more stable way. Our achievements show that cohesion policy stimulates modernisation, development and long-term structural changes. The policy necessitates a comprehensive approach to development and brings together various sectors and levels of government in undertaking joint projects. An investment in cohesion policy is also an investment in economic, social and territorial growth, which also supports smart and environmental growth. Poland is living proof that cohesion policy stabilises economic growth and employment in times of economic downturn. During the Polish presidency of the EU Council we would therefore like to focus on objectively and actively raising public awareness of the policy\u2019s impact and benefi ts in all EU Member States.

Among other things, this strategy includes the construction of GEOCENTRUM, an educational and research centre, as part of the Wroclaw Technology Institute. This project will be fi nanced from the Lower Silesia Regional Operational Programme for 2007-2013. Implementing this project will meet the growing needs of entrepreneurs for graduates with a broad education to work in the raw materials, construction, civil engineering and environmental engineering sectors. I believe that the research centre will help to make the region more attractive for investors while emphasising the prestige of higher education in Lower Silesia\u201d. GEOCENTRUM will incorporate four departments of the Technical Institute: Geo- engineering, Mining, Land and Water Construction, as well as Mechanical-Energy and Environmental Engineering. The project will meet growing labour market needs for specialists with an interdisciplinary education while ensuring closer integration between scientifi c and research circles in Wroclaw. Measures will also be stepped up to promote innovation and support technologies of importance to the Lower Silesian regional economy in sectors linked to Earth sciences in the wider sense (raw materials, construction, civil engineering, environmental engineering). The building housing the GEOCENTRUM will be an integrated 21st century educational centre which meets modern standards. Marek Tram\u015b , Councillor of Polkowice powiat and Committee of the Regions member, emphasises that Lower Silesia is one of the richest Polish regions in terms of raw materials. \u201cThis is also a region of young and educated people. Our economy is a modern and dynamically developing one. The construction of the GEOCENTRUM centre will enable the launch of completely new education and research activities while producing high-class specialists to ensure the intelligent use of our natural resources and wealth. I feel that the project is exactly in line with the current needs of our labour market\u201d. kg106418_inside_B.indd 20 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "23 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union The project to redevelop Mill Island in Bydgoszcz is a project lasting many years and involving a number of stages. The overarching objective of the project is the wholesale regeneration of Mill Island \u2013 a unique spatial system in Bydgoszcz under direct conservation protection. The redevelopment takes account of social, economic as well as environmental aspects. The project was divided into four stages comprising individual projects fi nanced in part through European funds: development of entrepreneurship, the restoration of cultural heritage sites, the construction of leisure facilities and the regeneration of sports grounds including the construction of a yacht marina. Piotr Ca\u0142becki , Marshall of the Kujawsko \u2013 Pomorskie Region: \u201cOnce a deserted island, now an enchanting vibrant area in the heart of Bydgoszcz \u2013 Mill Island.\u201d Thanks to funds from the Kujawsko \u2013 Pomorskie Regional Operational Programme, the island is regaining its former splendour. The unique historical and cultural value of this place has survived - a symbol of Bydgoszcz, where eighteenth-century granaries form a picturesque part of the city landscape. Today, Mill Island not only marks the start of a walk over the \u201clovers\u2019 footbridge\u201d to the charming \u201cVenice of Bydgoszcz\u201d and the new opera house. It is also a place where business ideas are generated at the Centre for Jobs Initiative and Enterprise Development, where tradition and history enthusiasts meet in the gothic Bia\u0142y Spichrz \u201cwhite granary\u201d of the district museum, and where locals and visitors can seek out artistic experiences at the amphitheatre. A visit after nightfall is also a must, when you can see the illuminated apartment building refl ected in the Zbo\u017cowy and Mi\u0119dzywodzie canal. Mill Island is a place with a soul in the heart of the city. You have to see it with your own eyes. It is worth pointing out that the project involves not only the wholesale regeneration of Mill Island and the restoration of part of its historic infrastructure. The foundations have also been laid for a new social and economic role for the island, with the establishment of a Centre for Jobs Initiative and Enterprise Development in a renovated historic building. The centre is an organisation which serves investors and residents looking for new forms of employment. Its services include professional consultancy and the organisation of workshops, seminars and lectures, which are attended by around 2000 people every year. Marzena Kempi\u0144ska , a councillor from \u015awiecie and member of the Committee of the Regions sums up as follows: \u201cthe regeneration of Mill Island has shown how in a short period of time a large area of a city can be renewed. Mill Island has been completely regenerated. Its unique historical character has been maintained but it has been adapted to meet modern requirements and needs: it has been given a new urban role. The run-down former industrial site has been transformed into an area of culture, leisure, tourism and sport.

EU funding has meant that this forgotten pearl can shine once more. We are now waiting for tourists who will appreciate the value of this pearl; tourists who will be drawn here for sentimental reasons or by their desire to visit a place of worship \u2013 and for them to throng to this city.\u201d This project will help create new jobs in the tourism sector and establish new companies. The project can showcase \u2013 in terms of both investment and promotion \u2013 the main attractions of Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski.

Implementing the project will enable comprehensive conservation and restoration of the monuments while turning them to new tourist and cultural uses. Unique on a European scale, the Chapel of the Holy Trinity is a great attraction for connoisseurs and lovers of historical monuments visiting Lublin Castle. Thanks to this investment, the oldest and most valuable monuments of Lublin will receive the proper technical maintenance appropriate to their importance, in terms both of high-quality use and aesthetics. One of the positive effects of the project will also be the adaptation of the buildings and their surroundings for tourism purposes, taking into account the needs of disabled people\u201d Ewa Panasiuk , member of the Lublin Regional Assembly and member of the Committee of the Regions comments: \u201cThanks to this investment Lublin will brilliantly display its wealth of attractions representing the historical essence of three cultures existing side by side - Jewish, Orthodox and Catholic.

        "26 The impact of this project is not limited to the redevelopment of an institution, the purchase of new medical equipment, modernising health care infrastructure, or increasing the amount of specialist medical treatments and persons benefi ting from them. The new centre will also facilitate access to neurosurgical, neurotraumatological and neurooncological treatment, with patients waiting less time for signifi cantly improved services. The project is also intended to help retain highly qualifi ed doctors and nurses in the local area. According to El\u017cbieta Polak , Marshall of the Lubuskie Region: \u201cEU funding has brought numerous successful projects to our region. One such project which is of great importance for the region is the Lubuskie neurosurgery and neurotraumatology centre, established by the regional hospital in Zielona G\u00f3ra. The centre will be housed on two fl oors of the Zielona G\u00f3ra Hospital. It includes a large ward for patients requiring intensive care, with special beds which can be adjusted remotely. The heart of the centre is an operating theatre. Equipment includes an O-shaped tomography scanner, enabling computer tomography of patients during operations. This scanner generates a highly accurate image in just 12 seconds. This equipment enables operations to treat all skull and brain injuries, as well as spinal injuries and oncological disorders. Neurosurgery facilities in Zielona G\u00f3ra are just one of many examples of improvements to the quality of life in our region. The centre will enable more convenient treatment, more accurate diagnoses and faster recovery. The hospital had to wait 10 years before establishing a neurosurgery and neurotraumatology centre in Zielona G\u00f3ra. The necessary construction work was carried out in small steps. It was not until funding became available from the Lubuskie Regional Programme that the project could be completed. Specialists from all over Poland agree that this is the most modern centre in the country\u201d. Dr Andrzej Kunt , mayor of Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105 and a member of the Committee of the Regions comments: \u201cin my opinion, this centre is one of the main achievements of the Lubuskie Regional Operational Programme; it was a very well selected project. It is a fact that without EU co-fi nancing this highly anticipated and necessary project would never have been completed\u201d.

        "27 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union Marek Sowa , Marshall of the Lesser Poland Region, speaking about the project: \u201cFor years Krakow had been looking for a use for a disused airfi eld, one of the oldest in Europe, established in 1912, the former Rakowice-Czy\u017cyny airport, located close to the city centre. An EU grant under the Lesser Poland Regional Operational Programme has made it possible to build a modern Museum of Polish Aviation on the site. The main building of the Museum of Polish Aviation, which covers an area of 3 300 m 2 and was designed by architects Pysall Ruge, is an innovative building which draws inspiration from the most modern museums and culture parks of its kind in the world. From the air the building resembles a propeller. This spacious building features a cinema where fi lms relating to aviation are shown, a multifunctional room with a capacity of 150 persons, numerous computer workstations, a library, a reading room and a caf\u00e9. The Museum sets out to be accessible to all visitors, including those with disabilities, and to communicate the diversity of aviation in a modern way. The grounds of the museum, occupying more than six hectares, have been landscaped to feature green areas, small architectural features and walkways. With its new building the Museum is in a position to develop and become an attractive feature of the cultural heritage of Lesser Poland. With the creation of the Aviation Culture Park the Commission and the region are not only boosting the region\u2019s cultural potential but also promoting culture as a way of stimulating economic and social development. Poland\u2019s cultural heritage with its universal dimension is being disseminated and promoted, at the same time contributing to a better understanding of culture in society and encouraging the cultural integration of the peoples of Europe\u201d. According to Ludwik W\u0119grzyn , Councillor for Bochnia and member of the Committee of the Regions, the project is unusually interesting and combines academic research with the promotion of the leisure industry in its broadest sense: \u201cThis museum will make it possible to compare historical technological achievements with dynamic modern developments in aviation technology. It will challenge the popular view that museums are boring\u201d.

        "28 Poland\u2019s most famous folk song and dance ensemble, \u201cMazowsze\u201d, which has existed for more than 60 years, can fi nally boast its own home - a place with a most unusual atmosphere. A spectacular multifunctional cultural centre has been built in the song and dance ensemble\u2019s 12-hectare palace and park historic complex in Karolin - the Matecznik Mazowsze European Centre for the Promotion of Regional and National Culture. The building measures 6 690 m2 and features a 225 m2 stage and an auditorium for 580 visitors, with facilities for people with disabilities. It is a modern building, built to the highest standards and combining functionality with comfort, whose architecture blends in terms of scale and detail with the existing Karolin Palace. The project to build a world cultural centre in a rural area is a fi rst for Poland. Adam Struzik Marshall of the Mazovian Region and member of the Committee of the Regions, considers that EU funding has provided essential support for the development of the region: \u201cEuropean Union funds, which we also use in the cultural sector, make it possible for us to make numerous investments, for example in the extension and modernisation of tourist infrastructure, popularising tourist products and organising events to promote our regional heritage. Funding obtained by local government organisations, community centres, museums and NGOs help to increase attractiveness for tourism and make an important contribution to the realisation of the region\u2019s development strategy. The Matecznik Mazowsze is considered to be the most modern cultural centre in the country. This investment will undoubtedly bring substantial benefi ts. It is already clear that this place has become an attraction which indirectly promotes the economic development of the Mazovian Region. It is a multifunctional centre, a place of cultural dialogue and also a venue for major events of regional, national and international signifi cance. The centre will make it possible to broaden the activities of the Mazowsze ensemble and will do much to improve the accessibility of cultural infrastructure in the region as well as help tourist development. The Matecznik will host courses and seminars on Polish folklore and the traditions of the Mazovian Region as well as on the culture of other countries; training for culture workers, choreographers, dance instructors; workshops in folk handicrafts, singing and regional gastronomy, as well as concerts by other ensembles and artists; national and international art festivals. The Centre will also be involved in documentation and popularisation, the preparation of television programmes and producing publications on regional ensembles, and folklore and ethnographic centres. One signifi cant result of the investment will be the creation of many new jobs\u201d.

        "29 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union For many years, the municipal public library in Opole has provided residents of the city and the region with access to a wide range of books on a variety of subjects. It is the biggest public library in terms of the size of its book collection, number of readers and the number of book loans in the Opole Region. Apart from lending books, the library carries out a series of activities to promote reading; it organises author meetings, workshops, literary festivals, lectures and competitions. Until now, the library in Opole has not had the facilities to enable it to fully carry out its mission fully. The new premises make use of the fa\u00e7ade of a damaged tenement building, which has been restored and attached to a modern glass construction. By restoring the original elevation of the historic building, the construction fi ts in very well with the landscape of the old town. J\u00f3zef Sebesta , Marshall of the Opole Region and member of the Committee of the Regions, \u201cthe greatest asset of any region are its residents. Our goal is to undertake and support measures to provide the residents of Opole with decent living conditions and to give them opportunities to fl ourish. Fulfi lling the cultural needs of society requires a guarantee that public institutions can offer an appropriate standard of services. The creation of a new building for the municipal public library in Opole is an investment in high quality public spaces. The implementation of this project enables us to remove barriers to cultural education, promote reading and helps develop active citizenship in this area. Thanks to the unique design, the new, spacious library building links tradition with modernity. It is currently one of the most modern buildings of its kind in the country. The fusion of modernity and tradition is refl ected not only in the library\u2019s appearance \u2013 inside local residents can not only borrow books or make use of the reading room, they can also access extensive multimedia resources, listen to music, rent fi lms and surf on the internet. Consideration has also been given to the youngest readers - a \u2018fairy tale room\u2019 has been created where children can read or listen to their favourite stories. All resources have been adapted to meet the needs of people with disabilities. With this project, Opole has acquired a new cultural centre. The comprehensive services it provides and its broad remit mean that the library goes well beyond the standard model. I believe that this type of investment in a new quality of life in the regions is a key element in their development.\u201d Opole Region \u201c21 st century library\u201d Renovation and extension of the municipal public library in Opole \u201cThe spirit of literature is still alive\u201d, by Grzegorz G\u0119bala Benefi ciary: City of Opole Programme: Opole Regional operational programme for 2007-2013 Priority axis 5: Social infrastructure and higher education Measure 5.3: Cultural development and protection of cultural heritage Implementation period: VII 2008\u2013II 2011 Total project cost: PLN 14 343 996,04 Eligible costs: PLN 12 958 121,99 Financing: Resources from the European Regional Development Fund: PLN 6 479 060.99 (49.99%) Own contribution: PLN 6 479 061.00 (50.01%) kg106418_inside_B.indd 14 10/06/11 10:01 ",
        "30 Promoting trade and business; improving people\u2019s quality of life and work; making the area more attractive for tourists and, above all, raising the region\u2019s competitiveness \u2013 such are the benefi ts of a modern airport with all the facilities it needs. It is estimated that following the completion of the construction of the new passenger terminal, the number of passengers served by Rzesz\u00f3w airport will increase to 700 000 in 2013. It will be possible to check in 700 passengers every hour i.e. twice the current rate. The Marshall of the Podkarpackie Region, Miros\u0142aw Karapyta , had the following to say about the project: \u201cOnly a few years ago, it would have been hard to imagine that so many investments would be carried at the same time at Rzesz\u00f3w\u2013Jasionka airport. Thanks to the bold use of EU funding, the development of Rzesz\u00f3w airport has now really gathered momentum. Rzesz\u00f3w-Jasionka airport is located in the heart of the Podkarpackie Region, a mere 7.8 km from Rzesz\u00f3w city centre as the crow fl ies. Next door to the airport lies one of the most attractive investment sites in south-east Poland \u2013 the Aeropolis Podkarpacki Science and Technology Park. Both Rzesz\u00f3w Polytechnic and Rzesz\u00f3w University are in the process of setting up research laboratories on the site. The fact that the A4 motorway will pass close by the site is particularly important. The Podkarpackie Regional Operational Programme made it possible to secure EU funding for a total of nine projects, which together were worth over PLN 146 million; EU funding accounted for over PLN 80.5 million of this amount. The largest projects included the construction of a set of aircraft hangars together with a parking apron, the expansion of the airport\u2019s technical facilities and the refurbishment of the new passenger terminal under construction. Given the constant increase in passenger numbers and the need to ensure appropriate standards for them, the largest and most important investment is the construction of the passenger terminal, which was jointly funded by the Infrastructure and Environment Operational Programme. Thanks to EU funding, this modern airport has the chance of becoming a veritable \u2018bargaining chip\u2019 in our efforts to attract further international investment.\u201d CoR member, Lucjan Ku\u017aniar , highlights the benefi ts of the project: \u201cOne of the key issues for the development of the Podkarpackie Region is the creation of a modern communications infrastructure system for the region which will help Podkarpackie become more accessible and, as a result, even more attractive for investors, tourists and local residents alike. The expansion of the airport provides an opportunity to really strengthen its position and develop its network of air routes and, therefore, to open up the region to both western and eastern Europe and the world. The Podkarpackie Region, whose new advertising slogan is \u201copen space,\u201d is indeed proving that it is truly open to the world.\u201d Podkarpackie Region \u2013 A window on the world Rzesz\u00f3w airport \u2013 Construction of a new passenger terminal Benefi ciary: Port Lotniczy \u201cRzesz\u00f3w \u2013 Jasionka\u201d Sp. z o.o.

        "31 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union The project involved preparing infrastructure in the Bia\u0142ystok sub-zone of the Suwalki Special Economic Zone. Thanks to investment, the capital of the region offers potential investors favourable conditions for business development together with access to infrastructure and utilities. The preparation of investment sites is one of the conditions for the economic development of the city and the entire region. Investment should contribute to the development of innovative projects in the Podlasie Region \u2013 this is one of the requirements for those interested in projects in special economic zones. Investment creates new jobs and increases the pace of economic growth. A larger zone also benefi ts businesses operating in the vicinity. The project covered the construction of infrastructure for investment sites, including mains water and new municipal or district roads or redevelopment of existing ones. Marshall of the Podlasie Region Jaros\u0142aw Dworza\u0144ski underlines the strengths of the project: \u201cThe preparation of the Bia\u0142ystok sub-zone of the Suwalki Special Economic Zone in and around ulica Mickiewicza, ulica J. Kuronia, ulica My\u015bliwska, ulica Solnicka and ulica \u017burawia is extremely important for the development of the region \u2013 such activities are especially important in the case of regions such as Podlasie. Funding from the Regional Operational Programme has enabled the Bia\u0142ystok authorities to prepare an area of almost 30 ha, located close to the S19 national road. The proximity of investment plots is having a positive effect not only on the development of the city, but also on the entire voivodship. They are generating benefi ts not only for investors who decide to locate their factories here, but also local businesses, which can develop thanks to cooperation with a major partner. Residents of our region are also benefi tting, with greater job opportunities above all in the services and construction sectors.\u201d CoR member and mayor of Bia\u0142ystok Tadeusz Truskolaski speaks about the project: \u201cThe proper preparation of investment sites forms part of a wider growth strategy in Bia\u0142ystok. I am convinced that we will succeed in tapping the city\u2019s full potential, which will of course have an impact on the entire region. However, these activities must take account of the regional context. Bia\u0142ystok is the capital of a region with exceptional natural assets. The establishment of any kind of production facilities in this area would be counterproductive and probably do signifi cantly more harm than good. Therefore we are counting on the interest of investors wishing to locate compatible industries here, especially those that use innovative technologies. We can encourage such investors by offering them preferential conditions in the Suwalki Special Economic Zone.\u201d Podlasie Region \u2013 Supporting the investor Preparing investment sites in the Bia\u0142ystok sub-zone of the Suwalki Special Economic Zone: building infrastructure and modernising road surfaces Benefi ciary: City of Bia\u0142ystok Programme: Regional Operational Programme of the Podlasie region for 2007-2013 Priority axis: 1.

        "32 As a result of the implementation of the Physics for the Future project, physics graduates will for the fi rst time in the history of the University of Gdansk (or indeed any other university in the country) have the opportunity to work with modern measuring apparatus and data analysis methods within the walls of their own university, providing them with the knowledge and skills needed to operate the kinds of equipment likely to be used by potential employers (fi rms, other universities, research laboratories etc). Physics graduates of the University of Gdansk will be sought-after on the labour market as specialists in exact sciences, familiar with the most modern technologies, creative, and open to innovation. Several hundred new pieces of equipment - all of them meeting international standards, the most modern technological solutions in their class - have been purchased for the use of the laboratory. Some of the equipment acquired for the laboratory is unique, exceeding the technological level of equipment available to Polish research laboratories. These include: a Raman spectrometer (the fi rst in Poland, and only the third in the world), a spectrofl uorometer and an innovative, compact-build scanning electron microscope, the fi rst of its kind in the world. The Marshall of the Pomeranian Region, Mieczys\u0142aw Struk commenting on the project: \u201cFor educated young people, new technologies offer not only a chance to develop their potential but also the opportunity to compete on equal terms. Raising the quality of education is key to giving Pomerania and the whole country a more important role on the international stage. I think I can venture to say that the Physics for the Future project, carried out by the University of Gdansk, is the pride of the Pomeranian voivodeship and puts us at the head of the pack nationally. A new laboratory with high-class research equipment is an opportunity for young people to become sought-after specialists on the labour market for the exact sciences, familiar with the most modern technologies, creative and open to innovation. The support given by the Pomeranian Region to the Physics for the Future project is an investment in the young generation and offers the opportunity to improve the region\u2019s potential.

        "33 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union By regenerating a post-industrial site, this project will help create one of Poland\u2019s most modern museums and act as a specialist education centre in the area of archaeology, ethnography, theatre and the arts. This initiative, which will include the construction of an impressive exhibition area showcasing the history of Upper Silesia, among others, will signifi cantly broaden the region\u2019s cultural offer and make it more attractive for tourists. The Marshall of the Silesian Region, Adam Matusiewicz , describes the project as follows: \u201cThe Silesian Museum was formally set up in 1929 by an Act of the Silesian parliament. To date, it has amassed over 83 000 artefacts in its collection. These include works of art as well as numerous archaeological, ethnographic and historical items along with photographs and collections of amateur art. The Centre for Polish Scenography, a department set up here in 1991, remains unique among Polish museums. This is by no means the fi rst attempt to build a modern home for the Silesian Museum. Work fi rst began in 1936. The plans for the building were among the most modern at the time in that part of Europe. The completion of the building work coincided with the outbreak of World War II. Even before it was offi cially opened, the Nazis ordered the demolition of the new museum as part of their policy of destroying everything that was a symbol of Poland. In 1984, the Silesian Museum re-opened on a temporary site, in the centre of Katowice, where it remains to this day. However, there has always been a constant stream of suggestions for a new site for the museum. The idea of adapting the site of the former \u2018Katowice\u2019 coal mine as the new museum site, making use of its post-industrial buildings, was fi rst put forward in 1987. The new Silesian Museum will be the fi rst building in Katowice to form part of the so- called \u2018Cultural Axis\u2019, which \u2013 in addition to the Museum building \u2013 will also include the construction of an international convention centre (both projects are included on the list of key projects under the Silesian Regional Operational Programme) and the home of the Polish Radio National Symphony Orchestra in Katowice (project fi nanced by the Infrastructure and Environment Operational Programme). A number of underground and aboveground walkways will be built to help people get around the site. The only buildings visible above ground level will be the glass towers built to provide the underground exhibition areas with light. According to the plans, the exhibition areas, which are located on each fl oor of the main building, will be situated completely underground. Over 6 000 m2 of exhibition space will be used to display the museum\u2019s collections, which are currently stored in the museum\u2019s warehouses. Visitors to the new Silesian Museum will be able to enjoy six permanent exhibitions, including an exhibition on the history of Upper Silesia, along with a broad presentation of the collections of the Centre for Polish Scenography.\u201d Silesian Region \u2013 \u201cThe new face of a former mine\u201d Construction of a new home for the Muzeum \u015al\u0105ski (Silesian Museum) in Katowice Benefi ciary: Silesian Museum Programme: Silesian Regional Operational Programme for the years 2007-2013 Priority VI: Sustainable Urban Development Measure VI.1: Strengthening of Regional Growth Centres Implementation period: years 2008-2012 Total project cost: PLN 324 271 174.73 Financing: European Regional Development Fund: PLN 225 448 089.84 (85%) Own investment: PLN 98 823 084.90 (15%) kg106418_inside_B.indd 10 10/06/11 10:01 ",

Targi Kielce (www.targikielce.pl) was set up in 1992, with the fi rst fair to be held at the Kielce Exhibition Centre being the International Defence Industry Fair. Only a handful of fairs were held a year in Kielce during the 1990s. Despite these humble beginnings, several dozen will be organised in 2011! The \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Region, thanks to its geographical location, social-economic potential, outstanding natural beauty and signifi cant investment opportunities, has all the conditions needed to turn it into one of the country\u2019s most attractive regions. Targi Kielce plays a key role in harnessing this potential. The Kielce Fair development project, which is worth over PLN 200 million, was voted by internet users as the most popular project in the \u201cDevelopment of Eastern Poland\u201d Operational Programme during the \u201cPrzymierz si\u0119\u201d (Try it yourself) competition organised by Poland\u2019s Ministry for Regional Development. The EU project has involved the construction of a new reception area with an electronic registration system for exhibitors and visitors alike. Other projects have included the renovation of Hall F, destroyed by fi re, as well as the construction of Poland\u2019s most modern exhibition hall at a cost of PLN 35 million. The turn of the year 2010/2011 saw work begin on the construction of a Convention Centre at a cost of PLN 61 million, which represents the largest ever investment in the history of Targi Kielce. The centre will have multiple uses, thanks to its unique design.\u201d Implementing the project will help the economic development of Kielce and the \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Region by creating new jobs, developing education and innovation and promotional activity. \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Region \u2013 \u201cDevelopment Fairs\u201d Modernisation and expansion of the infrastructure for Targi Kielce for the creation of an international exhibition and convention centre Benefi ciary Targi Kielce sp. z o.o.

        "35 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union The 2007-2013 Warmia and Mazury Regional Operational Programme for region envisages a growing role for tourism in the region\u2019s economy, mainly by making tourism services more attractive. The quality of such services largely depends on the professionalism of staff in the sector. The project described here was launched in order to establish modern training facilities for the hotel and catering trades. It involves expanding and modernising four training centres in the region. These centres now house new training rooms with modern equipment to enable training in hotel and catering trades (in cafes, cake shops, delicatessens, chocolate making), as well as in offi ce technology and IT, customer service, and organoleptic evaluation. Courses in new subjects have also been developed. The new training facilities resulting from the implementation of the programme will meet European vocational training standards not least in terms of the type and number of training rooms; at the same time, highly specialised equipment will enable high quality teaching. Jacek Protas , Marshall of the region, commented as follows: \u201cTourism is one of the main economic sectors in the Warmia and Mazury Region. Among other things, our visitors can enjoy active recreation around the lakes, sightseeing and a rich regional cuisine. This is what inspired us to improve the competitiveness of regional tourism services on the national and European markets. The regional government decided to support hotel and catering vocational schools. Training centres in E\u0142k, Szczytno, Elbl\u0105g and Olsztyn have received EU co-fi nancing, thanks to which they have been able to improve their technical infrastructure and equip classrooms for hands-on vocational training. New curricula have been developed from scratch, and teaching staff have been given the appropriate training. The schools will be accredited as State vocational exam centres. Internships will be organised for students in Poland and in Europe. Graduates of these schools will get a solid grounding enabling them to meet high standards, thus enhancing services targeted at tourists and local residents.

        "36 The aim of the project, to be implemented from 2010 to 2013, is the purchase of 22 electric multiple unit trains (EMUs) for regional railway passenger services. These modern trains, designed for regional rail passenger services on electrifi ed lines, will be used on the following railway lines: Pozna\u0144-Kutno, Pozna\u0144-Zb\u0105szynek and Pozna\u0144-Inowroc\u0142aw. The colourful 75-metre-long railcars will accommodate 204 sitting passengers and will be equipped with air-conditioning , surveillance facilities, disabled toilets and low fl oors. Trains will be able to travel at a maximum speed of 160 km/h. The purchase of the new trains in conjunction with the launch by the regional government of its own Koleje Wielkopolskie (Wielkopolska Railways) transport company, together with increased investment in rail transport, will soon bring higher quality transport services to Wielkopolska. A safer, faster service offering options more closely in line with passengers\u2019 expectations will enable passengers from smaller towns to get to Pozna\u0144 faster and more conveniently. The new trains will be cheaper to operate than the locomotives currently in use, thus cutting the costs of the newly launched regional services. The Marshall of the Wielkopolska Region Marek Wo\u017aniak sums up the project as follows: \u201cThis project is the greatest investment in the history of the Wielkopolska Regional Authority. We took the decision to purchase modern rolling stock in 2006, with the idea of helping the people of Wielkopolska to travel quickly and safely on the relevant rail routes. The railcars ordered by us will meet future safety standards. The fi rst should arrive in Wielkopolska even before Euro 2012, and all of them will be here by the middle of 2014. The delivery of these trains will undoubtedly be a real step forward for railways in our region. Higher-quality regional rail passenger services should secure the future of the new \u2018Koleje Wielkopolskie\u2019 company. I do not rule out that the possibility of buying more new trains for Wielkopolska in a few years, but that will depend among other things on co-funding from the European Union\u201d.

        "37 The Committee of the Regions and the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union The Marshall of the West Pomeranian Region, Olgierd Geblewicz , talks about the project: The purpose of the project was to buy 10 diesel multiple units (DMUs) produced by the Bydgoszcz-based company PESA. Two more vehicles of the same type were purchased by the West Pomeranian Region using its own budget. All trains are completely modern, environmentally friendly and adapted to the needs of people with disabilities. The SA136 DMU is called \u201cthe smurf\u201d by passengers and railwaymen because of its white and blue appearance. DMUs offer great convenience for all people travelling between the major cities in the region. Their routes also extend beyond the region\u2019s borders to towns such as Pi\u0142a and Chojnice. Fast and safe transport connections provide major comfort when travelling. This is ensured by 157 soft comfortable seats adapted to long journeys and by air conditioning, providing pleasant cool air even during the most intense heat waves. Overseeing passenger safety is a monitoring system, encompassing both the interior and exterior of the vehicle. In addition, every vehicle is equipped with a complex on-board diagnostic system, which works in conjunction with on-board computers, systematically informing the engine driver about the vehicle\u2019s operation. This information is also transmitted with the help of the GSM network to the maintenance depot, where the vehicle is serviced. Environmental concerns have not been overlooked. By using the latest power units, which meet demanding European environmental standards, as well as hydrodynamic transfer, soft suspension and disc brakes, the vehicles produce signifi cantly less harmful substances and noise than other rolling stock in use. People with disabilities, parents with small children and tourists travelling with their two- wheeled vehicles will not have to fear long journeys, because the lower fl oor in the vehicles makes it easier to get on board. In addition, the vehicles include a number of features to accommodate such passengers. Other features include sockets for charging mobile phone batteries and powering laptop computers and an audio-visual information system using LCD panels and a GPS system. Thanks to this, passengers can see the train timetable, its position, the nearest stations and the speed at which it is travelling. LCD monitors can be used to show fi lms, including those to promote the region and local cultural events. The organisation and subsidy of regional passenger rail transport and the acquisition of a rail fl eet is one of the objectives of the regional government. The purchase of new DMUs not only increases the cohesion of regional transport, it also improves travelling conditions and helps shorten journey times. This is made possible through the use of a fl eet with better traction conditions than conventional diesel trains. In this way, rail can become an alternative to car transport in the region.
