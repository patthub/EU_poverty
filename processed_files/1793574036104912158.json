        "PREFACE There is a growing demand for comparable gender statistics at European Community level. This publication describes briefly the data available in Eurostat that can be subdivided by sex. One of Eurostat's major tasks is to establish and improve comparability at Community level between the statistical data of the Member States. Especially for social statistics, data collection methods, concepts and definitions often vary considerably between countries. Consequently, the data available from Eurostat may not always be of the standard expected by potential users. The harmonisation procedure for European statistics extends over several years and depends mainly on the will and capabilities of Member States. The quality of the data given at Community level is expected to improve from year to year. Eurostat is making every effort to ensure that this happens. The databases given here cover the following areas: population and migration, public health, employment and unemployment, living and working conditions and regional social statistics. The statistical data appearing in this publication use a 'sex' variable, or apply primarily to women, such as in the social protection field. The databases can be classified into two types: Tables and Individual data. Concerning individual data from surveys or other databases, only the main results are published, but there is considerable room for data exploration. In addition to the standard tables published, Eurostat can produce ad hoc tables on request. Each database is presented by a short introduction, followed by details of the data available in it and ends with bibliographical notes giving names of some relevant publications and telling if data are available in the Eurostat New Cronos database. Finally there is a contact person in Eurostat, Luxembourg. It must be stressed that the data indicator does not mean that all data exist for every country for every year. For this reason, those interested are asked to consult the publications listed in the bibliography and to contact the persons designated. We hope that this publication will promote the use of statistics to describe gender relevant issues. Also we hope that it brings out the need for harmonising social statistics which would provide a clearer picture of men and women in the European Union. Luxembourg, October 1999 ",

        "DEMOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION Eurostat's demographic statistics currently cover the Member States of the European Union, EFTA member countries and several Central European countries (36 European countries in total). These statistics cover, in principle, the period from 1960 to 1998. The annual population evaluations are based on either the most recent census or on the processed population registers. Data on marital status are yielded from each country's system for registering such information. There is not much divergence between the definitions of the related events except for foetal death or birthrank. Divorce data should be interpreted with caution owing to differences of a legal nature. CONTENTS OF THE DATABASE All tables on individuals except about divorces can be subdivided by sex. 1.

        "MIGRATION INTRODUCTION Data on the foreign population living in the EU Member States and on international migration are obtained from a wide diversity of sources including population registers, surveys, censuses, administrative records of government departments, etc. Migration statistics have to be interpreted with caution since the definitions used by the Member States in this field are particularly diverse (the United Nations recommendations are hardly adhered to). The need for harmonisation provides impetus for Eurostat to draw up a methodology to improve the quality of the data. One step towards such harmonisation was the revision of the UN recommendations on international migration statistics - Eurostat' played a very active role in the drafting ofthe new recommendations that were adopted in 1997. More detailed information will be added to the database, including the historical series on flows, the foreign workers data, monthly asylum data and related documentation and metadata.

        "PUBLIC HEALTH INTRODUCTION Eurostat's public health statistics cover a variety of different domains in the Member States and in some cases also in EFTA and East European countries. For certain variables (mortality, morbidity, health personnel) data are available from 1960/70 onwards. In a lot of cases the variables come from multipurpose surveys including health variables (ECHP, LFS, Eurobarometer, HFS). They also come from registers of specific diseases (AIDS, EuroTB), from Eurostat's own collection of data (mortality, health care) or from specific health surveys realised in recent years. The International Organisations active in the field of health statistics (in particular WHO, OECD) collect directly from MS certain variables that Eurostat use regularly from these original sources. An internal Eurostat database on public health statistics is being established containing all these data and gradually data are being stored in New Cronos (separate Health and Safety domain). In the year 2000 new data coming from national health surveys in 12 selected domains and data on health expenditure and consumption coming from the new system of health accounts will be available.

        "CENSUSES INTRODUCTION Statistics from population censuses have a ten-year frequency. They yield data on the structure of both the total and economically active population, on the composition of households and families, on the level of education and on housing conditions.

        "THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY HOUSEHOLD PANEL (ECHP) INTRODUCTION The ECHP: a 14-nation Community survey The European Community Household Panel (ECHP) is a survey that involves annual interviewing of a representative panel of households and individuals in each country, covering a wide range of topics: demographics and employment characteristics, income, health, education, housing.. The longitudinal structure ofthe ECHP makes it possible to follow up and interview the same households and people over several consecutive years. The survey is based on a harmonised questionnaire, the Community version of which was drawn up by Eurostat, and subsequently adapted by 'National Data Collection Units (NDUs)' depending on the institutional peculiarities of each country. The first wave if the ECHP was conducted in 1994 in the then 12 EU Member States. The sample totalled some 60.500 households (about 170.000 individuals) selected randomly. Austria (in 1995) and Finland (in 1996) have joined the project since then. From 1997, comparable information coming from registers and The Swedish Living Conditions Survey will be added to the data. The ECHP is an annual survey, whose duration is planned for nine years (for the 1994- 2002 period). CONTENTS OF THE DATABASE All data on individuals can be subdivided by sex. 1.

        "HOUSEHOLD BUDGET SURVEYS INTRODUCTION Household budget surveys (national, but harmonised at Community level) are carried out in all Member States, with different frequencies (annually in B, D, DK, E, I, L, NL, P, S and UK; every 7 years in IRL; every 3-5 years in the other Member States). The results of 2 waves, 1988 and 1994, are available. Data from the \"1999\" surveys have not yet been sent to Eurostat. The surveys provide information on household expenditure in particular, but also on the type of household, on the socio-economic status ofthe head of household, on accommodation, etc. Most countries have provided Eurostat with individual data from the 1988 and 1994 surveys (except for Denmark and Ireland in 1988) which enables several variables to be combined, thereby yielding more complex and detailed data. For some countries (like Germany, France, Norway, Greece, Italy, UK, Spain, Finland or Sweden) data from the household budget survey are sent in national format and then converted into Community format, for the others data are provided in Eurostat format, which comprises two parts: * record of each household member (demographic data on employment and personal income); * record on the whole household (expenditure, type and composition of household, demographic and socio-economic status of the head of household, household income by sources, accommodation and amenities, durable goods, pattern of consumption etc.).

        "SOCIAL PROTECTION INTRODUCTION Although the database on social protection does not yield data broken down by sex, data relating specifically to women (e.g. on maternity) may be analysed. The database is based on the methodology ofthe European System of integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS) and yields data on social protection expenditure and receipts for every Member State. Expenditure for social benefits ofthe family/children function represented 2.2% of GDP inEU-15inl996. Basic concepts and definitions Receipts Receipts comprise social contributions by employers, social contributions by protected persons, tax-related general government contributions and other receipts. Sector of origin Receipts are also broken down by the sector of origin according to the national accounts (i.e. corporations, general government, households, non-profit institutions and rest of the world). Social protection expenditure Social protection expenditure comprises social benefits, administration costs and other expenditure. Social benefits form the most sizeable part of social protection expenditure. They are made up of transfers, in cash or in kind, to households to cover social risk which entail financial costs or loss of income. Social benefits are broken down by function as follows: * sickness/health care, * disability, * old age, * survivors. * family/children, * unemployment, * housing, * social exclusion not elsewhere classified. The family/children function includes the following benefits: cash benefits income maintenance benefits in the event of childbirth birth grants parental leave benefits family or child allowances other cash benefits 24 ",

CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS The classification for the levels of education used is ISCED. In the data collection referring to the academic year 96/97 - data collection year 1998- ISCED97 was used for the first time. In the same data collection year a classification for the fields of training, which is an extension of the ISCED97 classification for the fields of education developed under a joint Eurostat - CEDEFOP project, has also been used for the first time. Scope : Programmes included in the data collection may have more than 300 hours of training. Programmes at ISCED 5A and ISCED 6 levels are excluded. VET specific definitions Place of training Mainly in educational/training institution which includes : \"in an educational/training institution \" : 90% or more of learning time in an educational/training institution and the rest of the time in a working environment \"in majority in an educational/training institution\" : 75 to 89% of learning time in an educational/training institution and the rest of the time in a working environment.

        "LABOUR FORCE SURVEY (LFS) INTRODUCTION The Community labour force survey is the main source of harmonised statistics on employment and unemployment in the European Union. It has been carried out since the 1960s and has undergone various developments in concepts in order to make data as comparable as possible between Member States. Since 1983, the survey has been organised in spring of each year. It is based on a sample of about 650 000 households, 1 700 000 individuals, in the EU. The NSIs of Member States were supposed to send the results to Eurostat nine months after the survey. In the new regulation this delay was reduced to twelve weeks after the end of reference period in the case of a continuous survey. The Community questionnaire uses the concepts and definitions drawn up by the International Labour Office, as well as common classifications. In 1992 the questionnaire was revised for a first time, with new variables being included (e.g. information about the second job, night work, working at home, the degree of urbanisation). In 1998 a second revision took place and a number of variables have been introduced in order to get a better picture of the composition of household, a better measure of underemployment, the main labour status, the income and the education and training module has been completely revised. The main labour status and the income are optional. . For technical and methodological reasons, Eurostat processes only the results of the population living in private households. This enables three main groups of the population of working age (at least 15 years of age) to be distinguished - persons in employment, the unemployed and the inactive. This survey provides reasonably detailed information on each of these categories. The most general data are published annually by Eurostat (\"LFS results for the year...\"). It must be stressed that the possibilities for processing the LFS results are very wide. Among other things, they enable employment to be linked to the family situation (when members ofthe family live in the same household). The presentation here of the LFS database will only give a brief insight into the data available. Those interested are asked to consult the publications listed at the end of the chapter. 38 ",

        "EARNINGS BACKGROUND Statistics on earnings compiled by Eurostat where a breakdown by sex exists are divided into three parts: * Harmonized average gross earnings of manual workers and non-manual workers in industry and services * Net earnings of manual workers in the manufacturing industry for a number of standard cases. * Statistics on the structure and distribution of earnings - 1995 I. Harmonized average gross earnings of manual workers in industry and non-manual workers in industry and services INTRODUCTION This statistics form part of the integrated systems of statistics of earnings gradually introduced in the 1960s by the Statistical Office of the European Communities in cooperation with the Member States. The Harmonized Statistics of Earnings provide annual data on the gross hourly earnings actually paid to manual workers in industry and the gross monthly earnings of non- manual workers in industry and services. In some countries data are also available on the gross monthly earnings of total manual and non-manual workers in industry and services.

Net earnings of manual workers in the manufacturing industry for a number of standard cases. INTRODUCTION In the absence of a survey on net earnings, Eurostat has tried, in cooperation with the appropriate statistical services in the Member States, to quantify by means of estimates that are as accurate as possible the levels of and trends in the net earnings of manual workers and - starting in 1992 - of total employees in manufacturing industry (NACE Rev. 1 D). Basic concepts and definitions Net earnings Net earnings are calculated from gross earnings, after deduction of taxes and social security contributions payable by employees and, where appropriate, after addition of family allowances. The reference period is the month of October. The data have been adjusted to take into account of bonuses and gratuities not paid regularly with each pay pocket. Gross earnings - taxes - social security contributions + family allowances = Net earnings The calculations relate to the average gross monthly earnings of manual workers and starting in 1992 - ofthe total of employees in the manufacturing industries (NACE D: local units with 10 or more employees). In order to show the effects of tax scales on income; the calculation is made for a number of standard cases, in which male and female net earnings are included. 49 ",

This involved the number of hours (weekly/monthly) which the employee was obliged to work under the terms of a contract, regulation or rules in force in the local unit. Paid hours Paid hours covered normal and overtime hours, remunerated during the reference period. Hours not worked during the reference period but nevertheless paid were counted as \"paid hours\" (annual leave, sick leave, official holidays and other hours paid such as for medical examinations).

        "ACCIDENTS AT WORK INTRODUCTION The ESAW project The ESAW (European Statistics on Accidents at Work) project was launched in 1990, aiming at harmonised data on accidents at work for all accidents entailing more than three days' absence from work. A \"Methodology for the Harmonisation of European Occupational Accident Statistics\" was published in 1992 by Eurostat and DG V/F 10 . The ESAW project has been an integral part of the framework programme for priority actions in the field of statistical information 1993 to 1997 . The aim ofthe ESAW project is \"to collect Union-wide comparable data on accidents at work and establish a database. \" Comparable data on work accidents are a prerequisite for monitoring trends in health and safety at work in the Union and for promoting accidents prevention both at Community level and in the individual Member States. The aims are to provide data on high-risk groups and sectors and at a later stage indicators on both the causes and the social cost of accidents at work. Consistent series of data should be established to provide the means for the monitoring of health and safety at work and the efficiency of regulation in this field. It is also an aim of the ESAW project to develop a methodology, which is as far as possible comparable with other international statistics, and to participate in the co ordination of such work. The ESAW methodology is in accordance with the ILO Resolution of 1998 concerning \"Statistics of Occupational Injuries: resulting from Occupational Accidents\" 12 . Basic concepts and definitions - population/objects ESAW Phase 2 data are collected for the reference period 1996 onwards. The reference period is defined as the year of notification of the accident. All cases of accidents at work leading to an absence of more than three calendar days 13 are included in the ESAW data. In practice it means that an accident at work is included in ESAW if the person is unfit for work for more than 3 days even if these days include Saturdays, Sundays or other days where the person is not usually working. An accident at work is defined as \"a discrete occurrence in the course of work, which leads to physical or mental harm\". This includes cases of acute poisoning and wilful acts of other persons but excludes deliberate self-inflicted injuries and accidents on the ( ) Office for Official Publications of the European Communities.

However, it has been decided for ESAW methodology to follow the most common practice in the Member States, which is to use calendar days in calculating the number of days with an absence from work. 54 ",
        "way to and from work (commuting accidents). The phrase \"in the course of work\" means whilst engaged in an occupational activity or during the time spent at work. This includes cases of road traffic accidents in the course \u00f3f work. k fatal accident is defined as an accident, which leads to the death of a victim within one year ofthe accident. The population of persons covered by the ESAW data, established from the LFS, was in 1994 almost 132 million persons in employment, which represented almost 90% ofthe total European workforce. Indicators The ESAW methodology considers 2 main types of indicators on accidents at work: the numbers of accidents and the incidence rates. Obviously, the numbers of accidents have to be related to the reference population of persons in employment (persons exposed to the risk of accident at work) in order to establish the incidence rates (frequency). The incidence rate is defined as the number of accidents at work per 100 000 persons in employment. It can be calculated for Europe, a Member State, or any sub-population breakdown according to one or more of the variables above characterising the victim of the accident (economic activity, age, etc.). It can be established for all accidents or breakdowns according to one or more of the variables above characterising the accident (part of body injured, etc.). Separate incidence rates are calculated for fatal accidents and accidents leading to more than 3 days' absence. It should be noted that only this adjusted incidence rate on fatalities is used for the breakdown by Member States The standard formula is the following: Number of accidents (fatal or non-fatal) Incidence rate = X 100 000 Number of employed persons in the studied population To correct for differences in economic structure between the Member States a \"standardised\" number of accidents at work per 100 000 persons in employment is calculated per Member State by giving each branch the same weight at national level as in the European Union total {\"standardised\" incidence rate). This standardisation method is used in current ESAW publications on accidents at work. Type of Injury The variable type ofinjury describes the physical consequences for the victim e.g. bone fracture, wounds etc. The current ESAW classification is in accordance with the ILO recommendation mentioned above. 53 ",
        "Part of Body Injured This variable describes the part ofthe body injured. The current ESAW classification is on the whole in accordance with the ILO recommendation mentioned above. In cases where several parts of the body have been injured, the site, which has been most seriously injured, should be chosen e.g. an amputation precedes bone fracture, which precedes wounds etc. In other cases a code for multiple sites should be used at the appropriate level ofthe classification, e.g., broken hand and foot. In cases where larger parts ofthe body have been affected, e.g., injuries caused by burns or skalds, a code for multiple sites should be used as well. \u2022 Future variables Workstation This variable identifies the usual or in contrast occasional nature of the place/post occupied by the victim at the time of the accident. It does not take into account the permanency or not of the job (see \"Employment status\"). The Working Environment The type of working area where the victim was present or was working just before the accident. This is the place of work, general area, work premises, where the accident happened. The Working Process The main type/kind of work, task (generic/broad activity) that was done by the victim at the time of the accident. This describes the main type of work done by the victim at the time of the accident. This is not the occupation of the victim, neither the victim's precise Specific Physical Activity at the moment of the accident. This concerns the description of the task, work, broadly speaking, undertaken by the victim during a period of time ending at the instant ofthe accident. The Specific Physical Activity The activity being done by the victim just before the accident. This is the Specific Physical Activity the victim was doing at the very moment of the accident. One must consider exactly what the victim was doing at the time of the accident. The activity may be undertaken for a very short period of time. The Material Agent of the Specific Physical Activity The principal Material Agent associated/linked with the Specific Physical Activity of the victim just before the accident. The Material Agent associated with the Specific Physical Activity is describing the tool, the object, the agent used by the victim when the accident happened. The Material Agent may be or may not be implicated in the accident. 56 ",
        "The Deviation The last deviant event from normal which leads to the accident. This is the description of what occurred in an abnormal way. This is a deviation from the normal way of working, from the normal process. The Deviation is the event leading to the accident. If there are several connected events, the last deviation must be recorded (the closest deviation, in time, to the Contact - Mode of Injury). The Material Agent of Deviation The principal Material Agent associated/linked with the deviant event. The Material Agent associated with the Deviation describes the tool, the object, the agent linked to the abnormality ofthe process, linked with what occurred in an abnormal way. The Contact - Mode of Injury The contact that injured the victim. It is describing how the victim was hurt (physical or psychological contact) by the Material Agent that caused the injury. If there are several Contacts - Modes of Injury, the one causing the most serious injury must be recorded. The Material Agent ofthe Contact - Mode of Injury The principal Material Agent associated/linked with the contact that injured. The Material Agent associated with the Contact - Mode of Injury describes the object, the tool, the agent the victim came into contact with or the psychological Mode of Injury.

        "OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES INTRODUCTION Background for EODS project A Pilot Project on European Occupational Disease Statistics (EODS) was launched in 1991. The overall aim ofthe project is to establish Union-wide comparable and reliable indicators on occupational diseases. A pilot project was proposed and adopted by the Working Group. The objective of the Pilot Project was to establish comparable data for selected variables with respect to 31 items taken from the European Schedule of Occupational Diseases. Data from the reference year 1995 on recognised occupational diseases was collected in the 15 Member States and delivered to Eurostat. Further information on the coverage and recognition criteria was collected with a questionnaire. The evaluation work was to be completed by an external evaluation team in co-operation with a technical subcommittee. The results of the evaluation showed that the methodology for the collection of data on recognised cases of occupational diseases needed to be improved on several points. The most important were: The population covered by the data should be quantitatively defined by industry and occupation. The medical inclusion criteria should be clearly defined for the various items (or principal groups of diseases) More detailed classification ofthe medical diagnosis is needed The inclusion of \"mild cases\" should be clarified A measure ofthe severity of disease should be established The EODS Working Group concluded in September 1998 that an improved methodology, EODS Phase 1, should be established taking into account the results of the evaluation. The aim was to collect new EODS data for the reference year 2000. For this reason an EODS Phase 1 methodology should be finalised before the end of 1999. This work has now been launched. The population of persons covered by the 1995 EODS Pilot data, established from the LFS, was almost 128 million persons in employment, which represented almost 90% of the total European workforce. Basic concepts and definitions European Schedule reference N\u00b0 The variable \"European Schedule Reference N\u00b0\" provides an indicator for agent or type of exposure. The Schedule also provides a reference to the information notices on occupational diseases, and thus explanatory notes for the various items in the Schedule. 59 ",
        "EODS Pilot data was collected for the reference year 1995 for 31 items taken from the European Schedule of Occupational Diseases. \u2022 Future variables Diagnosis Information on diagnosis is classified according to the ICD 10 nomenclature. Exposure Information on exposure should be classified in accordance with a classification established by Eurostat in collaboration with the Working Group (Main groups at the first digit level: chemical agents, physical agents, biological agents, biomechanical agents, psychosocial exposure factors, industrial factors-materials-products). Only the use of a short list is compulsory but a more detailed (\"long\") list can be used optionally. Use categories The use category is the type of industrial product that contained the harmful exposure agent that caused the disease (e.g., cleaning products, colouring products, ...). This variable is optional. Degree of disability/ severity A variable and a classification will be developed taking into consideration the various national definitions. This variable should partly solve the problem with \"mild cases\". CONTENTS OF THE DATABASE Most tables on individuals can be subdivided by sex. 1.

        "AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURE INTRODUCTION Data on women and men working in agriculture may be yielded from the Community survey on the structure of agricultural holdings (available from the EUROFARM database). An exhaustive study (covering all EU holdings) is carried out every 10 years - the last one was held in 1989/90 and the next one is foreseen for 1999/2000. A sample survey is carried out every 2-3 years - the most recent one dates from 1997 (the results from all Member States will be available in autumn 1999). Results of the surveys are transmitted by the Member States to Eurostat in the form of individual data for each holding (except for Germany which has sent tabular results, but will start sending individual data from the 1999/2000 basic survey onwards). The survey mainly yields data on the structure of agricultural holdings (holdings, crops, livestock, machinery, etc.), but also on the farm labour force. Those interested can obtain information on the contents of the survey by consulting the \"Official Journal ofthe EC\", no L 391 of 30.12.89, L 149 of 6.6 1997 and no L 168 of 13.6.1998.

        "PROJECTIONS INTRODUCTION Eurostat makes projections in two fields, demography and employment. In addition to that, national population forecasts are collected annually and updated to the New Cronos database. CONTENTS OF THE DATABASE 1. Demographic projections Eurostat makes population projections using assumptions on three basic components, i.e., fertility, mortality and migration (external and internal). The latest long-term population projections have been drawn up for the period 1995 - 2050 in scenarios: baseline, low, high, young and old The assumptions underlying the five scenarios are summarised in the following scheme: Scenarios BASELINE LOW HIGH YOUNG OLD Fertility medium low high high low Life expectancy medium low high low high Net migration medium low high high low At a national level, projections are currently made for all the countries in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Projections also exist at a regional level for the European Union Member States (using NUTS 2). Regional scenarios will be available also on CD-ROM. New Cronos database includes following data of both the most recent national forecasts and the Eurostat projections for each EU and EFTA country on: a) Population by sex age group (five-year in 1995 - 2000, 2005 , 2050) assumptions used for fertility, mortality and migration. 2. Labour force scenarios Using the data from the Labour Force Survey. Eurostat has made projections for the economically active population (persons in employment and the unemployed). These projections are made for the years 1995-2025 and cover all the EU Member States (also at NUTS 2 regional level). There is a breakdown by sex and by age (15. 16 74. 75 and more). 66 ",
        "Three long-term activity rate scenarios have been made: the baseline scenario and the high and low scenarios. A) The baseline scenario assumes the recent trends, for the most part, to continue: continued growth of the EU economy modest increases in labour demand and employment growth moderate rise in the labour force participation of young people under 25 significant increase in the labour force participation of women slight fall in the participation of middle aged males considerable increase in the participation of women aged 50 to 75 slight rise in the participation of elderly males B) The low scenario assumes: lower economic growth than in the past lack of jobs for young people leading to decline ofthe participation deterioration of general conditions of the middle aged persons to be active on the labour market continued trend towards early retirement, especially among men. C) The high scenario assumes: higher rates of economic growth than in the past rising demand for labour more young people will combine education with paid employment ample incentives for prime aged persons to be active on the labour market elderly persons will postpone retirement due to more flexible working arrangements These scenarios are combined with the demographic scenarios. Data available in this database for every year are: a) Activity rate by sex age (15, 16, ..., 74, 75 and more) b) Economically active population 1995 - 2025 by sex age.

        "LABOUR MARKET POLICIES Development of a new database as a module of ESSPROS INTRODUCTION The European Council in Amsterdam in June 1997 decided to incorporate a new title on Employment in the Treaty. The Extraordinary Job Summit of Luxembourg in November 1997 agreed to immediately implement different methods of multilateral monitoring of the co-ordinated strategy for employment as provided in Article 128 ofthe Treaty. The Employment Policy Guidelines provide common goals and targets for the formulation of employment policies and labour market reform in Member States. At the same time, this multilateral monitoring requires comparable policy indicators and data, which in part are not yet available for the Union as a whole. In 1996, in anticipation of this action, the Commission initiated preliminary technical work in co-operation with Member States with the aim of examining the feasibility of such a database. Since then, Eurostat and DGV have worked closely together to define the characteristics of the work which should be done, as well as the links of this work with the two other main existing sources (OECD database on LMP and European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics - ESSPROS). At present, work has started in order to set up an agreed comparable database in Member States, and a pilot data collection was launched at the end of March 1999. Basic concepts and definitions Labour market policy measures are defined as \"Public interventions in the labour market aimed at reaching its efficient functioning and to correct disequilibria and which can be distinguished from other general employment policy measures in that they act selectively to favour particular groups in the labour market \" Each individual measure is classified according to two complementary classification criteria, by type of action and by type of expenditure: 1. Type of action Out-of-work income maintenance and support Full employment benefits Partial unemployment benefits Part-time unemployment benefits Redundancy compensation Bankruptcy compensation 69 ",

A pilot data collection will be finished in December-99 and the results of the first data collection should be available 12 months later (December-2000). It is planned to provide data on participants for each LMP measure. The database will take into account the following aspects ofthe LMP measures: Types and characteristics of the labour market measures, Expenditure for each measure, Number of participants and characteristics with respect to age (under 20, 20-24, 25-44, 45-49, 50 and more), sex and employment situation.
