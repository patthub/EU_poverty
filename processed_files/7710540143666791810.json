        "7 1. Introduction This report proposes a revised structure and content for the Dashboard of EU Youth Indicators which will feed into the development of the EU\u2019s Youth Strategy. Knowledge and evidence-building are placed at the core of European youth policy in the \u2018EU Strategy Investing and Empowering: A renewed open method of coordination to address youth challenges and opportunities\u2019 1 and the Council\u2019s \u2018Resolution on a renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field for 2010-2018 (2009).\u2019 2 These documents emphasise the role of knowledge of the living conditions, values and attitudes of young people with a view to sharing it with other policy fields. In order to facilitate knowledge gathering and an evidence-based approach to youth policy, the Council invited the Commission to set up an ad-hoc expert group on youth indicators in 2010 which created the first Dashboard of EU youth indicators and presented it in the Commission Staff Working Document on EU Indicators in the Field of Youth 3 (Annex I). In 2019, the Expert Group on 'EU indicators in the field of youth' (EG) 4 was established with the mandate to support the work of the European Commission\u2019s Directorate General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture (DG EAC) by delivering the following expected outcomes: \uf084 Outcome 1: Review of the existing Dashboard of EU indicators in the field of youth \uf084 Outcome 2: Proposals for new quantitative and qualitative policy indicators and benchmarks, as appropriate, tailored to the needs of Member States and sectors concerned, to help to monitor the implementation of the EU Youth Strategy (2019- 2027). This Expert Group was composed of 32 representatives of Member States\u2019 authorities, international organisations and key stakeholders. Their suggestions summarised in this report will be presented to the Council\u2019s Youth Working Party. The work of the Expert Group followed the Commission \u2019 s proposal to build on the existing Dashboard of EU youth indicators and relied on a number of policy documents, including the Council Resolution on the EU Youth Strategy 4F 5 (and its Work Plan 2019-2021), which sets out a framework for European cooperation in the youth field for 2019-2027, which in turn is based on the Commission\u2019s Communication of 22 May 2018 on \u2018Engaging, Connecting and Empowering young people\u2019. 5F 6 The revision of the Dashboard echoes the findings of the interim evaluation of the EU Youth Strategy (2010-2018) 6F 7 , which stressed the need for a 1 EUROPEAN COMMISSION (2009).

Development of the new policy indicators furthermore builds on the results of the open method of coordination (OMC) in the youth field 2010-2018 (SWD 2018/168) 8 . The experts took into account the European Youth Goals 9 and incorporated in the revision of the Dashboard the guiding principles of a European Youth Policy and the new EU Youth Strategy: equality and non- discrimination; inclusion; participation; global, European, national, regional and local dimension; and dual approach. This report was created upon finalisation of the revision of the dashboard conducted by the experts from September 2019 to November 2020, and the external consultations organised from October to November 2020 with Eurostat, Eurofound, EACEA Youth Wiki and Youth Goals Laboratory. It also integrates the final feedback on the revised Dashboard collected from the experts in January-February 2021. Section 1 of the report briefly describes the background, the youth policy context and quality standards underlying the revision of the dashboard; section 2 presents the structure, purpose and relevance of the revised Dashboard; and sections 3 and 4 present the revised Situation-Dashboard and newly developed Policy-Dashboard indicators. Expert reflections on relevance of the situation indicators for the EU Youth Goals are presented in Annex II while Annex III compiles general comments and recommendations for the future development and revision of the Situation-Dashboard. This report was written by Sladjana Petkovic, with the support of Ecorys, who were both commissioned by DG EAC to provide support services to expert groups and mutual learning activities in the field of youth policy from March 2019 to December 2021. 1.1 Indicative roadmap and methodology The work of the Expert Group 'EU indicators in the youth field\u2019 was organised in line with the indicative roadmap (see Figure 1 below), which was adopted by the Expert Group in September 2019 and updated at the fourth meeting (in July 2020).The European Commission\u2019s DG EAC hosted three face-to-face meetings and three virtual meetings of this Expert Group while additional online consultations took place between meetings, as per the experts\u2019 request. The revision process included the thematic and the technical review of around 140 indicators compiled by Ecorys in an Indicators matrix which was composed of 41 dashboard indicators and the additional European (e.g. Eurostat youth database) 10 and global indicator datasets (e.g. Youth Development Index (YDI) 11 ; Youth Well-being Index 12 , Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators) 13 . In addition, Youth Progress Index (YPI) 14 and country specific youth indicators (i.e. Sweden) were presented to the experts but they were not a subject of assessment due to the technical limitations. Online Excel worksheets and tailored breakout session templates were developed to support the Expert Group in conducting the thorough (online and offline) assessment of the selected indicators, involving a) identification of key themes and relevant questions and b) identification of potential datasets and technical issues related to the indicators. 8 EUROPEAN COMMISSION (2018).

        "9 The process of indicator assessment was based on the following quality selection criteria adopted by the experts: valid; relevant/usable; reliable/verifiable/transparent; coherent and comparable; measurable; cost-effective; statistically robust; disaggregated \u2013 potential to be downscaled; accessible and clear; achievable/feasible; time bounded and punctual. Additional selection criterion for revised dashboard indicators is linked to their relevance for the EU Youth Goals (see Annex II). Figure 1. Methodology for the Expert Group Source: Ecorys, 2020 The Commission\u2019s DG EAC and external partners, such as Eurostat, EACEA Youth Wiki, EU- Council of Europe youth partnership, and EU Youth Goals Laboratory provided enriching inputs during the revision process. As mentioned earlier, external consultations with respective technical experts (including Eurofound), were conducted to gain their feedback on the final draft of the revised Dashboard, to develop ownership and to ensure that the document reflects the changing reality of youth in Europe.

        "10 2. Structure and relevance of the revised Dashboard The structure of the revised Dashboard was adopted by the experts during the fourth meeting (held in July 2020). As the result, the revised Dashboard of EU Youth Indicators is composed of two main sections: Section 1: Situation-Dashboard and Section 2: Policy- Dashboard, (see Figure 2). The Situation-Dashboard contains 73 revised and newly developed contextual and situation indicators: \uf077 Contextual indicators (4) provide introductory insight into the demographic data on the youth population in Europe; \uf077 Situation indicators (69) are divided between eight policy domains, which in turn are organised within three core dimensions aligned with the core actions of the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027: Engage (2 domains, 12 indicators and 3 sub- indicators); Connect (2 domains, 7 indicators and 4 sub-indicators); and Empower (4 domains, 15 indicators and 28 sub-indicators). The Policy-Dashboard combines the newly developed quantitative and qualitative policy indicators organised around 13 instruments of the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027 (see Table 10), including: 1. Evidence-based youth policy-making and knowledge building; 2. Mutual learning and dissemination; 3. Participatory governance; 4. Mobilising EU programmes and funds; 5. Monitoring of EU funding; 6. Communicating the EU Youth Strategy; 7. Future National Activities Planner; 8. EU Youth Dialogue; 9. The EU Youth Coordinator; 10. Youth Information and Support; 11. EU Work Plans for Youth; 12. Monitoring, reporting, evaluation; and 13. Mid-term Review. In comparison to the existing Dashboard (41 indicators), the structure of the revised Dashboard reflects the cross-sectoral nature of youth policy and the EYS and encompasses all the main aspects of young people\u2019s lives. The replacement of indicators on \u2018Culture and Creativity\u2019 and \u2018Youth and the World\u2019 with indicators on \u2018Youth and the Digital World\u2019 and \u2018Quality Youth Work\u2019 reflects the change in priorities in the youth field. The revised Dashboard provides a rich source of information for various audiences, including researchers, practitioners and policy makers. From a research perspective, the Situation- Dashboard indicators should be most useful for youth research (i.e. research on young people), whereas the Policy-Dashboard clearly focuses on youth policy research. 15 15 Initial reflection on these topics has been formulated in the \u2018Note on the renewed EU-Dashboard of youth indicators\u2019, created by Hofmann-van de Poll, (unpublished internal document), and supported by the fellow experts during the consultation process.

        "12 3. Situation Dashboard The Situation-Dashboard (73) is composed of the contextual (4) and situation indicators (69) which were assessed by the experts as \u2018essential\u2019. Besides, Ecorys has developed a web-based interactive data visualisation tool to present an online version of the revised Situation-Dashboard 16 . It aims to encourage data exploration and comparative data analysis, and to enable users to view indicators and other statistical data, gaining insights in the situation on youth in the EU and their programme engagement and activities. Recommendations for the future development of Situation-Dashboard indicators and their relevance for the EU Youth Goals are presented in Annexes 2 and 3. 3.1 Contextual indicators \uf0d8 Youth population (4 indicators), see Table 1 Table 1.

        "24 4. Policy Dashboard One of the expected outcomes within the mandate of this Expert Group was to create proposals for new quantitative and qualitative policy indicators and benchmarks, tailored to the needs of Member States and sectors concerned to help monitoring the implementation of the EU Youth Strategy (2019-2027). The experts began developing new policy indicators by reviewing the outcome indicators proposed by the Open Method of Coordination (OMC). Following a thorough assessment, the experts have included five \u2018OMC outcome indicators\u2019 in the revised Dashboard. They argued that there is a difficulty in fulfilling the political goal of monitoring the implementation of the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027 when the proposed OMC indicators are technically insufficient to do so. Following consultations with the Commission\u2019s DG EAC, the Expert Group concluded that a solution lies in the monitoring of the instruments of the Strategy by applying the set of policy indicators developed by them from March to November 2020 (see table 10). However, the Policy-Dashboard does not aspire to represent a comprehensive list of recommendations for qualitative and quantitative policy indicators aiming to measure the success of the EYS. It rather represents a \u2018recommended list\u2019 of data that youth experts think Member States should produce/collect in order to monitor the effectiveness of the EYS and support the EU Youth Report. This list is a result of an extensive discussion and suggestions developed by the experts based on the available data and expertise that could be further tested. Table 9. Policy indicators for EYS 2019-2027 instruments 1. EVIDENCE-BASED YOUTH POLICY-MAKING AND KNOWLEDGE BUILDING Definition: EU Youth Policy should be evidence-based and anchored in the real needs and situations of young people. That requires continuous research, knowledge development and outreach to young people and youth organisations. The collection of disaggregated data on young people is of particular importance to foster understanding of the needs of different groups of young people, particularly those with fewer opportunities. Evidence based policy-making should be carried out with the support of the Youth Wiki, youth research networks, cooperation with international organisations such as the Council of Europe, the OECD and other bodies. 1.1. Is there a national platform where people and authorities can inform themselves on European policy and its implementation in the country? 1.2. Whether there is a National Youth Plan/ National Youth Strategy in place in your country? 1.3. Whether the National Youth Plan / National Youth Strategy is based on evidence? 1.4. Whether there is a systematic follow-up on implementation of the National Youth Plan/ National Youth Strategy? 1.5. Whether Youth policy is regularly monitored and evaluated? If so, by whom? 1.6.

Expert groups will continue to develop policy guidance, practical tools and share good practices; this strategy will offer new tools for mutual learning, such as peer reviews and peer counselling, high-level forums, analysis and studies, following the priorities of the EU Youth Strategy at large, and within the triennial Work Plans. It will pursue a more systematic approach to quality youth information, outreach and dissemination, building on its existing networks. 2.1.

If the most important challenges in MS where they need mutual learning are found in EU Youth Strategy in a useful way? 3.PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE Definition: In order to acknowledge young people as experts of their own lives, it is crucial to ensure that young people and their representative organisations are involved in the different phases of implementation of the EU Youth Strategy. Participation increases visibility for young people and their concerns, but it also raises the visibility of decision-makers in youth policy in the eyes of young people. Participation also aims at increasing legitimacy and acknowledgement of youth policies. In order to build a basis for a regular civic dialogue, give stakeholders a greater role in coordinating the implementation of the strategy, offer opportunities to exchange information on activities and results, an EU Youth Strategy Platform will aim to facilitate participatory governance and coordination of the implementation of the Strategy. The Commission is invited to organise dedicated meetings to bring together, as appropriate, representatives of EU institutions, Member States, National Agencies of Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps, youth organisations and other relevant stakeholders as well as local and regional authorities. 3.1. What types of stakeholders are represented in the EU Youth Strategy Platform? How many stakeholders and sectors are included in the EU Youth Strategy Platform? 3.2.

        "28 6. COMMUNICATING THE EU YOUTH STRATEGY Definition: Keeping in mind the different stakeholders involved in policy-making for young people, it is important to communicate the purpose and the content of the EU Youth Strategy in a comprehensive way and youth-friendly language.

        "38 Annex III: General comments and recommendations for development and revision of the Situation-Dashboard General comments: \uf084 All Eurostat data can be presented by sex, the majority (if relevant) by 5-years group (although the reliability could be a concern) and by educational attainment (more relevant for older age groups). The breakdown should be mentioned only if it is very important (e.g. to show inequality). \uf084 Expert recommendations on data disaggregation: a) indicators on access to rights and cross-sectoral cooperation need to cover all 8 domains; b) all the performance indicators should propose a differentiation by gender; c) social inclusion domain: to disaggregate data according to age, sex and migrant background. \uf084 Eurostat ICT surveys for after 2022 will respond to the new DG CONNECT framework, to be decided this year. DG EAC could have a voice to propose variables/indicators needed for the policy. \uf084 EU-SILC modules will run on 3- or 6-years rotation. The majority of variables in these modules (on health, labour, social participation, etc.) will be repeated but they are always discussed and some changes are possible. \uf084 Some alignment of future Eurobarometers on Youth with Eurostat variables and surveys calendar would be beneficial for monitoring situation of youth. \uf084 Eurofound suggests an in-depth statistical analysis and a quality check of the various indicators because the revised dashboard includes data from several sources of very different quality and data providers, with very different period of references and very different levels of representativeness. There are a set of standard statistical analyses that could be performed (e.g. correlation analysis, principal component analysis, crombach alpha). All these are explained on in the JRC-OECD Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators (https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/books/handbook-constructing-composite- indicators-methodology-and-user-guide. Expert recommendations for the Situation-Dashboard indicators YOUTH POPULATION \uf084 Indicators on youth with disability (Eurostat, SILC) \uf084 Indicators on sexual identity/orientation despite low data availability/potential to be included in policy Dashboard. YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN SOCIETY \uf084 Youth sense of belonging to the European project (Eurobarometer). \uf084 Age for office (Data are available in the Youth Wiki, besides the sources mentioned in the dashboard. A comparative online map is available on the Youth Wiki website). \uf084 Young people 18-30 who got elected into local, regional, national and the European Parliament. (The indicator poses difficulties concerning the number of young people ",
        "39 elected in national and regional parliaments. While data are available for the European Parliament, they are not for national and regional ones). \uf084 Youth engagement in boards of sport clubs, leisure clubs, youth clubs, associations. \uf084 Participation of the young in activities of churches or other religious organisation by sex and age. \uf084 Collaborative environment when interacting with other young people. \uf084 Obstacles to participation in EU programmes / Accessibility of the EU programmes: more details about the profiles of the participants, more data from young people. \uf084 Voting in direct democracy mechanism, such as referenda, popular initiatives, recalls, or town hall meetings (despite the fact that there surely will not be too many of those around the EU\u2026). \uf084 Indicator on number of innovative participatory mechanisms across the EU, such as: participatory budgeting opportunities; citizen councils; public consultations; participatory planning; referenda. \uf084 Indicator on the individualized political participation types (as conventional and non- conventional are covered), such as boycotting products, systematically engaging in environmentalism (e.g. reducing car travel, increasing cycling, using reusable packaging, going vegan, etc.). \uf084 Self-reported level of information on/awareness of current EU/national/local public matters. Maybe using some of the information provided by the initiative \u201cEU vs Disinfo\u201d to mark how much disinformation is aimed directly at young people every year. EMPLOYMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP \uf084 Job satisfaction (EU-LFS 2017, EU-SILC every 3 years). \uf084 Commuting to work (remoteness, urban rural dimension). \uf084 Number of young people in internships (ratio of paid and unpaid internships). \uf084 Number of young people in traineeships. \uf084 Number of start-ups developed by young people. YOUTH MOBILITY \uf084 Structural indicator for voluntary programmes and services. \uf084 What about volunteering abroad? We could have statistics from the Solidarity Corps for example (e.g. about going abroad to learn, volunteer or work for a period of more than 2 weeks). \uf084 Indicators on intercultural awareness (limited data availability). \uf084 Number of exchanges and international volunteering opportunities would be good to know in order to put the numbers of young participants into perspective (to be able to see how many people per project we have on average in different countries, etc.). \uf084 Background of the young people participating (in order to be able to tell how inclusive the projects are and what level of outreach they show). YOUTH AND THE DIGITAL WORLD ",
        "40 \uf084 Skills for innovation (Youth Wiki: Chapter 6 (6.7.)) \uf084 Young people victims of cyber bullying by age and sex. \uf084 A sub-indicator on safe usage of digital technologies (e.g. amount of risky online behaviour young people engage in, based on a list they could pick from in the ICT Survey: chatting online with people they do not know in person, sharing pictures of themselves to people they do not know in person, etc.). \uf084 Access to digital world of youth with visual and other impairments. QUALITY YOUTH WORK \uf084 Indicators referring to \u2018youth work\u2019 in general should be further developed (if we narrow the focus on quality only it could imply that there is an issue with quality of youth work practice across Europe). \uf084 What about the recognition of the youth worker profession, access to initial and continuing training. This is a major difference between countries and an essential element of quality. EDUCATION AND TRAINING \uf084 Indicators on young people with more difficult access to education (e.g. from vulnerable groups, with Roma background, refugees, etc.). \uf084 Indicators on youth in institutions (e.g. youth with disabilities, youth in long-term juvenile institutions, young people in specialized education). \uf084 More information about participation in non-formal education and training (e.g. via e- courses). Make the timeframe wider, as non-formal learning activities can highly depend on season of the year (with summer bringing more opportunities to participate than other seasons), and this could provide an unclear picture\u2026e.g. last 3 months? \uf084 Include a more current thinking about what competences are necessary in today\u2019s world, such as life skills and citizenship education. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING \uf084 Indicators on disability: \u2018prevalence of disability, employment of disabled persons, barriers to the social integration of disabled persons\u2019, \uf084 Indicators on mental health issues, depression, distress, anxiety; and on access to/satisfaction with mental health services. \uf084 Indicators on fear of the future/worries about climate change/respectively optimistic view. \uf084 Indicators on sexual transmitted diseases (WHO). \uf084 Indicators on work life balance (some data coming from EU-LFS, Flash Eurobarometer). SOCIAL INCLUSION \uf084 Indicators on social inclusion/exclusion perception. \uf084 Indicators on intercultural understanding, openness to cultural diversity and value of diversity. ",
        "41 \uf084 Indicators on solidarity and barriers to solidarity (e.g. \u2018Young people involved in solidarity activities with other communities (refugees, deprived populations\u2019 etc.). \uf084 Indicators related to access to housing, justice, youth counselling services and helplines. (Could be linked to the counselling; mental health; or merged with other areas). \uf084 Measures of inclusion of young people with mental issues into everyday life, including labour market and learning opportunities. \uf084 Support mechanisms that enable young people with various disadvantages (mental & physical health, cultural background, economic background) to engage in everyday life, e.g. number of young people reached by/attending/engaged in the outreach programmes battling exclusion & discrimination.
