        "2 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 I n March 2002, the Barcelona European Council decided to enhance the activities of the Euro- pean Investment Bank in Mediterranean part- ner countries through the creation of the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partner- ship (FEMIP). The overall objective was to \"stimu- late private sector development in our Mediterranean Partner Countries in order to facilitate a higher level of economic growth consistent with the growth of the labour force in the region.\" Following consultations with the partner countries (MPCs), the Council decided the following year to reinforce FEMIP, essentially via the creation of a number of features and instruments to support the private sector. These included the establishment of a trust fund allowing donors to complement on a voluntary basis the Bank\u2019s own resources as well as the financial resources provided to the Bank from the EU budget. The aim of the trust fund would be to direct re- sources to operations in certain priority sectors which can be enhanced through the provision of technical assistance or made financially viable via a risk capital operation. In June 2011, the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors approved the creation of a third window of operation for the FEMIP Trust Fund (FTF), dedicated to activities that would support democratic transformation processes in the Medi- terranean region. The FEMIP Trust Fund acts on three fronts: 1. It targets upstream technical assistance through the financing of sectoral studies; 2. It supports private-sector development through the financing of risk capital operations; 3. It supports operations that enable democratic transformation in the region. The Mediterranean partner countries currently eligible for FTF support are: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Leba- non, Libya 1 , Morocco, Palestine, Syria 2 and Tunisia. The FEMIP Trust Fund\u2019s activities are fully com- plementary to other EU instruments, such as the Neighbourhood Investment Facility. In February 2013, the Board revised the Rules to al- low contributions from third parties, including the Deauville Partnership MENA Transition Fund, to be channelled through the FTF. This revision has served to reinforce complementarities between the various players in the FEMIP region. The Assembly of Donors serves as both advisory and decision-making body for the FTF, by provid- ing guidance on the Fund\u2019s strategy and orienta- tions, and by approving proposals. The Assembly also constitutes an ideal forum for bilateral donors to engage further with the EIB and the European Commission. T h e F E M I P T r u s t F u n d ( F T F ) 1 The EIB will start operating in Libya after it signs a Framework Agreement with the country \u2013 currently under preparation. 2 Following EU sanctions in November 2011, the EIB has suspended all loan disbursements and technical advisory contracts for projects in Syria.

        "4 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 2014 marked the beginning of a new seven-year period for our activities in the Mediterranean re- gion with the 2014-2020 External Lending Man- date giving the Bank the possibility to invest up to EUR 9.6 billion with a European Union guarantee, complemented by up to EUR 3 billion of financ- ing at the Bank\u2019s own risk. To accompany this new mandate and meet the changing needs in the re- gion, we developed the FTF Strategy 2014-2020 to- gether with our donors. In 2014, we continued to broaden the range of in- struments available for the region with the launch of a new Impact Investment Window. This allows the FTF to expand its reach, facilitating Bank fi- nancing in higher risk and higher impact transac- tions, like providing risk capital to equity funds and microfinance institutions. During 2014 we also negotiated a contribution of EUR 19.2 million from the United Kingdom\u2019s De- partment for International Development (DfID) in support of Climate Action in the Middle East and North Africa (CAMENA) to build capacity and pre- pare new climate investments in the Mediterra- nean region. Looking forward, we will continue to seek ways to maximise the impact of FTF operations. By com- bining EIB and FTF resources \u2013 technical, as well as financial \u2013 the FTF will support partner countries in promoting investment in socio-economic infra- structure and private-sector development, thus creating jobs and economic growth. O ver the past ten years, the FTF has proven its worth, complementing EIB lending activi- ties in Mediterranean partner countries by financing assignments to support investment in the region. To date, the FTF has approved 60 opera- tions with an aggregate value of EUR 37.2 million, of which EUR 5.76 million was approved in 2014. The Trust Fund had also leveraged an additional EUR 20.76 million in grants from the Deauville Part- nership MENA Transition Fund. 2014: FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Ten years of service to Mediterranean partner countries Ambroise FAYOLLE F o r e w o r d b y t h e E I B V i c e - P r e s i d e n t ",

        "8 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 \u201cSince the creation of the FEMIP Trust Fund (FTF), Spain has reaffirmed its commitment to the Medi- terranean partner countries and has supported, through all the instruments available, the achievement of a favourable economic environment and the development of a strong and dynamic private sector in the region. The FEMIP Trust Fund has managed to cope with the dif- ferent challenges of the region, shifting its focus from upstream analysis to project preparation and imple- mentation when it was appropriate, focusing its activity on priority sectors and inviting third parties to provide resources to finance new projects that are in the pipeline. As a result of the successful performance of the Fund, in its 12 years of life it has approved 60 projects that have mobilised 80% of its resources. Spain gives its full support to the new EIB Strategy for the Mediterranean 2014-2020. We praise the capacity of the FEMIP Trust Fund to adopt a more integrated approach to projects by providing technical assistance and widen the scope for risk capital operations, with the main goal of achieving steady growth in the Mediterranean partner countries.\u201d Luis DE GUINDOS JURADO Minister of Economy and Competitiveness of the Kingdom of Spain Member of the EIB Board of Governors \u201c Sweden takes an active part in supporting action to promote economic devel- opment and growth in the Middle East and North Africa. In this perspective, Sweden has since 2011 provided continuous support to the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Invest- ment and Partnership Trust Fund. The support provided through the Trust Fund allows the improved preparation and implementation of projects in Mediterranean partner countries, and fosters institutional capacities in those countries, thereby enhancing the sustainability of investments. Given the challenges ahead for the Middle East and North Africa, Sweden will continue its engagement in the Mediterranean region, in line with our priorities for development cooperation. In the framework of the EIB Strategy for Mediterranean 2020 and the FEMIP Trust Fund Strategy, we firmly believe that Trust Fund contributions to infrastructure and climate action financing and private sector support will positively impact sustain- able development, governance and poverty reduction in the Mediterranean countries.\u201d Robert RYDBERG Ambassador, Deputy Director General Head of Department for Middle East and North Africa Ministry for Foreign Affairs Swedish Government Offices Donor statements ",

Subsequently, the Bank worked with relevant European Commission DGs to develop the SNAP-T programme. So far, the Neighbourhood Investment Facility has ap- proved EUR 5 million and the Bank has allocated Technical Advisory to support seed accelerators in the FEMIP region, EUR 2 million Country: Egypt, Palestine (West Bank), Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Morocco Beneficiary: Seed accelerators in Egypt, Palestine (West Bank), Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon Sector: ICT EUR 2.1 million from EIB own resources to SNAP-T, allowing it to hire up to eight expert staff assisting partner countries with the preparation of finance- able EuroMed Transport Forum priority projects \u2013 under the political guidance of the European Commission and the Union for the Mediterra nean. Furthermore, the Bank succeeded in mobilising EUR 11.5 million from the Deauville Partnership Transition Fund for technical advisory actions ex- pected to be managed mainly by SNAP-T. The extra EUR 2 million approved by FTF Donors in April 2014 adds value to SNAP-T and helps generate an impact over its initial three-year period by removing pos- sible timing gaps between TA identification and funds being available from other funding sources. This operation matches a growing need in the region: the creation of millions of jobs over the next decade in order to stimulate sustainable economic growth. Business accelerators provide seed capital and tech- nical advisory to entrepreneurs to help them create companies at a relatively fast pace. The operation aims to support five accelerators in the region by fi- nancing training via a EUR 0.8 million TA component, to complement seed funding of up to EUR 1.2 million through the creation of a platform. The EUR 0.8 million TA component was contracted in 2014. amount of EUR 5.76 million, including a third ex- tension to the FEMIP internship programme, were approved by the Assembly of Donors.

The additional allo- cation of EUR 0.35 million from the FTF is crucial to: (i) develop national strategies and PPP awareness among the stakeholders involved in the devel- opment of potential PPP projects; (ii) procure and manage technical, legal and finan- cial consultancies funded through MED5P, via the coaching of public project implementation units. TAYSIR \u2013 Subordinated loan to a greenfield MFI in Tunisia, EUR 1 million Country: Tunisia Beneficiary: Tunisian microenterprises and low-income self-employed persons Sector: Finance and MSMEs TAYSIR is a first pilot project under the new FTF \u201cIm- pact Investment Envelope\u201d, supported as part of the wider FTF Strategy 2014-2020. This subordinated loan is an efficient way to pro- vide stable, medium-term funding to new and emerging companies. In the Tunisian context, the approved EIB loan to TAYSIR is considered as Tier II capital by the Tunisian regulatory authority for micro finance \u2013 thereby contributing to the mini- mum capital requirement necessary to launch this socially-orientated microfinance institution. Given the strong demand for microfinance services from women and youth entrepreneurs, small farm- ers and disadvantaged groups in Tunisia, the antici- pated expansion of TAYSIR\u2019s activity in the coming years is expected to permit the reimbursement of the EIB\u2019s EUR 1 million subordinated loan by the end of year seven. Once reimbursed, these funds can be reinvested in other projects. The operation was approved by FTF donors on 14 October 2014, and an agreement on a EUR 1 mil- lion loan (nearly 2.2 million Tunisian dinars) was signed with Taysir Micro-finance on 3 December 2014 in Tunis. EIB President Werner Hoyer and Vice- President Philippe de Fontaine Vive were present at the TAYSIR signing ceremony. ",

With this access to finance, and in particular to long-term financing with conditions of duration, repayment and price as provided by the EIB FEMIP Trust Fund, we are able to increase a supply of microfinance services to microenterprises, youth, small farmers and low-income self-employed people in Tunisia with the ultimate goal of enhancing entrepreneurship, financial inclusion and improving living conditions for people at the bottom of the pyramid.\u201d \u201c Taysir has an innovative approach in the field of microfinance in Tunisia. Since its launch in June 2014, Taysir has offered its customers a new range of services: \u2022 mobile banking with \"mobile branches\", the \"mobile agent system\" and \"mobile banking\" for customers; \u2022 interest-free loans, which provide quasi-equity to our customers to supplement microcredit; \u2022 assistance ranging from financial education to the creation of micro- enterprises and technical support to small dairy farmers; \u2022 support for consolidation of sectors focusing on milk, waste recy- cling and crafts. Through these strategies Taysir is developing a new approach to inte- grated assisted microcredit.\" \u201c Taysir has a strong rural base and began by opening three branches in rural governorates \u2013 El Kef and Siliana, which are both less developed regions, and Cap Bon. A fourth branch was opened in a poorer district of Tunis, Cit\u00e9 Ibn Khaldoun. The strategy is to maintain a balance between rural regions in the centre of north-western Tunisia and poorer areas in the large conurbations. This strategy is designed to support the economic development of less developed regions.\" Pierre GACHES Director General Taysir Microfinance - Taysir Conseil ",

        "18 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 Deauville Partnership MENA Transition Fund The Deauville Partnership provides support for the political and economic transitions in Egypt, Tuni- sia, Morocco, Libya, Jordan and Yemen. Within the partnership, the MENA Transition Fund was created to provide countries with advisory services helping them to undertake the policy reforms needed to build more inclusive and transparent economies, boost trade and integration in the region and en- hance the environment for private sector growth. The Transition Fund received commitments of some USD 182 million. EIB-backed projects have gained significant support from both donors and recipient countries, reflecting the EIB\u2019s capacity to initiate and develop regional projects and regional integration as well as to mo- bilise co-financiers. The Deauville Partnership MENA Transition Fund grants for these projects are chan- nelled through the FTF (following revisions to the FTF Rules of Establishment and Administration) and allow support for innovative projects with a catalyt- ic impact that include strong ownership by the ben- eficiary countries, while also encouraging comple- mentarities with the Bank\u2019s projects. At end-2014, over EUR 21 million (USD 25.2 mil- lion) had thus been granted by the MENA Transi- tion Fund for four EIB-Ied technical advisory pro- grammes in the FEMIP region. 1. LOGISMED Soft (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia) helps to improve the organisation and performance of the logistic sector; 2. TRANSTRAC (Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia) contributes to reducing the trade and transport barriers along priority trade corridors to facilitate trade; 3. Jordan SME Growth Programme seeks to in- crease productivity and competitiveness by sup- porting innovative MSMEs; 4.

I was involved in several dossiers ranging from business support and innovation to energy and sustainable urban development, with a focus on the Mediterranean region. In particular, I worked on a study relating to the obstacles faced by micro, small and medium-sized enter- prises which was concluded by a high-level workshop held in Tunisia, to which I substantially contributed. My EIB experience enabled me to put my theoretical knowledge into practice and enhance my drafting, communication and organisational skills. Moreover, I learned many new methods which were previously unknown to me and I strongly believe that I brought added value to the projects and studies that I was involved in along every step of the way.

Secondees from the Mediterranean region The FEMIP secondment programme was set up for two years with a budget of EUR 150 000. It enables experienced civil servants from Mediterranean part- ner countries to join EIB teams in Luxembourg for up to two years. The Bank imposes no geographical or gender quotas, but aims to strike a balance in terms of the representation of secondees by the end of the pilot phase in 2016. Since the launch of the programme in 2013, the EIB has hosted two secondees \u2013 from Egypt and Pales- tine \u2013 who are working in the Operations Directorate as policy officers. The recruitment process for three additional secondees will be launched in 2015. Feed- back from the current secondees is positive. The secondees contribute their professional skills, as well as knowledge of their national environments, which is valuable for the Bank\u2019s operations in the Mediterranean partner countries. Upon return to their respective institutions, relationships between the home institutions and the EIB can be strengthened. These initial secondments have attracted the atten- tion of several partner country institutions and indi- viduals. This is likely to result in larger pools of appli- cants in the years ahead. EU secondees To strengthen EIB cooperation with EU develop- ment finance institutions and public banks, anoth- er initiative with EUR 300 000 of approved funding was established under the FEMIP Trust Fund to en- courage the exchange of staff with these European partners.

From September 2013 I had the chance to join the EIB secondment programme in the Trust Funds and Blending Division, dealing mainly with EU blending facili- ties and FTF-related issues. There is no need to say how fruitful this one-year experience was, by providing me with a deep insight into the EIB and EU activity in the Mediterranean region. Within a well-established partnership, my experience enabled the EIB and CDP to go even further by increasing their mutual knowledge and preparing the ground for new areas of cooperation both within Italy and in the Mediterranean region. Especially now that CDP finds itself in a period of major changes, being entitled by Italian law to act as the Italian DFI, the value of my experience is even more pro- nounced.

Public conference Tools for growth: driving investment in the Mediterranean region (Naples, 30 October 2014) In conjunction with the Italian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the 14th FEMIP Con- ference marked the launch of the 2014-2020 External Lending Mandate. Participants from Europe and the Mediterranean countries actively discussed new op- portunities for growth against a challenging political, social and economic backdrop in the Mediterranean countries. Providing an overview of the financial tools available to the Mediterranean countries, where both financing and technical expertise are needed to move forward with projects and investments, the confer- ence was split into four discussion-based sessions. This allowed delegates to interact with key figures to gain a better understanding of the opportunities for investment in the region. A high-level panel on strat- egy in the opening session was followed by three the- matic sessions addressing core development finance activities: lending, blending and advising. Each of these sessions focused on a particular sector \u2013 SMEs, energy and transport \u2013 in order to stimulate practical and operational discussions. Dissemination activities in 2014 ",

Expert workshops Based on the findings of two FTF studies, two expert workshops were organised during the year: Opportunities for mesofinance in Tunisia (Tunis, 4 March 2014) Mesofinance covers the segment of companies be- tween start-ups and larger SMEs, representing those medium-sized companies which experience the most difficulty in finding financing. The FTF study on the \u201cPotential of Mesofinance for Job Creation in Mediterranean Partner Countries\u201d was carried out by the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, based on a literature review, and ex- tensive surveys and consultations with small entre- preneurs, financial institutions, government officials, international donors and staff of supervisory institu- tions in Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia. It is available for download from the EIB website. Based on the findings of the study, the workshop in Tunis, hosted by EIB Vice-President de Fontaine Vive, brought together financial players to discuss new in- vestment mechanisms that could be put in place in the country to better meet the financial needs of these economically productive businesses. The con- clusions of the workshop could be used as a basis for pilot actions to test innovative approaches to en- hancing access to finance for SMEs across the Medi- terranean region. Maximising the employment impact of EIB infrastructure investments (Rabat, 13-14 November 2014) Job creation is a key factor of economic success and has long been one of the criteria in the Bank\u2019s assess- ment of investment projects. As one of the leading IFIs in the Mediterranean region, it seemed essen- tial to the EIB, after the Arab Spring, to look in more detail at the impact of the Bank\u2019s investment pro- jects on employment, in terms of both quantity and quality. The EIB therefore partnered with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to study ways to \u201cMaxim- ise the employment impact of the EIB\u2019s infrastructure projects\u201d, within the broader framework of the ILO\u2019s programme on employment-intensive investment. Based on analysis of selected EIB infrastructure in- vestments, particularly in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, the report will be published during 2015. The ILO team is supported by local consultants to carry out 11 case studies selected for analysis: \u2022 Jordan: Amman ring road; Tafila wind farm; \u2022 Morocco: Second National Programme of Rural Roads; Solar Energy in Ouarzazate; Sanitation in Ou- jda; Sanitation in Sebou Basin; \u2022 Tunisia: Urban Road Priority V; Power Station in Sousse; \u2022 Egypt: Giza North power plant; EPAP II; Egyptian power transmission project. The Rabat workshop was attended by representa- tives of all countries in the FTF study, to discuss the implications and next steps.

        "28 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 L o o k i n g a h e a d The EIB\u00b4s overall objectives and activities in the Southern Neighbourhood The Bank\u2019s activities in the Southern Neighbourhood aim at supporting the EU\u2019s European Neighbour- hood Policy in the Mediterranean region, through fi- nancing of investment projects that contribute to the achievement of EU policy objectives. The Bank\u2019s overall strategy in the Southern Neighbourhood will continue to be guided by the EU\u2019s priorities for the re- gion, the Bank\u2019s own risk facilities, the EIB Roadmap for the Mediterranean endorsed at the 13th FEMIP Ministerial Meeting in Athens on 1 April 2014, as well as by the priorities set in the EIB Corporate Operation- al Plan (COP) 2015-2017 and by the External Lending Mandate\u2019s objectives for the new planning period 2014-2020. The new External Lending Mandate (ELM) establishes three general objectives, in addition to the underly- ing aim of promoting regional integration: \u2022 supporting local private sector development \u2013 in particular SMEs; \u2022 developing social and economic infrastructure \u2013 in- cluding transport, energy, the environment, infor- mation and communication technology; \u2022 investing in climate change mitigation and adaptation. This new ELM enables the Bank to provide investment in the Mediterranean region of up to EUR 9.6 billion with a European Union guarantee, which is comple- mented by an envelope of EUR 3 billion in own risk re- sources for financing projects across Europe\u2019s South- ern and Eastern Neighbourhood over the period. The key operational priority in the Mediterranean region will be to maintain the Bank\u2019s role as one of the leading financiers in the region, with two core ar- eas of activity: infrastructure financing and support for the private sector. The Bank will continue to sup- port infrastructure projects in its traditional sectors of intervention: \u2022 energy \u2022 transport \u2022 water and sanitation \u2022 urban development \u2022 health and education.

        "29 2014 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report Looking ahead The FTF Strategy 2014-2020 scaling up the Fund\u2019s activities Investment needs across most countries in the Southern Neighbourhood are expected to be sub- stantial in the years ahead. Gross fixed capital forma- tion is forecast at approximately EUR 200 billion per annum for the region over 2014-18. EIB lending can only contribute to a small fraction of this total and therefore it is necessary for the Bank to focus on key priorities and bottlenecks that will maximise its im- pact and contribution to EU objectives. Assessment of the quality of existing infrastructure confirms very large investment needs across all sectors, in particu- lar in the energy, water, transport and SME sectors: \u2022 Infrastructure investments in the South have been insufficient in recent years, resulting in substan- tial infrastructure gaps and often deteriorating networks. Impact Investment Envelope To allow the EIB to undertake a wider range of private sector operations \u2013 involving higher levels of risk to potentially achieve greater development impact \u2013 FTF donors approved a new Impact Investment Envelope. This envelope enables the Bank to extend the range of instruments to finance entrepreneurial activities, and to consider private sector projects which could have an important developmental impact, but that the Bank, due to the risk profile, would not normally be able to undertake. Such an initiative positions the EIB as a pioneer in the impact investing spectrum and underpins the complementarity role of the Bank as a development-focused institution in the FEMIP region. These operations would typically not follow standard banking or commercial principles, and have similarities to certain grant programmes focused on social, environmental and development objectives (the \u201chigher risk \u2013 higher impact\u201d principle). The envelope targets direct and indirect equity or debt investments pursuing specific development, innovation or social objectives. Thereby, projects will primarily focus on financing of SMEs, cooperatives, microenterprises and the self-employed, and in sectors generating a high social or developmental impact, such as innovation, research and agriculture. A first investment from this new envelope \u2013 a EUR 1 million subordinated loan for TAYSIR Microfinance in Tunisia \u2013 was approved and signed in 2014. The project consists of a EUR-denominated subordinated loan for the benefit of a newly created Tunisian microfinance institution with a strong social mission. It is the EIB's first operation in Tunisia to support the creation of a new MFI, with a clear social impact mission targeting small farmers, women and young entrepreneurs. ",
        "30 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 \u2022 The potential for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in the Southern Neighbour- hood is substantial and could allow for meeting growing energy demand, while ensuring environ- mental sustainability. \u2022 Despite the banking sectors in the South being rela- tively large, access to finance remains challenging, particularly for SMEs. \u2022 The potential for the Bank\u2019s microfinance activities in the Southern Neighbourhood remains high. Cooperation between donors and banks by blending grant aid for investments and technical assistance (TA) with loans and risk capital has become increas- ingly important in development finance. It allows donors to leverage the impact of scarce grants, and banks to offer clients more sustainable forms of fi- nancing, thus facilitating the implementation of pro- jects with high economic rates of return, but which in the absence of affordable concessional financing, constrained by user fees and tariffs, might not be fi- nancially sustainable. Therefore, to offer products that meet the needs of emerging and developing country clients, close cooperation with the donor community to attract grant financing is essential to the Bank\u2019s business. To this end, the FEMIP Trust Fund has emerged as an important vehicle to complement the instruments that banks can fund out of their own resources. The FTF finances TA to support the Bank in project iden- tification, and clients in enhancing the quality of project preparation and strengthening capacity in project implementation. In some cases, when jus- tified on the grounds of achieving significant eco- nomic benefits, and when the risk profile of a trans- action does not meet the Bank\u2019s credit risk and policy guidelines, the FTF can, through its Impact Invest- ment Envelope, also finance risk capital to leverage further commercial funding. In April 2014, donors reviewed and approved a multi- annual FTF strategy. The FEMIP Trust Fund focuses specifically on four priorities for 2014-2020: 1. finance and MSMEs 2. infrastructure 3. environment 4. human capital and research, development and in- novation (RDI). The strategy widens the scope for risk capital opera- tions, including the new Impact Investment Envelope. The FTF Strategy 2014-2020 endorsed the creation of CAMENA (Climate Action in the Middle East and North Africa), a dedicated Climate Action Envelope, to support improved energy security, emission re- ductions and improved resilience to climate change ",
        "31 2014 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report Looking ahead CAMENA Climate Action Envelope Climate change will severely impact the Mediterranean region and the need for a broad approach to this problem is fully recognised. The initial funding for CAMENA is provided by the United King- dom\u2019s Department for International Development according to their decision made in late 2014 to make a significant contribution of EUR 19.2 million (GBP 15 million) to the FEMIP Trust Fund over the period 2015-2018. CAMENA would welcome further contributions from other donors. The first CAMENA-financed projects are expected to be approved in 2015. The envelope will seek to achieve a wide geographical and sec- tor spread, to support the mainstreaming of climate considerations across operations in the region. CAMENA can be used to: \u2022 identify, catalyse and prepare climate action investment projects, which could subsequently benefit from EIB financing; \u2022 fund actions to improve the enabling environment in relation to climate investments among public and private institutions within the Mediterranean partner countries; \u2022 finance equity operations. Expected results: - broad integration of climate mitigation and adaptation consid- erations in project design; - improved national enabling environments for climate investment; - development of a strong pipeline of feasible climate action invest- ments; - reduction of greenhouse gas emissions across the Mediterranean region. through the identification and development of new climate action projects. As lending activities in the region continue to in- crease and, with a growing project pipeline, demand for FTF resources is growing, the Bank anticipates that the funds currently available in the FTF will be fully allocated by the end of 2015 . During 2015, therefore, in cooperation with donors the Bank will endeavour to raise EUR 35 million to cover project needs during the period 2015-2020 . ",

Many IFIs and donors have started/increased their activities in the Medi- terranean partner countries. Against this backdrop, it was essential also for the FTF to increase its vis- ibility in the region. To this end, the Assembly of Donors of the FEMIP Trust Fund approved the financing of Support for the dissemination of the FEMIP Trust Fund-funded activities in the FEMIP region by written procedure in February 2013. More specifically, EUR 35 000 was earmarked under the FTF Dissemination Window Budget to support increased communication work through dissemination of FTF-related activities, including studies, reports, conferences, workshops and other relevant undertakings in the FEMIP region. Objectives and Results The consultancy assignment pursued the overall objective of supporting the dissemination of infor- mation on FTF activities in the areas of public-pri- vate partnerships, microfinance support, renewable energy manufacturing, energy efficiency and pri- vate sector development in the EU and, in particu- lar, in the Mediterranean partner countries. The specific objectives of this assignment were to: - support the dissemination of FTF activities during regional FEMIP events; - enhance the quality of FTF activities by increasing monitoring actions; - enhance the quality of FEMIP and FTF-related events. The main activities carried out concerned support for the following: - Organisation of the 13th FEMIP Conference: \"Ener- gy efficiency in the Mediterranean region\" (10 De- cember, Brussels). Organised in collaboration with the Observatoire M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en de l\u2019Energie and the Union for the Mediterranean, the 13th edition of the FEMIP Conferences brought together 250 participants from Europe and the Mediterranean countries to discuss actively how energy efficien- cy can improve the countries\u2019 overall competitive position and create employment opportunities, based on an FTF-financed study on supporting Energy Efficiency in the Mediterranean; - Organisation of the workshops, seminars and fo- rum conferences, which took place in the context of the FTF studies/initiatives during September 2013/September 2014, in particular the workshop on \u201cDeveloping the next generation Regional Mar- ketplace for SMEs and Family-Owned Enterprises ",

Alongside the above-mentioned objectives, the im- plementation of the TA assignment activities con- tributed to achieving the below outputs: - FTF activities are more visible within the EU and in particular in the Mediterranean partner coun- tries, with a focus on disseminating the results of the FTF studies in the FEMIP region to the relevant stakeholders; - The quality of Deauville Partnership FTF activities is enhanced via improved monitoring; - The number and quality of external participants at EIB FEMIP events is enhanced thanks to the updat- ed and consolidated FTF database. Conclusions Overall, the TA assignment contributed to ensuring a systematic dissemination of FTF-related activities in the FEMIP region, at a time when the FTF was deploying an important level of new activity related to the projects supported under the Deauville Partnership MENA Transition Fund. The follow-up on some FTF studies contributed to the launch of new initiatives related to these stud- ies, thereby providing new opportunities for the EIB to finance projects in the FEMIP region, such as the study on energy efficiency which has led to a business development initiative carried out in Tunisia de- signed to identify a potential pipeline of projects to be financed by the EIB.

        "38 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 Energy efficiency and renewable en- ergy project preparation programme in urban areas of the Mediterranean partner countries (Med-ELENA Study) Country: Regional Beneficiary: Mediterranean partner countries (MPCs) 6 Sector: Energy Consultant: Consortium LAVOLA 1981, SA/Albea Transenergy, led by LAVOLA Approved Amount: Up to EUR 200 000 Signed Amount: EUR 167 265 Tender Procedure: Competitive negotiated Duration: 24 months Implementation Period: 07.03.2012 - 10.02.2014 Context In 2011, the FTF Assembly of Donors approved the financing of this operation to examine the ap- propriate support mechanisms that would ena- ble cities in the MPCs to develop bankable invest- ment programmes to improve energy efficiency (EE) and small-scale renewable energy (RE) usage in urban environments. In line with the European Commission\u2019s efforts to encourage MPCs to imple- ment greenhouse gas emission reductions in line with the EU \u201c20-20-20\u201d objectives, this operation reviewed EE and RE projects under preparation in cities of the MPCs in order to pre-identify which technical assistance and financial schemes would be needed to accelerate their future implemen- tation. An option was to examine an extension to the European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) pro- gramme, and the potential for the creation of a new Med-ELENA dedicated facility. The assignment aimed at assessing the broader in- vestment potential in the EE and RE field, the de- tailed needs in terms of technical assistance and funding support which could justify the creation of a Med-ELENA facility. The geographical frame for the study included all eligible FEMIP countries. Objectives and Results This study falls under the \u201cEnergy\u201d FTF priority includ- ing renewable energy development in the MPCs with an overall objective to pave the way for faster and better implementation of EE and small-scale RE pro- jects, thereby contributing to long-term sustainable development in the region through energy self-suffi- ciency and commercialisation of the energy surplus. The overall implementation consisted of the follow- ing phases: - Phase I \u2013 Scoping: taking stock of the sector, screening a preliminary pipeline of projects, rank- ing a selection of projects, and identifying three pilot projects (two in Morocco, one in Palestine); - Phase II \u2013 Detailed analysis of pilot projects: an- alysing the needs of the three pilot projects, with a focus on TA requirements and financing; - Phase III \u2013 Synthesis: combining the work of the two previous phases in order to recommend the first steps of the design of an appropriate re- sponse to the identified needs. The investment potential in EE and RE in the MPCs was determined by two methods: - (1) A top-down approach , analysing country mar- ket potential studies carried out for the EIB and oth- er IFIs and extrapolating the potential to all MPCs; - (2) A bottom-up approach , by evaluating the po- tential of identified and eligible existing projects. Alongside this methodology, the study found an estimated EUR 16.7 billion of market potential for projects in urban areas of the MPCs by 2030 (not in- cluding the estimated TA necessary for sustainable viable projects). This potential was approximately equally split between EE and small-scale RE pro- jects. More specifically, the following sectors were found to offer the largest potential for investments in urban EE and small-scale RE: - EE in new and existing buildings (insulation, ener- gy efficient design, EE appliances, etc.); 6 The MPCs are Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia. Syria was not covered by the assignment as the EIB suspended all loan disbursements and technical advisory contracts for projects in Syria follow- ing EU sanctions in November 2011. The country could nonetheless be covered by a Med-ELENA facility after EU sanctions are lifted. ",
        "39 2014 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report Annexes - EE and RE in local infrastructure (including street and traffic lighting, district heating & cooling sys- tems, and possibly water systems); - RE integration in buildings (solar water heaters, photovoltaic installations, etc.); - Improving EE and integrating RE in urban mobility and transport. Despite the large potential for investments in urban EE and small-scale RE projects, only a limited num- ber of projects are currently reaching the imple- mentation stage. To understand better the reasons for this low uptake of projects, the study analysed three mature pilot projects , selected through project screening and analysis: - (1) the new town of Chrafate in Morocco (with EUR 16.5 million in total investment costs, EUR 0.701 million in TA costs and an estimated lev- erage factor of 24); - (2) implementation of the Energy Efficiency Plan for Public Lighting in Agadir in Morocco (with EUR 10.5 million in total investment costs, EUR 0.452 million in TA costs and an estimated lev- erage factor of 22); - (3) implementing solar water heating for hot water and boiler preheating in hospitals in Pal- estine with EUR 5 million in total investment costs, EUR 0.25 million in TA costs and an estimated lev- erage factor of 20. The most common barriers identified were: - Limited information/lack of technical capac- ity : technical barriers (limited awareness of pos- sibilities in the sector and insufficiently qualified capacity; the absence of local expertise in man- ufacturing and installing EE and small-scale RE equipment; limited expertise in project planning and implementation of complex projects); - Limited borrowing capacity or budgetary au- tonomy for local authorities: capital-intensive projects face difficulties where public sector pro- moters have limited access to capital; when inter- national finance is considered, promoters can be wary of foreign exchange risks; - Low perceived financial profitability of projects: resulting from split or competing incentives, for instance where construction firms do not them- selves benefit from the savings in efficient pro- jects; low energy prices in the various countries also limit the incentive to take action. The study outlined that a Med-ELENA facility could indeed serve to address these barriers and unlock significant EE and small-scale RE investments. It was concluded that such a technical assistance and funding facility put in place by the EIB in collabora- tion with national authorities and potentially with other participating IFIs should support all stages of the projects, from identification through to imple- mentation, including: - technical (energy audits; feasibility studies; technical guides or other technical advice to promoters); - management (support for project implementa- tion units; provision of procedures to follow up works and commissioning); - financial (support to prepare business plans; pric- ing analysis; recommendations on fund-raising options); - legal (analysing the relevant legal frameworks for proposed projects; providing support with con- tractual aspects); - structuring (analysing PPP implementation strat- egies, pay-as-you-save methodologies or others). The consultants found that the facility also should comprise loans and possibly grants for projects. ",

In April 2009 the FTF Donors approved the financing of a feasibility study to identify the optimal operational structure of the MDBI, includ- ing its co-ownership requirement, as well as ana- lysing the human and financial resources required for its viable and efficient functioning. The results of the study were presented to the 10th FEMIP Ministerial Meeting on 18 May 2010 and Ministers \"agreed to discuss options for the implementation of the MBDI based on the outcome of the feasibil- ity study that has been financed through the FTF\". MBDI received a clear leadership revamp by the Mi- lan Chamber of Commerce and Promos, under the aegis of the Italian government. In November 2010 Promos launched the preparation of a detailed fea- sibility study on the initiative. The study recommended setting up the \u201cEuro- Mediterranean Development Centre (EMDC)\u201d for MSMEs of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) countries. The EMDC is an \u201cumbrella instrument\u201d which pulls together existing financial and techni- cal assistance expertise from bilateral, multilateral and local financial institutions. It ensures that at least part of the available EU resources for MSMEs targets agreed priorities co-determined with the MPCs. Conclusions The main conclusion of the study assessment is that the investment potential and the identified needs justify the creation of Med-ELENA, a facility designed to finance technical assistance and pro- vide funding for eligible projects . In particular, the Med-ELENA facility should include active project identification and selection in addition to TA encompassing all phases of the project, from design to final commissioning. The catalytic impact of the TA provided could be enhanced with the associated adapted financing, possibly including investment grants. The EIB, or other participating IFIs, may then provide loans to bankable and technically sound projects. A well-designed Med-ELENA programme would com- plement other existing initiatives supporting the development of more sustainable energy systems in the MPCs. Financed within the strategic framework of the FTF, this operation has enabled the EIB to assess invest- ment potential and to identify needs for EE and small-scale RE investment in urban areas of the MPCs. As a result, the Bank is now proceeding with an analysis of the detailed structure for a first such Med- ELENA facility, looking into Tunisia as a pilot country, which could then be expanded into a FEMIP- wide regional model and/or instrument . The Final Report and Executive Summary of the \u201cMed-ELENA study\u201d were published on the EIB\u2019s website on 26 March 2014 and are available at: http://www.eib.org/infocentre/publications/all/femip-study-elena.htm ",

These actions took the form of programmes of profes- sional meetings with Italian partners at business fairs organised by the CEPEX office in Milan and concerned the agricultural and agri-food sector and the mechani- cal and electrical industry. The Foundation thus made efforts to find potential Italian partners and launched promotional campaigns to encourage them to meet Tunisian businesses participating in CEPEX's action programme.

A key suc- cess factor for the Initiative, the pre-start-up phase aims to achieve fine-tuning and consensus on the ini- tiative through formal agreements with institutions and partners and to elaborate an executive plan. Objectives and Results To determine the cooperation and contribution with the Milan Chamber of Commerce-Promos on this pro- ject, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in Milan on 27 June 2011 with the aim of iden- tifying partners and resources for the implementation of a \u2018Pre-Start-up Phase\u2019 of the EMDC Initiative. A Con- tribution Agreement (CA) was signed in May 2012 in order to fund activities aimed at achieving the objec- tives of the MoU, along three main lines of action and related outputs: (i) executive designing through pre- feasibility studies and assessments; (ii) stakeholders\u2019 consensus building through bilateral and multilater- al dialogue, promotion and networking; and (iii) gov- ernance and monitoring of the Initiative. In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, a prolonged political transition, in particular in Egypt and Tunisia, led to some implementation obstacles. To adapt to the challenging environment, it was agreed to allow for the funding \u2013 under remain- ing resources from the CA envelope and beyond the original time boundaries of the Pre-Start-Up Phase \u2013 of some crucial initiatives that would oth- erwise have been implemented within the previous period. Under the CA, three consultancy contracts have been signed to conduct feasibility studies and as- sessments, including: 1. Concept and Executive Plan of the EMDC Initiative; 2. Business Plans for the establishment of EMDC Country Centres in Morocco and Tunisia; Analysis and elaboration of a Legal Framework for the EMDC Initiative.

During the pre-start-up phase, dialogue 7 on a bi- lateral level with relevant MSMEs, national agen- cies and institutions resulted in the creation of a network of EMDC\u2019s partners comprising 28 partner agencies from 13 countries. Dialogue on a multilateral level aimed to pursue and further partnership with key bodies 8 as a basis for gaining institutional endorsement, thus further- ing the EMDC\u2019s legitimacy and positioning, as well as to achieve coherence with the broader regional scale. This entailed multiple joint activities; institu- tional missions, ad-hoc meetings, and the organisa- tion and/or participation in conferences and work- shops with the EIB, EU and the UfM 9 . Moreover, a number of events for communication and promotion, networking and institutional ca- pacity building were organised and co-funded with FTF support under the Contribution Agreement, including: - a press conference and launch event (Milan, June 2011, October 2013); - a dedicated session in the framework of the Third Economic and Financial Forum for the Mediterra- nean (Milan, November 2012); - an EMDC Networking and Partnership Event (Mi- lan, December 2013); and - a Study Tour in Italy (Milan, Naples, Caserta, June 2014) for EMDC partner agencies and institutions from four Mediterranean countries. The results of the EMDC pre start-up phase were presented to the FEMIP donors at the Assembly of Donors\u2019 meeting on 15 December 2014. The FEM- IP Trust Fund may contribute further to EMDC\u2019s operations. 7 Twenty institutional missions and meetings were carried out in nine countries, including Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Lebanon. Additional missions \u2013 as part of a continued and sustained activity of dialogue and partnership building aiming at the expansion and consolidation of the EMDC Network \u2013 were carried out using EMDC own resources. 8 IFIs, EC institutions, intergovernmental organisations, regional initiatives and programmes 9 For example with the EIB: participation in the 12th Meeting of the FEMIP Committee, Luxembourg, May 2011; the 10th FEMIP Conference, Tunis, March 2012; and the FEMIP Trust Fund Assembly of Donors, Luxembourg, June 2012. With the EU: involvement in three workshops for Euro-Mediterranean Industrial Dialogue, Milan, October 2011, December 2011, March 2012. And with the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM): participation in regional programmes like EUROMED Invest, managed by the Med Alliance Consortium \u201cWithin the framework of a Memorandum of Understanding and Contribution Agreement signed between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Milan Chamber of Commerce in 2011 and 2012, EIB resources financed through the FEMIP Trust Fund (FTF) have made a crucial contribution to the implementation of a prepara- tory phase \u2013 \u2018Pre-Start-up Phase\u2019 - to launch the EMDC Initiative. The FTF funding contributed to defining EMDC\u2019s concept and mis- sion, positioning, institutional and legal structure, operating meth- ods, thereby laying grounds for the successful establishment of the EMDC as a fully fledged, coherent and sustainable entity for the pro- motion of economic development and cooperation within the Euro- Mediterranean area. EMDC is today in its second year of life and we believe we have estab- lished the basis for implementing successfully our mandate both in support of our Partner Agencies dealing with the internationalisa- tion of SMEs and of enterprises willing to grow. We are aware of the obstacles to overcome but, given the relevance of the SME sector in the Northern and Southern Mediterranean Countries, we are confident that all relevant players in the coun- tries involved will deploy the maximum effort to achieve our com- mon objectives. Milan and the Lombardy Region stand ready to lend their support.\u201d (Photo: Ambassador Giancarlo ARAGONA, EMDC Presentation, Tunis, 15 May) Ambassador Giancarlo ARAGONA, President of Euro-Mediterranean Development Centre for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (EMDC) Foundation ",

        "44 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 Study on enabling SME access to growth capital markets via dedicated SME exchange markets (SMEx initiative) Country: Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Palestine Beneficiary: Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia (together the priority countries), Egypt and Palestine Sector: Finance Consultant: Individual Experts Approved Amount: EUR 25 000 from FTF (Total of EUR 50 000 with EUR 25 000 provided by EIB) Signed Amount: EUR 49 900 Tender Procedure: Competitive negotiated Duration: 6 months Implementation Period: 03.09.2013 - 10.02.2014 Context In August 2013, the FTF Assembly of Donors ap- proved by means of written procedure the EUR 25 000 envelope to support SME access to growth capital markets via dedicated SME ex- change markets, which would catalyse technical assistance or risk capital resources, possibly via the Deauville Transition Fund. The significant role which SMEs can play to further accelerate economic growth and job creation in the MPCs depends to a large extent on their ability to grow, for which access to stable and long-term fi- nancing is considered a critical success factor. To- day, a significant SME funding gap exists and access to finance, in particular access to growth capital, re- mains a fundamental concern for both SME busi- ness owners and SME policy makers across the re- gion. Growth capital is usually provided from four different sources: friends, families, venture capital- ists, over-the-counter equity markets and banks. An alternative source of growth capital for SMEs, and one that is gaining increasing attention inter- nationally, is the SME-focused second-tier stock ex- change. The harmonisation of national platforms, to create a regional market, is considered to be cru- cial to increase the liquidity of SME stock exchang- es in MENA. The establishment of liquid, SME-fo- cused second-tier stock exchange markets would underpin national and regional SME development programmes aimed at improving SME access to fi- nance. The establishment of successful second-tier stock exchanges in the region is also considered fundamental for the balanced development of cap- ital markets and would complement the nascent private equity sector, providing a viable exit strat- egy for venture capitalists and private equity funds. Furthermore, second-tier exchange markets would provide a nursing ground for small high-growth companies, which could in time move on to the main stock exchange markets. With this background and considering the Bank\u2019s experience in supporting the financial sector in the MPCs, following the various operational visits in the region and cooperation established with the Dubai International Financial Centre Authority (\u201cDIFCA\u201d) and the Abraaj Capital group, it became clear that the countries\u2019 administrations as well as the inter- national financiers acknowledged the need for setting up such a trading platform for the region\u2019s companies. Within the FTF framework, the TA op- eration was approved for a study to be carried out, with a particular focus on providing clear recom- mendations and a common way forward for MPCs considering setting up SME-focused second-tier stock exchanges. Objectives and Results SMEs account for 45% of formal national employ- ment in the MPCs but are largely dependent upon bank or family funding, with SME market capitalisa- tion accounting for only 1.3% of GDP. With an over- all objective of SME development as a critical suc- cess factor for national economic development, increased tax revenues, employment growth and social stability, the study outlined that MPCs\u2019 ex- changes need to become a more important source of funding for SMEs in order to drive down the local cost of capital that can best be achieved through cooperation between the MPC regulators/exchang- es to deliver a specific targeted programme aimed at SMEs. This cooperation will lead to standardisation, con- vergence and development of the SME market- places to standardise and develop the (laws), regulations, rules and operations around a new mu- ",
        "45 2014 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report Annexes tually agreed common standard that is focused on fostering the development of SME marketplaces. The standardisation will enhance and not threaten existing exchanges, thereby leveraging an existing base of over 200 SMEs across the region, improv- ing the existing exchange brands, enabling these marketplaces to become better drivers of economic development. This approach will drive economies of scale into the markets and increase SME choice. To be effective, the proposed developments will go beyond standardisation of the capital market value chain, the process will supplement the markets with additional regulatory, stakeholder and opera- tional models (domestic and cross-border) as well as promoting advocacy of tax/legal and incentive changes to national Governments. Furthermore, the proposals will encourage new infrastructures to be established to improve the visibility and ef- ficiency of these markets. The programme will also include a regional SME Information Advisory Portal, MPC SME Index and company research to improve SME visibility and a locally sensitive NOMAD mod- el and inter-market linkages for trading and settle- ment to improve SME liquidity. The study suggested that the analysis and im- plementation of the above proposal should be designed and implemented by an independent ",
        "46 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 secretariat , supported by Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs), being part-time resources from the MPC regulator/exchanges. The secretariat would agree the resourcing, detailed objectives, modus oper- andi and deliverables with the MPCs by signing an MoU with the MPCs\u2019 regulators and exchanges. Within an agreed plan, the secretariat would meet with the TAGs monthly and provide periodic up- dates to national Ministers of Finance and Central Banks to increase the visibility and importance. The agreed models would be implemented nationally by the regulators/exchanges and would be scalable to other countries if other entrants were approved by the existing MPCs and the new entrant agreed to sign the MoU with all of its attendant responsi- bilities and obligations. Thereby, the region will be visible and accessible as a single standardised unit giving it more critical mass to attract international capital. Advisory support from the regulators, ex- changes, NOMADs, auditors and other stakeholders will remain local in proximity with the issuers. Conclusions Financed within the FTF framework, this TA enabled the EIB to consider a way forward for MPCs for set- ting up SME-focused second-tier stock exchanges. The initial results of the study were discussed at the Marseille workshop \"Developing the next generation Regional Marketplace for SMEs and Family-Owned Enterprises\" held on 8 November 2013 and sponsored by the EIB in conjunction with the Chambre de Commerce et d\u2019Industrie Marseille-Provence (CCIMP) with the support of the Association of the Medi- terranean Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ASCAME) and Finances & Conseil M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e (FCM) as part of the Mediterranean Economic Week. The results of these discussions were included in the final report. The concept was welcomed by the Deauville Partnership and the main conclusions of the study were made available to the EBRD in a spirit of partnership and will be used as a building block for the joint technical assistance operation. Further to this, the overall discussion on the setting up of SME-focused second-tier stock exchange will be continued with the EBRD, other IFIs and relevant stakeholders in 2015. Meanwhile, together with the EBRD, the EIB will take forward the work on two more focused stud- ies of the SME sector in Morocco and Egypt in order to establish a clear understanding of the funding al- ternatives available to SMEs and find out how IFIs can make a meaningful contribution to improve SMEs\u2019 access to finance in the region. To communicate the final conclusions of the study and further build upon the main results, EUR 35 000 was earmarked additionally and will be covered by the FEMIP Trust Fund Dissemination\u2019s SMEx envelope approved by the Fund Donors on 2 April 2014. Along with MPC stakeholders\u2019 commitment, the in- volvement of the EIB and other Donors is of great importance as they carry significant weight local- ly and in particular with governments. The study also highlighted the importance of government involvement to make SMEs an integral part of na- tional policy, delivering incentives (tax/subsidies) and other pro-SME policies into national legisla- tion. More active involvement will shift the bal- ance away from the informal economy in favour of transparent formal markets, which is essential to foster higher employment for current and future generations. With regard to Nexpand, entering as a licensed ex- change in all of the MPCs appeared possible in some but not all markets under current legal and regulatory frameworks. In its current form, the Nex- pand model was outlined as too embryonic and high risk as it was not well ahead in the delivery phases. ",
        "47 2014 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report Annexes Potential of mesofinance for job creation in Mediterranean partner countries Country: Regional Beneficiary: Mediterranean partner countries (MPCs) Sector: Finance and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) Consultant: Frankfurt School of Economics and Finance Approved Amount: Up to EUR 235 000 (TA operation: EUR 200 000; Conference: EUR 35 000) Signed Amount: EUR 189 000 Tender Procedure: Competitive negotiated Duration: 29 months Implementation Period: 11.12.2012 - 14.05.2014 Context The rapid growth of the microfinance industry in MPCs reflects the widespread belief among prac- titioners and stakeholders that entrepreneurial ac- tivity can flourish even in the poorest communities, and that access to financial services can enable cli- ents to raise their standard of living and increase the well-being of the local community. To spur job creation in the Mediterranean region, in particular for SMEs, the potential of microfinance also needs to be stepped up. To analyse the impact of microfi- nance in the MPCs and prepare a discussion paper, the study on \u201cA Review of the Economic and Social Impact of Microfinance\u201d was supported by the FEM- IP Trust Fund Donors in November 2007 in line with the Fund\u2019s objectives to share and increase under- standing of the economic and financial issues asso- ciated with the development of the partner coun- tries, and was presented at the FEMIP conference on \u201cMicrofinance in the Mediterranean: what im- pact?\u201d in Tunis in May 2008. In this context, a TA operation to conduct a study on the \u201cPotential of Mesofinance for job creation in MPCs\u201d was approved by FTF Donors in March 2011. The new study aimed to provide immediate actions regarding \u201cMesofinance\u201d (credit and guarantees in amounts higher than what microfinance can offer, but still too small for the traditional banking sec- tor). Mesofinance has the potential to fill the financ- ing gap for growing SMEs, also called the 'missing middle', which can use neither microcredit nor tra- ditional bank loans. Objectives and Results This study is in line with the FTF objective to sup- port innovative studies on topics that foster private sector development in the FEMIP region. The im- plementation of the study was conducted by Frank- furt School of Finance & Management in 2013 and 2014 and was based on a literature review, surveys of small entrepreneurs and consultations with gov- ernment officials, staff of supervisory institutions, international donors as well as financial institutions in Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia. The study provided insight into the need for and potential of mesofinance in FEMIP countries: Mesofinance in the FEMIP region: The number of enterprises in the MENA region is generally lower than in other emerging economies and is skewed towards nascent and mature firms. SMEs in the MPCs constitute over 85% of all registered com- panies (over 2/3 of total formal employment) and a significant share of GDP (approximately 60%). The majority of SMEs are still informal and largely opaque. In the MENA region 63% of small firms do not have access to formal finance. Only 8% of to- tal bank lending in the MENA region goes to SMEs, which rely on internal and self-generated funds. Mesofinance in the context of the financial sec- tors of MPCs: State banks play an important role in SME lending and private banks are reluctant to engage in this sector. As a result SME lending rep- resents only 13% on average of total bank lend- ing to the private sector in the MENA region. The causes are various: (1) banks do not have risk as- sessment tools tailored to the SME sector\u2019s specif- icities; (2) volatile economic environment; (3) un- developed financial infrastructure; (4) the nascent development stage of credit bureaus with the le- gal system not providing adequate protection for the rights of creditors; (5) significant problems in the registration, enforcement and selling of collat- eral. The survey by the Frankfurt School showed that banks started to recognise the potential profitability of the SME segment. MFIs in the MPCs ",
        "48 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report 2014 cannot take deposits from the public which affects portfolio growth, composition and product inno- vation. Few MFIs have found ways to tap into the SME market. Equity finance is largely tailored to large firms and high-tech start-ups, not to the bulk of SMEs. Alongside the above findings, the study provided concrete recommendations directed at: Governments 1. Building reliable data sources for the SME sec- tor and mesofinance; 2. Amending current legal and fiscal framework to work in support of SME and SME finance; 3. Formalising the SME sector; 4. Creating government intervention synergies and a coherent policy vis-\u00e0-vis the SME sector; 5. Special support to innovative SMEs and small businesses with potentially high production ef- ficiency levels; 6. Establishing single-window contact points; 7. Strengthening the financial infrastructure; 8. Credit guarantee schemes; 9. Supporting financial sector reform pro- grammes in MENA countries: (i) Removal of restrictive entrance barriers for foreign banks, (ii) Repositioning or reform of government banks, (iii) Support and encouragement for the venture capital sector, (iv) Introduction of mezzanine financing, (v) Support of \u201cBusiness angels\u201d; 10. Strengthening bank supervision. ",
        "49 2014 FEMIP Trust Fund \u2013 Annual Report Annexes International financial institutions (IFIs) 1. Advise on an improved design of credit guaran- tee scheme; 2. Study the justification for a refinancing window/ debt financing and fund such a facility, conduct or assign a rating exercise on the individual banks to assess which banks would meet the eligibil- ity criteria for debt financing, agree on the insti- tutional setting and details of the debt financing and open the facility to participating banks while monitoring performance; 3. Offer (equity) investments in financial institu- tions that have a genuine interest in mesofi- nance or in equity funds for SMEs with a special focus on underserved segments, such as women entrepreneurs, innovative small businesses or enterprises with potentially high production ef- ficiency levels; 4. Offer (equity) investments in and/or strengthen lease facilities and innovative financing schemes such as venture capital, mezzanine finance; Conclusions The study highlighted concrete recommendations for governments, financial institutions, small busi- nesses and IFIs and may serve as a basis for pilot actions to test innovative approaches in enhancing access to finance for SMEs in the MPCs. The conclusions of the study were discussed at a technical workshop \u201cThe Potential of Mesofinance for Job Creation in the MPCs\u201d, held in Tunis on 4 March 2014. Hosted by EIB Vice-President de Fontaine Vive, the workshop brought together financial players to discuss new investment methods that could be put in place in the country to better meet the financial needs of these economically productive businesses. Following on the recommendations, the Bank is looking into the possibility of creating a \u201cMissing Mid- dle Fund\u201d . More importantly, the recommendations of the study have been partially implemented with the creation of an \u201cImpact Investment Envelope\u201d under the FTF enabling the EIB to increase its support to MSMEs through risk capital operations. Endorsed by the Donors on 2 April 2014, the Envelope targets investments in fund structures, microfinance institutions, or other entities pursuing specific economic, in- novation, social and environmental objectives without aiming for and maximising financial returns. For more details, please see the Final Report of the study published on 26 March 2014 on the EIB\u2019s web- site: http://www.eib.org/infocentre/publications/all/femip-study-the-potential-of-mesofinance-for-job- creation.htm 5. Support initiatives for a reliable SME sector and mesofinance database, and the use of this da- tabase for the formulation of a coherent SME policy; 6. Support the development of secured transac- tions, legal and regulatory framework; 7. Assist in strengthening of the financial infrastruc- ture (credit bureaus, collateral registries), develop credit reporting infrastructure based on country needs; 8. Sensitise and raise awareness of SME banking op- portunity with the Board and top management of commercial banks; 9. Raise awareness on best practices in SME finance; 10. Build capacity within financial institutions on strategy, market segmentation, design of al- ternative securities, appraisal techniques, new SME finance services and monitoring/risk. ",
