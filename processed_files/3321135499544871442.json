        "ISSN 1022-6559 3 November 1997 The contents of this bulletin are based on RTD-News, updated every day, and other CORDIS databases THE FUTURE OF NUCLEAR FUSION RESEARCH IN EUROPE Commission presents options for fusion research The European Commission has prepared a paper outlining imaginable scenarios for the future of European research into the development of nuclear fusion as an energy source. The paper, produced as a contribution to the debate on the Fifth RTD Framework Programme, was reciuested by the Council in May 1997. It outlines six scenarios, with estimated costs, ranging from stopping research at European level, through continuing at the current level, to stepping up efforts in Europe independently of Japan, Russia and the USA. The harnessing of fusion holds out the promise of potentially safe and clean energy, with virtually inexhaustible fuel resources. However, as a commercial power source fusion energy is still decades away, and therefore the bulk of the costs of its develop\u00ad ment must be borne by public authorities. Currently, the Community's Fusion programme brings together all fusion research in the EU and Switzerland, with the long\u00adterm goal of \"the joint construction of prototype reactors\". European expenditure on fusion research amounts to almost ECU 500 million per year during the Fourth Framework Programme (1994\u00ad1998), of which the Community budget accounts for about 40%. Current efforts, in particular the Joint European Torus (JET) and similar facilities in Japan and the USA have been focused on developing the basis for designing and operating a full\u00adscale experimental reactor (the \"Next Step\"). Research at this level has shown Europe to be a leader in fusion research worldwide, and demonstrated the high level of know\u00adhow of European scientists. The EU, along with the USA, Japan, and Russia, is contributing to the design of the \"Next Step\", the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER) which is designed to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion power pro\u00ad duction, as well as its safety and environmental potential. Following the success of this, a demonstration reactor would be constructed, capable of producing significant quantities of electric power. As far as the construction of ITER is concerned, decisions from the various partners are not expected before the turn of the century. Six imaginable scenarios The six imaginable scenarios outlined by the Commission, with the estimated Community funding required for the Fifth Frame\u00ad work Programme period (1999\u00ad2002), are as follows: \u25a0 Close down Community fusion research altogether; In this scenario, fusion research worldwide would be slowed down, and in the event that countries outside Europe continued and succeeded, Europe would lose the future market. Even in this scenario, fusion would still require some ECU 40 million to ECU.150 million from the Community budget during the Fifth Framework Programme, depending on how quickly European research is halted; \u25a0 Seience\u00addrivcn/watching brief: Here joint basic research would be continued, hut without the overall goal of building a prototype reactor. This could be combined with a \"watching brief\" on fusion development elsewhere, provided that an experimental reactor was constructed. Having no focus, this scenario would rapidly reduce European influence and know\u00adhow almost as much as the previous scenario, although the Commission estimates the need for Community funding at FA .'( T 750 million for the Fifth Framework Programme period; \u25a0 Extending the current Engineering Design Activities for ITER: Under this scenario, the ongoing activities in preparation for the construction of ITER which are scheduled to be completed in July 199S would be extended, with no decision taken on the construction of ITER until late in the Fifth Framework Programme. This scenario would, of course, have to he agreed with the other partners in ITER, but would basically involve continuing existing activities at a similar cost, around ECU 900 million for the period 1999\u00ad2002; \u25a0 Starting the construction phase of ITER outside the EU: Ifall the parties commit themselves to participation in ITER, final preparations would be started in 1998, and actual construction in 2002. To maintain sufficient influence, the Community share would have to be at least 20%. Costs to the Community budget would be minimized, totalling around ECU 925 million for Fl'5. For the period after 2002, Community funding for fusion would be around ECU 250 million to ECU 275 million per year. Constructing ITER outside the EU would, however, mean that the benefits accruing to Europe would be lessened; (Continued on page 2) PUBLISHED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION INNOVATION PROGRAMME ",

Europe would perhaps have to bear around 60% of the costs with the host Member State contributing almost half of this amount. Under this assumption, Community funding would amount to some ECU 975 million during FP5, and, beyond 2002 would be in the region of ECU 325 million to ECU 3 75 million per year, m Constructing an ITER\u00adlike reactor independently in Europe: If Europe proceeds alone, the benefits, in terms of intellectual property protection and market potential, would be maximized, while the operation and management of the project would be simplified. The costs would inevitably be higher for Europe, with the Community budget perhaps support\u00ad ing some 66% of the costs. The host state would have to fund a further 25% of the costs, with the remaining costs coming from other sources. On the basis of these assumptions. Community funding would total some ECU 1,100 million over FP5, and would then be around ECU 550 million to ECU 600 million in the years after 2002. The Community strategy cannot be decided in isolation, since decisions on ITER depend on all the partners. The Commission suggests, bearing in mind the potential benefits and the 30 years of work already undertaken, that Europe must maintain the integrated nature and the reactor orientation of the Community effort in fusion R&D, therefore ruling out the first two scenarios. Equally, for the time being, the Commission rules out the final scenario, given the expense of this option and the benefits of global partnership. Whilst considering the construction of ITER to be the best option, the Commission is of the opinion that moving to construction now would be premature, whether in the EU or out\u00ad side. It therefore favours scenario 3, effectively continuing present levels of effort during a three\u00adyear period of active preparations before taking a decision on the construction of the Next Step, preferably within the ITER framework, towards the end of the Fifth Frame\u00ad work Programme.

Speaking at the Fourth World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems (Berlin, 21 Octo\u00ad ber 1997), Mr. Neil Kinnock, Commissioner responsible for transport policy, stressed the importance for Europe of the rapid development of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). With the market in GNSS estimated to reach S50 billion by the year 2005, Mr. Kinnock pointed out that the Union is facing a key strategic choice as to whether it should go ahead with the development of an independent satellite navigation system and positioning sys\u00ad tems or develop a single global system with Europe's international partners. The Commis\u00ad sioner's preference would be to develop a single global system, but only on certain condi\u00ad tions: \"If we are not convinced that such a global system is a realistic possibility\", he noted, \"Europe must press ahead with its own system\". Mr. Kinnock identified the conditions of Europe's participation in a Global Navigation Satellite System as the following: \u25a0 Collective control over the system; \u25a0 Guarantees that the service, on which the safety of European transport will depend, cannot be withdrawn; \u25a0 The opportunity for European industry to compete in all segments of the market. At the invitation of the Council of Ministers, the Commission will, by the end of this year, put forward a European strategy for the development of GNSS.

RCN 9240 THE COMMUNITY PATENT AND THE PATENT SYSTEM IN EUROPE- PUBLIC HEARING Luxembourg, 25 \u00ad 26 November 1997 A public hearing on the Commission's Green Paper on the Com\u00ad munitypatent and the patent system in Europe will be held in the European Parliament in Luxembourg on 25 and 26 November 1997. The hearing, which forms part of the consultation process on the Green Paper, is being organized jointly by the Luxembourg Presi\u00ad dency of the Council and the European Commission. The Green Paper (COM(97) 314 final) is designed to provide a basis for consultation with all interested parties, in order to determine whether users' needs are currently being met and whether new meas\u00ad ures should be taken at Community level. In particular, it asks whether the Community Patent Convention, which dates from 1975, should be replaced by full scale Community legislation which would ensure that businesses and innovators could secure patent protection throughout the Single Market on the basis of a single patent application. The ( )pen I learing in Luxembourg will mark the conclusion of the wide\u00ad spread consultation process initiated in .lune this year, and its conclu\u00ad sions will form the basis on which the Commission will determine its future legislative agenda in this domain. The hearing will be addressed, among others, by Mr. R. Geubbels, Lux\u00ad embourg Minister for Economics, Mr. J. Mogg, Director\u00adGeneral for the Internal Market (DG XV), Mr. P. Waterschoot, Director responsible for Intellectual Property Rights and representatives from the European Patent Office. Mr. \u03bb'.

        "o C O R D IS Community R&D Information Service Programme Implementation DEUS - EUROPEAN SMEs USE OF THE INTERNET DEUS (Developing European SMEs) was a project supported by the Community's ES\u00ad PRIT programme. The project has recently completed a \"Study of European SMEs adoption of the Internet\". The study aimed to gather information on the use of the Internet by SMEs in Europe. In par\u00ad ticular, it looked at small and micro\u00adbusi\u00ad nesses. Thus far, the study found, the Internet has penetrated very few micro\u00adbusinesses. A variety of reasons for this were identified: \u25a0 Internet is perceived as being for tech\u00ad nologists only; \u25a0 The cost of set\u00adup and use are perceived as too high; \u25a0 Many SMEs do not have the necessary technical skills in\u00adhouse for set\u00adup and maintenance, and specialized help for SMEs is expensive and rarely available; \u25a0 The time taken to use the Internet is not available in SMEs, and many people do not have the necessary knowledge to use it effectively; \u25a0 The lack of organization on the Internet makes it difficult for SMEs to use. Therefore, the study suggests that by pooling SMEs into groups with shared problems and conditions, it becomes easier to help them adopt Internet solutions in their business. By focusing actions on target groups of SMEs, DEUS has, in partnership with local cham\u00ad bers of commerce in a pilot action, been able to demonstrate the viability of this course.

RCN 9192 JOULEN The findings so far... The European Commission, DG XII, has published a report presenting the key find\u00ad ings and recommendations from the assess\u00ad ment of completed projects under the Com\u00ad munity's specific RTD programme in the \u00f1eld of Non\u00adNuclear Energy (JOULE II, 1990\u00ad 1994). The evaluation was undertaken during 1996 by a group of nine independent evaluators. The overall aim of the evaluation exercise was to provide an assessment of the programme's achievements based on the performance of a sample of 100 projects, mostly completed in 1995\u00ad1996. The exercise was predominantly a scientific and technical evaluation, but was aimed at setting the completed projects in a wider economic, social and environmental context. The report finds that overall performance has been encour\u00ad aging. In particular it notes that the added value provided by EU support has been instrumen\u00ad tal in getting the projects off the ground. In addition, the trans\u00adEuropean consortia were useful in terms of exchanging experience and building contacts and networks for the future. Projects were also shown to have been posi\u00ad tive in terms of commercialization. The dis\u00ad semination of research results has been wide\u00ad spread, while commercialization/exploitation, where it has occurred, has shown some impacts on the market. The wider potential for socio\u00ad economic and environmental benefits is clear. Overall, the projects have shown a positive potential for energy, economic and other ben\u00ad efits. Commenting on the results of the evaluation, Mrs. Edith Cresson, Commissioner responsi\u00ad ble for research, innovation, education, train\u00ad ing and youth, noted that \"The development of a European energy policy has played, and will continue to play, a major role in the construc\u00ad tion of Europe. As this document shows, con\u00ad sortia, networks and numerous exchanges stimulated by the European Union's support have brought, and will continue to bring about, interesting results\". The report includes an executive sum\u00ad mary in all 11 official languages of the European Union. The main text of the report is in English.

        "Programme Implementation The 13 projects are all being implemented by joint EU\u00adCanada consortia, and involve a total of 125 higher education and training establishments (76 in Europe and 49 in Canada). There are also 14 associated partner organizations from industry and commerce participating in the projects. A total of ECU 1.5 million will go to the projects from the Community, with Canada also putting up funding. The 13 projects were chosen from a total of 72 valid proposals received. Taken together with the first call, there are now 19 projects receiving support under the agreement, involving staff and students in some 170 institutions. The themes to be covered by the 13 new projects include traditional academic themes such as improving transatlantic academic recognition of qualifications. Other themes are more wide\u00adranging, such as training of professionals in child abuse issues, protecting and safeguarding the environment, and new industrial training needs generated by the emergence of the global economy.

RCN 9201 THE SUSTAINABLE CITIES PROJECT The Sustainable Cities project is part of the Community's Fifth Environmental Action Programme and aims to develop, promote, and exchange experience of ideas for sustainable development, and formulate recommendations for imple\u00ad mentation at European, national, re\u00ad gional and local levels. The project consists of two distinct parts: \u25a0 Firstly the \"Sustainable Cities Report\", which includes a report on policies for sustainable development in cities and a good practice guide; and \u25a0 Secondly the \"European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign\", which encourages sustainable development policies in towns and cities throughout Europe through networking and offering support. The Sustainable Cities Report investigates ways to apply urban management princi\u00ad ples and tools to the following fields, placing emphasis on integration between them: \u25a0 Management of natural resources; \u25a0 The urban economy; \u25a0 Social issues: \u25a0 Mobilitv and accessibility; \u25a0 Land\u00aduse planning; \u25a0 Urban regeneration; \u25a0 Cultural heritage and tourism. To ensure the widest possible distribution of the report, different targeted summaries are being drawn up to address specific pri\u00ad ority groups. The first targeted summary, already available, is for local authorities. Others in preparation address businesses and citizens. Documents covering manage\u00ad ment and regeneration issues are also be\u00ad ing prepared. The campaign aims to encourage and sup\u00ad port local authorities in working towards sustainability by promoting Local Agenda 21 and similar processes. This is in accord\u00ad ance with the mandate to local authorities under Agenda 21 which was agreed by the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. These objectives are being addressed by strengthening partnerships among all sec\u00ad tors at local level and between authorities. Any local authority may join the campaign by adopting and signing the European Sus\u00ad tainable Cities and Towns Charter, also known as the Aalborg Charter, and imple\u00ad menting the Lisboa Action Plan. Up to July 1997, over 320 European local authorities have signed the Charter, and are working towards implementing Local Agenda 21 and similar plans in their areas.

RCN 9228 NUCLEAR WASTE DUMPING IN THE ARCTIC Assessing\" the long\u00adterm consequences ARMARA is a project, funded by the Com\u00ad mission under the Nuclear Fission Safety research programme, which aims to assess the long\u00adterm effects of nuclear waste dumping in the Kara and Barents Seas by the former Soviet Union. The project was launched in early 1996, and involves ten research institutes from the EU and three from Norway, coordinated by the Department of Experimental Physics of University College Dublin. The project has conducted a number of model\u00addirected sampling campaigns in the Arctic Seas, collecting extensive data on radionuclide contamination and transfer mechanisms, which has been interpreted and used to refine and validate an advanced compartmental model of radionuclide dispersal. This work will allow the prediction of likely short and long\u00adterm doses to man, and provide clear scientific guidelines for decision\u00admakers should remedial action or counter measures be needed. Within the Arctic, the St Anna/Voronin Trough has been identified as a key region for water mass exchange between the Arctic Shelf and the Central Arctic Ocean. In time, radioactive material leaching from dumped nuclear reactors and other nuclear debris in the Kara Sea will be advected through this zone. Data on plutonium concentrations in filtered surface and sub\u00adsurface water collected along a latitudinal section across these troughs in summer 1996 show no evidence of enhanced plutonium concentrations arising from the dumped material.

RCN 9235 MARIS Building the Maritime Information Society MARIS is one of the G7 Information Society initiatives established in 1995 following the Information Society Forum in Brussels. Its aim is to promote the use of information and communications technologies in the maritime sector. The MARIS approach is 100% user-driven, to ensure the best response to actual needs in the maritime sector. The first aim of the MARIS projects is to raise awareness of new types of technologies and services among potential user communities. A second goal is to encourage information technology com\u00ad panies to make use of the results produced in those communities. The pragmatic approach of MARIS means that most of the applications developed are based on existing technology and on tech\u00ad nical infrastructures and telecom services in use today in the maritime sector. MARIS also seeks to link existing national systems to create global maritime networks. The four main project areas within MARIS are as fol\u00ad lows: \u25a0 MARSOURCE concentrates on creating a fisheries and oceans information network; \u25a0 MARTRANS aims to set up a port logistics information network; \u25a0 MARVEL is developing technologies for the intelligent manufacture of ships and other maritime systems; \u25a0 SAFEMAR is developing a ship report\u00ad ing system for vessels to support the implementation of the various interna\u00ad tional conventions and resolutions. MARIS has recently created a regional net\u00ad work, founded bv Bilbao. Bremen, Genoa and Helsinki. The aim of the network is to serve as an interface between local maritime play\u00ad ers and the global state\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adart in advanced information and communications technolo\u00ad gies. It will also serve to promote the success\u00ad ful applications developed for maritime indus\u00ad tries in the Information Society.

The Council held discussions on the basis of a Commission communication which supported the idea of encouraging public\u00ad private partnerships in order to speed up the development of the trans\u00adEuropean transport networks. Given the high costs of the major infrastructure projects involved, particularly those among the 14 priority projects, the budgetary rigour prevailing in Member States has meant that the TENs are at a less advanced stage of development than envisaged. In order to advance these projects, which can have a strong impact on job creation in Europe, the Council calls for the value of public\u00adprivate partnerships for these projects to be recognized. The Council considers that, both by attracting additional finance and by bringing a wider range of skills, public\u00adprivate partnerships could be an important tool for the realisation of several of the priority TENs projects. That said, the Council does not see such partnerships as replacing public funding for projects. The Council calls for the creation of an environment favourable to public\u00adprivate partnerships, at both national and Community level, and underlines the need to establish partnerships from the start of projects. Proposals from the Commission concerning the application of public procurement legislation to transport infrastructure projects and the application of competition legislation were noted by the Council in respect of creating a favourable environment. The Council also noted with interest the Commission's intention to examine the possibilities to create new financing instruments using the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund, as well as developing existing ones. Finally, the Council called on Member States to use all possible means to encourage the development of systems for public\u00adprivate partnerships, where appropriate. The Council recognized the need for Member States to give strong support to the TENs projects, including public\u00adprivate partnerships, in order for them to be successfully developed. Based on Council Press Release 292 of 9 October 1997. RCN 9191 COMBINED HEAT AND POWER GENERATION Commission adopts communication The European Commission has adopted a communication on the promotion of combined heat and power generation (CHP). The proposed strategy will facilitate the development of CHP and remove barriers to its penetration in the European market as an energy saving and environmentally\u00adfriendly system of heat and power production. A CHP plant can convert as much as 85\u00ad90% of the energy content of a fuel, compared to only 30\u00ad40% when burnt to produce electricity in the conventional process. Simply by channelling the heat produced in creating electricity, CHP more than doubles fuel efficiency. One example of a successful CUP application is the City of Copenhagen, where hot water produced in electricity generation is used for industry or to heat homes, buildings and shops. Currently only 9% of energy production uses CUP. The Commission proposes to double this to 18% by 2010. It sees this target as realistic, and suggests that achieving this would reduce CO, emissions by 4% of the EU's total emissions. However, while there is scope for action at EU level, the major effort in extending the use of CHP must be undertaken by Member States at national level. The proposed strategy will include the following efforts: \u25a0 Promotion of CUP as an environmentally\u00adfriendly technology, through tax incentives, setting of emission standards for power plants and full transparency in the costs and benefits of different power generation processes; \u25a0 Increasing the share of funding for CHP under Community programmes such as CORDIS FOCUS \u00ad NUMBER 97 3 NOVEMBER 1997 ",

RCN 9199 MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS IN EUROPE The European Commission has, at the initiative of Commissioner Martin Bangemann, adopted a Communication setting out strategy and policy orientations aimed at creating a favourable environment for the further development of mobile communications in Europe. The main focus of this document is the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) which will allow mobile users wireless access to the Internet and other multimedia services. Areas identified as needing urgent attention include the clarification of the licensing regime to be used and confirmation that the radio frequency spectrum will become available in good time. The Commission believes that basic customer interests need to be preserved and that Europe-wide \"roaming\" for future mobile multimedia services\u00b7 should be ensured, as is the case today with voice telephony. The Communication provides a synthesis of the comments and contributions received from Member States and sector players in response to an earlier Commission Communication on the development of mobile and wireless communications. On that basis it is concluded that action by publie administrations is urgently needed. Proposed lines for action are as follows: \u25a0 UMTS licensing should seek to ensure the development of pan-European services (ie. should support \"roaming\"). In this context, the development, by ETSI, of a common, open and internationally competitive standard for the air-interface to ensure end-to-end interoperability in a pan-European UMTS environment, is vital. It should be noted that the current framework for licensing (Directives 97/3/EC and 90/ 388/EC) is fully applicable to UMTS; \u25a0 The Commission recognizes the concerns of industry that the amount of radio frequency spectrum currently allocated for UMTS is too modest and supports the proposal to include this issue on the agenda of the World Radio Conference conference in 1999; \u25a0 The Commission is considering the proposal of a European Parliament and Council Decision with respect to roaming, frequencies and standards by early 1998; \u25a0 The Commission notes the need for further research in relation to UMTS. This effort will be pursued in the context of the forthcoming Fifth RTD Framework Programme; \u25a0 The Commission considers that the further development of UMTS should aim at establishing a global standard and calls on Member States and industry to promote UMTS as a key element of the IMT-2000 recommendation currently under preparation at the ITU.

RCN 9207 THE FUTURE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY A European perspective Speaking at a conference in Austria on 14 October 1997, European Commissioner for agriculture and rural development, Mr. Franz Fischler, stressed the importance of future technologies, such as biotechnology, in maintaining growth in Europe and securing employment. The Commissioner noted the results of recent research which shows that there is a risk of the EU losing over 200,000 jobs in the area of hiotechnological research and development due to hostile attitudes towards these activities. With this in mind, the EU's future review of bioteeh legislation ensures both the respect of ethical considerations and the economic framework necessary for the development of a safe and transparent bioteeh industry - crucial to allay public concerns regarding this area. In order for Europe to exploit its full bioteeh potential, it will need, pointed out Mr. Fischler, to integrate a number of points into its societal model. In particular, it will need transparent legislation concerning the licensing of bioteeh products and a clear legal framework that is quick and efficient while taking account of all the safety questions. In order to help Europe achieve these goals, the Commission has outlined a reform package integrating these aspects, as well as taking account of ethical and security matters. In addition, a scientific committee has been appointed to give recommendations on ethical questions relating to biotechnology. Mr. Fischler stressed, however, that \"the crucial question concerning the application of a modern technology is a matter of public acceptance. We therefore need total transparency concerning the process of scientific evaluation and an active debate on all possible risks a product can present\".

RCN 9214 COMMISSION ADOPTS NEW ILLUSTRATED NUCLEAR PROGRAMME Coordinated development of nuclear industries The European Commission has adopted a new Illustrated Nuclear Programme (PINC) for the European Communities, with the aim of encouraging coordinated development of nuclear industries in the EU. The new programme is the fourth full Illustrated Nuclear Programme to be published by the Commission under the Euratom Treaty, and follows the draft published in September 1996. It aims, above all, to place the nuclear power industry in the context of an overall energy policy for the Community. Europe has a mature nuclear energy industry, producing around one-third of Community energy consumption. However, some Member States have never built nuclear power plants and others are planning to phase out nuclear power. The future position of nuclear power depends on its acceptance by politicians and the public. In recent years, and particularly since the Chernobyl accident, public acceptance has been reduced. However, demand for energy is increasing, and will continue to increase in the foreseeable future, both in Europe and beyond. Nuclear power offers benefits through security of supply, existing technical knowledge and 3 NOVEMBER 1997 CORDIS FOCUS - NUMBER 97 ",
        "General Policy environmental impact. In particular, by reducing Europe's consumption of fossil fuels, its use in place of oil, coal and gas contributes to meeting targets for reduction of CO-, emissions. The PINC aims to contribute to addressing public concerns over safety, including transport, management, storage and disposal of radioactive waste, decommissioning and the dangers of arms proliferation. It also addresses public concerns over these issues in Central and Eastern European countries, and wider issues of international cooperation in the nuclear energy field. The development of technologies to develop nuclear power generation, including the improvement of safety, are addressed in the Commission's proposal for the Euratom element of the Fifth RTD Framework Programme. The following principles for Community nuclear activities are suggested: \u25a0 Member States have the right to decide to develop or not to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy; \u25a0 These choices must be respected; \u25a0 Member States which have chosen to use nuclear energy need to ensure a high degree of safety, respect non- proliferation agreements and ensure a high degree of human health protection; \u25a0 Whilst individual Member States and operators are responsible for safety, they share a collective responsibility towards all European citizens to ensure nuclear safety.

The 1998 Programme takes up the broad lines of \"Agenda 2000\", with the activities of the Commission centering on five main political priorities: \u25a0 Employment: In 1998, the Commission will concentrate on the pursuit of a sound macro-economic policy, completion of the single market, the development of all union policies to take account of employment considerations, better coordination of national employment policies, closer linkage between employment policy and economic policy, substantial improvements to labour markets, the fight against social exclusion and a firmer basis for the social dimension of Europe; \u25a0 The euro: The Commission will complete the final technical preparations for the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999; \u25a0 Agenda 2000: An immediate start will be made on proposed reforms, in line with the three-point strategy of strengthening and adapting existing policies, making the necessary preparations for the integration of new members and designing a suitable financial framework; \u25a0 External relations: The main challenge in 1998 will be preparing for enlargement. Priority will be given to collective and coherent action; \u25a0 Citizens: The main thrust of the Commission's activities will revolve around improving public health. A number of amendments will be proposed to existing directives relating to the environment and agriculture. In addition, the Commission will ensure that all Union policies give greater consideration to environmental factors. Ilased tin Commission Press Release IP/97/902 of 22 October 1997. RCN 9242 US POSITION ON CLIMATE CHANGE First reactions from the Environment Commissioner Mrs. Ritt Bjerregaard, European Commissioner for the environment, has expressed her disappointment at the position taken by the US with regard to climate change. US President Bill Clinton outlined the US position on climate change in a speech delivered on 26 October 1997. Whilst clearly recognising the need for action the US contributions to the discussions fall well short of expectations. Reacting to the US position, Mrs Bjerregaard affirmed: \"I am disappointed with the very weak level of ambition of the US. This is not an adequate response to the global problems of climate change\". Commissioner Bjerregaard further underlined that \"the Convention on Climate Change as adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992 already urges emission stabilization by 2000 at 1990 levels for industrialized countries. The US position to reach this goal by sometime around 2010 is therefore a significant step in the wrong direction. Kyoto is all about legally binding emission objectives and should clearly improve the Convention. Instead the US seeks to weaken it considerably - even though they are responsible for close to 25% of the global emissions of greenhouse gases\". Commissioner Bjerregaard also recalled the resolution adopted by the Union of Concerned Scientists which was presented to President Clinton on 30 September 1997 at a Science Summit on Climate Change. The resolution contains language as: \"The threat of global warming is very real and action is needed immediately\"... \"There is only one responsible choice - to act now\"... \"This is a wake-up call for world leaders\". Commissioner Bjerregaard repeated her support for this landmark consensus declaration and urged all Parties to the Convention \"to carefully consider and respect this scientific advice on the devastating consequences of human-induced global warming\". She dismissed earlier allegations that the EU position was \"unfair\" or \"overambitious\" or \"not realistic\". She referred in particular to the Communication on Climate Change adopted by the Commission on 1 October which demonstrates \"that the EU negotiating position on a 15% reduction of the emissions of three greenhouse gases is technically feasible and economically manageable\". The Commissioner added that \"it must be done and it can be done - provided the political will is there. This goes for the EU. Don't tell me other industrialized countries cannot do the same\". Mrs. Bjerregaard stressed the need to reach a result in Kyoto, but added: \"the US now finds itself in a difficult position by having neglected their obligation under the Convention to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 by 1990 levels\". Commissioner Bjerregaard finally recalled President Clinton's intervention during the second Earth Summit in New York in June this year, where he applauded the EU position and said: \"We will bring to the Kyoto Conference in December a strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits that will significantly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases\".

The report covers the period from January 1995 to July 1997, when the new \"Television without frontiers\" Directive came into force (Directive 97/36/EEC). This period was characterized by the launching of the first digital services in Europe, for which the Directive provides part of the Community framework. By 1996, Europe had over 250 television channels, their number having doubled in the last six years. At the beginning of 1997 there were over 330 digital channels broadcast by satellite (10 at the beginning of 1996). The period was also characterized by the abundance of the case law issued by the European Court of Justice in direct connection with the Directive. In total, the Court adopted seven decisions. The report presents and analyses these decisions, which have particularly important consequences for the criteria determining Member States'jurisdiction over broadcasters. The 'home country control' principle emerges strengthened and more workable from this case law.

        "Publications INDUSTRY STUDIES OF INNOVATION USING CIS DATA Manufacture of machinery and electrical machinery The European Innovation Monitoring System (EIMS) has published a report examining the innovation process in the European Union Member States, with particular focus on the indus\u00ad trial machinery and electrical ma\u00ad chinery sectors. The study, prepared on behalf of EIMS by the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), looks at national inno\u00ad vation systems and the economic struc\u00ad ture of the two sectors concerned and the influence of these factors on the in\u00ad novation process. The study reveals a higher degree of in\u00ad novation in the industrial machinery sec\u00ad tor as compared to the electrical engi\u00ad neering sector. This may be accounted for in part by the fact that while innova\u00ad tion activities in the electrical engineer\u00ad ing sector are dominated by large firms (more able to put up the necessary in\u00ad vestment), in the mechanical engineer\u00ad ing sector SMEs also play an important role. In addition, technological development in \"niches\", the predominant market structure for the micro business, seems to be an ongoing process in mechanical engineering sector. Market niches in electrical engineering seem, on the con\u00ad trary, to be far less dynamic. The study finds, however, that differ\u00ad ences in the participation and intensity of innovation activities and technology transfer can not be explained by indus\u00ad try\u00adspecific barriers to innovation. It therefore suggests that we should look less closely at industry\u00adspecific barriers to innovation but rather at barriers to innovation in general. The most impor\u00ad tant barriers to innovation are identified as being: \u25a0 Low expected profits from innova\u00ad tion due to the high level of financial investment needed and the too long pay\u00adoff period; \u25a0 Difficulties in financing innovation activities.

RCN 9256 O CORDIS Community R&D Information Service Legislation TELECOMS SERVICES AT THE RIGHT PRICE The European Commission has adopted a Recommendation setting out the prices which telecommunications operators may charge each other for delivery of calls in the liberalized European t\u00e9l\u00e9coms market (after 1 January 1998). The aim of the Recommendation is to bring down the costs of interconnection charges which constitute one of the big\u00ad gest barriers to new entrants. Commissioner Martin Bangemann, responsi\u00ad ble for telecommunications policy, stated that, \"The price of interconnection will be a criti\u00ad cal factor affecting the speed with which com\u00ad petition and choice develop in the EU\". The Commission, he said, \"is sending a strong sig\u00ad nal to the market that we expect interconnec\u00ad tion prices in Europe to be very competi tive\". The Commission is recommending a move to forward\u00adlooking long\u00adrun average incremen\u00ad tal costs as the basis for interconnection charges. The existing monopoly operators have, thus far, based their charges on the his\u00ad toric costs of their original investments.

RCN 9211 \u03a6 CORDIS Community R&D Information Service Preparatory acts SYNERGY PROGRAMME FOR 1998 The European Commission has put for\u00ad ward a proposal for a Council Regula\u00ad tion extending the validity of the Com\u00ad munity's SYNERGY programme for the promotion of international cooperation in the energy sector for a further period of one year. This further extension of the SYNERGY programme (already extended for a period of one year for 1997), falls within the con\u00ad text of the Commission's preparation of a framework energy programme, incorpo\u00ad rating all the Community programmes which have an energy component. At the request of the Council, the Com\u00ad mission adopted, on 23 April 1997, a Com\u00ad munication entitled \"An overall view of energy policy and actions\". This draws two main operational conclusions: \u25a0 Energy measures should be strength\u00ad ened so as to better respond to the expected significant increase in external dependency, to the objective of competitiveness, and to the need to respect the environment; \u25a0 With a view to increased efficiency, efforts should be made at clarification and streamlining. Community energy policy needs a coherent framework to allow it to fulfil its priority purposes with adequate means. Following on from this communication, the Commission will submit appropriate proposals, following the direction of these conclusions, by the end of the year. It will, however, clearly not be possible, given the scope of the proposal, for a new pro\u00ad gramme to be definitively adopted before the first half of 1998. Consequently, the objective of the present proposal from the Commission is to ensure the continuity. for 1998, of the action started by SYNERGY.

The report examines young people's atti\u00ad tudes \u00ad on matters which affect them di\u00ad rectly, and towards the European Union. The first part of the survey illustrates the life\u00ad style of young Europeans, looking at their religious beliefs, participation in community life, views on employment and unemploy\u00ad ment, education, travel, knowledge of lan\u00ad guages, etc. The second part focuses on the way they perceive the EU, and what it has achieved. The survey finds that the greatest concern of young people is employment. In their eyes, it must be the EU's first priority for action. They consider that the greatest as\u00ad set for finding a job is a \"good general edu\u00ad cation\". A success for the EU is in increas\u00ad ing mobility for young people, with over half of the young people interviewed having trav\u00ad elled to another Member State in the past two years. For the young, the notion of \"Eu\u00ad ropean citizenship'' is linked to the ability to work, live and study in any Member State. Only 28% of the interviewees did not feel confident in speaking in a second European language, a great improvement since 1990, when some 40% were not confident of using a second language. In their free time, most young people partici\u00ad pate in sports or watch television. Despite the fact that almost half the interviewees are not members of any organizations or associations, they still show themselves sensitive and open to handicap victims and willing to care for eld\u00ad erly people. The young people were particu\u00ad larly interested in the development of new technologies, seeing them as a key to the crea\u00ad tion of employment. In this respect research and development was cited as the third prior\u00ad ity for the EU, ahead of housing, the fight against crime and consumer protection. That said, half of the interviewees do not yet use computers or the Internet. A total of 9,400 young people aged between 15 and 24 were interviewed between April and June 1997. This represents an average of 600 per Member State, except Germany (1,200: 600 from former West Germany and 600 from former East Germany), the United Kingdom (800: 600 from Great Britain and 200 from Northern Ireland) and Luxem\u00ad bourg (200). The survey includes both new questions, and \"old\" ones which can be com\u00ad pared with a previous survey from 1990. The full text of the survey may be downloaded, in English.

The project is aimed at increasing the flexibility of the successful \"Eu\u00ad ropean Awareness Scenario Workshop\" (EASW) methodology, both in terms of the range of subjects which may be dealt with and in terms of the workshop duration. Within the EASW, a platform has been devel\u00ad oped to support and facilitate the active par\u00ad ticipation of societal groups on technological developments concerning the sustainable devel\u00ad opment of cities. This has resulted in a fully tested, ready\u00adto\u00aduse package for local scenario workshops on the subject of \"urban ecology\", and the constitution of a group of trained Na\u00ad tional Monitors. In addition to the subject of \"urban ecology\" of the initial EASW phase, FLEXLMODO aims to de\u00ad velop and test scenarios on the following subjects: \u25a0 Urban mobility; \u25a0 Local information provision; \u25a0 Urban regeneration. For all these areas, suitable support material will be developed to facilitate the performance and the transfer of the adapted flexible methodol\u00ad ogy and the new scenarios.
