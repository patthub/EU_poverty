This update of the Gender Equality Index has greatly benefited from expert advice received from: EIGE\u2019s working group on the Gender Equality Index; the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA); the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound); and the European Commission, in particular the Gender Equality Unit at the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, and Eurostat. EIGE is very grateful to the many other individuals and institutions who provided valuable contributions and support to the update of the Gender Equality Index. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is an autonomous body of the European Union established to strengthen gender equality across the EU. Equality between women and men is a fundamental value of the EU and EIGE\u2019s task is to make this a reality in Europe and beyond. This includes becoming a European knowledge centre on gender equality issues, supporting gender mainstreaming in all EU and member state policies, and fighting discrimination based on sex.

        "Foreword Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 3 Foreword With a freshly elected European Parliament and a new term for the European Commission, the time is ripe to take stock of progress and con- solidate gender equality priorities for the years ahead. The European Union (EU) cannot afford to stall now. Gender equality must be placed at the heart of the next multiannual financial framework to foster a more inclusive and cohe- sive EU. EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index shows that ad- vances in gender equality are still moving at a snail\u2019s pace, but we are heading in the right direction. There are big improvements in the domain of power, as more women are taking on decision-making positions, especially in com- pany boardrooms across Europe. In the private sphere, the unequal sharing of cleaning, cooking and caring responsibilities has hardly changed. The bulk of this unpaid work continues to fall on women. That makes it harder for them to juggle work and person- al life, which impacts on their earning potential and the well-being of the women themselves and the people closest to them. The topic of work\u2014life balance affects both women and men and is a top priority for the EU. This is why we chose it as this year\u2019s the- matic focus of the Index. It is a new feature that we are introducing, and each year the Index will take an in-depth look at an emerging policy issue that matters for gender equality. We are happy to announce that from now on, the Index will be updated on an annual basis, making it even more up to date and responsive to emerg- ing challenges. As always, the Gender Equality Index sets a benchmark for gender equality in the EU. It shows which Member State is the closest to gender equality, which has improved the most and which has the furthest way to go. The Index measures the success of policy measures and initiatives, designed to create more gender- equal societies. Its value lies in its capacity to guide decision-makers towards their goal for a more balanced and inclusive society that improves the lives of everyone in the EU. On behalf of the Institute, I would like to thank all the institutions and experts who contributed to this edition of the Gender Equality Index. I would like to especially thank EIGE\u2019s working group on the Gender Equality Index and all re- searchers who supported our work on work\u2014 life balance; the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound); the European Commission, in par- ticular the Gender Equality Unit at the Direct- orate-General for Justice and Consumers, and Eurostat; and my colleagues at EIGE.

Heteronormativity is defined by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) as \u2018the assumption that everyone is \u201cnaturally\u201d heterosexual, and that heterosexu- ality is an ideal, superior to homosexuality or bisexuality.\u2019 It has for effect to \u2018make heterosexuality seem coherent, natural and privileged\u2019 (FRA, 2009b). The language used to represent LGBTQI*, a very heterogeneous group, is and has been in continuous evolution towards inclusion. For this reason, different people and institutions have adopted different versions of the acronym, such as LGBT, LGBTIQ and LGBTI. In accordance with that, the report will use those institutions\u2019 chosen acronyms when describing the results of their work.

        "Highlights of the Gender Equality Index 2019 Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 13 Highlights of the Gender Equality Index 2019 Main findings \u0083 The EU keeps moving towards gender equal- ity at a snail\u2019s pace. While the Gender Equality Index score for the EU rose from 66.2 points (out of 100) in 2015 to 67.4 in 2017, the EU still has a lot of room for improvement. Since 2005, the EU\u2019s score has increased by only 5.4 points. \u0083 Although the power domain has the lowest score, improvements in this domain contrib- uted to nearly three quarters (74 %) of the progress between 2015 and 2017. \u0083 The persistent gender segregation in differ- ent fields of study in tertiary education con- tributes to making knowledge the second lowest domain in the Index. \u0083 The Gender Equality Index 2019 expands the analysis of intersecting inequalities by high- lighting the situation of LGBTQI* people and Roma and Muslim women in areas where statistics are available. \u0083 Convergence analysis shows the different trends in gender equality across the EU. In 2005-2017, despite the different starting points, 16 Member States (AT, CY, DE, EE, IT, LV, MT, PT, SI below the EU average and BE, DK, FI, LU, NL, SE, UK above) grew in gender equality faster than the EU average and de- creased their distance to gender equality. An- other eight Member States (BG, CZ, EL, HR, HU, PL, RO, SK) improved in gender equality, but at a slower pace than the EU average. Spain, France and Ireland started with high- er scores than the EU average and grew at a faster rate, increasing their distance from the EU average. Lithuania had lower scores than the EU in 2005, and it is the only Mem- ber State whose scores declined as the EU\u2019s average increased, widening the gap. Domain of work \u0083 With a total EU-28 score of 72.0 points, the domain of work spotlights the incremental overall progress of 2.0 points made since 2005, including 0.5 points since 2015. \u0083 Segregation and quality of work remains a particular gender equality challenge for the EU and all Member States, with a respect ive sub-domain score of only 64.0 points in 2017, amidst slowly rising employment rates. In 2017, the FTE employment rate in the EU was 41 % for women and 57 % for men, an in- crease of about 1 percentage point (p.p.) for both genders from 2015 and with the most acute gender gap observed among the cou- ples with children. \u0083 Being a parent continues to hinder women in the labour market, reflecting the dispro- portionate weight of care duties on mothers. This leads to women\u2019s predominant reliance on part-time work, even at the cost of con- signing them to jobs with poorer career pro- gression. In 2018, 31 % of women and 8 % of men aged 20-64 worked part-time in the EU. Domain of money \u0083 The EU-28 score for the domain of money showed continuing improvement since 2005, including a 0.8-point increase since 2015. This made it possible to reach 80.4 points in 2017: the second highest ranked domain in the Gender Equality Index. \u0083 Nonetheless, progress in the sub-domain of economic resources (87.7 in 2017, still 2.0 points lower than in 2005) remains frag- ile, and with a recent worsening of the situa- tion in Member States such as Luxembourg, Lithuania, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Malta and Sweden.

        "Highlights of the Gender Equality Index 2019 European Institute for Gender Equality 14 \u0083 In 2017 the EU-28 gender gap in mean monthly earnings was 20 % to the detriment of women, increasing substantially for cou- ples with children (36 %), lone parents (31 %) or those with high educational qualifications (33 %). Throughout the course of a life, these inequalities lead not only to a gender gap in mean monthly earnings of 38 % among those aged 65 or more, but also to increased expo- sure to poverty for women in retirement. Domain of knowledge \u0083 The EU-28 score (63.5 points) has remained virtually static between 2015 and 2017 and only improved by 2.7 points over the entire 12-year period from 2005. Increasing ed- ucational attainment among women and men drives slow but positive change in the domain, while more significant progress is being held back by strong gender segrega- tion and low engagement in lifelong learning. \u0083 In the EU more women and men graduate from universities than in the past and the gender gap continues to increase to the det- riment of men. Both women and men limit their fields of study as only 21 % of men stu- dents choose to study in the field of educa- tion, health and welfare, humanities and arts, and women constitute only about 33 % of graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) tertiary education. \u0083 Adult participation in education and training is low in the EU and has barely altered since 2005. Adult learning sharply decreases with age and is particularly low among the work- ing-age population (aged 25-64) with a low level of qualifications. Domain of time \u0083 Gender inequalities in time use are persist ent and growing: the EU-28 2017 score of 65.7 is not only 1 p.p. lower than that of 2005, it also represents a 3.2 p.p. drop from the gains that had been achieved up until 2012. \u0083 Women are engaged disproportionally more in unpaid care work: almost 38 % take care of children, grandchildren, older people and/or people with disabilities every day for 1 hour or more compared with 25 % of men. Even more strikingly, only 34 % of men are en- gaged in cooking and housework every day for 1 hour or more in comparison with 79 % of women, with the situation barely changing in more than a decade. \u0083 Gender inequalities in unpaid domestic work are highest between women and men living in a couple and having children. Women aged between 25 and 49 are those most likely to do unpaid care work every day. \u0083 Women and men with disabilities need care, but they are also carers. The Index shows 29 % of women and 20 % of men with dis- abilities in the EU are doing care work every day. Women with disabilities also do the big- gest bulk of the cooking and/or other house- work (79 %) compared to men with disabil- ities (41 %). Domain of power \u0083 The domain of power has seen the biggest advances in gender equality but remains the most gender unequal in the Index. At the same time, it made the biggest improvement: a 13-point increase since 2005. Between 2015 and 2017, the EU score for this domain rose from 48.5 to 51.9 points (+ 3.4 points). \u0083 Improvement in the domain of power is driven by the increased number of women in nation- al parliaments and on the boards of the larg- est publicly quoted companies. The impact of gender quotas has had a relevant impact. In Member States that have instituted legislative candidate quotas to increase the gender bal- ance in parliaments, women\u2019s representation has improved since the application of a quota. The same for the presence of women mem- bers of boards, which has increased strikingly in the Member States that have introduced quotas to address the gender imbalance. ",
        "Highlights of the Gender Equality Index 2019 Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 15 \u0083 The social power sub-domain (research, media and sports decision-making) is the one with the slowest progress since 2015, when data was collected for the first time. Domain of health \u0083 The EU-28 health domain score of 88.1 points in 2017 has not only barely changed since 2015 (+ 0.7 points), it has also made scant pro- gress since 2005 (+ 2.2 points). This domain\u2019s scores have consistently ranked among the highest of all six core domains measured in the Gender Equality Index. \u0083 While women in the EU can expect to live to the age of 84 compared to 78 for men, they spend a higher share of their lives in poor health: 19 years compared to 15 years for men. \u0083 Some population groups face challenges in accessing adequate healthcare: lone mothers and fathers (6 % and 8 % respectively) and women and men with disabilities (8 % and 7 % respectively) report unmet needs for medical examinations. While no compara- ble data is available, those identifying as LGBTQI* are also known to face significant health inequalities. Domain of violence \u0083 Data on all forms of violence against women remains scarce across the EU. Reliable, sys- tematic and comparable data covering var- ious aspects of violence against women, disaggregated by sex and the relationship between the survivor and perpetrator, is key to designing effective EU-wide strategies to end violence against women. \u0083 The EU is experiencing a backlash in women\u2019s rights and gender equality. In several Mem- ber States, the ratification and/or full imple- mentation of the Council of Europe\u2019s Conven- tion on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Is- tanbul Convention) (2011) has been hindered by \u2018anti-gender\u2019 opponents, thereby under- mining political and legal efforts to eradicate violence against women. \u0083 Among LGBT groups, transgender people are most likely to report experiences of vio- lence. In the EU, about one in three trans- gender persons experiences either physical or sexual violence or the threat of violence. Work\u2014life balance \u0083 In the EU, 34 % of women and 23 % of men aged 20-49, are ineligible for parental leave, with four Member States providing universal access to pa- rental leave. When only the employed popu lation is considered, in the EU- 28, 10 % women and 12 % of men are ineligible for parental leave despite being in employment. In nine Member States all of those employed (women and men) have an opportunity to access parental leave. Mem- ber States with more universal parental-leave schemes create better opportunities for gen- der equality: those Member States with higher eligibility rates have higher scores in the Gen- der Equality Index as well as in the sub-do- mains of work and time. \u0083 In the EU, 29 % of households report unmet needs for professional home-care services in 2016 and much of the care is provided informally, disproportionately by women of pre-retirement age. Of those aged 50-64, 21 % of women and 11 % of men provide long-term care (LTC) for older people and/or people with disabilities at least several days a week. Overall, in Member States where women disproportionately bear the burden of LTC, gender inequalities in labour partic- ipation are higher. More particularly, in the Member States with larger gender gaps in the provision of care for older people and/ or people with disabilities, there are lower scores in the sub-domain of participation in the labour market. Fewer than one in two In the EU, 34 % of women and 23% men are ineligible for parental leave ",
        "Highlights of the Gender Equality Index 2019 European Institute for Gender Equality 16 women (48 %) involved in informal LTC is in paid work. \u0083 The EU has reached the first Barcelona tar- get (also called the \u2018Barcelona objectives\u2019) of 33 % of all children under 3 years of age being enrolled in a formal childcare insti- tution. At national level, only 13 Member States have achieved this objective. Overall, 14 % of households in 2016 reported unmet needs for childcare services, primarily due to financial reasons (50 %). Women\u2019s great- er involvement in informal childcare inter- feres with their employment opportunities, thereby increasing the risk of poverty and economic dependency. In households where the youngest child is under 7 years of age, women spend on average 32 hours a week on paid work and 39 hours on unpaid work compared to 41 hours and 19 hours for men respectively. Gaps in care services constitute a serious obstacle for women\u2019s participation in the labour market, while care responsi- bilities do not substantially affect men\u2019s en- gagement in paid work. In the EU, 10 % of women work part-time or are inactive due to care duties, while this applies to only 0.5 % of men. \u0083 For public infrastructure to benefit the whole population, its design, location and accessi- bility should take into account the differences in gender needs. Commuting enables people not only to take on work but also to access better jobs. This is highlighted by its strong association with the Gender Equality Index, and in particular with its time and work do- mains. Nonetheless, due to gendered shar- ing of duties at home, women\u2019s commuting time is shorter compared to men\u2019s time (40 minutes and 45 minutes, on average). Fur- thermore, lack of access to a car and the longer travel times involved in the use of public transport make it even more difficult for women, particularly lone mothers, to achieve a good work\u2014life balance. \u0083 In the EU, 57 % of women and 54 % of men have no possibility of changing their work- ing-time provisions, while 14 % of women and 19 % of men could determine their own work- ing hours completely. The private sector not only accounts for a higher share of male em- ployment, but also ensures a higher level of flexibility in working time. Given women\u2019s con- centration in public-sector jobs, this implies that women have fewer chances for work\u2014life bal- ance via flexibility at work. It is one of the reasons why only 14 % of women in part-time employment can move into full-time jobs, whereas 28 % of men can do so. The Gender Equal- ity Index (in its entirety and across all its domains) shows a significant corre- lation to the availability of flexible working schedules in Member States, high- lighting their importance in how women and men are able to allocate their time for home and paid work activities, as well as for their ed- ucation and training opportunities. \u0083 Gender equality in the domains of work and time is positively associated with higher par- ticipation in education and training for both women and men. However, time-related barriers, such as family responsibilities or work-schedule conflicts, can put participation in lifelong-learning activities out of reach for many adults. In the EU-28, 40 % of women and 24 % of men cannot participate in learn- ing due to family responsibilities. In nearly all Member States, men report work-schedule conflicts as an obstacle to participation in ed- ucation and training more often than women. For one family in two, cost is an obstacle to accessing the childcare services they need ",
        "Introduction Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 17 Introduction This fourth edition of the Gender Equality Index comes at a turbulent time when gender equali- ty and those promoting it are facing increasing challenges to protect this core value of the EU. Measuring gender equality is integral to effective policymaking in the EU. Since the first edition in 2013, the Gender Equality Index has tracked and reported progress by providing a comprehensive measure of gender equality, tailored to fit the EU\u2019s policy goals. It reveals both progress and setbacks, and explores what can be done better to seize opportunities for change. The Index measures gender equalities in the do- mains of work, money, knowledge, time, power, health and violence, as well as intersecting ine- qualities. By providing relevant statistics, data and measures, all essential components for evi- dence-based policymaking and successful gen- der mainstreaming (EIGE, 2015b), it supports the assessment of policy outcomes on women and men. This edition includes scores for 2005, 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2017, providing an insightful tracking of gender-equality progress in the EU and individual Member States over a period of 12 years. As of 2019, the Gender Equality Index will be updated annually. This will enable more timely contributions to EU policy monitoring systems. A new feature is the introduction of a thematic focus linked to selected domains in the Index. The special focus for this, the 2019 edition, is on work\u2014life balance, an issue of high EU political importance. The Index also presents an addi- tional set of indicators on work\u2014life balance not included in the calculations of the core Gender Equality Index, but which are conceptually and statistically linked. The analysis of work\u2014life balance cuts across three broad areas: paid work, unpaid work (care), and education and training. It presents indicators in six specific areas: parental-leave policies; infor- mal care for older adults or people with disabili- ties, as well as LTC services; caring for children and child- care services; transport and public infrastructure; flex- ible working arrangements; and lifelong learning. Such analysis aims to establish strong connections between work\u2014life balance and gen- der equality. It also provides new insights into the moni- toring of the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights and its \u2018New start\u2019 initiative on Work\u2014life Balance. Building on previous editions and EIGE\u2019s ap- proach to intersecting inequalities (EIGE, 2019a), the Gender Equality Index 2019 continues to show the diverse realities that different groups of women and men face. It examines how elements such as disability, age, level of education, coun- try of birth and family type intersect with gender to create different pathways in people\u2019s lives. For the first time, the Index highlights the situation of LGBTQI* people and Roma and Muslim women in areas where statistics are available. This edition further extends the Index\u2019s scope by presenting a convergence analysis of gender equality over time. This not only reveals whether Member States are individually advancing in gen- der equality but also whether gender equal ity gaps between Member States are decreasing. A narrowing or widening of gaps is evidence of EU progress on building cohesive societies. Chapter 1 presents the results of the Gender Equality Index 2019, the main trends since the last edition of 2017 and developments since 2005. The outcomes of the convergence analysis provide a broader context for the main findings. Chapters 2-7 summarise the main findings of the six core domains of the Index. Developments in the domain of violence are presented in Chap- ter 8. The broad thematic focus of work\u2014life bal- ance and its links with the Gender Equality Index are explored in Chapter 9. The work-life balance scoreboard covers three broad areas: paid work, unpaid work (care) and education and training ",

Gender equality in the European Union: improvements and challenges between 2005 and 2017 1.1. Still far from the finish line The Gender Equality Index score of 67.4 points out of 100 for the EU in 2017 highlights that all Member States need to make considerable ad- vances to ensure women and men enjoy equal levels of well-being in all domains of life. Although this was an increase of 5.4 points since 2005, it represents modest progress on the goal over a 12-year period. The room for improvement varies across Member States. Almost a third of the 28 EU Member States scored higher than 70 points in 2017, with Sweden (83.6 points) and Denmark (77.5 points) maintaining their top-two status between 2005 and 2017. While Greece and Hungary (51.2 and 51.9 points respectively) showed they have the most ground to make up, nearly half of all Member States scored lower than 60 points in 2017. Of the six domains that constitute the composite indicator of the Gender Equality Index, the power domain score of 51.9 points of the EU reveals that gender inequalities in decision-making re- main the biggest hurdles to overcome. The per- sistent gender segregation in different fields of study in tertiary education ensures knowledge is the second least equal domain in the Index with an EU score of 63.5 points. The time domain (EU: 65.7 points) spotlights worsening inequalities in how time is used by women and men, the only area to suffer a setback since 2005.

Snail\u2019s-pace progress on gender equality in the EU continues While the Gender Equality Index score for the EU rose from 66.2 points in 2015 to 67.4 in 2017, it represented an increase of just 0.6 points per year. This was in line with the sluggish improve- ment seen between 2005 and 2015, averaging around 0.4 points per year. Nearly all Member States saw some progress to- wards gender equality between 2015 and 2017, with scores in 16 Member States improving by more than 1 point. Particularly strong progress was achieved in Portugal (+ 3.9 points) and Es- tonia (+ 3.1 points), with Portugal advancing by more than 10 points overall since 2005. This was largely due to dramatic advances in political and economic decision-making. In Estonia, progress was attributable to higher scores in the power, knowledge and money domains (see Table 1 and Figure 4). While Italy and Cyprus showed the largest indi- vidual improvement on gender equality in the EU since 2005, progress slowed down between 2005 and 2017. Italy witnessed a 12.9-point increase up until 2015 but its Index score rose by a mere 0.9 point in the following 2 years. Cyprus\u2019s score improved by 1.2 points in the same period, re- sulting in an overall increase of 10.4 points since 2005. This was enough to lift Cyprus from last po- sition on the Index in 2005 to 20th in 2017. A few other Member States saw accelerated pro- gress. Croatia, for example, improved by 1.3-points per year from 2015 compared to a 0.3 point annu- al increase during the previous decade.

Lithuania\u2019s score dropped to 55.5 points in 2017, making it the only Member State not to have made any pro- gress on gender equality since 2005. Poland\u2019s decrease to 55.2 points erased about a third of the gains it had made in the preceding decade. In both cases, these reversals were due to grow- ing gender imbalances in the power domain.

More women in decision- making drives progress The power domain has seen the biggest ad- vances in gender equality but remains the most gender unequal in the Index. The EU score for this domain rose from 48.5 to 51.9 points be- tween 2015 and 2017, an average increase of 1.7 points per year. In comparison, progress in other domains was less than 1 point over the same period (see Table 1). Improvements in the power domain contribut- ed to nearly three quarters (74 %) of the pro- gress in the Gender Equality Index between 2015 and 2017 (See Table 2). They were the key factor driving change in all Member States, ex- plaining at least half of all Index score changes in each Member State, and in some (BG, EL, FR, HR, HU, AT, PT, SK) accounting for more than 80 % of progress. Overall, between 2005 and 2017, the power domain contributed 57 % of the advancement in the Gender Equality Index. The rise of women in decision-making became a key driver of gender equality in general in the aftermath of the economic crisis, explain- ing about two thirds of the progress in the EU Index score from 2012. In contrast, changes in the domain of power accounted only for 39 % of improvements in overall gender equality be- tween 2005 and 2012 (see Table 2). Since 2015 the share of women in decision-making roles has increased in 24 Member States, with France (+ 10.1 points) and Portugal (+ 12.8 points) ex- periencing extraordinary rises. Four Member States (LT, NL, PL, SI), however, saw their share of women in decision-making fall in this period (see Table 1).

The finan- cial and economic situation for women and men became more equal in nine Member States (DE, EE, HR, CY, LV, PL, PT, RO, FI). Improvements have been much less common in other domains. At national level, every Member State made progress of at least 1 point in one or more domains, except for Lithuania and the Netherlands. Twelve Member States improved in two domains (CZ, DE, IE, ES, HR, IT, CT, LV, MT, PT, RO, FI), while Estonia improved its score in three domains. While the domain of time most negatively im- pacted the Gender Equality Index between 2005 and 2017 (by 11 %) due to diminishing gender equality in this area in several Member States, almost a third of Member States experi- enced inequalities worsening in one domain by at least 1 point during the last 2 years of this period. Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland and Slovenia saw falling scores in the power domain; Denmark, Cyprus and the United Kingdom suf- fered setbacks in the knowledge domain; and Luxembourg in the money domain. 1.4. Convergence on gender equality in the EU One of the fundamental objectives of the EU is to improve the lives of its citizens by promoting upward economic and social convergence (Euro- pean Commission, 2016b; European Parliament, 2018b), with the European Pillar of Social Rights serving as a compass for the renewed process of convergence across Europe. In addition to moni- toring the convergence of socioeconomic out- comes such as gross domestic product (GDP), in- ( 2 ) Variation is calculated through a commonly used dispersion measurement, the coefficient of variation, which is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. The lower the values of the coefficient of variation, the lower the degree of variability is and the closer the EU Member States are to each other regarding the score of the Index. comes, poverty or employment, it is also relevant to analyse and monitor convergence as regards gender equality. This chapter provides the first attempt to analyse the degree of convergence on gender equality in the EU between 2005 and 2017. Convergence is the tendency of Member States to become more alike over time. Therefore, the analysis conducted shows whether the Gender Equality Index scores of the Members States are moving towards the same level of achievement and to what extent a gradual reduction of disparities is being achieved in the process. Following the methodology proposed by Eurofound (2018c) in monitoring convergence, the first step is to ex- amine the trend of the Gender Equality Index at EU level, which is followed by an analysis of the convergence and divergence patterns in each Member State towards the EU (see Annex 4 for further methodological details). Subsequent analysis is needed to assess convergence on dif- ferent domains, sub-domains and indicators and will be provided in future editions of the Gender Equality Index. Trend at the EU level Longer-term developments at the EU level regarding the variation between the Mem- ber States in the Gender Equality Index score from 2005 to 2017 are presented in Figure 5. It shows the average of the Gender Equality In- dex score for the 28 Member States (left axis) in comparison to the trend in the cross-Mem- ber State variability (right axis) ( 2 ). The figure shows that the mean improvement in the Gen- der Equality Index in this period, rising from 62.0 to 67.4 points, was accompanied by an overall decline in variation. This implies that, on average, differences between Member States decreased. ",
        "Gender equality in the European Union: improvements and challenges between 2005 and 2017 European Institute for Gender Equality 24 An increase in Gender Equality Index score, to- gether with reduced cross-Member State dispar- ities between 2005 and 2017, point to a trend of upward convergence. Nonetheless, Table 3 shows that periods of upward divergence could be spot- ted in certain years within this period. This means that while there is a general increase in the Gen- der Equality Index scores, the disparities be- tween Member States widened when some Mem- ber States outperformed others during some periods (2006-2007; 2011-2012; and 2013-2014). These findings show the importance of monitor- ing annual progress across the Member States if a common objective of gender equality in the EU is to be achieved in a smooth and gradual way. Further analysis suggests that the worst- performing Member States were catching up with the best-performers over the period. Mem- ber States with higher initial levels of gender equality in 2005, such as Sweden, Denmark or Finland (indicated by their position on the x-axis of Figure 6), showed slower growth in subse- quent years (indicated by their position on the y-axis).

Although the results of the convergence ana- lysis suggest a gradual narrowing of gaps on gender equality in the EU between 2005 and 2017, they do not shed light on the different de- velopments at Member State level. For instance, despite an average increase in the Gender Equality Index score during this period, not all of the Member States registered an improve- ment. This is known as upward convergence in the weak sense (Eurofound, 2017b). Convergence and divergence patterns of Member States 2005-2017 To see how the developments in the Gender Equality Index of individual Member States com- pare to the EU average, a systematic mapping of the patterns was carried out on the basis of the following information: (1) EU average perfor- mance (improvement or worsening); (2) Member State performance (improvement or worsening); (3) relative Member State performance in rela- tion to the EU average (better or worse); and (4) relative Member State speed in relation to the EU average (faster or slower). As a result, EU ( 3 ) This classification has been done with the Stata code developed by Eurofound following the methodology presented in Eurofound, 2018c.

Phenomena such as digitalisation, globalisation, migration and demographic change, including ageing, have not only transformed the EU labour market but also the primary consider ations in the debate over the future of work (European Commission, 2019). With paid work being the main source of income for most families and individuals, policies tackling the changing world of work need to put gender considerations at the heart of responses (ILO, 2019). Existing gender inequalities have to be addressed first and foremost to ensure gender injustice is not perpetuated and to improve the lives of both women and men from different generations and backgrounds. Although the gender gap in labour-market par- ticipation has narrowed over the years, the goal of the Europe 2020 strategy to reach a 75 % em- ployment rate for women and men alike remains elusive for women. While their employment rate in 2018 was just above 67 %, the 79 % rate for men had already surpassed the EU goal ( 4 ). This gender gap reflects numerous structural bar- riers inhibiting women\u2019s labour-market partic- ipation and other inequalities concerning the quality and accessibility of paid work. Gender segregation in the labour market is a well-known reality. It restricts life choices and the education and employment options of wom- en and men, and determines the status of their jobs. Segregation also drives the gender pay gap, further reinforces gender stereotypes and perpetuates unequal gender power relations in the public and private spheres (EIGE, 2017e). Environmental, demographic and socioeco- nomic changes are increasing the demand for care workers, predominantly women trapped in low-quality jobs (ILO, 2018a). The vast un- der-representation of women in sectors such as ICT points to a major waste of highly qualified human resources and economic potential (EIGE, 2018d). Reducing gender segregation across The domain of work measures the ex- tent to which women and men can benefit from equal access to employ- ment and good working conditions. The sub-domain of participation com- bines two indicators: the rate of full- time equivalent (FTE) employment and the duration of working life. The FTE employment rate takes into account the higher incidence of part-time employment among women and is obtained by comparing each worker\u2019s average number of hours worked with the average number of hours worked by a full-time worker (EIGE, 2014b). Gender segregation and quality of work are included in the second sub-domain. Sectoral segregation is measured through women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation in the education, human health and social work sectors. Quality of work is measured by flexible working-time arrangements and job prospects with flexibility of work capturing the ability of both genders to take time off for personal or family matters. The job prospects index (a Eurofound job quality index) captures continuity of employment defined by the type of employment contract, job security, career advancement prospects and development of the workplace in terms of the number of employees. It is meas- ured on a scale of between 0 and 100 points, where 100 indicates the best job prospects.

To achieve this economic and social growth, continuous efforts are needed to move towards a social model that enables both wom- en and men to be earners and carers. In 2017, a roadmap for Member States to inte- grate a gender perspective into the Europe- an Pillar of Social Rights was set out in its key principles. This included active support for se- cure and adaptable employment, fair wages, so- cial dialogue and work\u2014life balance (European Commission, 2017b). In recent years, work\u2014life balance has become a priority policy area for the EU. A key objective of the proposed work\u2014 life balance directive is to increase women\u2019s participation in the labour market and support their career progression through better sharing of both women and men\u2019s parental and caring responsibilities (European Commission, 2017c). The directive, among other initiatives, builds on the European Commission\u2019s Strategic Engage- ment for Gender Equality 2016-2019 , which also presents measures for work\u2014life balance. The fast-paced evolution of the world of work, partly through digitalisation, has made it critical to enhance women\u2019s and men\u2019s skills to ensure equal access to and participation in the labour market. Of particular concern is improving ac- cess to secure and quality jobs, especially for women in vulnerable situations such as victims of gender-based violence (Council of the Euro- pean Union, 2017). Similarly, the need to reform social protection systems to facilitate fair and decent working conditions for women and men in typical employment situations is highlight- ed in the proposal for a Council recommenda- tion on access to social protection for workers and the self-employed (European Commission, 2018e). Overall, only a simultaneous and holis- tic response to gender-related challenges in the world of work would ensure sustainable eco- nomic growth and more active management of the social and public finance risks of population ageing and global uncertainties. 2.1. Gender equality inching slowly forward in fast- changing world of work The score of 72.0 points in 2017 highlights the incremental overall progress made in the do- main of work since the 71.5-point score in 2015 and the 70.0-point score in 2005 (Figure 9). EU-level progress since 2005 was driven by the achievements of Member States that already had higher overall scores for this domain (SE, IE, LU, ES and DE) and that improved at a speed double the EU average. Cyprus and Malta also showed very strong progress between 2005 and 2017. On the other hand, and despite slowly improving situations, Italy and Greece demon- strated they had the most ground to make up, while Romania remained the only Member State with a domain score lower than that of 2005 (Figure 10). A breakdown of the two sub-domains revealed contrasting levels of progress. Participation at- tained a score of 80.9 points in 2017 (Figure 9). This represents a sturdier improvement from the 77.5 points in 2005 and a more balanced situation for women and men. The advance was largely due to gains in employment participa- tion rates in some Member States, particularly Ireland, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia. Between 2015 and 2017, improvement in these Member States exceeded 2 p.p.

Among Member States, scores in this sub-domain varied, ranging from Slovakia\u2019s 53.5 points to the Netherlands\u2019 74.2, but also showed no significant change since 2015. The exception was Estonia, whose score decreased by 1.7 points to 57.0 from 2015 to 2017. The latter scores show that the effectiveness of measures to reduce gender segregation in em- ployment remains limited, with women mostly occupying jobs in sectors that have generally lower remuneration levels, lower career pros- pects and fewer options for upskilling (EIGE, 2017c), revealing enduring inequalities. The seg- regation and quality of work sub-domain results underline that to achieve gender equality in the work domain, systematically and effectively tack- ling these persistent challenges and inequalities is critical. Although a strong emphasis was put on equal access to the labour market for a long time, the quality of working conditions, working time, precarious work and social protection re- lated to the non-standard forms of employment should more consistently become gender-relat- ed and important concerns for EU policymakers and others (EIGE, 2017d; Eurofound, 2018d; ILO, 2018a). 2.2. Women dominate part-time employment, consigning them to jobs with poorer career progression In 2017, the FTE employ- ment rate in the EU was 41 % for women and 57 % for men, an increase of about 1 p.p. for both gen- ders from 2015. This main- tains the gender gap in FTE employment unchanged at 16 p.p. over the period and shows that despite the overall employment rates of women being some- Figure 10: The domain of work scores for EU Member States, 2005, 2015 and 2017 Domain of work 72.0 S c o r e s 2017 2015 2005 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 IT EL SK CZ PL HU RO BG HR CY EE EU-28 DE FR PT ES SI MT LT BE LU LV FI IE AT UK NL DK SE The full-time equivalent employment rate of women is 41 % and of men 57 % ",

In 2018, 31 % of women and 8 % of men worked part-time ( 6 ). Overall FTE employment rates, which reflect the spread of part-time employment as well as overall la- bour-market participation, remained highly var- ied among Member States. The lowest (below or equal to 40 %) FTE rates for women were ob- served in Greece (31 %) and Italy (31 %), as well as Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Croatia and Malta (Figure 11). FTE employment gender gaps at national level also demonstrate very different labour-market opportunities for women and men. The largest gap to women\u2019s detriment was noted in Malta (25 p.p.), with the lowest observed in Finland and Sweden (8 p.p.). No steady narrowing of gender gaps in FTE employment have been noted na- tionally in recent years. Although FTE gender gaps widened (by at least 1 p.p.) between 2015 and 2017 in Denmark, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Slovenia, they also narrowed (by at least 1 p.p.) in Cyprus, Greece, Hungary ( 5 ) Eurostat (lfsa_ergan): 2018 employment rate for those aged 15-64: men, 73.8 % and women, 63.3 %. The latter employment statistics, in contrast to FTE, do not account for differences in part-time work prevalence between women and men. ( 6 ) Eurostat (lfsa_eppga): part-time employment as percentage of the total employment, by sex and age (%), age group 20-64. and Poland. This underlines not only the slow gains on FTE employment for both genders, but also the fragility of women\u2019s opportunities in the labour market. As women spend less time in paid work than men, they are also more likely to worry that their income in old age will be insufficient (Eu- rofound, 2018a). The gender pension gap, the gender pay gap and the weaker economic inde- pendence of women are reinforced by the con- centration of women and men in certain sectors and occupations (EIGE, 2017c). Women not only remain over-represented in education, human health and social work, but their employment in these sectors also increased by 2 p.p. between 2005 and 2017 to just over 30 %. In contrast, men\u2019s share of employment in these sectors stalled at around 8 % from 2005. Among Mem- ber States the gender gap in these fields dif- fered significantly in 2017, varying from the nar- rowest in Cyprus and Romania (13 p.p.) to the widest in Finland (31 p.p.). From 2015, the gen- der gap narrowed (by at least 1 p.p.) in Belgium and Austria, but widened (by at least 1 p.p.) in Figure 11: Full-time equivalent employment rate (FTE) by women and men, and EU Member State (15+, %), 2017 4157 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 EL IT ES HR BE FR NL EU-28 BG FI PT AT DE RO DK CY LU IE UK MT SI PL HU SK LV LT CZ EE SE P e r c e n t a g e Women Men Total Source : EIGE\u2019s calculation, EU LFS.

Motherhood, low education and migration are particular barriers to work for women Being a parent continues to hinder women, but not men, in the labour market. FTE employment rates of women with children were around 60 % (Figure 12) regardless of the family type. Lone fathers had a higher FTE employment rate (74 %), though this was still far lower than those of fathers living in a couple (88 %). These figures not only reveal the extent of fathers\u2019 possibili- ties to participate in the labour market when liv- ing in couples, they also show that the arrival of a child has the greatest negative impact on the mothers living in couples. The disproportionate weight of care duties on mothers limits their participation in or forces their withdrawal from the labour market. This is further backed up by 2014-2017 trends showing FTE employment rates for lone fathers improved at double the speed (+ 8 p.p.) of those for lone mothers and couples with children (+ 4 p.p.). While the most acute gender gap in FTE em- ployment was observed among couples with children (28 p.p.), very large differences between women and men\u2019s labour-market parti cipation were noted also for those aged 25-49 (19 p.p.) and 50-64 years (18 p.p.). These ages coincide with the peak times for family formation and in- creasing care duties \u2014 be it for children, grand- children or those who are older and ill. These gender gaps in FTE employment stress the need for wider and more gender-sensitive op- portunities for the equal sharing of care duties in our societies (see Chapter 9). Other major disparities between women and men exist among those with a lower level of qual- ifications and foreign-born population groups, where both strong gender norms still in play and fewer possibilities for employment lead to much lower participation by women in paid work. The gender gaps in FTE employment rates were as high as 19 p.p. among those with low qualifica- tions and 21 p.p. among people born outside the EU. These gaps widened by 2 p.p. between 2014 and 2017, worsening an already worrying situa- tion. Migrant women, moreover, are dispropor- tionately engaged in the informal economy, such Figure 12: Full-time equivalent employment rate (FTE) by women and men, age, family type, level of education, country of birth and disability (15+, %), EU, 2017 60 59 25 65 50 2 18 46 66 41 39 20 47 88 74 31 84 68 6 37 63 74 56 60 28 63 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 C o u p l e w i t h c h i l d r e n L o n e p a r e n t 1 5 - 2 4 2 5 - 4 9 5 0 - 6 4 6 5 + L o w M e d i u m H i g h N a t i v e b o r n F o r e i g n b o r n W i t h W i t h o u t Family Age Education Country of birth Disabilities P e r c e n t a g e Women Men Source : EIGE\u2019s calculation, EU LFS.

In addition, very low FTE employment rates are not- ed among people aged above 65 years and those with disabilities, especially women. Inter alia, this has consequences for current and future social security entitlements, as well as for upskilling and wider societal integration opportunities. By extending its analysis of intersecting inequal- ities to show how different groups of women and men are affected, the Gender Equality Index also highlights the situation of LGBTQI* people, Roma women and Muslim women in areas where sta- tistics or other research evidence are available. In several Member States, the use of a headscarf by Muslim women is an obstacle when applying for a job, regardless of a candidate\u2019s quali fications (EFOMW, 2017). It can similarly exclude them from certain jobs and sectors, such as those involving contact with customers (ENAR, 2016a, 2016b). Roma women report a much lower employment rate than Roma men, mostly due to lower edu- cational attainment, traditional gender roles and the lack of childcare options outside the house- hold. Access to the labour market is made even more difficult by living in segregated areas and the discrimination Roma face (FRA, 2014b). Similarly, discrimination and harassment in the workplace pose a problem for LGBT people in the EU. An LGBT survey found that one in five LGBT people had felt discriminated against in the workplace in the previous 12 months be- cause of their sexual orientation (FRA, 2013). More recent research (Eurofound, 2016) iden- tified large disparities within the group, with 15 % of bisexual men and 23 % of transgender people reporting discrimination at work. ",

Domain of money The discrepancies between the national eco- nomic performance measurements and the public\u2019s own evaluations of living standards have led to a call for a people-centred economy that would enable sustainable and more inclu- sive economic development (World Economic Forum, 2018). Recent years have seen wage increases and higher disposable income among households in a large majority of Member States (European Commission, 2018b). At the same time, Europe faces an increasing socioeconomic divide between those with the highest share of economic capital and the poorest (OECD, 2017). Despite progress on gender equality, inequali- ties between women and men in this domain remain a key aspect of this divide. Addressing this is essential to achieving sustainable and inclusive economic growth, as well as a decent living for all. Across the EU, women receive disproportion- ately lower earnings than men. The EU gender gap in hourly pay is 16 % (European Commis- sion, 2018c). The pay gender gap rises to 40 % when employment rates and overall labour-mar- ket participation are considered. The ramifi- cations include a 37 % gender gap in pension income, a situation that will persist for decades to come (European Commission, 2018d). Wom- en\u2019s economic independence, therefore, is far lower than men\u2019s, particularly as one in five women workers in the EU belong to the lowest wage group, compared to one in 10 men (EIGE, 2017d). Economic independence is an essential requisite for the self-fulfilment of women and men and guaranteeing equal access to financial resources is critical to the process. The European Commis- sion\u2019s EU action plan 2017-2019 \u2014 tackling the gender pay gap , aims to achieve this through action on eight priority areas to address the underlying root causes. This includes reinforc- ing the application of the equal pay principle and fighting occupational segregation. In Janu- ary 2019, the Commission launched a follow-up public consultation to assess the impact both of existing EU legislation and of pay transpar- ency recommendations. The principle of equal pay for work of equal value, enshrined in the European treaties since 1957, was reiterated as a principle in the 2017 european pillar of social rights and made a priority in the Euro- pean Commission\u2019s Strategic Engagement for The domain of money measures gender inequalities in access to financial resources and women\u2019s and men\u2019s economic situation. The sub-domain of financial resources includes women\u2019s and men\u2019s monthly earnings and income measured through two indicators. These are mean monthly earnings from work and mean equivalised net income. This latter indicator includes pensions, invest- ments, benefits and any other source in addition to earnings from paid work. Both indicators are expressed in the purchasing power standard (PPS), which is an artificial currency that accounts for differences in price levels between Member States. The sub-domain of economic resources captures women\u2019s and men\u2019s risk of poverty and the income distribution among women and men. Included among the indicators are the percentage of the population not at risk of poverty (those with an income above or equal to 60 % of the national median income) and the ratio of the bottom and top quintile by sex. The latter indicator is used to measure the level of income inequality among women and among men.

The link between reducing inequalities and the fight against poverty and other deprivations is also at the core of the sustainable develop- ment goals (SDGs). Adopted by United Nations member states in 2015 and endorsed by the EU, this shared blueprint for sustainable well-being includes targets on ending poverty, attaining gender equality and providing decent work and economic growth. 3.1. Patchy progress on gender- equal access to financial and economic resources With a score of 80.4 points in 2017, the domain of money showed continuing improvement from 2005 (73.9 points). This rating places the domain of money second only to health in surpassing 80 points in the Gender Equality Index. This suggests that, although significant gender gaps still exist on financial and economic resources, women and men have achieved somewhat more equitable settings in this domain than in many other domains (e.g. the domain of power). In comparison with 2015, the greatest progress (+ 2 points) was noted in three Member States (EE, HR and RO), although their achieved levels remain below the EU average. Regress (by at least 1 point) between 2015 and 2017 was noted in two Member States (LU, LT). Luxembourg, in spite of this, has the highest score in the EU. Lithuania, which already had one of the lowest scores in the EU, slipped further behind in the rankings. Between 2005 and 2017, Greece and Luxembourg had worsening situations, whereas particularly large gains (+ 10 points) have been noted in Estonia, Slovakia, Poland and Malta. Of the two sub-domains, gender equal ity in economic resources is in a better posi- tion (87.7 points) than financial resources (73.8 points), with the former contributing to the overall improvement in the money domain score. Although the situation in this sub-domain had Figure 13: Scores of the domain of money and its sub-domains, EU, 2005-2017 73.9 78.4 78.4 79.6 80.4 60.9 69.4 70.0 73.0 73.8 89.7 88.6 87.9 86.7 87.7 60 70 80 90 2005 2010 2012 2015 2017 Money Domain of money Financial Economic S c o r e s Figure 14: Scores for the domain of money, EU Member States, 2005, 2015 and 2017 80.4 BG RO LT LV EE EL HU PT HR SK PL ES CZ IT EU-28 CY UK SI MT IE DE AT FR NL SE DK FI BE LU S c o r e s 2017 2015 2005 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 Domain of money ",

Nonethe- less, the situation in 2017 still showed a wider gender gap in economic resources in compari- son to 2005. Progress in this area remains frag- ile in many Member States. Compared to the sub-domain of financial resources, where no sig- nificant (+ 1 point) Member State-level regress was noted between 2015 and 2017, gender inequalities in economic resources worsened in six Member States: Luxembourg (\u2013 4.8 points), Lithuania (\u2013 4.3), Bulgaria (\u2013 3.4), the Nether- lands (\u2013 1.9), Malta (\u2013 1.4) and Sweden (\u2013 1.2). The situation in Bulgaria is particularly worrying due to a major and continuous decline in gen- der equality in this area from 2005 (88.1 points) to 2017 (76.1 points). In 11 other Member States (DK, DE, ES, FR, IT, LT, LU, HU, MT, AT, SE) and the EU as a whole, gender equality in the sub-do- main of economic resources was greater in 2005 than in 2017. 3.2. Paying the price for motherhood To better capture the impact of income-generat- ing opportunities for women and men, various income sources, measures and breakdowns in gender gaps in pay that combine the effect of individual, household, organisational and coun- try characteristics have to be examined (EIGE, 2019c). The gender gaps in individual earnings point to women\u2019s much larger disadvantage than men in gaining income when compared to what household-level statistical measures, such as at-risk-of-poverty rates, show. The rise of household disposable income (mean annual equivalised net income) observed during 2005-2015 continued into 2017. Between 2015 and 2017, women\u2019s income increased by 874 PPS to 17 343 PPS and men\u2019s by 925 PPS to 18 121 PPS. The latter increases sustained the gender gap in disposable income at 4 % to women\u2019s disadvantage. This statistical measure is calculated on the basis of various incomes pooled at the household level, which suggests that all adults, irrespective of their gender, are attributed the same share of household income if living in the same household. Gen- der differences in mean equivalised net income are therefore mainly due to varied income sit- uations of different household types rather than differences, for example, in the salaries of women and men. Mean monthly gross earn- ings (before tax deductions and social security contributions) of women and men employees, which refer to individual incomes, show that on average in the EU, women employees in com- panies with at least 10 employees earn about 80 % of what their male counterparts earn (2 249 PPS vs 2 809 PPS respectively). The latter gender gap depicts the magnitude of gender gaps in financial resources, as also indicated by individual-level measures, for example the EU average gender pay gap of 16 % or the gender gap in overall earnings of 40 % (EIGE, 2019c). Further differences across women\u2019s and men\u2019s employee groups exist. For example, the gen- der gap (7 %) in gross monthly earnings in PPS (Figure 15) among employees aged 15-24 years was more than five times lower than among employees aged 65 years or above (gender gap of 38 %) or employees with dependent children and living in a couple (gender gap of 36 %). This statistic supports wider research findings that family formation and corresponding gen- der norms and stereotypes are key factors in both the occurrence and widening of gender inequalities in pay during the life-course (EIGE, 2019c).

        "Domain of money European Institute for Gender Equality 38 3.3. Lifetime pay inequalities fall on older women Despite growing population income and women\u2019s con- tinuing gains in education and employment, gender gaps in pay ensure poverty is mostly concentrated in families where women are the sole earners. In 2017, 35 % of lone mothers in the EU were at risk of poverty, compared to 28 % of lone fathers ( 7 ). The latter fig- ure not only spotlights the sizeable gender gap in this group, it also underlines the high level of vulnerability to poverty among lone parents. Although acknowledged by policymakers, exist- ing remedies remain limited in their effective- ness, not least because of barriers to accessing work and earning a decent income. The risk of poverty rises sharply along the life- course, pointing to the accumulating impact of pay inequalities. Poverty among those aged ( 7 ) EIGE\u2019s calculation, EU-SILC. 75 years and above is consistently concentrated among women, due mainly to the impact of women\u2019s reduced time in work and/or lower earnings throughout their careers and therefore the lower pensions they receive. Although wom- en\u2019s shouldering of unpaid care duties is often perceived as a \u2018family\u2019 choice, poverty rates among older people reflect the adverse impact on women\u2019s individual well-being from such gendered arrangements. With the exception of a handful of Member States (HU, NL, DK, BE), at-risk-of-poverty rates among women aged 75 or more were higher (2-10 p.p.) or much higher (+ 10 p.p.) than among older men (Figure 16) in 2017. In some instances where the gender gap was above 20 p.p., this was accompanied by sig- nificant rates of poverty (45-57 %) among older women. This situation was particularly prevalent in Estonia, Bulgaria and Lithuania. The response to the feminisation of poverty in older age in general requires more explicit soci- etal awareness of the financial impact of unpaid duties, a burden primarily borne by women. It also requires income redistribution mecha- nisms (both within and outside the social-pro- Figure 15: Mean monthly gross earnings in PPS of women and men, by age, family type, level of education, country of birth and disability, EU, 2017 14 % 31 % 31 % 36 % 7 % 26 % 34 % 38 % 30 % 27 % 33 % 27 % 25 % 28 % 26 % 28 % 0 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500 S i n g l e L o n e p a r e n t s C o u p l e w i t h o u t c h i l d r e n C o u p l e w i t h c h i l d r e n 1 5 - 2 4 2 5 - 4 9 5 0 - 6 4 6 5 + L o w M e d i u m H i g h N a t i v e b o r n E U b o r n N o n - E U b o r n W i t h W i t h o u t Family Age Education Country of birth Disabilities P P S Women\u2019s earnings Men\u2019s earnings Gender gap (%) Source: EIGE\u2019s calculation, European Union statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC).

High at-risk-of-poverty rates also remain evi- dent among women and men with low educa- tional attainment (26 % and 25 % respectively) and among those born outside the EU (32 % for both genders) ( 8 ). Among migrant households, gender gaps in at-risk-of-poverty rates are less visible as income is estimated at household level. Nonetheless, existing research indicates that women and men from non-EU countries often struggle to access the labour market or tend to work in low-paid, unstable jobs (Insti- tute of Development Studies, 2016), with women migrants facing even more barriers to quality jobs. The trend in Europe for domestic work (often irregular, low-paid, dead-end jobs increasingly carried out by migrant women) implies women\u2019s economic independence gained through this type of work is very fragile (Triandafyllidou, 2013). The financial and economic situation for some groups of women and men across the EU is ( 8 ) EIGE\u2019s calculation, EU-SILC. especially difficult. Europe\u2019s largest minority, the Roma, experience deep poverty and poor socioeconomic conditions. According to a 2018 survey by the European Union Agency for Fun- damental Rights (FRA, 2018), 80 % of Roma interviewed were at risk of poverty compared to an EU average of 17 %, 30 % of Roma were living in households with no tap water and 46 % had no indoor sanitation facilities. When employed, Roma women earn less than Roma men, whose wages in turn are well below those of the non- Roma population. Direct comparison of men\u2019s and women\u2019s earnings by ethnicity showed a larger gender gap among Roma workers than non-Roma workers (O\u2019Higgins, 2015). Disability also increases the risk of poverty for both women and men. More than half of women of working age with disabilities are economically inactive. They are more likely to be affected by an inability to meet unexpected financial expenses than men with disabilities and women without, and are at a higher risk of economic and social marginalisation than either of the other groups (European Parliament, 2017). In all Member States the severe material deprivation rate of women with disabilities is also higher than that of women without disabilities.

Data on the financial and economic situation of LGBT people in Europe is scarce. However, drawing upon information from other world regions and qualitative case stud- ies, it is possible to state that this social group faces a high risk of financial insecurity, poverty and even homelessness. Estimates show that between 20 % and 40 % of young homeless people identify as LGBTQI in the United States and Canada, with United Kingdom data suggest- ing a respective figure of 25 % (Feantsa, 2017).

( 10 ) EIGE\u2019s calculation, Eurostat, Education Statistics, 2017 (educ_uoe_enrt03). ( 11 ) Eurostat, EU LFS, 2018 (trng_lfs_01). Education is a powerful driver of more gen- der-equal and inclusive societies. Equal access to education and a fair and high-quality edu- cational process for girls and boys and women and men provide benefits at individual and societal level (EIGE, 2018c). Education is also a tool to raise awareness of the key principles of equality between women and men and to pre- vent a backlash against women\u2019s rights (Euro- pean Parliament, 2019). The Gender Equality Index for the domain of knowledge reveals how women\u2019s educational attainment is rising, but overall positive develop- ment is being held back by strong gender segre- gation and low engagement in lifelong learning. While young women (aged 30-34 years) have already exceeded the Europe 2020 tertiary edu- cation target of 40 % (46 %), the share of men tertiary graduates has yet to reach it (36 %) ( 9 ). About half of EU students graduate in two main fields of education, with gender concentration striking in both. Just over a fifth (21 %) of men tertiary students graduate in education, health and welfare, humanities and arts ( 10 ), while only 33 % of women students graduate in STEM (EIGE, 2018c). Such a divide is mirrored by the gender segregation in the equivalent labour market, determining women\u2019s and men\u2019s earn- ings, career prospects and working conditions. Of growing concern is a lack of participation in lifelong learning. The majority of Member States lag far behind the strategic framework for Euro- pean cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) benchmark of 15 % of adults aged 25-64 years engaged in lifelong learning (Coun- cil of the European Union, 2009). Between 2013 and 2017 the participation figure stagnated at 11 % ( 11 ), with women more likely to engage in adult learning than men in the majority of Mem- ber States. Participation is often low among those who would benefit the most from educa- tion and training, for example women with low levels of qualification or women engaged in pre- carious employment.

Adult participation in learning plays a crucial role in the Europe 2020 flagship initiative, \u2018An agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019, and played a similarly important role in the concluded \u2018Youth on the move\u2019 initiative (Euro- pean Commission, 2010). In addition, the Euro- pean Council\u2019s resolution on a renewed Euro- pean agenda for adult learning addresses the challenge of raising participation rates among adults in learning activities (Council of the Euro- pean Union, 2011). 4.1. Gender equality in education standing still even as women graduates outnumber men graduates With a total EU score of 63.5 points, the domain of knowledge remained virtually static between 2015 and 2017 and only improved by 2.7 points over the entire 12-year period from 2005 (Figure 17). The slow but positive change in the domain has been propelled forward by improving educational attainment among men and women. This is one of the few domains where a gender gap has been reversed since 2005 \u2014 women now outperform men in ter- tiary educational attainment in most Member States. However, gender segregation in educa- tion and the generally low participation levels in formal and non-formal education and train- ing among women and men remain major hurdles, holding back overall progress in this domain. Most Member States experienced hardly any improvement in the knowledge domain from 2015. An increase was registered in Estonia (+ 2.3), Spain (+ 2.1) and Czechia (+ 1.7), while scores dropped in Cyprus (\u2013 2.0), the United Kingdom (\u2013 1.4) and Denmark (\u2013 1.3). As Fig- ure 18 illustrates, the greatest overall progress between 2005 and 2017 was achieved in Cyprus (+ 13.1), Greece (+ 8.5) and Spain (+ 8.1). The biggest setbacks were in the United Kingdom (\u2013 5.4), Germany (\u2013 1.6) and Denmark (\u2013 1.4). Over the 12-year period, the sub-domain of attainment and participation achieved the high- est increase in the domain of knowledge: from 67.0 to 72.8 points (Figure 17). Luxembourg and Czechia made the most significant improve- ments in this area (+ 18.9 and + 17.9 points respectively), with seven other Member States progressing by more than 10 points (IE, EL, FR, MT, NL, AT, PT). The situation deteriorated in three Member States: the United Kingdom (\u2013 6.0), Poland (\u2013 1.5) and Slovenia (\u2013 1.0). Gender segregation in education remains a major block to gender equality in the EU, with this sub-domain showing almost no change from 2005 (55.2 points) to 2017 (55.4 points). Cyprus made the most substantial long-term progress in this sub-domain with an increase of 14.8 points, mostly from a greater proportion of men studying education, health and wel- fare, humanities and arts. Another five Member States saw a long-term increase of more than 7 points (EE, ES, IT, SI, SK). In contrast, there was significant regression for Malta (\u2013 11.2) and Ger- many (\u2013 7.7) over the same period.

Both women and men limit their study fields In the EU, more women and men graduate from universities than in the past. Between 2005 and 2017, the EU average for ter- tiary education graduates grew by 7 p.p. to 25 % ( 12 ), with almost all of the growth taking place in the first 10 years. Women strongly outnumbered men as tertiary graduates, with a gender gap in Estonia of 16 p.p., in Latvia of 13 p.p. and in Sweden of 11 p.p. Men were more likely to graduate from universities in four Member States: Germany (with the larg- est gender gap of 8 p.p.), Austria, Malta and Hungary (showing gaps below 4 p.p.). An inter- sectional analysis revealed that though more women than men aged 15-49 gained tertiary education, a reverse trend was evident in the 50+ age group. Meanwhile, an intersection of gender and disability discovered an EU-28 gender gap advantageous to men (2 p.p.) among people with disabilities. Among people without disabilities, this gap is reversed and stands at 1 p.p. ( 13 ). ( 12 ) EIGE\u2019s calculation, EU LFS, 2017. ( 13 ) EIGE\u2019s calculation, EU LFS, 2017. Educational attainment can be challenging for people from deprived socioeconomic back- grounds given that students\u2019 socioeconomic status impacts strongly on their educational participation and outcomes (OECD, 2018a). While poor school performance does not necessarily stem from poverty, schools often reproduce existing patterns of socioeconomic (dis)advantage rather than creating a more bal- anced distribution of learning opportunities and outcomes for students (OECD, 2018a). This ten- dency can be traced in the situation of groups from marginalised communities, such as Roma. On average, 63 % of Roma aged 16-24 years were not employed, nor in education or training in the EU in 2016. Among young Roma women, that figure rose to 72 % (FRA, 2016). Although a higher proportion of working-age women are better educated than men, this does not translate into more favourable labour-market outcomes. Women work more often in part-time positions, face precarious conditions at work or receive lower pay: wom- en\u2019s gross hourly pay is 16 % lower than that Figure 18: Scores for the domain of knowledge, EU Member States, 2005, 2015 and 2017 2015 2005 63.5 LV HR RO BG DE PT EE EL LT SI CY PL HU CZ SK FI IT EU-28 AT MT FR IE NL ES LU UK BE DK SE S c o r e s 2017 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Domain of knowledge 1 ",

The addition of the \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 or the \u2018sticky floor\u2019 phenomena that predomi- nantly affect women also harms their career progression. In measuring gender division in the tertiary fields of education, health and welfare, humanities and arts to identify gender inequality through levels of educational segregation, the Gender Equal- ity Index found that, in 2017, 43 % of all women at university were studying in these fields, with the gender gap in the EU as a whole at 22 p.p., remaining unchanged since 2005. The level of gender segregation varied significantly among Member States (Figure 19). The highest gender gap in enrolment in the above fields was regis- tered in Finland at 33 p.p. In another four Mem- ber States, it was above 25 p.p. (DK, EE, LV, LT). In contrast, Bulgaria and Romania (15 p.p.) had the lowest gender gaps. Several EU Member States saw substantial changes on this issue in ( 14 ) Eurostat, Gender pay gap in unadjusted form by NACE Rev. 2 activity \u2014 structure of earnings survey methodology (earn_gr_ gpgr2). the 12 years following 2005. While the gap was cut by 11 p.p. in the Netherlands and by more than 5 p.p. in Denmark, Germany and Italy, there was a 6 p.p. increase in Hungary, with another five Member States witnessing a spike of more than 4 p.p. (BG, MT, PL, RO, SI). Gender segregation is particularly persistent in STEM subjects with women constituting about 33 % of graduates in STEM tertiary education and only 13 % of graduates in STEM vocational education (EIGE, 2018c). However, certain STEM subfields such as natural sciences, mathemat- ics and statistics are gender balanced or even dominated by women. Reducing segregation in education and simultaneously involving more women in the STEM study fields would have sig- nificant benefits for the economy. The European Commission estimates that by 2020 there will be a shortage about 500 000 ICT specialists in the EU (European Commission, 2017d).

Adult learning stalls most when reskilling needs are greatest Up-to-date skills and knowl- edge are crucially important in the rapidly evolving labour market. Regardless of the level of education attained, participation in subsequent formal and non-formal learn- ing activities ensures women and men keep pace with ever-changing labour-mar- ket needs. Nevertheless, the proportion of women and men (aged 15+) in formal or non-formal education and training remained low in the EU (17 %) in 2017, and has barely altered from 2005 ( 15 ). However, there were large differences between Member States. Sweden and Denmark, for example, had the highest participation rates (35 % and 33 % respectively), while Bulgaria ( 15 ) EIGE\u2019s calculation, EU LFS. and Romania had the lowest rates (both 9 %). Differences in adult learning between women and men generally remained very small across the EU, with a gap of less than 1 p.p. in 17 EU Member States. Sweden, Denmark and France (respective gaps of 12 p.p., 7.8 p.p. and 4.9 p.p. in favour of women) were the only clear excep- tions. The intersectional analysis revealed large differ- ences in formal and non-formal learning related to age. Figure 20 illustrates that as people age, their participation in education and training drops. Unsurprisingly, women and men aged 15-24 in 2017 had the highest rates of adult learning (67 % and 64 % respectively) as most were still enrolled in formal education. However, among the 25-49 year age cohort figures for adult participation in formal or informal edu- cation had dropped significantly, to 14 % of women and 12 % for men. By the time people were approaching or in retirement, participa- tion rates for both women and men had fallen into single digits. 43 % of women and 21 % of men in universities are studying education, health and welfare, humanities and arts Figure 20: Participation in formal or non-formal education and training of women and men, by family type, age, level of education, and country of birth (15+, %), and gender gaps, EU, 2017 11 16 9 13 67 14 8 3 15 16 21 17 15 16 13 20 7 11 64 12 6 2 18 14 17 16 13 15 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 S i n g l e L o n e p a r e n t s C o u p l e w i t h o u t c h i l d r e n C o u p l e w i t h c h i l d r e n 1 5 - 2 4 2 5 - 4 9 5 0 - 6 4 6 5 + L o w M e d i u m H i g h N a t i v e b o r n E U b o r n N o n - E U b o r n P e r c e n t a g e Women Men Family Age Education Country of birth Source: EIGE\u2019s calculation, European Union labour force survey (EU LFS).

The lack of time due to work or family-re- lated duties are the strongest barriers to adult learning. While work schedules play a more significant role in preventing men from par- ticipation, the opposite is true for women, for whom family reasons represent higher barrier levels (see Section 9.7 on lifelong learning). These increase significantly when children under 5 years of age are brought into the mix (EIGE, 2017d). ",

Domain of time The time that women and men have for personal matters and their families has become a broadly debated issue in the EU. Besides the need for self-care and care for others, it implies the nego- tiation of boundaries between paid and unpaid work (Hochschild, 1997), as well as the negotiation of the role of carers within families and society. Through gender stereotyping, domestic and care work (mostly unpaid) is associated with women, and paid work with men. As a result, the unequal distribution of time spent on caring and house- work activities between women and men remains a major hurdle to progress on gender equality. Hence, current and future policy initiatives need to aim for a more balanced distribution of time spent at work and home for everyone. They should also aim for a better gender distribution of unpaid care and housework or to improve the value of care work in general. The disproportionate amount of time women spend on care and domestic chores impacts upon their participation in employment and opportunities for social, personal and civic activ- ities, reinforcing gender segregation in edu- cation and the labour market. It also affects women\u2019s employment patterns and prospects by exacerbating their involvement in precarious work, with consequences for gender gaps in pay and pensions (EIGE, 2015c, 2016b, 2017d). Gen- der inequalities in unpaid labour are all the more relevant as women\u2019s overall participation in paid work has increased without a corresponding change in time-use patterns. This means that, on a daily basis, women are increasingly expected to carry the \u2018double burden\u2019 of balancing paid and unpaid activities. As a result, when both are considered, women work an average of 55 hours per week compared to 49 hours worked by men (Eurofound, 2017a, p. 116). To address the inequalities on caring activities, the European Commission issued a proposal for a directive on work\u2014life balance for parents and carers in 2017. Under the umbrella of the European Pillar of Social Rights, the proposed directive promotes a gender-equal sharing of care responsibilities and establishes \u2018minimum The domain of time measures gender inequalities in the allo- cation of time for care and domestic work and social activ- ities. The first sub-domain of care activities measures gen- der gaps in women\u2019s and men\u2019s involvement in the care and/or education of their children, grandchildren and older and dis- abled people. It also measures their involvement in cooking and housework. The second sub-domain explores how many women and men engage in social activities. Concretely, it measures gender gaps in women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation in sport, cultural or leis ure activities outside of their home, combined with their engagement in voluntary and charitable activities. There has been no new published data in this domain since the last edition of the Index, and the next wave of survey data (European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) and European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS)) will not be released before 2021, posing challenges for regular and better tracking of progress in this area. Given the lack of new data, this chapter mostly provides a brief summary of previous findings and presents some additional information on policy developments and vulnerabilities of specific groups.

The Directive was adopted on 20 June 2019. Recognising that gender gaps in employment are most acute between women and men with caring responsibilities, the European Council reaffirmed the so-called Barcelona targets in the European Pact for Gender Equality . The first target called on Member States to ensure that 33 % of children below 3 years of age attend childcare facilities. This is now a reality for the EU as a whole, although significant variations exist among Member States. A second target, aiming to provide childcare for 90 % of children from the age of three to mandatory school-going age, progressed to a promising EU average of 85 % in 2017 ( 16 ). With the second target nearly met and the first being consolidated, the EU Com- mission is considering a review of the Barcelona targets following consultations with Member States (European Commission, 2018f). Member State-specific information on the Barcelona tar- gets and how they link with gender equality is provided in Section 9.4 of this report. 5.1. Enduring burden of care perpetuates inequalities for women Unrelenting and growing inequalities in wom- en\u2019s and men\u2019s use of time are reflected by the overall downward score for this domain. Not only was the 2017 score (65.7) 1 point lower than that of 2005, it also represented a 3.2-point drop from the gains that had been achieved up until 2012 (Figure 21). While gender imbalances in the sub-domain of care and domestic activities remained relatively stable between 2005 and 2017 (with a score of around 70 points), they increased in social activities as the score dropped by 2 points to 61.6 points. ( 16 ) Eurostat, Children in formal childcare or education by age group and duration \u2014 % over the population of each age group \u2014 EU- SILC survey \u2018ilc_caindformal\u2019. The enduringly large gender gap in time devoted to care and housework contributed to this domain\u2019s overall low score. Indeed, women in the EU were disproportionally more engaged in unpaid care work in 2017. Almost 38 % took care of children, grandchildren, older people and/or people with disabilities every day for 1 hour or more compared with 25 % of men (EIGE, 2017c). Even more strikingly, only 34 % of men engaged in cooking and housework every day for 1 hour or more in comparison with 79 % of women, with the situation barely changing in more than a decade. The unalleviated burden of care and housework not only limits women\u2019s social and personal development or career pro- gression, it is the primary reason for economic inactivity or part-time work. As much as 10 % of women, compared to 0.5 % of men, either do not work or work part-time because of care responsibilities. While gender gaps in leisure, sport, cultural (4 p.p.) and charitable activities (\u2013 1 p.p.) are much smaller, working women\u2019s and men\u2019s par- ticipation in this area is extremely low in some Member States. Of even greater significance is the high variation among Member States. In 10 of them (BG, EL, HR, CY, LT, HU, PT, RO, SK, PL), fewer than one in five workers are engaged in any sport, cultural or leisure activities outside the home at least every other day.

In Spain and Lithuania, 5 % of workers are engaged in voluntary or char- itable activities at least once a month; in Bul- garia it is only 3 %; and in eight other Mem- ber States (BE, EL, CY, LV, PL, PT, RO, SK) the participation dropped to less than 10 %. The lack of time for engaging in social, cultural and charitable activities has an impact on women\u2019s and men\u2019s personal development and well-be- ing, and on social cohesiveness and solidarity in general. A more encouraging situation is, however, evi- dent in other Member States. More than 50 % of workers take part in sport, cultural and leis- ure activities in Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands, with at least 20 % engaging in charitable activities in Sweden, the Netherlands and Slovenia. 5.2. Uneven impact of family life on women and men Not only does family type determine the overall time that women and men spend caring for their children, grandchildren, older people or people with disabilities, it also impacts gender inequalities in caring. When different types of families are compared, a distinct difference is observed. While 85 % of women living in a couple with children do at least 1 hour of childcare work per day, this only holds true for 67 % of men. The gender gap increases to 60 p.p. for food preparation and housework, with 92 % of women cooking for at least 1 hour every day. One-parent families also reflect gender differences, as lone fathers are more likely to live with older chil- dren. This partially explains that while 76 % of lone mothers do childcare work every day, only 38 % of lone fathers do likewise. For this family type, the gender gap in domestic work narrows to 24 p.p., with 87 % of lone mothers cooking and/or doing housework every day for at least 1 hour a day. Family formation plays a role when analysing the situation of women and men from differ- ent age groups. The age cohort most likely 79 % of women and only 34 % of men do cooking and housework every day for one hour or more Figure 22: Scores for the domain of time, EU Member States, 2005 and 2017 65.7 BG EL SK PT RO LT HR CY PL HU CZ IT AT ES MT DE BE EU-28 LV FR LU UK SI IE EE FI DK NL SE S c o r e s 2017 2005 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 Domain of time Note: Due to lack of data, the 2017 Index scores are used.

Altogether, 61 % of women of this age group care for others every day com- pared to 39 % of men. In fact, women spend more time in care work than men throughout their life. The gender gap among young peo- ple (15-24 years old) is lower (12 p.p.), with just 3 % of young men doing care work every day. Different patterns of socialisation and gen- der norms are also obvious in relation to food preparation, with 21 % of young men cooking every day compared to 42 % of young women. With older women taking on the lion\u2019s share of care duties, and current demographic trends in the EU, the percentage of women caring for older people is certain to increase in the future. For gender equality, economic growth and the well-being of both older people and their carers, a more intense policy push to develop accessible and quality care services is urgently needed. Efforts should factor in assistance for the high numbers of women and men with disabilities caring for others. The Index shows that 29 % of women and 20 % of men with disabilities in the EU do care work every day. The intersection of country of birth and gender in care work underscores yet again the impact of migration on gender equality. Men residing in the country they were born in are least likely to spend every day caring for others (24 %). The share increases slightly for men born outside the EU (28 %) and men coming from a different Member State (29 %). However, for women from non-EU countries, the figure jumps to 46 %, compared to 38 % for women coming from a different EU Member States or 37 % for those living in their country of birth. The gender gap in labour-market participation among Roma people could, to some extent, be due to the higher engagement of women in domestic work as their main activity. In 2016, 28 % of all Roma women surveyed indicated domestic work as their main activity, com- pared to only 6 % of all Roma men. This could be explained partly by traditional gender-role expectations among Roma people (FRA, 2016) and partly by the discrimination faced by Roma women in education and employment, lead- ing to some families seeing marriage and the role of family carer as the only viable option for Roma girls (Andrei, Martinidis, & Tkadlecova, 2015; Oprea, 2005).

Domain of power A hundred years ago, women across the EU made historic gains \u2014 they won the right to vote and to be elected, and they held pioneer- ing positions in national decision-making bodies (European Parliament, 2019). A century later, the composition of parliamentary assemblies and executive government at all territorial levels often fails to reflect the gender diversity of the population they represent, with women usually significantly under-represented in politics. In business, despite political and media attention, pressure from shareholders and an ever-growing body of research on the performance benefits of gender-balanced decision-making, corporate boards also remain heavily dominated by men. The European Commission brought the issue to the fore of the political agenda in 2010 by con- sidering possible legislative action (European Commission, 2011). It followed this though in 2012 with a proposed directive to improve gen- der balance among non-executive directors of listed companies, targeting at least 40 % of the under-represented sex (European Commission, 2012). More recently, EU actions to tackle verti- cal (gender) segregation in companies, sectors and occupations form a key part of the Commis- sion\u2019s 2017-2019 action plan to tackle the gen- der pay gap. Decision-making in research-funding institu- tions, media and sports organisations indicates that women\u2019s opportunities to influence the pol- icies, funding and content remain limited. This despite the growing involvement of women in research, their employment in the media sector and their participation in sport. 6.1.

However, it has steadily increased: by 3.4 points since 2015 and by 13 points since 2005. The majority of Member States experienced an increase in the score of the domain of power after 2015. The average increase for them is higher than the EU total average (4.4 points) and is driven by progress in the social (7.1 points) and economic (5.5 points) sub-domains.

Greater gender balance on the boards of the largest publicly quoted companies lay behind this trend.

Democracy undermined by absence of gender parity in politics The proportion of women in national parlia- ments (single/lower house) across the 28 EU Member States has gradually increased: from 21 % in 2005 to an all-time high of 30 % in 2018. Parliaments in Sweden, Finland, Belgium and Spain are gender balanced (i.e. at least 40 % of each gender), whereas women account for less than 20 % of parliamentarians in Greece, Cyprus, Malta and Hungary. Two elections in 2018 in particular saw signifi- cant changes to women\u2019s representation in national parliaments (Latvia and Luxembourg). While the percentage of women parliamentar- ians in Latvia jumped from 18 % to 31 %, in Luxembourg it dropped from 32 % to 22 %. Since 2015 progress has been made in France (+ 11 p.p.), Romania (+ 7 p.p.) and Bulgaria (+ 6 p.p.). Lower gains were achieved in Austria, Cyprus and Estonia (+ 5 p.p.), Ireland, Italy and Portugal (+ 4 p.p.), and Poland and the United Kingdom (+ 3 p.p.). Besides Luxembourg, the share of women in parliament declined in Croa- tia and Germany (\u2013 5 p.p.), Greece (\u2013 4 p.p.) and Lithuania (\u2013 3 p.p.).

The remaining one third of MPs are elected in constituencies with majoritarian systems, and the quota is 40-60. ( 19 ) Data collection in May-June 2018 identified 152 parties across the 28 EU Member States. A number of Member States have taken initiatives to improve the gender balance in their parlia- ments. Quotas on parliamentary candidates are currently in place in 10 Member States: Belgium, Croatia, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain. With the exception of Croatia, women\u2019s representation has improved since the application of a quota ( 17 ). However, only Portugal and Spain saw quota targets trans- lating into an equivalent (or almost) proportion of elected members of parliament. In all other cases, disparities between the quota target and women in parliament remain substantial: 8 p.p. in Ireland and Poland; 11 p.p. in Belgium and Slovenia; 13 p.p. in France and Greece; 15 p.p. in Italy ( 18 ); and more than 20 p.p. in Croatia. Political parties often act as gatekeepers against gender equality since they set party policy and select candidates for election. In 2018, women accounted for fewer than one in five (18 %) lead- ers of major political parties (those with more than 5 % of seats in parliament) across the EU, and one in three deputy leaders (34 %) ( 19 ). In Czechia, Hungary, Malta and Slovakia, none of the major parties has had a woman leader since data was first collected in 2011. The gender balance among cabinet ministers in national governments has been moving in the right direction since 2005, with the share of women ministers growing from 21 % at the end of 2005 to 31 % in November 2018. There are, however, considerable variations between Member States. Although governments in Spain, Sweden, France, Germany and Denmark are gender balanced (with at least 40 % of senior ministers of each gender), in all the other national governments men account for more than 60 % of cabinet ministers. In 2019, Lith- uania became the only EU Member State with an all-male government, with Hungary close behind. In 2018, after appointing its first woman minister since 2014, men accounted for 93 % of Hungary\u2019s cabinet ministers.

Nevertheless, in the past year, there were sig- nificant increases in the share of women among cabinet ministers in Czechia (12 % to 27 %), Spain (36 % to 61 %), Cyprus (8 % to 17 %), Austria (21 % to 36 %), Portugal (17 % to 29 %), Romania (21 % to 33 %) and Slovakia (20 % to 33 %) ( 20 ). While the continued under-representation of women in government remains a fundamen- tal concern, the political sidelining of women at cabinet level is just as worrying when allocating the portfolios usually considered to have lower political priority or seen as \u2018soft\u2019. In November 2018, two thirds (66 %) of all male cabinet minis- ters in the EU held a portfolio with a high profile (so-called basic or economic functions) compared to just over half (51 %) of female ministers. More- over, 40 % of all women ministers had a sociocul- tural portfolio compared to just 19 % of men. ( 20 ) EIGE\u2019s Gender statistics database, WMID, November 2018. The rate of change at regional and local levels is extremely slow. In 2018 women held a third (33 %) of the seats in regional assemblies in the 20 Member States with regional councils, marginally higher (3 p.p.) than in 2010. Regional assemblies included at least 40 % of each gen- der in five Member States (BE, ES, FR, FI, SE). However, in Italy, Romania, Slovakia and Hun- gary men occupied more than four out of every five seats. The latest local/municipal council data from June 2017 in all Member States showed that women accounted for 32 % of all members. Only councils in Sweden comprised at least 40 % of each gender, while those in Croatia, Greece, Cyprus and Romania comprised more than 80 % men. Local government leadership clearly remains elusive for women, who held only 15 % of local leadership positions (mayor or other leader of the municipal council) across the EU.

More gender equality on corporate boards \u2014 but only in a few Member States The proportion of women on the boards of the lar- gest listed companies in the EU-28 more than doubled between 2010 and 2018 (from 12 % to 26 %), after the European Commission brought the issue to the pol- icy fore. However, progress was concentrated in just a few Member States where governments took legislative or other forms of action. France remained the only Member State with at least 40 % of each gender on the com- bined boards of the companies covered ( 21 ). Only in four Member States (IT, SE, FI, DE) did women account for at least a third (+ 33 %) of board members. In just under half of Member States (13), men outnumber women by at least four to one (i.e. < 20 % women), including in Malta, Greece and Estonia, where women repre- sented less than 10 % of board members. In the remaining Member States (10), the proportion of women on the boards of the largest listed companies is between 20 % and 33 %. Six Member States have legislated gender quotas to address the gender imbalance in boardrooms: Belgium, Italy and Portugal (33 %), Germany and Austria (30 %) and France (40 %). A softer approach is taken in 11 other Mem- ber States (DK, IE, EL, ES, LU, NL, PL, SI, FI, SE, UK). This includes legislated quotas restricted to state-owned companies or applied without sanctions in Greece, Slovenia and Spain, while others have preferred to encourage companies to self-regulate in order to redress the gen- der balance in corporate boardrooms. In the remaining 11 Member States (BG, CZ, EE, HR, ( 21 ) The share of women on boards in France first reached 40 % in October 2016, driven by a law introduced in 2011 that required all large companies (> 500 employees or a turnover of > EUR 50 million) to have \u2265 40 % of each gender on boards by January 2017. ( 22 ) Austria and Portugal have not been included under the binding quotas group despite the fact that both have been enforcing legislative quotas since January 2018. The quotas are fairly recent and will take some time to show any impact. They are included instead under the soft measures. CY, LV, LT, HU, MT, RO, SK) there has been no substantial government action. The difference between action and inaction is striking. In 2018, the four Member States with binding quotas (BE, DE, FR, IT) had boards with 38 % women (an aggregate of all companies covered in those Member States), representing a rise of 28 p.p. since 2010 ( 22 ). This averaged to a steady yearly increase of 3.5 p.p. The Mem- ber States in which governments took soft mea- sures had 27 % women, a growth of 13 p.p. over the same period at 1.6 p.p. per year. In stark contrast, the no-action Member States had just 15 % women board members, with their repre- sentation rising by just 1.5 p.p. between 2010 and 2018. This averaged out at just 0.2 p.p. per year. The figures show a distinct correlation between political inaction and virtual stagna- tion on gender equality in economic power and decision-making. A recent slowdown in progress is likely to continue, as the three Member States responsible for the most progress (FR, DE, IT) have now surpassed their respective legislated targets, and Belgium is only 1 p.p. away from reaching its 33 % target. While more women are now in boardrooms, this has not translated into more women in executive hierarchies. In the EU in 2018 women accounted for just 17 % of senior executives compared to 29 % of non-executives. In addi- tion, top corporate positions were still largely occupied by men. Although numbers more than doubled from 2010, women board chairs and women CEOs have remained few and far between (7 % each). Clearly the challenge for policymakers is to take the necessary action in Member States that have so far done little to promote balanced represen- tation in the boardroom, and for further action in others to build on progress already made. Only 7 % of CEOs in the EU are women ",

It increased by 3.2 points in the 2 years from 2015, when data for this sub-domain was first introduced.

Domain of health Gender is understood as one of a wide range of factors that shape the health outcomes of a population (Sen, \u00d6stlin, & George, 2007), espe- cially in relation to life expectancy, exposure to risk factors and mental health issues (OECD/EU, 2018). These factors include the physical, social and economic environment, as well as a per- son\u2019s individual characteristics and behaviour, and can be described as \u2018circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age and the systems put in place to deal with ill- ness\u2019 (Stronks, Toebes, Hendriks, Ikram, & Ven- katapuram, 2016, p. 5). Some of those factors promote health, such as a higher education level or access to clean water and safe housing, while others can dam- age it, such as stereotypical gender norms, experiences of gender-based violence or lack of access to and utilisation of medical services. Gender relations and the unequal division of power associated with them are considered to be the most important social determinants of health (Sen, \u00d6stlin, & George, 2007) because they permeate every aspect of an individual\u2019s life from infancy to old age, and as such influ- ence their ability to access resources, to make decisions and to care for their health. Timely access to good-quality, affordable healthcare (both preventive and curative) plays a critical role too. It has been affirmed as a right and is included in the 20 principles of the Euro- pean Pillar of Social Rights. This inclusion, along with the right to gender equality, access to LTC services, and a healthy work environment and social protection, underlines that beyond bio- logical factors, health is the outcome of several determinants which require an interconnected, multidisciplinary approach. Improving health and reducing inequalities across and within Member States are among the strategic objectives of both the EU third health programme (2014-2020) (European Com- mission, 2014) and Health 2020, the WHO-led regional health strategy for Europe adopted in 2012 (WHO, 2013). The importance of achieving universal health is also enshrined in the sus- tainable development goals with Goal 3 focused on health and well-being and the Goal 5 gen- der-equality targets also encompassing health issues affecting women. Women in the EU live longer than men, however they spend longer time in ill health. Considering that the ageing population is becoming fem- inised, social care and healthcare need to take The domain of health mea- sures three health-related aspects of gender equal- ity: health status, health behaviour and access to health services. Health status looks at the gen- der differences in life expectancy, together with self-perceived health and healthy life years (also called disability-free life expectancy). This is complemented by a set of health behavioural factors based on WHO recommendations, namely fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption. Access to health services is measured by the percentage of people who report unmet medical and/or dental needs.

Moreover, life expectancy, well-being and access to healthcare are deter- mined by further factors, such as level of quali- fications, socioeconomic status, family type, ethnicity or sexual and gender identity, calling for a closer look at inequalities among different groups of women and men. 7.1. Behavioural change in health is key to tackling gender inequalities The health domain score of 88.1 points in 2017 had not only barely changed since 2015 (+ 0.7 points), it had also made scant prog- ress since 2005 (+ 2.2 points). Nevertheless, this domain\u2019s scores have consistently ranked among the highest of all six core domains mea- sured in the Gender Equality Index. Overall, Member State scores for the health domain have shown little progress since the last edition of the Index (Figure 28). In 2017, only Italy, Poland and Portugal had a higher rate of progress than the EU average between 2015 and 2017 (+ 2.4 p.p., 1 p.p. and 0.9 p.p. respec- tively). At the other end, four Member States (BE, DE, AT, FI, SI) flatlined, while only Latvia saw a regression. A closer look at the sub-domains of status, behaviour and access showed varying levels of progress on indicators selected and on inequal- ities among different groups of women and men. In 2017 the score for the sub-domain of access reached 98.3 points, with that of status not too far behind at 92.2 points. The behaviour sub-domain score of 75.4 points revealed the greatest disparity between any of the domain scores and one of its sub-domains (12.7 points). With the overall modest improvement in the domain of health since 2015 due to gains in sta- tus (+ 1) and access (+ 1.2 points) ( 23 ), the data ( 23 ) The sub-domain of behaviour is populated with most recent data (2014). Thus the calculation of the score for this sub-domain is unchanged since the last edition of the Gender Equality Index. suggests that much work remains to be done on behaviour. The situation, compounded by irregu- larly updated data on health behaviour with this Index relying on figures from 2014, also points to the difficulty of challenging norms to induce behavioural change. For example, gender norms on masculinity and attitudes expected of boys and men often deter men from seeking diag- nosis and treatment. They also encourage risky behaviours that lead to higher morbidity (Sen et al., 2007; WHO, 2018), including smoking and excessive drinking. This sub-domain\u2019s low score, detrimental to men, reflected this challenge and shed light on the diverse health scenarios coex- isting across the EU: Member State scores range from 42.5 points in Romania to 89.3 in Sweden. Since 2005, the sub-domain of status has regis tered the biggest improvement in the EU (+ 3.7 points) followed by access (+ 3.2 points). This improvement was due to a greater share of women and men (67 % and 72 % respectively) rating their health as being good or very good in 2017 than in 2005 (60 % and 66 %). Despite progress at the EU level, four Member States (DK, EL, LU, NL) registered lower scores in this sub-domain in 2017 than in 2005.

The \u2018mortality advantage\u2019, the phenomenon of women\u2019s higher life expectancy, is attributed to a series of bio- logical, socioeconomic and cultural factors (WHO, 2016). Among them, dominant mas- culinity norms often account for the higher prevalence of certain types of risky behaviour, with higher expo- sure to certain risks leading to higher morbidity among men (WHO, 2018). Through socialisation, boys and men are encouraged to rely on them- selves, to act \u2018tough\u2019 through substance abuse or suppressing emotions or pain, and to demon- strate their heterosexuality by engaging with multiple sexual partners (K\u00e5gesten et al., 2016). As a result, men in the EU are twice as likely to die of accidents as women and four times more likely to die of alcohol abuse and drug depen- dence ( 24 ). Similarly, significantly more men die of suicide: 4.85 women per 100 000 inhabitants compared to 17.85 men ( 25 ).

        "Domain of health European Institute for Gender Equality 60 While women outlive men in general, there are significant differences between various social groups of women. Studies show that women with a tertiary-level education live longer than those with a lower level of qualifications (WHO, 2016). A lower level of education, combined with lower socioeconomic status, can, there- fore, be contributing factors to the shorter life expectancy of Roma women in comparison with women from the population at large (Euro- pean Public Health Alliance, 2018). These and other avoidable health inequities across differ- ent socioeconomic groups \u2018usually result from the uneven distribution of social and environ- mental determinants; the differential access to resources such as education, employment, housing, health services; different levels of par- ticipation in society and different levels of con- trol over life\u2019 (European Public Health Alliance, 2018, p. 1). The \u2018mortality advantage\u2019 that women in the EU are said to have over men is offset by the fact that they spend a greater share of their life in ill health (WHO, 2016). On average, in the EU, 77 % of women\u2019s and 81 % of men\u2019s life is spent in good health (as a percentage of life expect- ancy). This \u2018morbidity disadvantage\u2019 means that in 2016, for example, women in the EU spent 20 years of their life in poor health compared to 16 years for men (Figure 30). In seven Member States (AT, FI, LU, LV, NL, PT, SI) women spent 25 years or more in poor health. The gender dif- ferences in ill health are of added significance because of the demographic changes of an age- ing and feminised population. While the largest age cohort for both women and men in 2016 was 45-49 years, it will be 50-54 years for men and 70-74 years for women by 2070. Overall, the median age will rise by 4 years for both men and women by then (European Commission, 2018a). Considering the challenges posed by ageing populations, a diminishing workforce and pres- sures on welfare systems, gender-specific mea- sures would effectively contribute to solving health-related differences between women and men with knock-on socioeconomic effects. As shown in Figure 30, women and men in the EU can expect to live in good health until the age of 64. This is an additional 2.8 years of healthy life for women and 3.6 years for men since 2005, and an extra 9 months for both women and men since the 2017 Index.

This diversity highlights the need for increased and integrated EU efforts to tackle gender inequities in health and to promote gender transformative health strategies (WHO, 2016, p. 76). 7.3. Lone parents and people with disabilities are still without the health support they need Across the EU, women and men report similar level of access to medical and dental examin- ation in 2017: 97 % of women and men reported no unmets need for medical examination. Nev- ertheless, unmet healthcare needs were higher for certain population groups in the EU-28 in 2017 (Figure 31), especially lone mothers and fathers (6 % and 8 % respectively) and women and men with disabilities (8 % and 7 % respec- tively). At the Member State level, figures differed considerably. In Greece, Romania and Estonia, the share of women with disabilities lacking access to medical care was 30 %, 23 % and 22 % respectively. In contrast, in Member States such as Spain, Malta, Austria and Germany women with disabilities reported the same level of med- ical access as women without disabilities. Compared to 2014, fewer women and men are reporting unmet needs for medical examin ation, particularly lone mothers. While 12 % of them reported this in 2014, only 6 % did so in 2017. Similarly, the share of women and men with dis- abilities reporting unmet medical examination needs shrank from 8 % for women and 7 % for women in 2014 to 13 % for both women and men in 2017. The mortality rate for infections, blood and car- diovascular diseases and external causes was Figure 31: Women and men who report unmet medical needs by family type, age, level of education, country of birth and disability status (16+, %), EU, 2017 6 6 3 4 3 4 5 5 5 4 4 5 4 4 5 8 6 8 4 4 3 5 5 4 5 5 3 4 3 3 5 7 0123456789 S i n g l e L o n e p a r e n t s C o u p l e w i t h o u t c h i l d r e n C o u p l e w i t h c h i l d r e n 1 5 - 2 4 2 5 - 4 9 5 0 - 6 4 6 5 + L o w M e d i u m H i g h N a t i v e b o r n E U b o r n n o n - E U b o r n W i t h W i t h o u t Family Age Education Country of birth Disabilities P e r c e n t a g e Women Men Source: EIGE\u2019s calculation, EU-SILC.

        "Domain of health European Institute for Gender Equality 62 higher among migrants and refugees because of poor living conditions and lack of heathcare (WHO, 2018). In fact, migrants and refugees, especially those in an irregular situation, have unequal access to preventive healthcare across the EU, notably due to differences between Mem- ber States in access requirements for health ser- vices (WHO, 2018). Migrant and refugee women may face additional problems related to repro- ductive health (European Parliament, 2016). For example, undocumented pregnant women are more vulnerable to complications in pregnancy and childbirth throughout the EU (WHO, 2016). Furthermore, as inequalities in health are often determined by education and socioeconomic status, people in the highest income quintile are more likely to report being in good health com- pared to people with the lowest income (OECD, 2017). Socioeconomic status and gender play a role in diseases and risk factors that contribute substantially to disability and lower quality of life. For example, people with a lower level of educa- tion are more likely to smoke, with evidence sug- gesting a more pronounced link among women. Although wealthy women are the first to start smoking, they are also the first to stop. Disad- vantaged groups, such as the long-term unem- ployed and homeless people, tend to smoke more in comparison with the more affluent. Research from Member States such as the Neth- erlands and Luxembourg suggests the trend of smoking is especially worrying among women with a low level of education (Hiscock, Bauld, Amos, Fidler, & Munaf\u00f2, 2012; Nagelhout et al., 2012; WHO, 2016). Research in 17 European Member States also shows that people with a low level of qualifications are twice likely to die from excessive alcohol consumption compared to the most highly qualified (WHO, 2016). ( 26 ) Heteronormativity is defined by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) as \u2018the assumption that everyone is \u201cnaturally\u201d heterosexual, and that heterosexuality is an ideal, superior to homosexuality or bisexuality.\u2019 It has for effect to \u2018make heterosexuality seem coherent, natural and privileged. (FRA, 2009b). Low educational levels and poverty often inter- sect with other aspects, such as ethnicity, to fur- ther exacerbate health inequities. Europe\u2019s larg- est ethnic minority, the Roma, for example, face serious barriers accessing healthcare (European Public Health Alliance, 2018), with access to sexual and reproductive health services being particularly difficult for Roma women (Hoctor & Lama\u010dkov\u00e1, 2017). Although a minority group present across the EU, no systematic comparable data exists on the health situation of LGBTQI* people. Studies in different Member States, however, suggest that LGBTQI* people face significant health inequal- ities due to heteronormativity ( 26 ) in health sys- tems, minority stress, victimisation and discrim- ination compounded by stigma (Zeeman et al., 2018). Evidence collected in OECD countries shows that there are higher rates of physical and mental health problems, particularly among transgender and intersex people (Valfort, 2017). For instance, LGBTI people were more likely to have considered or attempted suicide than those among the non-LGBTI population. Evi- dence suggests that this gap has decreased more significantly among the US states that adopted same-sex marriage than those that did not (Valfort, 2017). Meanwhile, LGBTI employ- ees in committed same-sex relationships who are not provided with the corporate-sponsored health insurance that employers give to workers in opposite sex marriages are at greater health risk from a lack of health insurance (Valfort, 2017). The social exclusion and discrimination faced by LGBT people in the labour market (FRA, 2014c) has also been closely linked to transgen- der people becoming become sex workers, con- sequently increasing their risk of and the preva- lence of HIV (Valfort, 2017).

The domain of violence provides a set of indica- tors that can help the EU and its Member States to monitor the extent of the most common and doc- umented forms of violence against women. Unlike other domains, the domain of violence does not measure differences between women and men, but examines and analyses women\u2019s experiences of violence. The main objective is to eliminate vio- lence against women, not to reduce gaps. A three-tier structure of measurement was defined to provide the most complete and reli- able picture of violence against women in the EU. (1) A composite measure combining indicators on the extent of violence against women. The composite measure does not affect the final score of the Gender Equality Index. However, violence against women must be considered alongside other domains as it mirrors endur- ing inequalities in the fields of work, health, money, power, knowledge and time. In 2017, the EU had a score of 27.5 (EIGE, 2017b). A high score in the Gender Equality Index means that a country is close to achiev- ing a gender-equal society. However, in the domain of violence, the higher the score, the more serious the phenomenon of violence against women in the country is. On a scale of 1 to 100, 1 represents a situation where violence is non-existent and 100 represents a situation where violence against women is extremely common, highly severe and not disclosed. The best-performing country is therefore the one with the lowest score. The calculation of the scores of the composite measure relied on data findings of a 2014 survey by FRA (FRA, 2014c). Until the comple- tion of the next EU-wide survey on violence against women led by Eurostat ( 27 ), scores for this domain cannot be updated. (2) Additional indicators covering a broader range of forms of violence against women described in the Istanbul Convention (Coun- cil of Europe, 2011) . These indicators might be included in the calculation of the single score if more reliable and comparable data becomes available. This includes EIGE\u2019s indi- cators on administrative data. (3) Contextual factors include some of the root causes of violence against women. This set of indicators enables analysis of the extent of violence against women over time and across Member States. Defined to moni- tor the compliance of the Member States regarding the obligations set out in the Istanbul Convention, they cover six dimen- sions: policies; prevention; protection and support; substantive legislation; involvement of law enforcement agencies; and societal framework.

        "Domain of violence European Institute for Gender Equality 64 8.1. Data gaps mask true scale of gender-based violence in the EU Among LGBT groups across the EU, trans- gender people are most likely to report experiences of violence. A FRA survey found that 34 % of transgender people had expe- rienced either a physical or a sexual attack or the threat of violence in the previous five years (FRA, 2013). A major concern is the high level of repetitive violence against this group in society, with 44 % of trans women report- ing experience of physical/sexual attack or the threat of violence at least three times in the preceding 12-month period (FRA, 2014a). Trans women and men are also most likely to face hate-motivated harassment, including verbal abuse, humiliation and social exclu- sion. On average, one in three transgen- der people was harassed in the same time frame, according to the survey. In the absence of up-to-date and comparable data within the domain of violence in all 28 EU Member States, only the forms of violence against women for which recent data is available are examined, namely femicide, female geni- tal mutilation (FGM) and trafficking in human beings. These three forms of violence are part of the second-tier indicators of the measure- ment framework for the domain of violence. Femicide Femicide is a phenomenon captured partially through national administrative data on inten- tional homicide of women by an intimate part- ner or by family member or relatives. In 2016, 16 EU Member States reported a total of 788 women killed by a partner or family member . On average, intimate partners or family mem- bers intentionally killed more than one woman every day in those Member States (Figure 32). In the remaining 12 EU Member States there is no comparable or available data disaggregated by sex and the relationship between the vic- tim and the perpetrator on women victims of intentional homicide, therefore the magnitude of the phenomenon cannot be truly known. In addition, to date, the term \u2018femicide\u2019 has not Figure 32: Women victims of intentional homicide by an intimate partner or family member, by 100 000 female population, 2016 0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 1.20 1.40 1.60 L V L T M T H U H R F I D E C Z A T F R S c o t l a n d E n g l a n d a n d W a l e s N L E S I T S I S K R a t e p e r 1 0 0 0 0 0 f e m a l e p o p u l a t i o n Family and relatives Intimate partner Intimate partner/family and relatives Source: Eurostat (crim_hom_vrel) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) homicide statistics.

Female genital mutilation (FGM) FGM refers to \u2018all procedures involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons\u2019 (WHO, 2008). As with some other forms of violence, FGM is particularly hard to measure in the EU. In 2015, EIGE developed a methodology to assist Mem- ber States in estimating the number of girls at risk of FGM, the aim of which is to develop bet- ter policies to prevent and combat FGM. Since then, EIGE has carried out two studies in nine EU Member States (BE, CY, FR, EL, IE, IT, MT, PL, SE) (EIGE, 2015a, 2018a), which demonstrate that strong legal frameworks, anti-FGM cam- paigns and awareness-raising initiatives contrib- ( 28 ) For Finland, the calculation of the share of girls at a high and a low risk of FGM is not available.

Drawing from EIGE\u2019s risk estimation methodology, Germany and Finland carried out their own research. In 2017, between 6 % and 17 % of 25 325 girls in Germany originating from countries where FGM is practised were consid- ered to be at risk. In 2018, Finland ( 28 ) counted 3 000 girls likely to be at risk of FGM. Trafficking in human beings Trafficking in human beings is estimated from administrative records at the national level related to \u2018registered victims\u2019 (EIGE, 2017b). In 2016, the number of registered female vic- tims of trafficking in the EU reached 7 007( 29 ). Overall, evidence shows that 68 % of registered victims of trafficking are women and girls. The most widespread form of exploitation expe- rienced by women and girls is sexual exploit- Figure 33: Estimated proportion of girls (aged 0-18) of the migrant resident population at risk of FGM (latest available year) 17 24 42 27 23 21 19 57 11 17 6 15 25 16 5 12 3 39 1 12 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 DE (2017); 25 325 IT (2016); 76 040 EL (2016); 1 787 BE (2016); 22 544 PT (2015); 5 835 FR (2014); 205 683 SE (2011); 59 409 MT (2011); 486 IE (2011); 14 577 CY (2011); 758 Low-risk scenario High-risk scenario Percentage Source: EIGE (2015, 2018a).

Although this data provides valuable information, the actual prevalence of traffick- ing in human beings is difficult to quantify due to its transnational, criminal and underground nature (FRA, 2009a). Moreover, victims of traf- ficking face a vast range of obstacles generally preventing them from reporting to or being identified by a relevant formal authority. These include trauma, fear of/dependency on the traf- ficker, victimisation through stereotyping, lack of information about available resources and language barriers (EIGE, 2018b). Many other severe forms of violence against women, such as psychological violence and forced marriage, are still inadequately mea- sured in the EU due to a lack of consistent and compar able data. To support Member States in collecting administrative data on rape, femicide and intimate partner violence, EIGE proposed a set of 13 indicators based on uniform statis- tical definitions that should be populated with data collected by the police and justice sectors. Seven of these indicators are part of the mea- surement framework for the domain of violence. Administrative data is a particularly useful source of information. It shows how the police, justice, health and social services, as well as organisa- tions dealing with the prevention, protection and prosecution of gender-based violence, respond to the phenomenon (EIGE, 2014a). 8.2. Backlash against gender equality undermines legal efforts to end violence against women Ending all forms of violence against women is a priority for the EU. In 2011, the adoption of the anti-trafficking directive by the European Parlia- ment initiated binding legislation to protect vic- tims and to prevent and prosecute trafficking. In 2012, minimum standards on the rights, sup- port and protection of vic- tims of crime, including vio- lence against women, were established through the victims\u2019 rights directive. On a similar note, the European protection order directive further developed protec- tion mechanisms for victims of crime in the EU. In 2017, the EU\u2019s accession to the Istanbul Convention provided a step- ping stone to establishing legally binding stan- dards and procedures for the elimination of all types of violence against women in the region. Although all 28 Member States have signed the convention, Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and the United Kingdom have yet to ratify it. The European Commission reaffirmed its com- mitment to tackling violence against women in its Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019 , calling on EU Member States to make further efforts in developing effective institu- tional responses to this enduring phenomenon. This includes, for example, raising awareness, improving data (availability, quality and reli- ability) and ensuring access to protection and support for survivors of gender-based violence (European Commission, 2015). In recent years, the EU has witnessed a general backlash against gender equality and women\u2019s rights (European Parliament, 2018a). The emer- gence of \u2018anti-gender\u2019 movements in several EU Member States has had numerous nega- tive effects on institutional, legal and policy frameworks aimed at combating gender-based violence (European Parliament, 2018a). In addi- tion, the ratification of the Istanbul Convention in several EU Member States has faced strong opposition from political and religious groups. Similar resistance has hindered the process of EU ratification of the convention, undermining its full implementation. Female victims of trafficking in human beings reached 7 007 in the EU (2016) ",
        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 67 9. Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus 9.1. Conceptual framework The quest for a work\u2014life balance has become a modern holy grail. The dizzying speed of change in the world of work, propelled by a digital revolution and economic crises, has swept away demarcation lines between the pro- fessional and the personal. These have brought socioeconomic costs that have impacted gen- der equality across different domains of life. Work\u2014life balance is no longer just a per- sonal goal, it is also a political one. The Gen- der Equality Index 2019 reflects that with its thematic focus on work\u2014life balance, cap- turing data and information that indicate how the EU and its Member States are progressing on this key policy objective. In addition to the work\u2014life balance-related indicators already provided by the Index in several domains in previous chapters, this report presents an additional set of indicators on the topic. For this purpose, and at the European Commis- sion\u2019s request, EIGE developed a work\u2014life balance scoreboard which, while not included in the calculations of the Gender Equality Index scores, demonstrates conceptual and statisti- cal links to the Index and is an important step in context ualising the information extracted there. This analysis is cantered on the European Pil- lar of Social Rights and its \u2018New start\u2019 initiative on work\u2014life balance, including legislative and non-legislative measures. It shows that the major challenges of work\u2014life balance are intrinsically linked to gender (in)equalities. It also provides new insight into the monitor- ing of the implementation of legal and policy measures on work\u2014life balance at the EU and national levels. The proposed indicators on work\u2014life balance could complement the social scoreboard, which monitors Member State performance in relation to the European Pillar of Social Rights. The analysis does not aim to define what \u2018good\u2019 work\u2014life balance is or assess which policy designs are better than others in achieving work\u2014life balance. The exact impact of any policy or measure on this issue in a society depends on a complex interaction between individual preferences, the provision of sup- porting services, labour-market characteristics or the social-protection system as a whole. The aim here is to present and explore the dif- ferent options people have for reconciling their work and personal life and whether these are equally available to all women and men, and if so, how can they further boost gender equality. Conceptually, the work\u2014life balance scoreboard (Table 1) is based on three broad areas: paid work, unpaid work (care), and education and training. It pre sents 15 indicators in six specific areas of concern: parental-leave policies; infor- mal care for older people, people with disabil- ities and LTC services; childcare and childcare services; transport and public infrastructure; flexible working arrangements; and lifelong learning. The work\u2014life balance scoreboard has multi- ple advantages. It is based on a broad concept of work\u2014life balance with a gender-equality perspective. It integrates individual-level out- come-based indicators with institutional-level input indicators (e.g. participation in informal care vs availability of care services). Indicators are also analysed in a broader context. For example, the analysis examines different modes of trans- port used by women and men and how hard it is for women and men to access public transport, in addition to exploring gender differences in commuting patterns. The analysis further looks at how gender intersects with other grounds of inequalities (e.g. age or type of family) through- out the course of a life. It applies a sectoral/occu- pational approach when relevant. ",

Parental-leave policies Parental-leave conditions may help or hinder gender equality The increase in female employment rates, coupled with the decline of the male breadwinner family model, have unsettled traditional gender work roles and expectations (Connolly, Aldrich, O\u2019Brien, Speight, & Poole, 2016; Trask, 2010). In this con- text, entitlements to job-protected leave after childbirth have become important policy meas- ures to support parents (ILO, 2014). They provide time-limited job protection to enable an employee to care for their new-born child, and afterwards return to work with the same employer, usually to the same job. These leave policies not only support gender equality, they are also important policy instruments for supporting child, maternal and paternal health and well-being, birth rates and various labour-market outcomes, such as increased women\u2019s participation in the labour market and reduced gender pay gaps (Andersen, 2018; Kamerman & Moss, 2009). Similarly, leave policies can be seen as important tools to fulfil children\u2019s rights to have time with and care from from both their parents (Haas & Hwang, 1999). Working parents across Member States are enti- tled to a range of types of leave, the most com- mon being maternity leave, paternity leave, paren- tal leave and leave to care for children who are ill (Blum, Koslowski, Macht, & Moss, 2018). Maternity leave is mostly understood as a health-and-wel- fare measure intended to protect the health of both the mother and the new-born child. Pater- nity leave is usually short leave taken after the birth or adoption of a child and intended to ena- ble the father/co-parent to spend time with the partner and new child. This analysis focuses on parental leave, which is generally understood to be a care measure intended to give both parents an equal opportu- nity to spend time caring for a young child. Usu- ally, it can only be taken at the end of maternity leave (Blum et al., 2018). Some Member States aim for an almost gender-neutral leave policy (e.g. ( 30 ) https://www.leavenetwork.org/introducing-the-network SE), with most of the available leave designated as parental leave. Other Member States have leave-system designs that identify a mother as a primary carer, with emphasis on a long period of maternity leave before the parental leave. Regular monitoring of parental leave policies by the International Network on Leave Policies and Research ( 30 ) shows that leave policies in the EU are in constant flux (Blum et al., 2018). Member States are working on leave-policy designs that not only support better gender balance in the use of parental leave and the work\u2014life balance of all working parents, but also enhance fertility rates and child well-being. A growing body of research is trying to identify how different leave-policy characteristics work towards varied and often conflicting policy pur- poses. The most crucial components of leave policies are the length of leave, payment levels, flexibility, financing, eligibility rules and coordina- tion with childcare services. These all impact the behaviour of women and men taking leave and their participation in the labour market, with con- sequences for gender equality. Some characteristics are positively associated with gender equality, such as an individual enti- tlement for fathers. Others, including extended leave for mothers, have negative associations. For gender-equality objectives, supporting the employment of mothers and increasing the take-up of leave by fathers are of particular inter- est. Although reliable comparable data is scarce, the overall take-up of parental leave by men is generally estimated to be very low (Blum et al., 2018; Karu & Tremblay, 2018). Childcare services are not available when childcare leave ends Among EU Member States, the types of child- care leave and parental leave specifically offered to young parents vary enormously. Although all Member States fulfil the minimum 4-month requirement set out in the parental leave direc- tive (Directive 2010/18/EU), the overall duration of ",
        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 70 available leave differs considerably across the EU (see Annex 5). There are Member States where the parental leave is less barely exceeds the 4-month requirement such as the United Kingdom with 4.2 months and Poland with 7.4 months. Other Member States provide leave until the child is 3 years old (e.g. CZ, EE, ES, FR, LT, HU) (Blum et al., 2018). Parental leave is only one type of leave availa- ble to parents. Counting all available maternity, paternity and parental leaves, both paid and/ or unpaid, the parents may have job-protected absence from work available lasting 3 years or even more (e.g. DE, EE, FR, HR, LT, PL, PT, FI). In several Member States over 9 months of child- care leave are well paid, i.e. at least 66 % of pre- vious monthly pay (e.g. BG, CZ, DK, EE, DE, HU, LT, AT, PL, RO, SI, FI, SE), while in other Member States less than 4 months is granted (e.g. BE, IE, FR, IT, LV, MT, NL, UK) (Blum et al., 2018). Although a generous parental-leave entitle- ment could be seen as beneficial from a child well-being point of view, there is no agreement on the optimal duration of parental leave. Argu- ments can be found supporting shorter leave to avoid the negative impacts on women\u2019s working life and employment and the gender imbalance in the workplace that long career breaks have. Both types of leave (very short or very long duration) are associated with reduced female labour-market participation (Akgunduz & Plan- tenga, 2012; Genre, Salvador, & Lamo, 2010; Misra, Budig, & Boeckmann, 2011; Olivetti & Petrongolo, 2017; Pettit & Hook, 2005). Parental-leave duration and its impact strongly depends on other leave characteristics and on the availability of care services. Good-quality and affordable (public) childcare services need to be available at the end of parental leave to allow parents to return to work. In most EU Member States (except HR, IT, LT, RO and SK), parents are entitled to early childhood education and care (ECEC) services through a statutory obligation for authorities to provide a care or nursery place for a child should a parent so wish. A lack of gaps between the end of leave provision and the start of subsidised, high-quality ECEC is linked to greater women\u2019s participation in the labour mar- ket (OECD, 2018b).

ECEC entitlement refers to the statutory obligation to provide a place for a child, should a parent wish to use it. Where there is no statutory entitlement there may still be both public and private provision available. Well-paid leave: earnings-related payment at 66 % or above of earnings (not taking into account the possibility of a ceiling). All types of leave are counted (including maternity, paternity, parental and childcare/time credit, including any parental-leave bonus but excluding leave to care for sick children). ",
        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 71 As of April 2018, 12 Member States (DK, DE, EE, ES, FR, LV, HU, MT, PL, SI, FI, SE) had no gaps between the end of leave and the start of ECEC entitlements (Figure 34). It is assumed that with the help of public childcare, the transition from leave back to employment is relatively smooth for parents in these Member States. However, evidence suggests that despite such entitlement, care services are not always easily available or sufficient, for example in Estonia, Germany and Hungary (Blum et al., 2018). Only in a few Mem- ber States (DK, DE, MT, SI, FI, SE) does publicly subsidised childcare begin as paid parental leave ends. The largest care gaps are found in Austria (36 months) and the Netherlands (33.2 months). This highlights a clear lack of coordination between the two policy areas (Blum et al., 2018). Take-up of parental leave by fathers remains a challenge Parental leave can be either an individual non-transferable entitlement, an individual transferable entitlement or a family entitlement. The latter means that a family can decide who takes the leave. While parental leave secures job protection for those taking time off to care for their children, it does not protect against the negative impact of such breaks on career progression, pay and other aspects of work- ing life. The negative impact of parenthood on women\u2019s employment is largely due to their dis- proportionate take-up of care duties and career breaks. If childcare is no longer considered the sole domain of women and more fathers take parental leave to stay at home and look after their children in their first year, the outcomes for gender equality include increased women\u2019s labour-market participation, reduced gender pay gaps and increased men\u2019s participation in household work (Andersen, 2018; O\u2019Brien & Wall, 2017). There are no reliable comparable statistics avail- able on the uptake or share of parental leave by fathers in the EU. Scarce available information does, however, indicate that the lion\u2019s share is taken up by women in all Member States. For instance, Poland reported 99 % of parental-leave takers to be women (Kurowska, Micho\u0144, & God- lewska-Bujok, 2018), while in France 4.4 % of beneficiaries were men (Boyer & Fagnani, 2018), and in Croatia fathers accounted for around 4.5 % of all parental leave taken (Dobroti\u0107, 2018). The take-up by men is changing slowly, even in Member States such as Sweden, where 45 % of the parental-leave benefit recipients were men. In total, men used only 27 % of all paren- tal-leave days used during 2016 (Duvander & Haas, 2018). Danish fathers on average took 11.7 % of the parental-leave period in total in 2016 (Bloksgaard & Rostgaard, 2018). Increased take-up of leave by fathers is strongly linked to access to individual entitlement (Duvander & Johansson, 2012; Haas & Rost- gaard, 2011). However, there is no evidence that non-transferable leave is sufficient to lead to increased use of parental leave by the fathers, unless it is well paid (Karu & Tremblay, 2018). A new directive on work\u2014life balance for par- ents and carers in 2019 introduced for the first time at least 10 working days of paid paternity leave and proposed an additional incentive (paid non-transferable parental leave of 2 out of 4 months) to encourage greater take-up by fathers. Another approach offers some form of bonus if both parents share parental leave. Several Mem- ber States offer specifically tailored incentives to get more fathers to use their leave (Table 5). For example, Sweden has a \u2018gender equality bonus\u2019 or a \u2018father\u2019s quota\u2019 that allocates an additional 90 days of the leave to fathers. If the fathers do not use it, the family loses both the leave and the financial benefit associated with it. Austria, Cro atia, Germany and Italy offer bonus time of varying amounts to families where the father shares part of the leave. Although information on the actual take-up or effectiveness of such incentives is scarce, the number of fathers using a month of parental leave in Portugal increased significantly after the bonus was introduced in 2009: from 596 fathers in 2008 to more than 24 000 by 2017 (Wall & Leit\u00e3o, 2018). The introduction of the father\u2019s ",
        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 72 quota in Sweden also led to increased uptake, and 44 % of men had taken their reserved days for children born in 2013 by 2015 (Duvander & Haas, 2018). The financial implications of parental leave are another factor determining its take-up by fathers, given that families are dependent on the higher salaries usually earned by men. Parental leave can either be paid at a certain percentage of previous taxable income, be paid at a low flat rate similar to social assistance or be unpaid. No payment requirements are specified in the parental leave directive, which means that Member States can choose whether to provide paid or unpaid parental leave or which eligibility criteria to apply for income-related benefit. Seven Member States (CY, EL, IE, MT, ES, NL, UK) provide unpaid parental leave, and in the remaining 21 Member States it is (at least par- tially) paid. The total amount of remuneration varies considerably, with every country setting a ceiling. Although a high level of pay is linked to a greater leave uptake by all parents, particu- larly by fathers (Lapuerta, Baiz\u00e1n, & Gonz\u00e1lez, 2011; Pull & Vogt, 2010; Ray, Gornick, & Schmitt, 2010), there are also many sociocultural factors that can discourage fathers\u2019 uptake of paren- tal leave regardless of the type of family leave provided. This includes gender stereotypes and roles that lead to gendered expectations and workplace practices and policies. One in five people in the EU not eligible for parental leave Parental leave is often unavailable as eligibility might be dependent on criteria such as whether a person is in paid work, whether they are an employee or self-employed, the sector in which they work or their the length of service, or leave might not be accessible to same-sex couples or migrants. As a result, ineligibility can inhibit both having children (as potential parents anticipate not benefiting from any leave policy) and full or part-time employment when potential parents have no alternatives to parental leave. With changing labour-market conditions and non-standard employment contracts on the rise, there are genuine concerns over the reality of parents\u2019 access to leave. During the last dec- ade in Europe, both temporary contracts and self-employment have become a growing trend. In Member States where parental-leave eligibility is dependent on strict conditions based on nar- row definitions of employment, there are likely to be stark inequalities and divisions in access to the leave provided by the social-protection infra- structure (Dobroti\u0107 & Blum, 2019).

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 73 To estimate how many women and men would be eligible for parental leave in the EU, EIGE mapped policy rules on paid and unpaid statu- tory parental leave across the EU-28. High-qual- ity survey data ( 31 ) was assessed to gauge the extent to which respective population groups corresponded to identify eligibility criteria for parental leave in each Member State. The anal- ysis focused on \u2018potential parents\u2019, i.e. all people aged 20-49 years \u2014 the peak parenthood and employment period. Special attention was given to the employed population as it is the primary target group of leave policies; however, the anal- ysis also included those who are not in employ- ment to capture Member States where eligibility is not based only on current employment con- ditions. For more details on the methodology used to estimate eligibility for parental leave, see Annex 5. Only in four Member States (EE, HR ( 32 ), FI, SE) do all women and men with children have the opportunity to access parental leave (Figure 35). In these Member States there are no restrictive eligibility criteria regarding being in employment, the length of time in current work, the type of occupation or whether an individual is in a het- erosexual or same-sex partnership ( 33 ). Further- more, in all four Member States, parental leave is paid at a comparatively high level, with financing ensured through general taxation and employ- ment insurance (Koslowski, Blum, & Moss, 2016), and a dual-earner/dual-caregiver model is seen as an effective way to combine work and care duties between women and men (see Section 9.4 on informal care of children and childcare ser- vices). In the remaining 24 Member States, eligibil- ity rates for parental leave vary. Greece has the highest ineligibility rate at 62 % of women and 51 % of men aged 20-49 years (Figure 35). Inel- igibility is also high in Ireland, Cyprus, Italy, Malta and the United Kingdom, particularly for women. ( 31 ) Microsimulation of eligibility rules was carried out using the European Union labour force survey (EU LFS) and the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) datasets. ( 32 ) In Croatia, same-sex couples are not eligible for parental leave, but due to small sample size it was not captured by the micro- simulation. ( 33 ) In Estonia, parents cannot take parental leave at the same time as the other parent. Finland requires non-EU nationals and migrant parents to be living in the country for 180 days prior to the birth of the baby to be eligible for parental leave (not simulated in the eligibility analysis). Overall, gender gaps on ineligibility rates show a disadvantage to women across the EU, except for Portugal, where a higher percentage of men (32 %) than women (23 %) are ineligible for paren- tal leave. Gender gaps also tend to be very large in the Member States with the most restricted access to parental leave. For example, the ineligi- bility gap between women and men of parenting age in Malta is 31 p.p., while 12 Member States have gaps larger than 10 p.p. Clearly, strict eligi- bility rules prevent women more than men from accessing parental leave, a key indicator of work\u2014 life balance. Even though all women and men are eligible for parental leave in four Member States, inequalities may occur when looking at financial compensation levels, as these often have additional conditions attached. For example, in 2016, 88 % of Swedish women and 96 % of Swedish men on parental leave were entitled to benefits at the earnings-re- lated compensation level. The others \u2014 more women than men \u2014 received bene fits based on a low flat-rate level. Foreign-born parents, espe- cially mothers, more often than native-born par- ents only have access to this type of payment in Sweden (Duvander & Haas, 2018). EIGE\u2019s esti- mations of eligibility for parental leave focused only on absence from work, although in many Member States, eligibility for parental leave and related financial benefits go hand in hand. Parents out of the labour market most likely to miss out on parental leave Across the EU-28, unemployment or economic inactivity is the main reason for ineligibility (78 % of women and 54 % of men) for parental leave. The other most common reasons for ineligibility relate to different employment conditions such as length of service (15 % of women and 20 % of men) or self-employment (7 % of women and 26 % of men). While people who are out of the ",
        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 74 labour market do not need job protection, they also do not benefit from this significant state-pro- vided work\u2014life balance measure, which in most Member States offers significant financial sup- port. Patterns of ineligibility are different for women and men. Inactivity or unemployment are more prevalent among women across the EU, while various employment-related conditions, includ- ing length of service or self-employment, disad- vantage men. Household characteristics, such as whether same-sex couples are eligible for paren- tal leave or whether both parents can take paren- tal leave at the same time, account for a low per- centage of ineligibility (less than 1 % of men and women). Overall, 11 Member States have policy eligibility rules whereby same-sex parents are not eligible for parental leave, with implications for adoptive parents from same-sex households. In Latvia, Germany, Czechia and Poland, nearly everyone in work can access parental leave, and only unemployed or non-working people of par- enting age are excluded ( 34 ) (Figure 36). In the ( 34 ) In Latvia and Poland, same-sex couples are not eligible for parental leave, but in Latvia due to the small sample size it was not captured by the microsimulation. remaining 24 Member States, reasons for ineli- gibility are much more varied. Self-employment as an ineligibility criteria is most significant in Greece, Italy and Spain, accounting for nearly half of all men and about one fifth of all women not eligible. This is of note given that both Greece and Italy have the highest levels of self-employed women and men in the EU (Eurostat, 2018). Parental leave in some Member States is also denied to \u2018family workers\u2019, such as domestic workers, unpaid assistants to family/partner employment or caregivers, who are typically linked to running a family business or farm. Eligibility restrictions concerning the employ- ment sector are rather rare in the EU, with the exception of Italy where some areas of eco- nomic activity among self-employed men only are not covered by parental-leave policy rules. It is possible that employment sectors influ- ence eligibility in other Member States; how- ever, information on such sectoral/occupational exclusions is not yet systematically available and should be explored in greater detail.

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 76 One in 10 employed persons denied access to parental leave in the EU Eligibility rates for parental leave in the EU-28 are generally expected to be significantly higher among the employed than the unemployed or inactive, given that the leave aims to provide job protection and time off for working parents. In nine Member States (CZ, DE, EE, HR, LV, PL, SI, FI, SE), nearly all employed women and men can access parental leave. However, on average in the EU, 10 % of employed women and 12 % of employed men were not eligible in 2016 (Fig- ure 37), with the gender disadvantage ranging from 32 % and 37 % of employed women and men in Greece to 2 % and 3 % of employed women and men in Lithuania. In eight Mem- ber States (EL, UK, IE, BE, ES, IT, AT, PT) a higher share of men than women were ineligible for parental leave, mostly due to eligibility condi- tions related to self-employment. Ineligibility rates also vary between groups of workers of different ages, levels of educa- tion, occupation and sector of employment. Such differences underline the importance of assessing the impact of policy design in rela- tion to these characteristics. Among the vari- ous age cohorts, younger workers are the least likely to be eligible for parental leave as they do not generally have a sufficient record of contin- uous employment, and therefore might decide to postpone parenthood until career-related eligibility criteria are fulfilled. More than 25 % of employed potential mothers and fathers in the youngest age group (20-24 years) were ineligible in five Member States (BE, EL, FR, NL, UK). The only Member State where ineligibil- ity rates progressively increased with age was Austria.

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 78 Member State groups. For example, a cluster of central and southern European Member States (CZ, PL, RO, HU, SK, EL) has one of the highest ineligibility gender gaps (more than 10 p.p.), while their Gender Equality Index scores are also lower than 56 points. In contrast, Nordic Member States (SE, DK, FI), which have either universal or nearly universal parental-leave sys- tems, have relatively high Gender Equality Index scores (above 73 points). The correlation between ineligibility for paren- tal leave and the overall Gender Equality Index score is in particular driven by linkages to labour-market participation (sub-domain of work) and involvement in care activities (sub-domain of time). As most Member States have employment-related eligibility conditions, overall ineligibility rates for parental leave dis- tinctively shape opportunities and outcomes for women and men within national labour markets. Member States with higher gen- der-equality scores on labour-market partici- pation are those that have lower gender gaps on parental-leave eligibility (Figure 38, Panel B) and higher overall eligibility rates for women (Figure 38, Panel C). This suggests that paren- tal leave, as a job protection measure for both women and men, is of significant importance in efforts to boost employment among mothers. For example, the highest ineligibility rates are recorded in Greece and Italy. Both also have the lowest FTE employment rates for women in the EU (31 %) ( 35 ), one of the highest gender employment gaps (20 %) ( 36 ) and large shares of economically inactive women (35 % and 40 % of women aged 20-64 respectively) ( 37 ). In both Member States, the interaction between employment-related eligibility conditions and the low involvement of women in the labour market creates a \u2018vicious circle\u2019: labour-market status disqualifies men and particularly women from parental-leave schemes, while at the same time ineligibility \u2018locks\u2019 women outside of the ( 35 ) EIGE\u2019s calculations, EU LFS, 2017.

Similarly, a link between ineligibility for paren- tal leave and care activities (sub-domain of time) suggests that Member States with more universal parental-leave schemes create bet- ter opportunities for gender equality in paren- tal care responsibilities (Figure 38, Panel D). Sweden, Estonia and Finland (three of the four Member States with 100 % eligibility rates for both women and men) had among the highest gender-equality scores in the care sub-domain. 9.3. Informal care of older people, people with disabilities and long-term care services Rising long-term care needs keenly felt by women The EU is currently experiencing unprece- dented demographic changes. The share of population above 65 years old in the EU is expected to increase from 19 % in 2016 to 29 % by 2080, and the percentage of people above 80 years old will more than double to 13 % ( 38 ) in that time. A rapidly ageing popu- lation leads to an ever-growing need for long- term formal and informal care. In 2017, one in four people in the EU had a long-term disabil- ity, women (27 %) more than men (22 %) ( 39 ). Given this context, the EU will face a major challenge in meeting LTC needs in a financially sustainable way, ensuring care is affordable without endangering the quality of services or the lives of care providers and the cared-for (European Commission, 2017a). LTC is \u2018a range of services and assistance for peo- ple who, as a result of mental and/or physical frailty and/or disability over an extended period of time, depend on help with daily living activi- ties and/or [are] in need of some permanent care\u2019 (European Union, 2014).

LTC systems vary significantly across EU Member States, with differences in the extent of provision, benefits and services provided and institutional settings (Spasova et al., 2018). In the EU-28, LTC relies heavily on informal care, with evidence indicating that the number of informal carers is twice that of formal caregiv- ers (European Union, 2014). The prevalence of informal care might be associated with the lack of accessible, affordable and good-quality formal LTC facilities and services (Spasova et al., 2018). In many Member States, formal home-care services remain underdeveloped and difficult to access. As such, research highlights the increasing role of domestic workers, often migrant women, in the provision of LTC at home in several EU Mem- ber States (Spasova et al., 2018). Due to a higher life expectancy, more women than men are in need of LTC. In addition, the vast majority of formal and informal carers are women. Women\u2019s greater involvement in informal care, which negatively impacts their participation in the labour market, also increases their risk of economic dependency, poverty and social exclu- sion. In the EU, almost one in every three inactive women (32 %) aged 20-64, compared to just 5 % of inactive men in the same age group, is not in paid work due to family and/or care responsibil- ities ( 40 ). Evidence of greater degrees of chronic stress and depression among female caregiv- ers has also been found as women often have to combine care responsibilities with household chores and work (Schultz, 2008). The availabil- ity, accessibility and affordability of care facilities are, therefore, crucial elements allowing carers, especially women, to stay in or enter the labour market and to reconcile work and life duties and needs. The European Pillar of Social Rights endorses everyone\u2019s right to accessible, good-quality and affordable LTC services, and in particular home care and community-based services. The 2019 directive on work\u2014life balance for parents and ( 40 ) Eurostat, EU LFS, 2018 (lfsa_igar). ( 41 ) EIGE calculation, Eurofound, EQLS. carers also introduced a new right for workers to take at least 5 working days per year of car- ers\u2019 leave where a relative has a serious illness or dependency. These provisions aim to remove some of the barriers faced by informal carers, especially women, to both entering and staying in employment. The development of sustainable models of care delivery is of high political importance in the EU. For instance, the Social Protection Committee and the European Commission are promoting new ways to provide adequate and sustainable LTC services in ageing societies through invest- ment in preventive care, rehabilitation and age- friendly environments. As part of this process, the European Commission launched the blueprint on digital transformation of health and care in 2016. This initiative highlighted the potential of digital- isation in helping informal carers to maintain an active and productive life while providing care for their dependents (European Commission, 2016a). Women bear the brunt of long-term informal care duties More women than men assume long-term infor- mal responsibilities at least several days a week or every day. Overall, women represent 62 % of all people providing LTC in the EU ( 41 ). At EU level, the informal LTC rate for older people and/ or people with disabilities was 15 % for women and 10 % for men in 2016. Significant variations exist between and within Member States in the number of informal carers (Figure 39). The share of people who report that they are providing informal LTC reaches 32 % for women and 20 % for men in France, whereas in Germany it is as low as 5 % for women and 7 % for men. There is nearly equal distribution of care duties in Swe- den, Romania, Croatia and Estonia (0.8 p.p.), and gaps as high as 13 p.p. in Belgium, 11 p.p. in France and 10 p.p. in Malta. Despite a large vari- ety of formal LTC systems, the disproportionate distribution of informal care duties to women\u2019s disadvantage is a persistent pattern across the EU-28. ",
        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 80 When interpreting the differences among Mem- ber States, it is important to take into account the subjectivity in assessing involvement in LTC. The EQLS did not provide a definition of \u2018care\u2019. As a result, \u2018providing care\u2019 can be understood as encompassing a vast range of actions of varying intensity, from the maintenance of social links to support for daily activities or even near-medical care. Older women most likely to be long-term informal carers Women of pre-retirement age (50-64 years) are most likely to take care of older people and/ or people with disabilities. In the EU, 21 % of women and 11 % of men of this age provided LTC every day or several days a week in 2016, compared to 13 % of women and 9 % of men aged 25-49 years. About a third of women aged 50-64 years in Belgium (37 %), France (33 %) and Lat- via (33 %) provide care at least several days a week (Figure 40). The difference in informal LTC rates between women aged 20-49 years and women aged 50-64 years is par- ticularly striking in Poland (\u2013 17 p.p.), Spain (\u2013 17 p.p.), Greece (\u2013 16 p.p.) and Bel- gium (\u2013 16 p.p.). Similarly, in 22 EU Member States, men of pre-retirement age (50- 64 years) are more likely to provide LTC than younger men (20-49 years). The high- est percentage of men of pre-retirement age involved in informal care are found in Latvia (28 %), France (21 %) and Estonia (17 %). As well as differences between age groups, there also are gender gaps within different age groups. Overall for the EU there is a 10-p.p. dif- ference among women and men of pre-retire- ment age and a 4-p.p. gap among those aged 20-49 years.

There are only two Member States (HU, HR) where the share of women and men informal carers aged 50-64 is about equal, and three Member States (CZ, PT, EE) where older men are slightly more likely than older women to provide LTC. The intersection of gender and age under- scores the particularly disadvantaged position of older women in the gender division of infor- mal care responsibilities and the challenge that intensive care poses on their work\u2014life balance. Although people aged 50-64 years are still eco- nomically active in a large number of Member States, their employment rates are much lower, especially for women involved in informal care. Long-term care duties intensify gender inequalities in employment, particularly for women A closer look at people who are in paid work and who are also providing LTC on a regular basis gives an insight into how many employed people have added pressure on their work\u2014life balance. A large share of employed people, par- ticularly women, combine work with care respon- sibilities. In the EU, 13 % of all working women and 9 % of working men were providing care to older people and/or people with disabilities at least several times a week in 2016 (Figure 41). In 21 EU Member States, a larger proportion of working women provide informal LTC. On the other hand, in four EU Member States (RO, SE, IE, PT), working men account for a bigger share of carers. In Austria, Germany and Czechia, the gender division is almost the same. In general, women and men providing LTC are less likely to participate in the labour market. In the EU, 42 % of women and 56 % of men taking care of older people and/or people with disabil- ities every day or several days a week in 2016 also had paid jobs, compared to 47 % of women and 58 % of men without care responsibilities (Figure 42).

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 83 The gendered nature of care responsibilities is evident across all age groups. Among those aged 20-49 years, women caring for older peo- ple and/or people with disabilities participate in the labour market by 8 p.p. less than women without such responsibilities and by 19 p.p. less than men carers. Men\u2019s employment rate in this age group is high, regardless of their involve- ment in informal care (Figure 42). Women of pre-retirement age (50-64 years) are even more negatively impacted. Fewer than one in two women (48 %) providing LTC is employed, in comparison with 66 % of men. Among those who are inactive, every tenth woman aged 50 years or more reports that family or care responsibilities are the main reasons for taking a career break and/or not seeking a job (EIGE, 2016b). Informal caring duties can also lead to early retirement for older carers, particularly women (European Commission, 2013). Research suggests that the impact of informal care provision on work might vary due to dif- ferent factors, including the number of hours of care provided, whether care is provided to a co-resident or someone living outside the household and the availability of formal care ser- vices (Colombo, Llena-Nozal, Mercier, & Tjadens, 2011). The intensity of care is another important variable in assessing the impact of care work on the mental health of carers. In fact, caring for more than 20 hours a week is linked to a 20 % higher prevalence of mental health problems among carers than for non-carers (Colombo et al., 2011). Overall, in Member States where women dis- proportionately bear the burden of LTC, gender inequalities in labour participation are higher. In fact, EU Member States with larger gender gaps in the provision of care for older people and/ or people with disabilities have lower scores in the sub-domain of participation in the labour market (r = 0.3338 *) (Panel A in Figure 43). For instance, Belgium has the highest gender gap in care, with 26 % of women and 12 % of men providing care (gender gap \u2013 13 p.p.), as well as one of the lowest scores in the sub-domain of participation (78.2 points).

One in three households live without adequate care In the EU, 29 % of households reported unmet needs for professional home-care services in 2016 ( 42 ) (Figure 44). Among Member States, this figure ranges from 12 % in Sweden to 86 % in Portugal. Some of the most common reasons reported by households are affordability (49 %) and lack of available care services (15 %) ( 43 ). For instance, in Cyprus, Romania and Poland, the cost of professional home-care services is an obstacle for up to 85 %, 80 % and 71 % of households respectively. Certain groups of the population may have more difficulty in accessing formal LTC services, includ- ing people with low income, poorly educated peo- ple, migrants and ethnic minority women (Euro- pean Commission, 2009). As a result, households are forced to provide care themselves or, in some Member States, to outsource care to domestic ( 42 ) 27 EU MS, data for Denmark is not available.

The situation of migrant domes- tic workers engaged in infor- mal care is of major concern. Most care migrants have irregular contracts which generally implies precarious working conditions and lim- ited access to social-protec- tion rights (Spasova et al., 2018). \u2018Unmet need\u2019 is a subjective measure which does not provide an insight into the type of needs that are not met in different Member States as peo- ple\u2019s living conditions and available services vary across Member States.

This may be due to their greater involvement in informal care. Moreover, older women tend to live alone more often than men, and therefore may be in need of care to a greater extent. Inability to access professional care services when needed not only impacts upon the qual- ity of life of the person in need of care, but may also force others to allocate more time to caring. This can have far-reaching effects on their ability to combine paid work with care duties. In addi- tion, it can prevent their access to better-quality jobs and negatively affect their employment sta- tus and the number of hours they can engage in paid work (ILO, 2018a). Considerable differences exist across Member States as regards unmet needs for professional home-care services and the levels of gender equality achieved.

As demonstrated by Fig- ure 45 (Panel A), the highest levels of gender ine- qualities in the use of time, as measured in the Gender Equality Index\u2019s domain of time (particu- larly in the sub-domain of social activities), are noted in Member States (e.g. EL, PT) with very large shares of households with unmet needs for professional home-care services (r = \u2013 0.4646 *).

In Member States where households reveal high levels of unmet needs for care services, women are noted to have lower scores in career pros- pects ( 44 ) (r = \u2013 0.5863 *) (Panel B, Figure 45).

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 86 9.4. Informal care of children and childcare services Equally shared or not, childcare is a key dimension of gender equality Family structures have changed drastically in recent decades. The male breadwinner model is no longer pre-eminent, supplanted by the prev- alence of dual-earning and single-headed fam- ilies as more women work outside of the home and not all families have a mother and a father. This has had a significant impact on childcare at a time when extended family members, such as grandparents, are less engaged in looking after their grandchildren. A broader range of family and work circumstances, which has led to par- ents needing for more and varied childcare ser- vices, has put pressure on public policies and services. Member States in the EU have reacted differ- ently according to their different labour-mar- ket structures, social and political systems and demographic circumstances. Understanding how social policies and structures affect gender roles, particularly in the division of care work at home, is key to progress on gender equality. Policies can support parents to stay in employ- ment by providing services that support defa- milisation \u2014 defined as the extent to which measures enable parents to be active outside the home by transferring traditional care work performed for free within the family to the for- mal and paid childcare sector (Esping-Andersen, 1990; Orloff, 1996). Policies and services can also resist defamilisation through the expecta- tion that childcare is given by family members at home. Policy approaches on this spectrum affect how parents share childcare in the home, with wider consequences for gender equal- ity in society as a whole. While certain policy options may promote equality between women and men by increasing the labour-market par- ticipation of women with children and men\u2019s involvement in childcare, by undervaluing the social and economic value of care jobs they can also undermine the economic independence of women from lower social classes or migrant backgrounds, thus aggravating inequalities among women (Michel & Mahon, 2013). As a result of different policy approaches and services provided, three main models for the organisation of care work and gender roles have been conceptualised (Ciccia & Bleijen- bergh, 2014). \u0083 The male breadwinner model is based on strictly distinct gender roles, with men asso- ciated with full-time paid work outside the home. Women are assigned to reproductive roles and are solely responsible for unpaid childcare. One consequence of this set-up is women\u2019s total economic dependency on their partner\u2019s income. The \u2018modified breadwin- ner model\u2019 or \u2018one and a half earner\u2019 model, where women combine part-time work with care responsibilities, is now considered the most prevalent version of this model (Cromp- ton, 2001, 2006). \u0083 The universal breadwinner or \u2018adult worker\u2019 model promotes men\u2019s and wom- en\u2019s economic independence and their full labour-market participation. To this end, childcare provision is encouraged either by public or private entities (Lewis & Giullari, 2005). This model is often criticised for per- petuating the low social and economic value given to care work. \u0083 The \u2018dual-earner/dual-caregiver\u2019 model is described as \u2018one that supports equal oppor- tunities for men and women in employment, equal contributions from mothers and fathers at home and high-quality care for children provided both by parents and by well-quali- fied and well-compensated non-parental car- egivers\u2019 (Wright, Gornick, & Meyers, 2009). Consequently, a \u2018dual-earner/dual-caregiver\u2019 model is often proposed to address the short- comings of the \u2018male breadwinner/female homemaker model\u2019 and its variants (Ciccia & Bleijenbergh, 2014). Despite a significant increase in the public provision of childcare services in recent years, women with children under 7 years of age in ",

The gender FTE gap (18 p.p. detrimen- tal to women) is closely related to care respon- sibilities. Unequal engagement of women and men in unpaid and paid work constitutes the root cause to gender inequalities in the labour market, in political decision-making and in soci- ety as a whole (Crompton, 1997; Walby, 1989; Wright et al., 2009). Childcare provision: an EU priority yet to reach every family EU policymakers have long recognised that the unequal sharing of childcare responsibilities within the family is one of the main reasons for women\u2019s lower labour-market participation. This culminated in the 2002 adoption of ambitious childcare provision targets by the Barcelona European Council, with goals to be achieved by 2010. Referred to as the \u2018Barcelona targets\u2019, they urged Member States to provide childcare for 33 % of children under 3 years of age and for 90 % of children from 3 years to mandatory school age by 2010. More recently, the Euro- pean Pillar of Social Rights and its \u2018New start\u2019 initiative emphasised children\u2019s right to afforda- ble, quality educational and childcare services. The EU also reaffirmed the need for children from marginalised socioeconomic backgrounds to benefit from specific remedial action to fur- ther their development and social inclusion ( 45 ). There are many documented social and eco- nomic benefits associated with quality and affordable childcare services. Statistical analy- sis of the impact of a variety of family-friendly measures (including parental leave, flexible working arrangements, childcare provision, etc.) on women\u2019s labour-market participation has shown that the provision of subsidised childcare services has had the most significant impact on reducing gender gaps in employment. It under- lines the fact that support for working moth- ers is one of the most effective means to their ( 45 ) Building on the European Commission recommendation on \u2018Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u2019 of 2013.

Similarly, an analysis by the Inter- national Trade Union Confederation shows that an increased investment of 2 % of GDP in the care industry by seven OECD countries would lead to an increase of 3.3 to 8.2 p.p. in women\u2019s employment and 1.4 to 4.0 p.p. for men (Inter- national Trade Union Confederation, 2016). Quality, affordable universal childcare services are also instrumental in addressing social ineq- uities affecting children (European Commission, 2018g). This is reflected in EU policies which promote the social and economic integration of marginalised groups, such as the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies ( 46 ) and the action plan on the integration of third-coun- try nationals ( 47 ), referring to the importance of quality early childhood education services. They also call for barriers to the enrolment of Roma or migrant children into formal childcare ser- vices to be removed. Investment in national childcare provision strongly relates to gender-equality outcomes in society, measured by the correlation between the enrolment in formal childcare services of children below 3 years of age (first Barcelona target) and the Gender Equality Index scores (r = 0.7952 *). The relation also holds, albeit to a lesser degree, for the second Barcelona target on care services for children between 3 years of age and the mandatory school age (r = 0.5445 *). It highlights that Member States where formal childcare is widely availa- ble tended to have high scores in the Gender Equality Index (Figure 46). Despite the equal sharing of childcare between women and men being a long-standing demand of the feminist movement and a key component of any policy effort to increase gender equality, it is important to acknowledge that the national targets and levels of ambition pursued by Mem- ber States in developing childcare services often vary. They may influence the conditions in which such services are made available. In par- ticular, childcare provision is often presented as ",

Stratigaki (2004) in particular argued that not only had equal sharing of childcare \u2014 or \u2018rec- onciliation\u2019 \u2014 been abandoned to the growing policy priority of job creation, it now serves to legitimise flexible working conditions instead of changing gender relations within the family. Figure 47 shows that, across the EU, about a third of all children under 3 years of age are enrolled in a formal childcare institution (34 %). This means that collectively the EU has achieved the first Barcelona target of 33 %. This represents a 7-p.p. increase over the preceding 5 years. Nationally, 13 Member States had reached the goal ( 48 ), with considerable progress made in certain Member States such as Malta (+ 20 p.p.), the Netherlands (+ 16 p.p.), Portugal (+ 14 p.p.), Lithuania (+ 12 p.p.), France (+ 11 p.p.) and Spain (+ 10 p.p.) over the preceding 5 years.

In 2017 it only had 1 % of children below 3 years of age in formal childcare. At the same time, 17 % of children below 3 years of age are in full-time childcare (30 hours or more per week) on average in the EU. 14 Mem- ber States have a share of children attending full-time childcare higher than the EU aver- age ( 49 ). In Denmark the majority of children attend full-time childcare (66 %), followed by Portugal (46 %) and Slovenia (41 %). Slovakia, Romania and Czechia are notable for having the lowest percentages of children in full-time child- care, at 1 %, 2 % and 3 % respectively. These figures reflect divergent views on the role of the state, the market and the family in the provision of childcare services. The EU-28\u2019s progress on the target of providing 90 % of children from 3 years of age to man- datory school age with formal childcare reached 85 % in 2017 (Figure 48), with 10 EU Member States (BG, CZ, EL, HR, CY, LT, PL, RO, SK and UK) Figure 46: Gender-equality scores 2017, and (A) the percentage of children up to 3 years of age cared for under formal arrangements and (B) the percentage of children from 3 years of age to the mandatory school age cared for under formal arrangements BE BG CZ DK DE EE IE EL ES FR HR IT CY LV LT LU HU MT NL AT PL PT RO SI SK FI SE UK 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 A B 85 90 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Percentage of children up to 3 years of age cared for under formal arrangements Pearson correlation r = 0.7952 *; Spearman correlation r = 0.8254 * Pearson correlation r = 0.5445 *; Spearman correlation r = 0.6502 * BE BG CZ DK DE EE IE EL ES FR HR IT CY LV LT LU HU MT NL AT PL PT RO SI SK FI SE UK 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 S c o r e s o f t h e G e n d e r E q u a l i t y I n d e x S c o r e s o f t h e G e n d e r E q u a l i t y I n d e x Percentage of children from 3 years of age to the mandatory school age cared for under formal arrangements Note : EIGE\u2019s calculations, EU-SILC, Gender Equality Index, (*) refers to significance at 10 %.

In the EU in 2016, 14 % of households reported that their needs for childcare services were unmet (Figure 49). This ranged from 22 % of United Kingdom households to 3 % of house- holds in Bulgaria. The reporting of unmet needs for childcare varied according to the gender of the respondent, partially because it is a subjec- tive measure. In the majority of Member States (21), women were more likely to report unmet need than men. Such gender differences in assessing whether the care needs of the house- hold are being met were also observed in rela- tion to LTC (Figure 44). In the EU, on average, households headed by lone mothers are more likely to experience unmet needs for childcare services (19 %) than couples with children (14 %). Affordability (50 %) is the most often cited rea- son for unmet need. The lack of available places (12 %), opening hours (8 %) and distance (5 %) pose less of a problem. In Cyprus and Ireland, ",

This was consistent with EU-wide sta- tistics. These showed that reliance on informal childcare (including grandparents and other relatives, friends or neighbours) was higher among low-income families, with 61 % of fami- lies in the poorest quartile dependent on family or friends compared to 50 % of families in the richest quartile. The use of formal childcare as the main type of childcare also increased with income, from 28 % in families in the poorest quartile to 45 % for families in the wealthiest quartile ( 51 ). Analysis of EU-SILC data by the European Social Policy Network found that mothers\u2019 education levels were another important predictor of the use of formal childcare in all EU Member States. Children born to highly educated mothers were much more likely to attend formal childcare than children born to women with a lower level of education. In the United Kingdom, for exam- ( 51 ) EIGE calculations based on the EQLS, 2016. Main type of childcare used for youngest child among respondents with at least one child < 12 in household in EU-28.

These anal- yses highlight how entrenched socioeconomic inequities affect women\u2019s ability to access and benefit from services designed to promote work\u2014life balance, and underline the need for an intersectional analysis on childcare policies to ensure access for families most in need. Women\u2019s work and economic independence most impacted by childcare How families organise themselves to look after children outside of formal childcare is likely to be influenced by gender roles and expec- tations. The EWCS shows that in households with the youngest child below 7 years of age, women spend an average of 32 hours a week on paid work compared to men\u2019s 41 hours, and 39 hours on unpaid work compared to men\u2019s 19 hours (Eurofound, 2017a, p. 117).

At Member State level, this situation affects 20 % of women in the Netherlands, 18 % in the United Kingdom, 16 % in Austria and 12 % in Ireland. The highest share of men working part-time or being economically inactive due to care duties is observed in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands (2 %), and Ireland (1 %). Gaps in care services limit women\u2019s employ- ment opportunities, while men\u2019s participation in the labour market remains unaffected by care responsibilities. As shown in Section 9.6, despite having greater access to flexibility when compared to women, men are less likely to be engaged in part-time work. Furthermore, women working part-time face difficulties tran- sitioning to full-time work (Figure 63). This is further highlighted in Figure 50, in which unmet needs in childcare services strongly correlate with the percentage of women informally car- ing for their children or grandchildren every day (r = 0.5206 *). This points to the fact that Member States where families face difficulties ( 52 ) EIGE\u2019s calculation, EU LFS, 2017.

In the EU, the majority of adults are regularly involved in childcare, with 56 % of women and 51 % of men spending time caring for or edu- cating their children or grandchildren every week ( 53 ). When examining the share of peo- ple looking after their own children (Figure 51), starker differences between women and men emerge, with 91 % of women involved com- pared to 78 % of men. Nationally, the most strik- ing gender gaps are seen in Lithuania (26 p.p.), Greece (24 p.p.), Poland (23 p.p.), Spain (19 p.p.) and Romania (18 p.p.). Men are most likely to be involved in informal childcare in Sweden (95 % and on a par with women), Ireland (90 %), and Estonia, Portugal and Slovenia (89 %).

Factors possibly affecting parents\u2019 ability to regularly care for their children include atypical work schedules, labour migration and custodial arrangements where there has been a separa- tion. Research shows that such circumstances are likely to decrease fathers\u2019 engagement with their children and increase that of mothers (Hook & Wolfe, 2011). Grandparents\u2019 involvement in informal childcare is a key enabling factor for parents to combine work and family responsibilities. Figure 52 shows that 23 % of women and 19 % of men in the EU spend time caring for and/ or educating their grandchildren several times a week. While the gender gap (4 p.p.) is lower than that observed among women and men caring for their own children, the level of grand- parents\u2019 involvement varies greatly among Member States. It ranged from 50 % for women and 46 % for men in Cyprus to 8 % of women and 7 % men in Sweden. As with other types of informal care, childcare provided by grand- parents is highly gendered and more likely to be performed by women (Koslowski, 2009; Leo- pold & Skopek, 2014). Several factors such as gender norms, women\u2019s greater time availabil- ity due to shorter working lives (see Chapter 2) and greater likelihood of working part-time con- tribute to grandmothers\u2019 higher engagement in informal childcare. The largest gender differences in care given by grandparents and to the disadvantage of women were seen in Romania (20 p.p.), Czechia (16 p.p.), Italy (11 p.p.) and Poland (11 p.p.). Men were more likely to care for their grandchildren than women in Luxembourg (7 p.p.), Germany (4 p.p.) and Latvia (3 p.p.).

However, employment gender gaps are dramatically higher among men and women with children, and increase with the size of the family. They range from 2 p.p. among people with no chil- dren to 15 p.p. with one child, 19 p.p. with two children and 29 p.p. for women and men with three or more children ( 54 ). While employ- ment among fathers is higher than that of men without children, the opposite is true for women. Figure 53 highlights that gender gaps on providing childcare to children or grandchil- dren remain regardless of professional cir- cumstances. While the gap between working women and men in the EU in 2016 was 8 p.p., the gap between non-working women and men was 13 p.p. The most striking gender difference was observed among managers (19 p.p.). This highlights that even when placed in demand- ing professional occupations, women are still expected to combine informal childcare with professional responsibilities to a far greater extent than men.

Only in Ireland are women and men equally likely to care for children while being employed. In four Member States (SE, LV, EE, SI), employed men are slightly more likely to be engaged in caring than employed women.

Transport and public infrastructure Women rely more on public infrastructure for work\u2014life balance Access to quality and sustainable public infra- structure such as care and educational facilities, health services and transportation is funda- mental to people\u2019s well-being and participation in social and economic activities. The complex interplay between mobility, out-of-home activi- ties, care responsibilities and paid work under- scores the critical role of public infrastructure in determining employment opportunities for women and men and in balancing paid work with other life duties and needs. Traditional gender roles assigning women to care work, paid or unpaid, result in women using and contributing to public infrastructure more than men (OECD, 2019). For public infra- structure to benefit the whole population, its design, location and accessibility should take into account the differences in gender needs. Due to the scope of this analysis, and given that women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to healthcare (see Chapter 7), care services (Sections 9.3 and 9.4) and educational facilities (see Chapter 4 and Section 9.7) are covered elsewhere, greater focus is put herein on other physical public infrastructure, and in particular on transport. Both transport and related travel behaviour, as well as the presence and quality of other facili- ties and services, are highly relevant to the anal- ysis of work\u2014life balance and gender equality. The existing literature provides much evidence on how transport and commuting explicitly sup- port work\u2014life balance. However, the use and accessibility of other public infrastructure facil- ities and services in relation to work\u2014life bal- ance per se have not been as extensively exam- ined as gender and employment (Schwanen & de Jong, 2008). Nonetheless, limited availability of gender-dis- aggregated data on physical public infrastruc- ture means that the current scoreboard (Sec- tion 9.1) contains only one transport-related indicator. It measures the time women and men spend on commuting between home and work. A number of other aspects regarding transpor- tation and travel behaviour can also be cap- tured through such information as the average time women and men spend on various cate- gories of travelling or the gender differences in the mode of transport typically used, which are also discussed in this section. Commuting patterns reflect and perpetuate gender roles at home and at work Due to existing gender inequalities across var- ious domains of life, women and men have dif- ferent access to transport and public infrastruc- ture, which affects them differently. A large body of academic literature has demonstrated signif- icant gender differences in the travel patterns and behaviour of women and men, in particular in their journey to work (EIGE, 2016a). For exam- ple, women are more likely to travel shorter dis- tances than men and undertake more complex and multi-purpose trips (CIVITAS, 2014). These travel patterns are the result of women\u2019s dual role in work and care, as well as the une- qual distribution of household chores (Blumen, 1994; EIGE, 2016a). Greater household respon- sibilities mean that women are more likely to work shorter hours (part-time) and closer to their home so as to be able to fulfil other tasks, including care and shopping (Bowling, G\u00f6llner, & O\u2019Dwyer, 1999). In this respect, women with young children are particularly disadvantaged regarding job choice and location because of the space-time fixity of work, childcare and other household tasks. This constrained mobil- ity makes it harder for women to participate in the labour market on the same footing as men, in turn increasing the gender pay gap and wom- en\u2019s risk of economic dependency and poverty (Blumen, 1994). Men\u2019s lower engagement in care and other household activities reflects their higher focus on successful and stable career pathways, accompanied by greater options on commuting type or time. ",
        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 97 Commuting is not only necessary for people to reach their work place, it also gives them more freedom to choose positions that suit their edu- cational background, even if it means travelling further. Men typically spend somewhat more time commuting and are also more likely to engage in linear, single-purpose trips (to and from work), in contrast to women. Overall, on average in the EU, commuting to and from work constitutes close to 30 % of all daily travelling time for women and close to 40 % for men. Travel related to shopping and other services, however, takes nearly a quarter of all travel time for women but less than one fifth of men\u2019s ( 55 ). Evidently, these differences indicate travelling being a wider reflection of gendered struc- tures in both the labour market and the private sphere.

In line with wider litera- ture (Crane, 2007), the referred commuting time does not directly reflect travel distances or travel modes, which may perpetuate further gender differences. About-the-same commut- ing time can entail major differences in travel distances as well as in speed and costs associ- ated with the differing transport modes used to reach workplaces. Among Member States, the longest commuting time for women was noted in Denmark (48 minutes), and for men in the United Kingdom (58 minutes). The short- est commuting times were observed in Cyprus, for both women and men. In seven Member States (AT, DE, IE, BE, LV, UK, SE), where gen- der gaps on commuting time were much more notable, average commuting times, especially for men, were also longer compared to Mem- ber States with smaller or near-equal gender gaps (e.g. CY, PT, IT, BG, EL).

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 98 Given the often subtle but complex ways mobil- ity and gender intersect, differences in commut- ing times are more pronounced among certain groups of women and men. For example, com- muting times are longer among employees with a higher level of educational qualifications, espe- cially among men in the prime earning years of 35 and above (Lee & McDonald, 2003). This under- lines once again the importance of commuting as an enabler of accessibility to desirable jobs. On average in the EU, commuting times were consistently shorter for women than men across various family and work dimensions (Figure 56). More notable dips in mobility were seen among women living in couples with dependent chil- dren. At the same time, lone parents had longer commuting times, potentially from increased efforts to combine family and work at any cost. When taking into account different patterns of employment, the mobility of women in self-em- ployment or in marginal part-time work was particularly constrained. In addition, the com- muting times of women working in the private sector were shorter than those of equivalent men and those of women and men in the pub- lic sector.

Gender differences in commuting times across various categories of employment intensity might reflect not only overall gender segregation in the labour market (see Chapter 2), but also the influ- ence of flexible working arrangements. As noted in Section 9.6, despite lower overall availability of flexible working arrangements (particularly in the public sector), women\u2019s higher take-up of such arrangements in comparison to men\u2019s take-up is a strong reflection of women\u2019s push for balance in paid work and household duties. Equal access to transport can empower women Commuting time is not only strongly linked to the entire Gender Equality Index ( 56 ), but also to two of its domains \u2014 time and work \u2014 as demonstrated by Figure 57. It can be viewed as an enabling factor for gender equality across various domains of life, particularly regarding women\u2019s and men\u2019s employment opportunities and their access to high-quality jobs.

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 99 In the domain of time, the strongest link is with the scores for the sub-domain of care activ ities. This suggests that in Member States where women\u2019s mobility is higher, women and men are more equally involved in caring for children and other dependents, as well as in house- hold activities. This means that gender equality on how time is spent, even on issues such as commuting and mobility, has knock-on effects for equality in other areas of life. An important additional example is in the domain of work. Higher commuting times for women go hand in hand with higher gender-equality scores for the sub-domain of segregation and quality of work. This shows that women\u2019s greater mobility is not only possible, unleashing a more equita- ble share of care activities in the process, it also leads to better and more diversified job options that reduce gender gaps in the world of work. It should also be noted that although the correla- tions in Figure 57 focus on linkages between the commuting time of women who work full-time, equivalent linkages could be established with the commuting time of men working full-time. In addition, respective associations could be dis- played on average commuting times pointing to mobility as a strong predictor of women\u2019s and men\u2019s overall engagement in economic and social life, irrespective of working intensity or family set- tings. In general, the existence of these linkages suggests that commuting time acts as a strong Figure 57: Gender Equality Index scores and average number of minutes per day spent commuting to and from work by women working full-time (15+), 2015 AT BE BG CY CZ DE DK EE EL ES FI FR HR HU IE IT LT LU LV MT NL PL PT RO SE SI SK UK 35 45 55 A C D B 65 75 85 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 S c o r e s o f t h e G e n d e r E q u a l i t y I n d e x , t i m e d o m a i n Average number of minutes per day spent commuting to and from work by women working full AT BE BG CY CZ DE DK EE EL ES FI FR HR HU IE IT LT LU LV MT NL PL PT RO SE SI SK UK 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 S c o r e s o f t h e G e n d e r E q u a l i t y I n d e x , t i m e s u b - d o m a i n o f c a r e a c t i v i t i e s Average number of minutes per day spent commuting to and from work by women working full Pearson correlation r = 0.6987 *; Spearman correlation r = 0.7789 * Pearson correlation r = 0.6209 *; Spearman correlation r = 0.6760 * Pearson correlation r = 0.7664 *; Spearman correlation r = 0.8155 * Pearson correlation r = 0.6224 *; Spearman correlation r = 0.7400 * AT BE BG CY CZ DE DK EE EL ES FI FR HR HU IE IT LT LU LV MT NL PL PT RO SE SI SK UK 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 S c o r e s o f t h e G e n d e r E q u a l i t y I n d e x , w o r k d o m a i n Average number of minutes per day spent commuting to and from work by women working full-time AT BE BG CY CZ DE DK EE EL ES FI FR HR HU IE IT LT LU LV MT NL PL PT RO SE SI SK UK 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 S c o r e s o f t h e G e n d e r E q u a l i t y I n d e x , w o r k s u b - d o m a i n o f s e g r e g a t i o n a n d q u a l i t y o f w o r k Average number of minutes per day spent commuting to and from work by women working full-time Note : EIGE\u2019s calculations, EWCS (2015), Gender Equality Index, (*) refers to significance at 10 %.

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 100 enabling factor in balancing paid work and care activities, thereby influencing gender-equality outcomes across Member States. Besides commuting time, there are substantial differences in the mode of transportation used by women and men. Data shows that men have access to faster and more comfortable modes of transport, most notably private cars. A number of studies suggests that the allocation of a car within a household is based on deeply rooted gender norms, with the result that cars are more likely to be attributed to men (Blumen, 1994). Access to a private vehicle tends to grant men access to a wider range of labour-market oppor- tunities, as distance and time to commute are not obstacles. Consequently, men are more likely to be employed further away from their home than women. In contrast, women use cars less and public transport more than men, notably, for example, due to lower (personal) incomes (Blu- men, 1994; Bowling et al., 1999; CIVITAS, 2014; Lang, 1992; Uteng & Cresswell, 2016). It is also argued (Blumen, 1994) that preference given to men in the use of the family car is associated with men\u2019s higher income. This leads to a vicious circle, as women\u2019s inaccessibility to a car often restricts ( 57 ) EIGE calculation based on Eurobarometer 82.2 (2014) data. ( 58 ) EIGE calculation based on EQLS data (2016). their employment opportunities to poorly paid occupations that are found closer to their home. Figure 58 shows that larger families in the EU were more likely to have cars as the most typi- cally used transport mode. Men used cars more often than women regardless of family type, with gender gaps wider among families with children and childless couples than single people. This reflects the greater needs and (income) possi- bilities of such families. Couples with children, for example, rely on cars as a means to better balance work and private-life needs. Lone par- ents with children, however, were less likely to be able to afford a car (see Chapter 3 as regards income situation), reporting no alternative mode of transport available to them other than public transport (18 %) or walking (22 %) ( 57 ). In general, access to public transport in the EU was viewed as either very or rather difficult for about a quar- ter of women and men with lower incomes (first quartile), as well as for a fifth of women and men with higher incomes (fourth quartile) ( 58 ). Generational factors also come into play on the link between gender and transport modes. For example, single women and men, who are mainly Figure 58: Distribution of women and men by mode of transport typically used (15+, %), by household type, EU-28, 2014 Women Men 39 45 50 61 31 29 22 16 28 24 26 22 42 53 63 72 26 20 15 11 26 24 19 12 0 25 50 75 Single Lone parent Couple without children Couple with children Single Lone parent Couple without children Couple with children Single Lone parent Couple without children Couple with children Car Public transport Biking and walking P e r c e n t a g e Source: EIGE calculation based on Eurobarometer 82.2 data.

The largest gender gap among those typically using public transport was among lone parents, with women more dependent on it. Among those biking or walking, the gender gap was greatest among couples with children and those without, with women again more reliant on these transport modes. Clearly, the travel and commuting statistics pro- vided above highlight that women\u2019s access to private transport has a crucial impact on their economic autonomy, particularly given existing transport infrastructure. Lack of access to a car for daily use restricts women\u2019s employment options, while the longer travel times involved in the use of public transport makes it even more difficult for women, particularly lone mothers, to achieve a good work\u2014life balance. As a result, it becomes increasingly necessary to reduce their working time, with consequences for their income levels and financial independence. It should be stressed that these findings reflect the current transport situation, which favours the use of private cars. At the same time, and given the gendered patterns of unpaid care and paid work division, the availa- bility, accessibility and cost of currently available public transport is a particularly strong determi- nant of whether women and men can work, how much they can work and where. Rethinking (envi- ronmental) sustainability and greater investment in public transport infrastructure with these fac- tors in mind could go some way to addressing gender inequalities in work\u2014life balance. The quality and safety of public transport are of importance too in determining how women and men use it. For example, sexual harassment on public transport is a major concern for women, impacting negatively on their overall mobility (Gardner, Cui, & Coiacetto, 2017). This is especially the case where there is no option to use a pri- vate car or to cycle, while walking carries security risks. Women with disabilities are particularly vul- nerable targets of sexual assault on public trans- port (Iudici, Bertoli, & Faccio, 2017), adding to the multiple other challenges they face (see e.g. Chapters 2 and 3). ( 59 ) Eurostat (lfsa_ewhun2). While this chapter highlights complexities and close links between transport/public infrastruc- ture and its shaping of gender-equal outcomes across the various spheres of life, it is important to stress the need for cautious interpretation of the available data and in the given time frame. Tack- ling gender equality via improved access to pub- lic infrastructure and transport is not only about seeking the same opportunities for women and men, it is also about a sustained, forward-looking understanding of the relationship between gen- der and mobility (Hanson, 2010), and mobility and work. Commuting times between home and work, for example, could be less of an impedi- ment to balancing work and life if opportunities for flexible working arrangements were greatly expanded (see Section 9.6). This would allow for a reallocation of how time is spent: from com- muting to more time with families. The future relationship between gender equal- ity and mobility could also be affected by such developments as smart transportation and the impact of digitalisation on gender equality (EIGE, 2018d, 2019a). Lastly, if gender equality was better mainstreamed into public infrastructure developments, and with greater investment in public transport overall, private transport would play a less crucial role in determining job options. This would open more opportunities for a bet- ter work\u2014life balance for both women and men (EIGE, 2016a) and reduce transport\u2019s environ- mental footprint. 9.6. Flexible working arrangements Greater autonomy in setting work-time schedules \u2014 for some The average weekly working hours of employees in the EU are on the decline as overall employ- ment rates rise (see Chapter 2). Men\u2019s weekly working time decreased by 1 hour between 2008 and 2017 (from 41.0 to 40.0 hours). For women, their working week declined by 0.3 hours (or close to 20 minutes) \u2014 from 34.0 to 33.7 hours ( 59 ). ",
        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 102 This working-time reduction reveals a general aspiration to close the gap between desired and actual working hours, with a fifth of Euro- peans dissatisfied with the balance between their work and personal lives (Euro- barometer, 2018). Further- more, the relatively larger drop in working time for men reflects a growing phe- nomenon among them to strike a better work\u2014 life balance so that they are more able to care for children or dependent relatives (Akgunduz & Plantenga, 2012; Eurofound, 2017c, 2018b). Flexible working arrangements (FWAs) provide greater possibilities for entering the labour mar- ket, retaining full-time jobs or striking a better work\u2014life balance because they better match working hours to private life needs. Nearly half of part-time workers in the EU indicate they would be willing to move to full-time jobs if more FWAs were available (Eurobarometer, 2018). With only 42 % of people actually making use of available FWAs (Eurobarometer, 2018), greater attention must be paid to general availability as well as to barriers to take-up. These can include discour- agement from management, stigmatisation, lack of support from colleagues or an expected neg- ative career impact (Teasdale, 2013). FWAs typically refer to flexibility on how much, when and where employees can work (Euro- found, 2017c; Laundon & Williams, 2018), and are viewed as a way to reduce tensions between the demands of work and private life. Histori- cally, FWAs were introduced to facilitate wom- en\u2019s greater participation in the labour market, and are still closely associated with the need for more time for household work and fam- ily responsibilities (Laundon & Williams, 2018; Leuze & Strau\u00df, 2016). This enduring association is influencing the low uptake of certain FWAs by men (Laundon & Williams, 2018). Nonetheless, changes in the labour market increasingly posi- tion FWAs as an innovative tool for companies to boost productivity and attract and retain employees, presenting a win-win situation for both employees and employers (Berkery, Mor- ley, Tiernan, Purtill, & Parry, 2017; Leslie, Man- chester, Park, & Mehng, 2012; Wheatley, 2017). Despite an increasing availability of FWAs (Euro- barometer, 2018; Plantenga et al., 2010; Wheat- Figure 59: Percentage of women and men by ability to set their own working-time arrangements (16+), EU-28, 2015 (Indicator 12) Women Men 57 10 19 14 54 8 19 19 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Set by the company/organisation with no possibility for changes Choice between several fixed working schedules determined by the company/organisation Ability to adapt own working hours within certain limits (e.g. flextime) Working hours are entirely determined by yourself P e r c e n t a g e Source: EIGE calculation based on EWCS (2015) data. 57 % of women and 54 % of men in the EU are unable to change their work schedule ",

For example, if 84 % of women employees predominantly work in the office, only 75 % of men employees do so ( 60 ); if about a quarter of men employees often work in clients\u2019 premises, vehicles or other sites, only about one tenth of women do so. In 2015 in the EU, 57 % of women and 54 % of men also had no possibility of changing their working-time provisions, while 14 % of women and 19 % of men overall could completely determine their own working hours (Figure 59). In addition, the availability of working-time arrangements var- ies according to job sectors, providing a distinct link to gender segregation in the labour market.

Despite the significant percentage differ- ence, a similar share of women (65 %) and men (62 %) had no flexibility in setting their work- ing-time arrangements, meaning that a dis- proportionate number of women are affected (Figure 60). When looking at different degrees of flexibility in working-time arrangements, the public sector had by far the smallest share of employees (5 %) \u2014 both women and men \u2014 who were entirely able to determine their work- ing hours by themselves. In the private sector, the share of those with inflexible working-time arrangements was about 10 p.p. less (56 % of women and 53 % of men) than in the public sector. As 78 % of all male employees and 65 % of all female employees in the EU work in the private sec- tor ( 62 ), this means that the sector not only surpasses the public sector in providing work- ing-time arrangements that enhance work\u2014life balance, it has also given men greater access Figure 60: Percentage of women and men by ability to set their own working-time arrangements by sector (15+), EU-28, 2015 56 10 18 17 65 11 20 5 53 8 18 21 62 10 22 5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Inflexible Choice between schedules Choice within limits Entirely flexible Inflexible Choice between schedules Choice within limits Entirely flexible Private sector Public sector P e r c e n t a g e Women Men Source: EIGE calculation based on EWCS (2015) data.

Furthermore, 17 % of women and 21 % of men private-sector employees in the EU have complete flexibility in setting their own working hours, with 27 % of women and 26 % of men having access to some flexibility (i.e. choice between schedules or choice within limits). This figure compares to 31 % of women and 32 % of men having some flexibility and 5 % of women and men having complete flexibility in the public sector. Given that women shoulder a higher level of care duties, any flexibility difference between genders, combined with high rates of take-up among women, implies a \u2018push\u2019 to take alterna- tive routes to accommodate home responsibil- ities, for example by leaving jobs or reducing working hours. This has substantial financial impacts, including gender gaps in pay. In a few Member States (SE, DK, NL), both women and men in the public sector have a very high level (+ 50 % of employees) of access to considera- ble working-time flexibility.

In a few Member States, such as Latvia, Por- tugal, Malta or Bulgaria, more women than men in the public sector had considerable flexibility despite an overall low level of access (about or less than 10 %). Occupation an important factor in accessing flexible work arrangements Major differences in access to flexible working time exist not only across Member States and economic sectors but also across occupations. On average in the EU, more than 60 % of man- agers (women or men) have access to consid- erable (i.e. certain or complete) flexibility in set- ting their own working arrangements, though this occupational group is one of the smaller ones in the economy (Figure 62). Across other occupations, about a third of women at best have access to flexible working time compared to about half of men. For example, women have much lower access (35 %) than men (about 50 %) to flexibility in major occupational groups such as professionals, and technicians and associate professionals, which account for about 36 % of women\u2019s and about 22 % of men\u2019s employment. Just under a third of both women and men in the EU have access to flexible working-time arrangements in various occupations requiring a lower level of qualifications, such as clerical support workers, service and sales workers, craft and related trades workers or employees of elementary occupations. The lowest access to flexibility is seen among plant- and machine-op- erating workers, especially women (8 %). Women have fewer opportunities to move from part-time to full-time jobs The data on flexibility in working-time arrange- ments refers to the (potential) opportunity of access and not necessarily the actual take-up of such arrangements.

In addition to take-up being shaped by gen- dered norms by which women disproportion- ately shoulder caring responsibilities, existing research notes a lack of supervisor support for actual utilisation of FWAs, or generally unsup- portive organisational cultures on their take-up (McNamara, Pitt-Catsouphes, Brown, & Matz- Costa, 2012). FWAs might also be closely linked to the design of national public policies, such as parental leave, which provide highly varied employee entitlements across Member States (see Section 9.2). For example, parents in Swe- den can use their parental-leave entitlements to shorten their working hours (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2018), making FWAs subject not only to organisational but also to wider national pub- lic-policy contexts. Women\u2019s generally lower access to flexibility, especially in certain Member States and occupa- tional groups, implies that the actual work\u2014life balance arrangements for women and men are not yet based on the principle of equal oppor- tunities, resulting in more severe consequences ( 63 ) Eurostat (lfsi_pt_a). for women\u2019s participation in the labour market. This, among other things, influences a par- ticularly high prevalence of part-time employ- ment among women (see Chapter 2), as well as reduced possibilities for transition between part-time and full-time work. In 2017, four times more women than men aged 20-64 years in the EU worked part-time (31 % of women compared to 8 % of men in total employment) ( 63 ). This corresponds to more than 31 million women and more than 9 million men. Despite the pool of men working part-time being considerably smaller, their opportunities for moving to full-time jobs are much higher in comparison to those of women. Between 2016 and 2017, 59 % of men compared to 75 % of women working part-time maintained that sta- tus (Figure 63). Consequently, 28 % of men and only 14 % of women in part-time employment moved into full-time jobs. The transition rates indicate that despite an overall improvement in the labour-market situation in recent years, men\u2019s opportunities for progression into full- time work improved (26 % in 2015) considerably more than for women (13 % in 2015).

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 107 Across Member States, a larger share of part- time employment within the economy, espe- cially among women, is associated with less dynamic transitions into full-time jobs (Fig- ure 64). In 2017, this was particularly the case in Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Germany and the United Kingdom, where the share of women in part-time work was espe- cially large (from 35 % in LU to 74 % in NL) and transition rates for women into full-time jobs were very low (from 6 % in NL to 11 % in AT). With the exception of Czechia, Cyprus and Den- mark, men\u2019s transition rates from part-time to full-time jobs were notably higher compared to women\u2019s in all Member States. The largest gender gaps in part-time to full- time transition rates (at least three times lower for women) were noted in the same group of Member States that also had a high share of women working part-time (Figure 64). Further- more, gender gaps in transition rates were also very wide in the Member States where men\u2019s chances of finding full-time jobs are especially high (e.g. HU, PT, MT) or in a number of other Member States where part-time employment accounts for a significant share of the labour market (e.g. IT, SE). Besides national labour-market characteristics, research findings (Gash, 2008; Kelle, Simonson, & Gordo, 2017) identify parenthood as a major con- straint on the ability of part-time workers to move into full-time jobs, especially in Member States with limited or unaffordable childcare provision (e.g. UK, DE). As noted in Section 9.4, 10 % of women in the EU are either economically inactive or work part-time because they are looking after children or adults with additional needs. This sit- uation affects only 0.6 % of men, underlining how the gendered nature of informal childcare dispro- portionately impacts women\u2019s employment.

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 108 The variability of transition rates between part- time and full-time work across and within Mem- ber States is also influenced by other factors. National policy designs, especially those that support maternal employment, are noted not only for strongly influencing opportunities but also for shaping preferences at individual and society levels (Gash, 2008). Empirical research shows that women who are in a weaker eco- nomic \u2014 and usually also negotiating \u2014 posi- tion within their partnerships are more likely to move to and remain in part-time jobs. However, this pattern is highly sensitive to the wider insti- tutional settings of the country (Dieckhoff, Gash, Mertens, & Gordo, 2016). For instance, the insti- tutional settings of the United Kingdom, as com- pared to those of Denmark and France, consid- ered to be supportive of maternal employment, are empirically proven to be a major constraint on United Kingdom part-time workers with chil- dren moving into full-time jobs (Gash, 2008). Sim- ilarly, research shows that the German home- care allowance, a benefit for parents to stay and take care of children at home, is a deterrent to using formal childcare and to either remaining in or re-entering the labour force (Kelle et al., 2017). Statistical evidence shows there is a consider- able share of people with unfulfilled employ- ment preferences, but often these preferences are highly influenced by the underlying gender norms on how women and men perceive their labour-market engagement given the gen- dered distribution of other duties. For example, despite women\u2019s disproportionate representa- tion in part-time employment in the EU, with ensuing pay consequences, only 23 % of women (compared to 36 % of men) working part-time in 2018 indicated that this was an involuntary choice and that they actually wished to work more (\u2018longer\u2019) hours ( 64 ). This suggests, among other things, that there are continuing incom- patibilities in institutional support for gender equality in labour-market participation. In general, the impact of FWAs, be it part-time or otherwise, is multidimensional. For individu- als, accessing FWAs is often linked to negative career consequences, such as lower salary, job ( 64 ) Eurostat (lfsa_eppgai), reference age group 20-64. levels or promotion possibilities (Laundon & Williams, 2018). FWAs users also tend to have reduced access to \u2014 or awareness of \u2014 the full range of benefits available to them within the workplace, including other types of flexible working arrangements (Leslie et al., 2012). Fur- thermore, reduced time in the office results not only in limited training or participation in rel- evant information sessions, but also in limited access to knowledge on how to make the most optimal FWAs and other benefit decisions (Les- lie et al., 2012). Given the diverse and multidimensional impacts of FWAs, it is important to stress that although they are an important measure for gender equality, they do not automatically lead to it. For example, as noted in EIGE (2018d), both gen- ders apply autonomy in setting their own work- ing time differently: women use it to achieve a better work\u2014life balance while men use it to increase their work commitment. For example, some men are able to opt for longer working hours due to a partner\u2019s greater availability at home (Holth, Bergman, & MacKenzie, 2017). Despite this, the availability of FWAs is increas- ingly recognised as a facilitator of gender equal- ity and of better work\u2014life balance opportuni- ties for both women and men. Flexible working arrangements can increase gender-equal opportunities The Gender Equality Index \u2014 in its entirety and across all its domains \u2014 shows a signif- icant correlation to the availability of flexible working schedules in Member States. Member States that had a higher share of employees with access to considerable (i.e. complete or a certain amount of) flexibility in setting their own working hours displayed higher Gender Equality Index scores (Figure 65, Panels A and B). Across the domains, the strongest linkage between the Gender Equality Index and the availability of FWAs for women is noted in the domain of time (Figure 65, Panel C), followed by the domain of money (Figure 65, Panel E) and the domain of knowledge. This highlights the importance of ",

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus European Institute for Gender Equality 110 with women\u2019s. The second strongest associa- tion between FWAs for men and gender-equal- ity scores is noted in the domain of power (Fig- ure 65, Panel F), followed by the domain of money. These associations, among other things, suggest that higher FWA availability (and consequently take-up) for men considerably boosts women\u2019s time resources. As a result, gender-equal oppor- tunities are increased at home and in the public domain, including in economic, social and politi- cal participation. Overall, the associations between the ability to set one\u2019s own working hours and the various domains of the Gender Equality Index are in line with emerging wider research. This links the availabil- ity of FWAs to a consequent reduction in gender inequalities on earnings (Van der Lippe, Van Bree- schoten, & Van Hek, 2018). Research shows, for example, that organisations which offer work\u2014life balance policies, and particularly those that offer flexibility in time schedules rather than working time reduction, tend to have a smaller gender pay gap (EIGE, 2019c; Van der Lippe et al., 2018). Demonstrated linkages between FWAs and the Gender Equality Index also support findings that point to the availability of flexible working time arrangements having differentiated impacts on women and men in different areas of life. For example, flexitime \u2014 more commonly taken by men \u2014 has positive effects on their job and lei- sure satisfaction as it enables them to be both fully employed and more engaged in household activities (Wheatley, 2017). Figure 65 (Panel F) shows that this type of FWA availability for men accompanies women\u2019s greater opportunities in political, economic and social engagement, lead- ing to increased gender equality in the domain of power. In contrast, FWAs that reduce the number of working hours and that are more prevalent among women are more often connected to negative impacts on women\u2019s job, leisure and life satisfaction (Wheatley, 2017). This is possibly due to resulting constraints, such as less economic independence, increased stress from coping with the remaining workload and overall expec- tations at work while fulfilling household duties (EIGE, 2018d; Wheatley, 2017). 9.7. Lifelong learning A catalyst for gender equality in the making Policy debates on work\u2014life balance tradition- ally do not consider education and training. Yet constant technological advances require work- ers to continuously upskill and keep abreast of new developments during their careers. Lifelong learning is also instrumental in women\u2019s reinte- gration into the labour market following a career break due to care responsibilities. It can be a cat- alyst for greater gender equality provided both women and men can access it despite work and family constraints. However, lack of time or finan- cial resources can significantly hamper access to adult learning and training and inhibit certain groups of women and men more than others. The Europe 2020 strategy set a goal of 15 % of the population participating in at least one educa- tion and training activity measured on a 4-week basis (European Commission, 2010). Three types of learning are recognised: formal, non-formal and informal learning. Formal education and training refers to lifelong-learning activities that take place in organised settings and are cre- dential based. Non-formal education also takes place in organised settings but is not certified. It largely focuses on learning opportunities organ- ised in the workplace, but it can also refer to education and training that take place in organi- sations stimulating adults\u2019 personal interests and development. The third type, informal learning, tends to refer to learning activities in our daily lives that are mostly incidental and unintentional (Coffield, 2000). The EU goal only refers to par- ticipation in formal and non-formal education, as it is expected that (nearly) everyone engages in informal learning on a daily basis. Women focus on education and training, men engage more in work-related training In 2017, the EU-28 average of women and men aged 25-64 years participating in education and training in a 4-week period was 12 % and 10 % respectively, well below the Europe 2020 target (Figure 66).

The EU trend followed similar lines among those in or out of work: 13 % of employed women and 10 % of employed men were engaged in educa- tion and training; among unemployed people, it was 11 % of women and 9 % of men ( 66 ). Regard- less of levels of educational attainment, women also participated more in education and training activities than men across the EU, although over- all participation dropped sharply among people with secondary or lower education. Only 4 % of women and men aged 25-64 years with lower than secondary education participated in life- long-learning activities ( 67 ). Similar patterns were evident in most Member States. More women than men aged 25-64 years participated in lifelong-learning activities in 24 Member States. In the remaining four Member States (DE, EL, RO, SK), the gap in favour of men ( 65 ) EIGE\u2019s calculation, Eurostat, European Union Labour Force Survey (trng_lfs_01). ( 66 ) Eurostat, Education statistics, 2017 (trng_lfs_03). ( 67 ) Eurostat, Education statistics, 2017 (trng_lfse_03). was lower than 1 p.p. However, overall participa- tion levels varied significantly among Member States. Nordic Member States had the highest participation rates in education and training among both women and men and also the high- est gender gaps in favour of women. In Sweden, for example, 38 % of women and 24 % of men aged 25-64 years had participated in education and training in a 4-week period. In contrast, Member States in southern and central Europe tended to have lower participation rates in life- long-learning activities. In Romania only 1 % of women and men participated in adult education and training, while in another five EU Member States (BG, EL, HR, PL, SK) the rates were below 5 % (Figure 66). Women\u2019s over-representation in lifelong learn- ing shrinks or disappears in work-related train- ing. In 2016, average participation rates in non-formal education and training during work- ing time in 27 EU Member States was 64 % and 75 % for women and men aged 25-64 years respectively (Figure 67). The same pattern was Figure 66: Percentage of women and men participating in formal and non-formal education and training (last 4 weeks) (25-64), 2017 (Indicator 14) 1012 0 10 20 30 40 50 SE FI DK FR EE NL AT UK SI MTEU-28 ES IE LV LT LU CZ PT DE BE IT CY HU EL PL SK HR BG RO Considerably higher participation among women Somewhat higher participation among women No gap P e r c e n t a g e Women Men Source: Eurostat, EU LFS (trng_lfs_01).

Gender patterns favouring men also appeared when looking deeper into incentives for employees to partic- ipate in non-formal education and training. In all Member States except Cyprus, men were more likely to receive financial contributions from employers to engage in education and training ( 68 ). Generally, employees in higher posi- tions \u2014 less likely to be achieved by women \u2014 have more opportunities to participate in work-related training, including training on transferable skills that enhance their chances for promotion (Evertsson, 2004). In contrast, invest- ment in women\u2019s training tends to be more job specific and task related (Evertsson, 2004). These differences can have negative implications for the work\u2014life balance of men and women as men grow further in their roles as the main family breadwinner, and women continue in jobs that help them better combine work with family duties.

The Gender Equality Index domains of time and work strongly correlate with women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation in education and training across Member States. Member States that had higher participation rates in adult formal and non-formal education displayed higher scores in the domain of time (Figure 68, Panels A and B) and a strong link to scores for the domain of work (Figure 68, Panels C and D). The corre- lation with the domain of time suggests a link between the better sharing of care responsibili- ties within a family and a higher engagement in lifelong-learning activities by both women and men. The availability and affordability of formal childcare services are similarly important fac- tors, as Member States with a higher provision of formal childcare for children below 3 years of age also had greater participation of women and men in the labour market and in lifelong-learn- ing activities. The correlation with the domain of work is due to a mutually reinforcing connec- tion between participation in adult education and higher gender equality in the labour mar- ket: those who engage in lifelong learning have Figure 67: Percentage of women and men participating in non-formal education and training during working hours (% of all participants in education and training during the last 12 months) (25-64), 2016 Women Men 6475 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 DK HR SE BG HU SK EE UK FI PT NL CZ PL DE EU-27 LV FR CY AT SI MT LU LT RO BE IT ES EL No gap Considerably higher participation among men P e r c e n t a g e Source: EIGE\u2019s calculations, Eurostat, Adult Education Survey (2016), data not available for IE.

This suggests that gen- der equality in the domains of work and time is not only positively associated with higher par- ticipation in adult education for both women and men, it particularly increases women\u2019s par- ticipation. Sweden is a good example of such an effect. Among EU Member States, Sweden has the highest levels of participation in educa- tion and training for both women and men, the highest gender-equality scores in the areas of work and time and the highest gender gap in adult education and training participation in the EU (14 p.p. in favour of women). Women and men face different barriers to education and training Not everyone can or wants to participate in education and training. Apart from weak interest in learning, a range of barriers can put participation out of reach for women and men. These include cost, access to formal and informal education and training activities, poor health and time. The latter is considered to be one of the strongest barriers to lifelong learn- ing, with work-schedule conflicts, care respon- sibilities and household duties being the key time issues. Women experience a higher time deficit because of family-related responsibilities (Figure 69). In contrast, work-schedule conflicts were bigger barriers for men in most Member States (Fig- ure 70). Women across Europe undertake the bulk of care duties after having children, with implications for their employment opportunities, involvement in social, lei- sure and cultural activities (see Chapter 5) and partic- ipation in lifelong learning.

        "Work\u2014life balance: a thematic focus Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 115 Member States except Denmark, more women than men reported family responsibilities as an obstacle, with the highest numbers reported in Cyprus, Malta, Greece, Austria and Spain (> 50 % of women identified this reason). Where the availability of formal childcare services is low and work\u2014life balance policies are unde- veloped, women might choose jobs that do not require continuous skills investment through education and training, and therefore allow more of their time for care duties (Sidle, 2011). Once a child enters the family, traditional gen- der roles tend to become more entrenched. Men strengthen their role as breadwinner as the partner active on the labour market (Becker, 1985; Dieckhoff & Steiber, 2010). This can poten- tially lead to difficulties in combining work and family responsibilities with adult education and training activities. Although the pattern is not universal, in the vast majority of Member States men tended to report their work schedule more as a barrier to participation than women did. On average, 43 % of men and 38 % of women in the EU who faced obstacles to participating in lifelong learning activities could not participate in lifelong learning due to work responsibilities (Figure 70). The policy goals of better work\u2014life balance and higher participation in lifelong learning are high on the EU agenda, but potential synergies and conflicts between them are rarely discussed. In a rapidly changing knowledge economy, con- tinuous learning throughout life is essential for both women and men, but finding the time to maintain and increase skills and knowledge is challenging. As women and men tend to face different time-related barriers to lifelong learn- ing, better work\u2014life policies would not only allow a more satisfactory combination of job and family responsibilities, they would also free up time for continuous investment and growth in people\u2019s skills and knowledge.

        "Conclusions Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 117 10. Conclusions Domain of work The domain of work, with a score of 72.0, keeps the third-highest position in the Gender Equal- ity Index. This score spotlights the incremental progress of 2 points made since 2005, pointing to the major challenges that remain. In particu- lar, the segregation and quality of work sub-do- main, with a score as low as 64.0, points to stag- nation and low level of effectiveness of measures undertaken to reduce gender segregation and other gender inequalities in employment. Wom- en not only remain over-represented in educa- tion, human health and social work, but their employment in these sectors increased by a fur- ther 2 p.p. between 2005 and-2017 to over 30 %. Women still dominate part-time employment, consigning them to jobs with poorer career progression . No steady narrowing of the gender gap in FTE employment (which is at 16 p.p.) has been noted nationally in recent years, whereas it even widened (by at least 1 p.p.) in, for example, Denmark, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Slovenia. This means that the goal of the Eur ope 2020 strategy to reach a 75 % employ- ment rate for women and men alike remains elusive, due strictly to women\u2019s particularly vul- nerable access to jobs. While women\u2019s employ- ment rate in 2018 was just above 67 %, the 79 % rate for men had already surpassed the EU goal. In all EU Member States, men dominate specific fields such as engineering and technology, but are under-represented in others, such as teach- ing and care work. Women\u2019s disproportionate responsibility for care of dependent family mem- bers and household tasks is a major factor of gender segregation in employment. The situa- tion requires much wider and more explicit rec- ognition of gender inequalities as a major barri- er to achieving the EU employment target in the future and setting up gender-sensitive targets in the assessment of policy effectiveness. Motherhood, lower upskilling and reskilling opportunities and a migration background remain particular barriers to accessing and progressing in jobs for women, especially among those with a low level of education. Being a parent continues to hinder women, but not men, in the labour market. The largest gen- der gap in the FTE employment rates is noted in couples with children. The gap is 60 % for wom- en, whereas it reaches as high as 88 % for men. Though the work\u2014life balance directive makes a bold and necessary step in recognising the need to, as well as instigating conditions to, bet- ter support women\u2019s access to paid work, more needs to be done. For example, boosting equal opportunities to participate in and benefit from continuous training and retraining and more gender-balanced opportunities of using trans- port and other public infrastructure are need- ed, not the least to create more gender-equal access to employment. A better gender balance as regards access to paid work and working in- tensity could be achieved via a better access to and take-up of FWAs, especially if taken up by men. This underlines the role of men in freeing up women\u2019s time resources and thus their wider opportunities outside the home sphere, boost- ing gender equality in employment as well as social and economic well-being for all. Domain of money Recent years have seen wage and household disposable income increases in a large majority of Member States, but gender equality in finan- cial and economic resources remains elusive, in line with steady gender gaps in accessing paid employment. The domain of money, with a score of 80.4 in 2017, has for the first time surpassed 80 points, ranking second only to the domain of health in the Gender Equality Index. This promising development nonetheless relates to patchy progress on gender-equal access to fi- nancial and economic resources . In 2005 the sub-domain of economic resources (which ac- counts for women\u2019s and men\u2019s exposure to pov- erty and income inequality among women and men) scored 89.7 points: it was 2 points lower in 2017. ",
        "Conclusions European Institute for Gender Equality 118 Persistent gender inequalities in pay still re- flect the price paid for motherhood , and are closely linked to the gendered distribution of care responsibilities within families. This points to further efforts being needed to generally in- crease society\u2019s awareness of the existence and roots of gender inequalities in pay and of the ways to minimise and even counteract their po- tential occurrence. For this, the consistent and simultaneous application of organisational and pol icy-level measures, including those listed in the EU action plan 2017-2019 \u2014 tackling the gender pay gap, is of utmost importance. In addition, the complexity of the gender gaps in pay requires moving away from partial or simplistic descriptions of the phenomenon, which often offer too narrow or incomplete comprehension and thus insufficient capacity to address it (EIGE, 2019c). For example, in ad- dition to the reduction of the gender pay gap, which displays gender gaps in hourly pay, more attention should be paid to narrowing gender gaps in annual earnings, which account for differences in employment intensity and over- all labour-market participation. Furthermore, more regular monitoring of gender gaps in pay and the income situation among people from more vulnerable backgrounds, such as migrant, Roma or older women, is needed and would provide a better basis for improved policy re- sponses. Analysis in the domain of money also stresses the need for long-term policy evaluations. For example, lifetime pay inequalities fall on older women , pointing to the need for gender-sensi- tive and forward-looking evaluation not only of national employment policies, but also of so- cial-protection systems. The gender gap in pen- sions in the EU stands at 39 %, and the gender gap in poverty to the disadvantage of women is at its highest among those aged 75 and over. This shows the limited effectiveness of current public-policy settings in reducing gendered bar- riers to equal economic and financial resources throughout people\u2019s lives. It also asks for more comprehensive evaluation and consistency of various policy settings and their reforms in order to ensure the equal economic indepen- dence of women and men. Domain of knowledge The domain of knowledge remained virtually static between 2015 and 2017, and the over- all progress in gender equality in the area of knowledge has been slow over the last 12 years. Educational attainment is rising, es- pecially among women, but more significant progress is being impeded by persistent gen- der segregation in higher education and low levels of participation in lifelong learning. Young women (aged 30-34) have already reached the Europe 2020 target (46 % have graduated from tertiary education), but the share of men tertiary graduates has yet to reach it. Moreover, the gender gap in educa- tional attainment among the younger gen- eration has been widening to the detriment of men, and reached 10 p.p. in 2016. Further challenges are faced by women and men with disabilities and by people from deprived so- cioeconomic backgrounds, highlighting the importance of access to high-quality inclusive education, as aimed for in the European Pillar of Social Rights. Although more women and men graduate from universities than in the past, gender segregation in education remains a major barrier to gender equality in the EU . In 2017, 43 % of all women at university were study- ing education, health and welfare, humanities and arts, with the gender gap in the EU as a whole at 22 p.p., remaining unchanged since 2005. Such a divide is mirrored by gender seg- regation in the labour market, determining women\u2019s and men\u2019s earnings, career pros- pects and working conditions. The majority of Member States lag far be- hind the European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) benchmark of 15 % of adults engaged in lifelong learning, with the EU-28 average stagnating at 11 % (12 % for women and 10 % for men in 2017). Adult learning stalls most when reskilling needs are greatest. Participation in lifelong learn- ing is particularly low among the population groups who could most benefit from it \u2014 old- er or low-skilled adults working in precarious ",
        "Conclusions Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 119 or fragmented work situations. A highly skilled and mobile working population is crucial for Europe\u2019s prosperity, therefore participation in lifelong learning will continue to be high on the EU policy agenda. Participation in educa- tion and training played an important role in the Europe 2020 flagship initiative, \u2018An agen- da for new skills and jobs\u2019, and was also at the centre Member State-specific recommenda- tions in 2018 and 2019. Moreover, the Com- mission, in its communication on strengthen- ing European identity through education and culture, proposed to establish an ambitious new benchmark for participation in lifelong learning \u2014 25 % by 2025. Although continuous learning throughout life is essential, finding time to maintain and increase skills and knowledge is challeng- ing. Edu cation and training is increasingly be- coming a cornerstone of work\u2014life balance . Member States with higher participation rates in adult formal and non-formal education dis- played more gender-balanced time share for caring and higher-gender equality achieve- ments in the domain of work. Domain of time The enduring burden of care perpetuates inequalities for women. Gender inequalities in time use are persistent and growing: the 2017 score of 65.7 is not only 1 p.p. lower than that of 2005, it also represents a 3.2 p.p. drop from the gains that had been achieved up until 2012. This domain has the third-lowest score in the Gender Equality Index. Developments in this domain cannot be monitored post the 2017 Index because EU data has not yet been updated. The next data update for this domain is expected in 2021. More frequent time-use data would help more immediate tracking of progress in this domain. The most recent available data shows that there is an uneven impact of family life on women and men . Women are engaged dis- proportionally more in unpaid care work, but even more strikingly in other domestic tasks. Only 34 % of men are engaged in cooking and housework every day for 1 hour or more in comparison with 79 % of women, with the situ- ation barely changing in more than a decade. Gender inequalities in unpaid domestic work are highest between women and men who live in a couple and have children. Women and men with disabilities need care, but they are also car- ers. The Gender Equality Index shows 29 % of women and 20 % of men with disabilities in the EU doing care work every day. A bigger share of women with disabilities (79%) are cooking and/or doing other housework compared to men with disabilities (41%). Women and men in pre-retirement age also often step in to provide care to their grandchildren, allowing parents to work while their own employment suffers. Time use by women and men is heavily influenced by other social and cultural factors, but also by available work\u2014life balance policies, public ser- vices and infrastructures. A framework for tackling work\u2014life balance and the \u2018care penalty\u2019 is established by both the Euro- pean Pillar of Social Rights and the EU action plan on tackling the gender pay gap. More specific ac- tion is being taken through the direct ive on work\u2014 life balance for parents and carers, adopted by the Council of the European Union in June 2019. The lack of formal care services impacts women as informal carers disproportionate- ly when compared to men , both during their working age and beyond it. Gender inequal- ities in time spent on informal caring are be- ing debated in EU policy circles as a challenge of work\u2014life balance. It is recognised that the disproportionate amount of time spent on un- paid care work and housework impacts wom- en\u2019s participation in employment and opportu- nities for social, personal and civic activities. It re inforces gender segregation in education and in the labour market. It also affects women\u2019s employment patterns and career prospects by exacerbating their involvement in precarious employment and by reinforcing the gender gap in pay and pensions. The thematic focus of the 2019 Index on work\u2014 life balance confirms that gender equality in general, but particularly in the domain of time, ",
        "Conclusions European Institute for Gender Equality 120 is strongly interlinked with many aspects of work\u2014life balance. Work\u2014life balance policies such as childcare and LTC services and FWAs therefore enhance gen- der equality. The Gender Equality Index scores are higher in the Member States where formal childcare and LTC arrangements are more wide- ly available. More concluding remarks on formal and informal care are presented in the subse- quent chapter on work\u2014life balance. Domain of power While the domain of power has the lowest score in the Gender Equality Index (51.9), it also shows the most improvement (an increase of 3.4 points since 2015 and 13 points since 2005). Much of the success in the Member States demonstrat- ing notable improvements in gender balance in political decision-making since 2005 can be at- tributed to the implementation of either a gen- der quota law or voluntary party quotas. Continued lack of gender parity is a funda- mental concern for democracy . In 2018 the proportion of women in national parliaments (single/lower house) across the EU Member States reached an all-time high of 30 % but that still means that seven in ten members of par- liaments are men. Fewer than one in five major political parties in the EU (18 %) has a woman leader, though there is better representation among deputy leaders (34 % women). In nation- al governments, women account for just three in ten (31 %) senior ministers (members of the cabinet or equivalent) and are twice as likely to be given less conspicuous sociocultural portfo- lios (i.e. health, education and social affairs) as men. The share of women on the boards of large companies across the EU more than doubled between 2010 and 2018 (from 12 % to 26 %), when the European Commission brought the issue to the fore, but progress has been con- centrated in just a few Member States where governments have either taken or considered legislative action and/or had an intensive public debate on the issue. Elsewhere there has been little improvement, and now that the main driv- ers of progress have reached or are close to their national targets, progress at EU level has slowed down. The increased level of female representation in boardrooms is not feeding through to the executive hierarchy. In 2018 women account- ed for just 17 % of senior executives compared to 29 % of non-executives. Less than a quarter (24 %) of the largest companies in the EU Mem- ber States have at least 40 % of each gender among non-executives, and more than one in five (21 %) have no women non-executives at all. Although the number of women on corpo- rate boards has more than doubled since 2010, the top positions are still largely occupied by men \u2014 women account for just 7 % of board chairs and 7 % of CEOs. Data on decision-making in research-funding organisations indicates that women\u2019s oppor- tunities to influence the research agenda and ensure equal access to funding for both women and men are limited. Men dominate the highest decision-making positions in the main research-funding organisations across the EU. In this respect, the gender-balance tar- gets for advisory groups (50 %) and evaluation panels (40 %) of the Horizon 2020 framework programme for research and innovation are highly relevant. The proportion of women involved in top-level decision-making in media organisations is also low , although women\u2019s employment in the media sector has been gradually increasing over the course of two decades. Women occupy 36 % of top decision-making positions in public broadcasting organisations across the EU. The Council acknowledged that media has an enor- mous capacity to contribute positively to the achievement of gender equality at all levels, and has confirmed its commitment to advancing women\u2019s roles in decision-making in the media (Council of the European Union, 2013). Although women\u2019s participation in sports is in- creasing, women are frequently absent from sports decision-making bodies . On average in the EU-28 women make up 16 % of deci- ",
        "Conclusions Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 121 sion-making positions in the most popular sports federations in Europe (2 p.p. higher than in 2015). Several international and continental federations in Europe, responsible for the pro- motion and development of sports, have al- ready shown a commitment to gender equality by introducing gender quotas. At the national level, initiatives to set up voluntary targets for gender balance in the governing structures of sports federations are concentrated in just a few Member States, which also have a high- er level of women\u2019s representation in top deci- sion-making positions. Domain of health Gender norms and stereotypes undermine behavioural change, to the detriment of men\u2019s health. Despite being the highest scor- ing domain since the inception of the Gender Equality Index, the health domain score has stalled since 2015 (+ 0.7 points), and has bare- ly progressed since 2005 (+ 2.2 points). Gen- der inequalities are most prominent in the sub-domain of health behaviour, with a score of 75.4 points. Largely due to dominant masculin- ity norms, men are more likely than women to be involved in risk behaviours such as smoking and excessive drinking, thereby increasing their risk of early death and morbidity in general. Women live longer than men but spend more of their life in poorer health. In most EU Member States, the number of years that women and men can expect to live in good health has increased by 2.8 for women and 3.6 for men since 2005, and an extra 9 months for both women and men since 2015. Despite im- proving health conditions and increasing life expectancy, clear gendered challenges remain regarding inequalities in health in the EU. While early and preventable deaths are one of the main concerns for men, women live longer but spend a greater share of their life in ill health. In 2016, women spent 20 years of their life in poor health in the EU compared to 16 years for men. Accordingly, a gender-specific approach to the health-related challenges faced by women and men could effectively contribute to reducing gender gaps, especially in light of ageing popu- lations, a diminishing workforce and increasing pressure on welfare systems. Disadvantaged groups of women and men in the EU still face greater unmet needs for healthcare services. The high scores in the sub-domain of access to healthcare in all Mem- ber States reflect continuous efforts to achieve access to adequate healthcare services in the EU. However, certain groups of women and men experience more difficulty in accessing the health support they need. In the EU, lone mothers (6 %) and fathers (8 %), as well as wom- en (8 %) and men (7 %) with disabilities, are more likely to have unmet needs. Also, despite higher mortality rates for infections and diseases relat- ed to poor living conditions, migrants and refu- gees experience unequal access to preventive healthcare in a large majority of Member States. The Roma population also face major obstacles in meeting their needs in terms of health, es- pecially with access to sexual and reproductive health services for Roma women. Domain of violence The limited availability of high-quality EU- wide comparative data , broken down by gen- der and the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, makes it extremely difficult to measure the prevalence of violence against women in the EU. Only three indicators of the second tier of the measurement framework for the domain of violence for which recent data was available could be updated, although not for all Member States: femicide, FGM and traf- ficking in human beings. As a result, scores for each Member State could not be presented. The completion of the next EU-wide survey on vio- lence against women is essential for the EU and its Member States to make progress in their ef- forts to prevent and eliminate violence against women. In this context, administrative data collected through the reporting and recording proced- ures of institutions such as the police, pros- ecutors\u2019 offices or the courts, is a key source of information that can help understand the scale of violence against women in the EU (EIGE, ",
        "Conclusions European Institute for Gender Equality 122 2019b). Drawing from the victims\u2019 rights directive and the Istanbul Convention\u2019s minimum require- ments for data provision, EIGE has developed a set of 13 indicators, seven of which are part of the measurement framework of the domain of violence, to be populated by the police and justice sectors to help Member States in collect- ing comprehensive and uniform data on rape, femicide and intimate partner violence. Further efforts need to be invested in measuring other severe forms of violence, such as psychological violence and forced marriage. In light of the current backlash against gender equality and women\u2019s rights in the EU, the rati- fication and full implementation of the Istanbul Convention by the EU and all of its Member States are needed more than ever to facilitate the development and monitoring of effective strategies and policies to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women. Work\u2014life balance and gender equality The analysis carried out within the framework of the thematic focus of the Gender Equality Index 2019 shows strong links between gen- der equality and work\u2014life balance, as mea- sured by the work\u2014life balance scoreboard that EIGE has developed and proposed (see Section 9.1). The availability of care services, benefits and services to families, job protection provided by leave policies, public infrastructure and the overall child-friendliness of the society create or limit opportunities and establish con- ditions in which women and men take their deci- sions regarding both work and family. For more effective policies on work\u2014life bal- ance, the discourse of work\u2014life balance needs to be broadened. First, we call for a broad- er conceptualisation of work\u2014life balance , which means welcoming more areas, such as lifelong learning or public infrastructure, into discussions and policies. Second, the focus of the work\u2014life balance discussion has to shift from separated fields of life and take a more holistic approach to life. Work\u2014life balance is not just blocks of time allocated to work and other activities; it is deter- mined by the \u2018whole day\u2019s schedule of multiple activities and trips taken by an individual\u2019 (Dong, Ben-Akiva, Bowman, & Walker, 2006). Gender inequalities are not isolated within each field of life, instead they feed into each other, leading to multiple inequalities and amplified barriers to balancing work and life. Third, work\u2014life balance is not only a chal- lenge for employed people or parents. Inac- tivity or low birth rates are often signs of fail- ing reconciliation, where people are forced to give up or make major compromises in one of the major fields of life. For instance, a full-time carer of a child or adult with significant disabil- ities is unlikely to be able to take up paid work, or someone may decide not to have or to post- pone having children as they anticipate being ineligible for leave policies. Fourth, balancing work and life is not an indi- vidual task, but an everyday negotiation be- tween members of the family. This is where the roots of gender inequalities lie. While women have quite successfully stepped into the world of paid work, men have not taken a sim- ilar step into the world of the home to equal- ly share the responsibilities and pleasures of family life. Even with all the work\u2014life policies in place, the family-related responsibilities never disappear \u2014 it is always the family that holds the first responsibility for the well-being of its members. As long as women, but not men, are expected to carry the double burden of work and family, gender inequalities will persist. Work\u2014life balance policies should be better coordinated and reflect changes in the la- bour market and society as a whole. For ex- ample, there should not be a care gap between the end of parental-leave provision and publicly subsidised high-quality formal childcare. The importance of intersectional approach was once again confirmed. Certain groups of people are disadvantaged, no matter which as- pect of work\u2014life balance we look at. One ex- ample is low-qualified people \u2014 especially wom- en \u2014 who are more likely to be out of paid work, ",
        "Conclusions Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 123 are more likely to be ineligible for leave policies, have less flexibility in the labour market, are more often dependent on public transport and attend less lifelong learning. This situation is also very similar for women of pre-retirement age. Leave policies The thematic focus of the 2019 Gender Equal ity Index on work\u2014life balance provides a unique insight into the gender inequalities that are caused and reproduced by parental-leave policy rules. While the parental leave directive (Direc- tive 2010/18/EU) does set the minimum for the overall duration of the leave for working women and men, the conditions of access are defined by the Member States. About one in ten employed women and men are not entitled to parental leave because the Member States have established restrictive eli- gibility rules. Without job protection they would lose their jobs if they wanted or needed to have time off from their paid work to care for their children beyond maternity and paternity leave. Since it is still generally women who take care of children, such restrictions have major conse- quences for gender equality. Indeed, the scores in the domains of work and of time are higher in the Member States where the eligibility rate for par ental leave is higher and the coverage of leave policies is more universal. The majority of Member States have set eligi- bility conditions which are connected to work- ing arrangements. The parental leave directive gives Member States the right to make entitle- ment to parental leave subject \u2018to a period of work qualification and/or a length of service qualification which shall not exceed one year\u2019. This illustrates well how certain FWAs like short- term contracts or other new forms of work can be seen as a double-edged sword. While pro- viding flexibility and therefore better support for work\u2014life balance, non-standard work also puts people in a precarious situations by ex- cluding them from social policies. Non-standard and new forms of work are a fast-growing trend in the labour market, which makes it urgent to revisit social-protection mechanisms which are still designed for old and standard forms of work. Currently, policies may reinforce labour market or other inequalities by excluding those most at risk. For instance, in six Member States more than 25 % of young (20-24 year old) employed women and men were ineligible for parental leave. Peo- ple in in lower-skilled and manual jobs are more likely to be ineligible than those in higher-skilled occupations. Same-sex couples are not eligible for parental leave in 11 Member States. There are also other terrains to be explored. Namely, the parental leave directive gives the employer the right \u2018to postpone the granting of parental leave for justifiable reasons related to the operation of the organisation\u2019. There is no evidence as to what extent employers ex- ercise their right to deny mothers and fathers their rights over business interests and whether there are any gendered consequences. Studies have shown that employers\u2019 attitudes are often an obstacle for men to take up parental leave (e.g. Wall & Leit\u00e3o, 2017). The analysis of eligibility for parental leave could complement an in-depth analysis of Member State-specific challenges identified by the social scoreboard and strengthen the analytical ba- sis of the Commission\u2019s proposals for Member States-specific European semester recommen- dations. Childcare services In addition to gaps in leave entitlements, suf- ficient care provisions are not always in place. There are five Member States (HR, IT, LT, RO, SK) where there is no obligation for authorities to provide a care or nursery place for a child should a parent so wish. Moreover, only in 12 Member States is the entitlement to public childcare in place immediately after the parental-leave en- titlements end. Although care services may be provided in spite of there being no legal obli- gation, such a gap between parental-leave and care-service entitlements can extend to as long as 3 years, creating an obstacle to a smooth transition between work and parental leave. ",
        "Conclusions European Institute for Gender Equality 124 Overall, 14 % of households in the EU 2016 re- ported unmet needs for childcare services, and it is still women who are more likely than men to step in to fill in the gap, either at the expense of their jobs or taking on a double shift. In a con- text where women continue to bear a heavier burden of informal care, having no childcare granted after parental-leave entitlements are exhausted has clear repercussions on female employment rates, and more widely on gender equality. In the EU, 10 % of women work part- time or are inactive due to care duties, while this applies to only 1 % of men. In households with the youngest child under 7 years of age, women spend on average 32 hours a week on paid work and 39 hours on unpaid work, com- pared to 41 hours and 19 hours for men re- spectively. The European Pillar of Social Rights declares access to affordable and good-quality childcare services one of its core principles. Now that good progress has been made in reaching the Barcelona targets, the time may have come to consider a review of the Barcelona targets by looking more broadly into the qualitative as- pects of services and exploring their links with employment targets, work\u2014life balance and other economic indicators. Long-term care In the context of an ageing population and increasing disability rates, the care needs for older people and people with disabilities are dramatically gaining attention. In addition to households having unmet needs for childcare, one in three households in the EU report hav- ing unmet needs for professional home-care services for older persons and/or persons with disabilities. In the majority of Member States, women bear such care responsibilities, putting additional pressure on their work\u2014life balance and employment opportunities. In the EU-28, 15 % of women and 10 % of men provide in- formal LTC to older people and/or people with disabilities. In Member States with a more gender-unequal division of care responsibili- ties, the Gender Equality Index score is lower. Given this situation, an important further step would be to establish EU-level targets on LTC services, similar to the Barcelona targets on childcare. The European Pillar of Social Rights declares access to affordable and good-quality LTC ser- vices to be one of its core principles. Improv- ing the availability, affordability and quality of LTC services is also one of the priority areas for action in the Commission\u2019s \u2018New start\u2019 initiative on work\u2014life balance. In addition, the European disability strategy 2010-2020 promotes the tran- sition from institutional to community-based care. The 2019 directive on work\u2014life balance for parents and carers introduced a new annual right for workers to take at least 5 working days of carers\u2019 leave in the event of serious illness or dependency of a relative or a person who lives in the same household as the worker. This provi- sion aims to improve carers\u2019 work\u2014life- balance and, at the same time, avoid their dropping out of the labour market entirely. Public infrastructure In every person\u2019s life there is commuting, whether between work, home, schools, health, care and other public services, grocery shops, banks, leisure and volunteering activities, etc. Physical environment, geography and social organisation of public infrastructure, togeth- er with logistics and commuting options, play a major role in how well work can be combined with rest of one\u2019s life. The scarce statistics that are available on com- muting and transport show that on average women spend as much as 40 minutes and men 45 minutes of their day on commuting to and from the workplace. Women more often than men are users of public transport as they have more limited access to private cars \u2014 a sign of gender inequalities in other fields of life. Being carers of small children but also of persons with physical limitations, the physical accessibility of public transport as well as the quality and main- tenance of roads may determine the real mobil- ity of these people. Suitable, fast, safe and con- venient means of transport not only allow for a better work\u2014life balance but also support job ",
        "Conclusions Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 125 searching and taking up better positions in the labour market. In Member States where the level of women\u2019s mobility is higher, women and men are more equality involved in caring and household ac- tivities. Also, the scores of the domain of work are higher in those countries where women\u2019s commuting times are longer, indicating that in countries where women are freer to move they have better work opportunities. Time pressure among working women is often caused by an incompatibility between the location and open- ing hours of childcare facilities and employment times (McLean, Naumann, & Koslowski, 2016; Steiber, 2009). Urban planning in general, but also the planning of public transport and the maintenance of roads, are highly significant from a gender perspective, supporting or complicating the everyday logis- tics and balancing of work and life. The Europe- an Economic and Social Committee states in its opinion that gender consideration is currently absent from EU transport policy. The transport sector is traditionally male dominated, and as a result transport policy is male oriented and also centered around men\u2019s lifestyles (Europe- an Economic and Social Committee, 2015). The mainstreaming of gender into policies impacting transport and public infrastructure is needed. Better data is also needed in order to carry out analysis from a gender perspective on how pub- lic infrastructures restrict or support work\u2014life balance and gender equality. Flexible working arrangements Possibilities to adjust one\u2019s working arrange- ments \u2014 either occasionally or on a permanent basis \u2014 according to family or personal needs is of paramount importance to a successful work\u2014 life balance. In the EU 57 % of women and 54 % of men have their working-time arrangements set by the company or organisation and still have no possibilities of any self-induced flexibili- ty in changing them. Men have greater availabil- ity of flexible working-time arrangements than women, not least due to their higher uptake of jobs in the private sector, which by now offers greater flexibility of working arrangements in comparison to the public sector. People in occupations requiring a lower level of qualifications are particularly disadvantaged as regards flexibility in working-time arrange- ments. As mentioned earlier, they also are less likely to benefit from parental leave. This par- tially explains why women with a lower level of qualifications are very likely to be out of paid work and not searching for a job because of care responsibilities (EIGE, 2017d). This is also an illustration of the far-reaching employment and income effects of failing to reach reconcilia- tion of work and personal-life demands. While part-time arrangements, one of the types of FWA, may be a desirable solution if they are voluntary and temporary, this should not be the only way to a better work\u2014life balance. It should also not mean that part-time jobs be- come \u2018traps\u2019 for women, harming their econom- ic independence, career prospects, and future pension entitlements. Public policies, particular- ly those ensuring sufficient and affordable care provisions, need to be in place in order to sup- port (re-)entry to full-time paid work for women. This would support labour-market adjustments as regards of the availability and flexibility of full-time jobs. Lifelong learning Participation in education and training is an- other time-intensive activity competing for time, adding complexity to the daily exercise of logis- tics. Europe\u2019s desire to increase the proportion of adults participating in education and training initiatives should be looked at, together with the aim of striving towards a better work\u2014life bal- ance. Family-related duties prevent women from par- ticipating in lifelong learning and training, and this effect is strongest among women with small children. On average in the EU 40 % of women and 24 % of men cannot participate in lifelong learning due to family responsibilities. In nearly all Member States, men report conflicts of work schedule more often than women do as an ob- ",
        "Conclusions European Institute for Gender Equality 126 stacle to participating in lifelong learning and training. This is why work\u2014life balance, partic- ipation in lifelong learning and gender equality are strongly interconnected. The \u2018New start\u2019 ini- tiative on work\u2014life balance provides a prom- ising basis for closer integration of policies on work\u2014life balance and policies on education, training and lifelong learning. Taking an intersectional perspective here puts the same groups of women and men in the limelight once again: older women and men and those with a lower level of qualifications have lower rates of participation in lifelong learning. When taking a holistic approach where all as- pects of work\u2014life balance are looked at to- gether, it becomes clear that inequalities ampli- fy each other, and that there are certain groups of women and men whose life arrangements are such that they are disadvantaged more than others in several dimensions of work\u2014life balance.

        "Annexes European Institute for Gender Equality 164 Annex 4. Methodology of the convergence analysis Several concepts and types of convergence ex- ist, as well as different ways to measure it. The convergence analysis of the Gender Equality Index builds on the methodology proposed by Eurofound (2018c) and focuses on two tradition- al indicators (Barro & Sala-i-Martin, 1992). \u0083 Beta convergence refers to a process in which Member States with relatively low in- itial values of a given indicator grow faster than countries that start with higher values, playing catch-up as a result. \u0083 Sigma convergence of a given indicator re- lates to a reduction of its overall variability across Member States over time leading to greater homogeneity among EU Member States. While closely related, both concepts are needed equally to capture the quality of convergence, as the faster growth of those with initial low levels of an indicator is insufficient by itself to guarantee a decline in dispersion levels across countries (Franks, Barkbu, Blavy, Oman, & Schoelermann, 2018). The analysis conducted examines the trend of the Gender Equality Index at EU level. It shows that the mean improvement in the Gender Equality Index in this period, rising from 62.0 to 67.4 points, was accompanied by an overall de- clining trend in dispersion. On average, differ- ences between Member States decreased from 15.2 % in 2005 to 13.6 % in 2017. That reduction in dispersion across the EU can also be studied with other measures of variability such as the standard deviation, which fell from 9.4 in 2005 to 9.2 in 2017, or the ratio of the Member State with the highest score to the Member State with the lowest score, which decreased from 1.7 to 1.6. The analysis carried out also explores conver- gence and divergence patterns of each Member State towards the EU average. The longer-term view of the Index from 2005 to 2017 at EU level is given by plotting the average performance with cross-country variability demonstrating sigma convergence. Variability is calculated through a commonly used dispersion measurement, the coefficient of variation, which is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. Lower values of the coefficient mean lower de- grees of variability. Following Eurofound (2017b) the combined analysis of average and variabili- ty makes it possible to determine the following patterns of convergence. \u0083 Upward convergence: mean improvement in performance and reduction of disparities among Member States. \u0083 Upward divergence: mean improvement in performance together with an increase in disparities among Member States. \u0083 Downward convergence: mean worsening in performance and reduction of disparities among Member States. \u0083 Downward divergence: mean worsening in performance together with an increase in disparities among Member States. Beta convergence, which allows the initial lev- els of the Gender Equality Index in 2005 and subsequent growth until 2017 to be studied, is assessed through a cross-country linear re- gression. The statistically significant and neg- ative \u03b2 coefficient obtained in this regression (\u03b2 = \u2013 0.1655, significant at 95 % level) is con- sistent with the hypothesis of convergence (Yin, Zestos, & Michelis, 2003). It suggests that the worst-performing Member States caught up with the best performers over the period. Mem- ber States with higher initial levels of gender equality in 2005, such as Sweden, Denmark or Finland (indicated by their position on the x-ax- is of Figure 6), showed slower growth in subse- quent years (indicated by their position on the y-axis). In comparison, Member States with low- er initial Index scores, such as Cyprus, Greece or Italy, showed faster growth rates on gender equality. The estimated value of the \u03b2 coefficient also indicates the speed of the convergence pro- cess and, therefore, the rate at which Member States are approaching each other (Monfort, ",
        "Annexes Gender Equality Index 2019 \u2014 Work\u2014life balance 165 2008). Thus, convergence on the Gender Equal- ity Index scores of the EU-28 occurred at a rate of 16.5 % each year between 2005 and 2017. Although the results of the beta and sigma con- vergence analysis suggest a gradual narrowing of gaps on gender equality in the EU between 2005 and 2017, they do not shed light on the different developments at Member State level. For instance, despite the average increase in the Gender Equality Index during this period, not all Member States registered an improvement. This is known as an upward convergence in the weak sense (Eurofound, 2017b). The systematic mapping of the patterns (comparing a Member State trend over a time period with the EU aver- age) was therefore carried out by considering all possible combinations of the following aspects. \u0083 EU average performance (improving or wors- ening). \u0083 Member State performance (improving or worsening). \u0083 Relative Member State performance in rela- tion to the EU average (better or worse). \u0083 Relative Member State speed in relation to the EU average (faster or slower). Five convergence or divergence patterns be- tween a Member State and the EU mean emerged when analysing gender equality be- tween 2005 and 2017 ( 69 ). ( 69 ) This classification has been done with the Stata code developed by Eurofound following the methodology presented in Euro- found (2018c). \u0083 Catching-up: Index scores lower than the EU average, but faster improvement than the EU mean, narrowing the gap between the Mem- ber State and the EU over time. \u0083 Flattening: Index scores higher than the EU average, but improvement was slower than the EU average. Over time, the gap between these Member States and the EU has re- duced. \u0083 Outperforming: Member States started with higher scores than the EU average and grew at a faster rate in the ensuing years, increas- ing the gap between them and the EU. \u0083 Slower pace: Member States improved their Gender Equality Index scores. However, with initially significantly lower scores than the EU average, their slower rate of progress during the period ensured growing disparities be- tween them and the EU over time. \u0083 Diving: Gender Equality Index scores lower than the EU and declining as the EU average increased, widening the gap as a result. The first two patterns correspond to upward convergence trends, while the latter three describe trends of upward divergence. The graphical analysis of these Member State dy- namics in comparison to the EU mean over the period considered are presented in Fig- ure 7 and Figure 8 of this report (see Sec- tion 1.4). ",
        "Annexes European Institute for Gender Equality 166 Annex 5. Methodology of parental-leave eligibility estimations Our methodological approach was to calculate eligibility for parental leave for a random sam- ple of men and women within each EU Member State using high-quality survey data \u2014 the EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS) and the EU statis- tics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). The first stage of the analysis involved the selec- tion and description of the target parental-leave policy for each Member State. It was followed by the second stage, whereby policy rules with re- gard to eligibility were applied to nationally repre- sentative data sets for all 28 Member States using microsimulation. Parental-leave policy specifica- tions were derived from the international network on leave policies and research annual review and additional expert consultations. The contextual- isation, leave definitions, entitlements and con- straints were collated for a selected time point of 2016 (June) to align with the most recent EU-SILC and EU LFS survey data sets. Information was cross-checked with the Mutual Information Sys- tem on Social Protection and national legislation. The principle for identifying the target paren- tal-leave policy in each Member State was that it was gender neutral and equally available to men and women, as distinct from maternity leave or paternity leave. For the analysis, only the legis- lated statutory parental leave deriving from the parental-leave directive (Directive 2010/18/EU) was selected. The list of policies selected for analysis can be found in Table 26. For microsimulations we created a sample of (potential) mothers and fathers in each Mem- ber State. \u2018Potential parents\u2019 were defined as individuals aged 20-49: the peak parenthood and employment period. Such a category ex- tends the analysis beyond those employed in- dividuals who have had a child in the previous year to a larger group in their prime economic activity phase and who may wish to have or already have children. Eligibility rules were col- lected and simulated for the following. 1. Employment/labour-market conditions: a. activity status (self-employed, unem- ployed and inactive), b. duration of contract (time spent with cur- rent employer), c. pay threshold conditions prior to leave. 2. Family/household conditions: a. same-sex couples, b. lone parents, c. adoptive parents. The feasibility of incorporating the dimension of citizenship (such as the treatment of nation- als born in the country or other EU countries, non-EU (\u2018third-country\u2019) nationals and mi- grants) was explored but not included in the final simulation due to an uneven level of in- formation of the policy conditions at Member State level.
