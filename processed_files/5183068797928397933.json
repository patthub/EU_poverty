        "With 54.5 out of 100 points, Romania ranks 25th in the EU on the Gender Equality Index. Its score is 12.9 points lower than the EU\u2019s score. Between 2005 and 2017, Romania\u2019s score increased by 4.6 points (+ 2.1 points since 2015). Romania is progressing towards gender equality at a slower pace than other EU Member States. Its rank has dropped one place since 2005. Romania\u2019s scores are lower than the EU\u2019s scores in all domains. Gender inequalities are most pronounced in the domain of power (38.8 points), time (50.3 points) and knowl- edge (51.5). Romania\u2019s highest score is in the domain of health (71.1 points), but this is the lowest score in the whole EU. Since 2005, Romania\u2019s scores have improved the most in the domains of money (+ 8.8 points) and power (+ 8.1). Progress has regressed in the domain of work (\u2013 0.9 points). Between 2005 and 2017, Romania improved its Index score, but it remained much lower than the EU\u2019s score in the same period. Romania\u2019s slower rate of improvement has led to an increasing gap with the EU over time. 1 100 EL HU SK RO PL LT HR CZ CY BG LV EE PT MT IT AT DE EU-28 SI LU ES BE IE NL UK FI FR DK SE RO 54.5 EU 67.4 Full inequality Full equality 2017 2005 \u25b2 Increase since 2005 \u25b2 5.4 \u25b2 4.6 Each year we score EU Member States and the EU as a whole to see how far they are from reaching gender equal- ity. The Index uses a scale of 1 to 100, where 1 is for total inequality and 100 is for total equality. The scores are based on the gaps between women and men and levels of achievement in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health. Two additional domains are integrated into the Index but do not have an impact on the final score. The domain of intersecting inequalities highlights how gender inequalities manifest in combination with age, dis/ability, country of birth, education and family type. The domain of violence against women measures and analyses women\u2019s experiences of violence. In addition to providing a snapshot into the Index scores, the Gender Equality Index 2019 includes a thematic focus on work-life balance.

        "Work Romania\u2019s score in the domain of work is 67.7. It is the only country showing a de- crease (\u2013 0.9 points) in this domain since 2005 (+ 0.6 points since 2015). Gender gaps in participation and segregation in the labour market persist. The employment rate (of people aged 20-64) is 61 % for women and 79 % for men. With the overall employment rate of 70 %, Romania has reached its national EU 2020 employment target of 70 %. Between 2005 and 2017, the full-time equivalent (FTE) employment rate remained stable for women (43 %) and increased for men (from 56 % to 60 %), widening the gender gap (from 13 percentage points (p.p.) to 17 p.p.). The FTE employment rates are much lower among single people. Around 8 % of both women and men work part-time. On average, women work 39 hours per week and men 40, which is the second smallest gender gap in the EU. The uneven concentration of women and men in different sectors of the labour market remains an issue. Romania has the lowest shares of both women (16 %) and men (3 %) working in education, health and social work in the EU. Significantly fewer women (9 %) than men (31 %) work in science, technology, engineering and mathe- matics (STEM) occupations. Money Romania\u2019s score in the domain of money is 62.0, showing progress of 8.8 points since 2005 (+ 2.6 points since 2015), with improvements in the economic and finan- cial situations of women and men. Despite increases in mean monthly earnings of both women (+ 70 %) and men (+ 65 %) from 2006 to 2014, the gender gap persists. Women still earn 5 % less than men. In couples with children, women earn 8 % less than men (11 % less in couples without children). The gender gap in earnings is also higher among people with lower levels of education. Romania\u2019s at risk of poverty rates for both women (23 %) and men (21 %) are among the highest in the EU and remained stable from 2007 to 2017. People facing the highest risk of poverty are those with low education (40 % of women and 41 % of men), young people aged 15-24 (33 % of both women and men) and lone parents (31 %). Income distribution among women and among men became more equal between 2007 and 2017. The gender pay gap is 4 % (the lowest in the EU) and the gender pension gap is 28 %. Knowledge Romania\u2019s score in the domain of knowledge is 51.5, which is 3.6 points more than in 2005 (\u2013 0.3 points since 2015). Despite this improvement, Romania has the third lowest knowl- edge score in the EU. An increase in the sub-domain score of attainment and participation is due to a growing number of tertiary graduates between 2005 and 2017. The share of women with tertiary education is 14 % (compared to 8 % in 2005), while the share of men with tertiary degrees is 13 % (compared to 9 % in 2005). Romania has almost met its national EU 2020 strategy target of having 26.7 % of people aged 30-34 with tertiary education. The current rate is 25 % (28 % of women and 21 % of men). Participation in lifelong learning has decreased in Romania since 2005. Around 8 % of women and 9 % of men engage in formal and non-for- mal education and training. This is one of the lowest participation rates in the EU. Despite improvements in the sub-domain of segregation, the uneven concentration of women and men in different study fields in tertiary education remains a challenge. Around 32 % of women and 17 % of men students study education, health and welfare, or human- ities and arts. \u25bc 0.3 \u25bc 1.3 79.0 58.0 Participation Segregation and quality of work 67.7 \u25bc 0.9 \u25bc decrease since 2005 \u25b2 11.1 \u25b2 3.2 47.2 81.6 Financial resources Economic situation 62.0 \u25b2 8.8 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25b2 3.2 \u25b2 4.1 52.4 50.7 Attainment and participation Segregation 51.5 \u25b2 3.6 \u25b2 increase since 2005 ",
        "Time Romania\u2019s score in the domain of time has not changed since the last edition of the Index because new data is not available. The next data update for this domain is expected in 2021. More frequent time-use data would help to track progress in this domain. In the domain of time, Romania\u2019s score is 50.3, well below the EU\u2019s score of 65.7. Gender inequalities in the distribution of time spent on care activities have in- creased since 2005. Women are more likely to spend time caring for their family: 46 % of women, compared to 25 % of men, have daily care responsibilities for 1 hour or more. This is the widest gender gap (21 p.p.) in the EU. This gap is even bigger among women and men in couples with children (82 % and 52 %). More women (75 %) than men (41 %) do cooking and housework every day for at least one hour. The gender gap is wider in couples with children (79 % women and 42 % men) than in couples without children (78 % and 54 %). Romania has the lowest shares of women (6 %) and men (8 %) participating in sport- ing, cultural or leisure activities outside the home in the EU. A lower share of women (6 %) than men (8 %) is involved in voluntary or charitable activities. Power Romania\u2019s score in the domain of power is 38.8, with an 8.1-point increase since 2005 (+ 5.6 points since 2015). The increase is driven by improvements in the sub-domains of political and social power, while there is regression in the sub-domain of econom- ic power. The domain of power has Romania\u2019s lowest score, standing 13.1 points below the EU\u2019s score. The share of women ministers increased from 12 % to 32 %, between 2005 and 2018. There are also more women members of parliament: 19 % compared to 11 % in 2005. The share of women on the boards of the largest publicly listed companies decreased from 13 % to 10 %, between 2005 and 2018. There has also been a de- crease in the share of women on the board of the central bank, from 13 % to 11 %. While Romania ranks 23rd in the sub-domain of economic power, it has the fifth highest score for the sub-domain of social power. Women comprise 45 % of board members of research-funding organisations, 27 % of board members of publicly owned broadcasting organisations and only 12 % of the highest decision-making bodies of national Olympic sports organisations. Health Romania\u2019s score in the domain of health is 71.1, showing progress of 1.6 points since 2005 (+ 0.7 points since 2015). Despite improvements in access to medical and dental services, Romania continues to rank last in the EU for gender equality in health. There is no new data for the sub-domain of health behaviour. Self-perceptions of good health slightly increased in Romania between 2007 and 2017. Fewer women (66 %) perceive their health as good, compared to men (76 %). Health satisfaction increases with a person\u2019s level of education but decreases with age. The gender gap widens, to the detriment of women, among older age groups and people with lower levels of education. Life expectancy increased for both women and men between 2005 and 2016. On average, women live 7 years longer than men. The num- ber of healthy life years has decreased for both women (from 63 to 59 years) and men (from 61 to 60 years), since 2007. Access to adequate health care increased for both women and men, between 2007 and 2017. Around 8 % of women and 5 % of men report unmet medical needs (com- pared to 18 % and 13 % in 2005), while 8 % of women and 6 % of men say they have unmet needs for dental services (compared to 19 % and 17 % in 2005). \u25bc 14.1 \u25b2 7.6 70.7 35.8 Care activities Social activities 50.3* \u25b2 1.4 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 * Scores not updated since 2017 edition. \u25b2 15.5 \u25bc 5.3 \u25b2 25.3 40.8 20.5 69.7 Political Economic Social 38.8 \u25b2 8.1 \u25b2 increase since 2005 \u25bc decrease since 2005 \u25b2 0.6 \u2014 \u25b2 6.0 88.6 42.5* 95.7 Status Behaviour Access 71.1 \u25b2 1.6 \u25b2 increase since 2005 * Scores not updated since 2017 edition.

        "Violence Violence against women is both a consequence and cause of persisting gender inequalities in the areas of work, health, money, power, knowledge and time. In con- trast to other domains, the domain of violence does not measure differences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s situ- ations but examines women\u2019s experiences of violence. For this reason, the domain of violence is not captured in the calculations of the Gender Equality Index. Instead, it is calculated as a separate composite measure of three aspects: prevalence, severity and disclosure of violence against women. The calculation of scores relied on the 2014 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights survey data results. No EU-wide survey on gender-based violence has been carried out since then. Until the com- pletion of the next survey, the scores cannot be updated. Romania signed and ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) in May 2016. The domain of violence presents updated data on three additional indicators to help monitor femicide, female genital mutilation and trafficking in human beings. How- ever, not all Member States collect such data and im- provements in data collection are necessary. Romania does not provide data on women victims of intentional homicide by an intimate partner or family member. Nor does it provide data estimating the pro- portion of girls (in the resident migrant population) at risk of female genital mutilation. Statistics on trafficking in human beings are not gathered and reported in Roma- nia. Comparable data, disaggregated by sex, is essential to the development of EU-wide strategies on preventing and eliminating violence against women across Member States. Thematic focus on work-life balance Gender Equality Index 2019 focuses on work-life balance \u2014 an issue of high political importance in the EU. In addi- tion to work-life balance related indicators captured by the Index (e.g. in the domains of work, time and knowledge), the thematic focus presents additional indicators \u2014 a work-life balance scoreboard (WLB scoreboard). The WLB scoreboard cuts across three broad areas: paid work, unpaid work (care) and education and training. It presents 15 indicators in six specific areas of concern: parental leave policies; caring for children and childcare services; informal care for older persons and persons with disabilities and long-term care services; transport and infrastructure; flexi- ble working arrangements; and lifelong learning. Parental leave policies Parental leave helps parents balance their caring duties and work life. However, it is often unavailable to potential par- ents as their eligibility might be dependent on criteria such as whether a person is in paid work; if they are an employee or self-employed; the sector in which they work; the length of service; or leave might not be accessible to same-sex couple or migrants. Changes in the labour market, such as the spread of atypical forms of employment (e.g. temporary contracts and on-demand work, bogus self-employment, voucher-based work) have increased concerns about par- ents\u2019 access to leave, especially in cases where it is based on definitions of traditional standard employment. In 2016, 33 % of women and 16 % of men aged 20-49 (potential parents) were ineligible for parental leave in Romania. Unemployment or inactivity was the main reason for ineligibility for 92 % of women and 73 % men. The re- maining 8 % of women and 27 % of men were ineligible for parental leave due to inadequate length of employment. Same-sex parents are ineligible for parental leave in Roma- nia. Among employed population, 4 % of women and 5 % of men were ineligible for parental leave. ",
        "Informal childcare and childcare services As the number of dual-earning and single-parent families grows, new needs for childcare services appear. High-qual- ity, available, accessible and affordable childcare services are essential to allow parents to stay in or join the labour market and reduce the gender gap in employment. In Romania, 62 % of all informal carers of children are women. Overall, more women (65 %) than men (50 %) are involved in caring for or educating their children or grand- children at least several times a week. The gender gap is much wider in Romania (15 p.p.) than in the EU (6 p.p.). In Romania, the gender gaps are especially wide among women and men working in the private sector (75 % and 47 %), among women and men who are not working (61 % and 35 %), and among women and men aged 20-49 (85 % and 64 %). Romania has not reached either of the Barcelona targets to have at least 33 % of children below the age of three and 90 % of children between the age of three and school age in childcare. About 16 % of children below the age of three are under some form of formal care arrangements, and only 2 % of them are in childcare for at least 30 hours a week. Formal childcare is provided for 60 % of children from age three to the minimum compulsory school age (only 12 % are in formal childcare for at least 30 hours a week). Around 9 % of households report unmet needs for formal childcare ser- vices in Romania, which is 5 p.p. less than the EU average. Informal care for older persons and persons with disabilities and long-term care services Available, accessible and affordable care services and infra- structure are crucial to support people with caring respon- sibilities maintain a healthy balance between their care du- ties and work life. This is especially relevant for women, who are often more engaged than men in both formal and infor- mal care of older persons and/or persons with disabilities. In light of emerging demographic trends, such as ageing societies, lower birth rates and consequently the decline of the working age population, the need for formal and infor- mal long-term care services becomes more important than ever. Most informal carers for older persons and/or persons with disabilities in Romania are women (51 %). The share of both women and men involved in informal care for older persons and/or people with disabilities several days a week or every day is 15 %. The same percentage of women is also involved in informal care at EU level (15 %), while the involvement of men is 5 p.p. higher. About 22 % of women and 15 % of men aged 50-64 take care of older persons and/or persons with disabilities, in comparison to 13 % of women and 18 % of men in the 20-49 age group. Around 36 % of women who take care of older persons and/or persons with disa- bilities are employed, compared to 77 % of men combining care with professional responsibilities. There are also fewer women than men informal carers who are working, in the EU, although the gender gap is wider in Romania (42 p.p. compared to 14 p.p. for the EU). In the 50-64 age group, 36 % of women informal carers work, compared to 82 % of men. Around 40 % of women and men in Romania report unmet needs for professional home care services. Transport and infrastructure Access to affordable and quality public infrastructure, such as care and educational facilities, health services and trans- portation, impacts women\u2019s and men\u2019s opportunities to balance paid work with other activities. The uneven division of caring duties and household tasks between women and men influences the ways in which they use or need certain types of transport and infrastructure. Time spent commut- ing is a good indication of whether existing public infra- structure helps or hinders women and men in juggling their everyday activities. In Romania, women and men spend similar amounts of time commuting to and from work (around 38 minutes per day for women and around 42 minutes for men). Men spend slightly more time commuting than women among single people, and among those in couples (with or without children). Women spend less time commuting than men, regardless of whether they work part- or full-time. Women part-time workers travel 32 minutes from home to work and back, while men commute 43 minutes, compared to 40 min- utes for women and 42 minutes for men working full-time. Generally, men are more likely to travel directly to and from work, whereas women make more multi-purpose trips, to fit in other activities such as school drop-offs or grocery shopping. ",

If carefully designed, keeping in mind the different needs of women and men, flexible working arrangements can make it easier to balance work and family life. They can support people with caring responsibilities to enter the labour market, as full-time employees. Around 69 % of both women and men cannot make use of flexible working arrangements in Romania because their work schedules are set by their employer, with no possi- bility for change. Access to flexible working arrangements is lower in Romania than in the EU, where 57 % of wom- en and 54 % of men have no control over their working time arrangements. In the Romanian public sector, 84 % of women and 86 % of men employees have no control over their working time. The situation is a bit better for private-sector employees, but access to flexible working time is still limited to 71 % of women and 68 % of men. Even though the share of women and men working part- time is similar in Romania, women are less likely than men to transition from part-time to full-time work. In 2017, 13 % of women part-time workers transitioned to full- time work, compared to 16 % of men. The gender gap is narrower than in the EU, where 14 % of women and 28 % of men moved from part-time to full-time work. Lifelong learning Constant advances in technology require workers to con- tinuously upskill and stay up to date with new develop- ments and technologies over the course of their careers. Lifelong learning is also a catalyst for gender equality as it gives women and men greater choice in their work op- tions and more opportunities to achieve their full poten- tial. Insufficient financial resources and time-related bar- riers such as conflicts with work schedules and/or family responsibilities can prevent access to lifelong learning for both women and men. Lifelong learning can help wom- en re-enter the labour market after career breaks due to care responsibilities. Romania has the lowest participation rate in lifelong learning (1 %) among Member States, with almost no dif- ference between women and men. Women (aged 25-64) are just as likely to participate in education and training as men, regardless of their employment status. Only among economically inactive people, women are less likely than men to engage in lifelong learning. Conflicts with work schedules are a greater barrier to participation in lifelong learning for men (34 %) than for women (25 %). Family responsibilities are reported as barriers to engagement in education and training for 44 % of women compared to 26 % of men. Work schedules are more of an obstacle for participation in lifelong learning in Romania than in the EU overall, while family responsibilities are less of an ob- stacle. In the EU, 38 % of women and 43 % of men report their work schedule as an obstacle, and 40 % of women and 24 % of men report that family responsibilities hinder participation in lifelong learning.
