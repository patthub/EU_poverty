        "3 T E N P R I O R I T I E S F O R E U R O P E The European Union is facing unprecedented challenges ranging from high unemployment, slow economic growth, economic uncertainties and a huge investment gap to migratory pressure and environmental and security challenges, as well as instability in its neighbourhood. Many citizens have lost confidence in the capacity of political institutions at all levels to tackle these challenges. Some achievements of European integration so far, like the free movement of persons and open internal borders, are being questioned. Populism and nationalism are on the rise. In November 2014, Jean-Claude Juncker took over as President of the European Commission, the executive organ of the European Union. He was elected on a political programme whose main purpose is to rebuild bridges in Europe and to restore European citizens\u2019 confidence by focusing EU policies on the key challenges ahead for our economies and societies, as well as to strengthen democratic legitimacy. To meet all of these challenges, Jean-Claude Juncker identified the 10 key priorities which are outlined in this booklet. They are the main focus for the EU institutions in 2015.

Collective efforts at European level are needed to help Europe\u2019s economy recover. As a result of the crisis, uncertainty in the economic outlook and high public and private debt in parts of the EU have been holding back investments. Resources are available, however, so money must be channelled to where it is most needed and projects must be developed to make best use of these resources. This Commission is focused on making smarter use of existing financial resources and making flexible use of public funds while improving the quality of regulation. It foresees a mobilisation of public and private sources of finance where public money is used to generate additional private investment without creating new debt. To provide this additional financing and to target projects of strategic and societal importance, the Commission, in cooperation with the European Investment Bank, launched the investment plan for Europe. At its heart lies a new European Fund for Strategic Investments that has been created in record time in 2015, with an initial \u20ac 21 billion of EU money. This will grow thanks to a multiplier effect, triggering other investments of more than \u20ac 315 billion. This could create 1.3 million jobs in the coming 3 years. One quarter of the money will be invested in smaller businesses. All the EU countries have endorsed the fund and may contribute to it. By October 2015, nine Member States had already pledged to contribute more than \u20ac 40 billion and China also indicated its intention to contribute. Investment will be targeted towards: \u2022 infrastructure \u2014 broadband, energy networks and transport; \u2022 education, research and innovation; \u2022 renewable energy and energy efficiency; \u2022 projects to help young people find work. Funding will be channelled to projects that are viable and bring benefit to the wider society. A list of projects which could be implemented over the next 3 years \u2014 and barriers holding back investment \u2014 has been identified. Priority will be given to removing the significant regulatory and non-regulatory barriers which remain across key infrastructure sectors including energy, telecoms, digital and transport, as well as barriers in services and product markets. The Commission has proposed a comprehensive list of initiatives in its 2015 work programme. The regulatory environment has a direct impact on investment, growth and jobs. Closing gaps in the single market could produce benefits of as much as \u20ac 1 500 billion per year, while exploiting the full growth potential of the single market could add more than 11 % to the EU\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). The EU economy has been in crisis from 2008 to 2014, but is likely to recover with new investment. The European Commission\u2019s top priority is to get Europe growing again and increase the number of jobs without creating new debt.

        "5 T E N P R I O R I T I E S F O R E U R O P E EU-cross-border, online services 4 % National online services 42 % US-based online services 54 % The internet and digital technologies are transforming the world. Europe must open up digital opportunities for people and businesses. At present, online barriers mean citizens miss out on opportunities to buy goods and services: only 15 % of EU citizens shop online from another EU country. Internet companies and start-ups do not take full advantage of online growth opportunities: only 7 % of small businesses sell cross-border. Businesses and governments are also not fully benefiting from digital tools. A fully functional digital single market could contribute \u20ac 415 billion per year to the EU\u2019s economy and create 3.8 million jobs. The digital single market strategy proposed by the Commission in May 2015 contains a set of actions to be achieved by the end of 2016. These include the following. \u2022 Providing better online access to digital goods and services by : \u2023 harmonising EU rules on contracts and consumer protection when buying online, whether for physical goods like shoes and furniture or digital content like e-books and apps; \u2023 promoting cheaper cross-border parcel delivery services: 62 % of companies that would like to sell online say that high delivery costs are a barrier; \u2023 ending unjustified geo-blocking \u2014 a discriminatory practice where online sellers either deny consumers access to a website based on their location or re-route them to a local store with different prices. Such blocking can mean that, for example, car rental customers in one EU country may end up paying more for an identical car rental in the same location than customers from another EU country; \u2023 modernising copyright law to allow for wider online access to cultural works across the EU. In particular, the Commission wants to ensure that users who buy films, music or articles at home can also enjoy them while travelling across Europe; \u2023 providing a high-speed, secure and trustworthy infrastructure supported by the right regulatory conditions for investment, fair competition and a level-playing field. \u2022 Embarking on an ambitious overhaul of telecoms rules : all digital services, applications and content depend on the availability of high-speed, secure infrastructures. This requires a strong, competitive and dynamic telecoms sector. Action needs to be taken to tackle the fact that markets remain isolated and national. \u2022 Maximising the growth potential of the digital economy . This will be achieved by investment in ICT infrastructure for, to give an example, cloud computing and use of \u2018big data\u2019, as well as research and innovation to boost industrial competiveness. It will also include better public services and improved digital skills for citizens \u2014 in short, an \u2018inclusive society\u2019. Few people buy online from other EU countries \u2014 a huge growth potential. The Commission wants everyone to have better access to digital goods and services, to reliable high-speed infrastructure and to get the most out of the digital economy.

Excessive dependence on a limited number of supply sources leaves countries vulnerable to supply disruptions. The EU must reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and cut greenhouse gas emissions, while ensuring that households and businesses are provided with affordable energy. The EU faces many challenges in achieving this. \u2022 The EU is the largest energy importer in the world, importing 53 % of its energy at an annual cost of around \u20ac 400 billion. \u2022 Many electricity grids and gas pipelines are built for national purposes and are not well connected across borders. For example, until 2015 the electricity cables connecting France and Spain could only handle 3 % of peak demand south of the border. Fixing problems like these could save consumers up to \u20ac 40 billion a year. \u2022 75 % of our houses are energy inefficient; 94 % of transport relies on oil products, of which 90 % are imported. \u2022 Wholesale electricity prices in Europe are 30 % higher and wholesale gas prices are over 100 % greater than in the United States. In February 2015, the Commission set out its strategy to achieve a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy. The strategy will ensure that the EU is well placed to meet its challenges based on solidarity and trust between Member States. The strategy focuses on the following five key areas. \u2022 Secure supplies : the EU must become less dependent on energy from outside its borders. This means making better, more efficient use of our domestic energy sources while diversifying to other sources and supplies. \u2022 Internal energy market : energy should flow freely across the EU, without any technical or regulatory barriers. Only then can energy providers freely compete and provide the best energy prices. The free flow will also make it easier to produce more renewable energy. \u2022 Energy efficiency : consuming less energy means less pollution and greater preservation of our domestic energy sources, reducing our need for energy imports. \u2022 Emissions reduction : the agreed EU target of emitting at least 40 % fewer greenhouse gases by 2030 is a first step. This implies that we have to invest more in the development of renewable energy sources. \u2022 Research and innovation : having the technological lead in alternative energy and reducing energy consumption will create huge export and industrial opportunities. This will also help boost growth and jobs. The strategy is accompanied by an action plan presenting specific measures that will be prepared and implemented over the coming years. In July, the Commission presented proposals to deliver a new deal for energy consumers, to launch a redesign of the European electricity market, to update energy efficiency labelling and to revise the EU emissions trading system. The Commission wants to ensure secure, affordable and climate-friendly energy for citizens and businesses. Using energy more wisely and fighting climate change is not only an investment in our children\u2019s future, it will also create new jobs and growth. WHERE DOES OUR ENERGY COME FROM? Europeans need more secure and sustainable energy sources. Further reading and latest developments: http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/energy-union/index_en.htm ",
        "7 T E N P R I O R I T I E S F O R E U R O P E The Commission\u2019s priorities are to: \u2022 create a capital markets union, making it easier for small businesses to raise money and make Europe a more attractive place to invest; \u2022 encourage workers to take up jobs in other EU countries in order to fill vacancies and meet the need for special skills; \u2022 prevent social dumping; \u2022 boost administrative cooperation among national tax authorities; \u2022 work for the adoption of a common consolidated corporate tax base and a financial transaction tax at EU level. In September 2015, following a public consultation, the Commission adopted an action plan setting out 20 key measures to achieve a true single market for capital in Europe. This project aims to unlock funding for Europe's businesses and to boost growth in the EU. The intention is to achieve this by 2019. The free movement of capital is a long-standing objective of the European Union. Europe\u2019s capital markets, however, remain fragmented along national lines and European economies remain heavily reliant on banks for their funding needs. This makes them more vulnerable in times of recession to a tightening of bank lending. In other parts of the world it is more common that investors directly offer so-called \u2018venture capital\u2019 to new companies. The capital markets union is intended to break down the barriers that are blocking cross-border investments in the EU and preventing businesses from getting access to finance. For example, if EU venture capital markets functioned like that of the United States, an extra \u20ac 90 billion might have been invested in companies between 2008 and 2013. In June 2015, the Commission presented an action plan to fundamentally reform corporate taxation in the EU. It sets out a series of initiatives to tackle tax avoidance, secure sustainable revenues to finance public services and strengthen the single market for businesses. The action plan contains two key goals: \u2022 the EU Member States should agree on common rules on how to calculate the basis on which they tax businesses. This would make it much cheaper for businesses to operate across borders and reduce tax avoidance while allowing different Member States to maintain different corporate tax rates; \u2022 profits should be taxed where they are generated rather than on the basis of formal business structures or accounting transactions carried out for tax purposes. An integrated EU economy is the best way to meet the challenges of globalisation. The EU needs to complete the internal market for products and services and make it the launch pad for companies and industry to thrive in the global economy. This creates growth and jobs. Enhancing fair, efficient, growth-friendly and transparent taxation is equally part of this priority.

        "8 T H E E U R O P E A N U N I O N E X P L A I N E D A deeper and fairer Economic and Monetary Union The EMU was a major step in the integration of EU economies. It involves the coordination of economic and fiscal policies, a common monetary policy and a common currency, the euro. Whilst all 28 EU Member States take part in the economic union, some countries have taken integration further and have adopted the euro. Economic integration brings the benefits of greater size and internal efficiency to the EU economy as a whole and to the economies of the individual Member States. This, in turn, offers opportunities for economic stability, higher growth and more employment \u2014 outcomes of direct benefit to EU citizens. Since the financial and economic crisis began in October 2008, the EU has taken action to ensure: \u2022 economic support to the EU countries that were hit particularly hard by the crisis, combined with agreements on reforms. Most of these assistance programmes were successfully concluded in 2014, while the situation in Greece required new agreements in 2015; \u2022 the restoration of financial stability and the formation of the right conditions for growth and job creation. There are now common rules on how to supervise banks and help banks in difficulty; \u2022 a better EU system of economic and financial governance . All EU countries now discuss and analyse their public budget together. The Commission\u2019s main objectives for improvement are as follows: \u2022 to make decisions about providing support for struggling euro area countries more democratically legitimate, with enhanced parliamentary control at EU and national levels; \u2022 to evaluate EU support and reform programmes not only for how they help create sustainable finances but also for their impact on the citizens of the country concerned; \u2022 to review the rules on how the EU monitors the fiscal and macroeconomic situation and the national budgets; \u2022 to encourage further structural reforms in the euro area. In February 2015, the Commission presented an analysis to the Heads of State and Government on the main shortcomings of the EMU that had been revealed by the crisis. As a result, in June, ambitious plans on how to deepen the EMU and how to complete it by 2025 at the latest were announced by the President of the Commission in close cooperation with the presidents of the euro summit, the Eurogroup (the ministers of the Member States in the euro area), the European Central Bank and the European Parliament (the so-called 'Five Presidents' Report'). Proposed measures include the introduction of a European deposit insurance scheme and the creation of a euro area treasury . To tackle the global economic crisis, the EU and its Member States took bold and unprecedented measures that were not always easy, especially for citizens, and that sometimes did not take their social consequences sufficiently into account. Now is the time to draw on the lessons learned for an improved economic governance and start completing the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) based on the \u2018Five Presidents\u2019 Report\u2019 under the lead of President Juncker.

        "9 T E N P R I O R I T I E S F O R E U R O P E The EU and the United States together make up 40 % of global economic output. A comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could bring important economic benefits, wider choice for consumers and new opportunities for businesses. TTIP would also strengthen the EU\u2019s strategic position in the world. The agreement is about more than just removing tariffs. Tariffs between the EU and the United States are already low (on average only 4 %), so the main hurdles to trade lie \u2018behind the border\u2019 in regulations, non-tariff barriers and red tape. Estimates show that 80 % of the overall potential wealth gains of a trade deal will come from cutting administrative costs and from liberalising trade in services and public procurement. With TTIP, the Commission wants to help people and businesses by: \u2022 opening up United States markets to EU firms, including for public services; \u2022 helping cut red tape that firms face when exporting; \u2022 setting new rules to make it easier and fairer to export , import and invest overseas. TTIP would help European firms sell more goods and services in the United States. European firms could also participate on an equal footing in United States government tenders. This would be good for the economy and for jobs. Here in Europe, cheaper American imports would mean more choice in the shops at lower prices: cheaper goods and services would also bring savings for business. The Commission will negotiate a reasonable and balanced trade agreement with the United States. The Commission supports free trade, but not at the price of sacrificing European standards in areas such as food safety, health, social and data protection or cultural diversity. In September the Commission proposed a new and transparent system for resolving disputes between investors and states \u2014 the investment court system. This would replace the existing investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism in all ongoing and future EU investment negotiations, including the TTIP. The European Parliament, which is elected by EU citizens, will have the final say on whether an agreement is acceptable. The European Commission is currently negotiating a trade agreement with the United States. The aim is to open up as much trade and investment as possible between the two blocs. This will result in more jobs and more growth on both sides.

        "10 T H E E U R O P E A N U N I O N E X P L A I N E D An area of justice and fundamental rights based on mutual trust The Commission\u2019s main objectives are to: \u2022 make it easier for citizens and companies in the EU to defend their rights outside their home country by improving the mutual recognition of judgments by courts across the EU; \u2022 crack down on organised crime, such as human trafficking, smuggling and cybercrime, and to tackle corruption; \u2022 conclude the accession of the EU to the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on Human Rights; \u2022 obtain guarantees that United States government agencies and companies adequately protect EU citizens\u2019 personal data. In April 2015, the European Commission set out a European agenda on security to support Member States\u2019 cooperation in tackling security threats and to increase collaboration in the fight against terrorism, organised crime and cybercrime. The agenda sets out the concrete tools and measures which will be used to ensure security and tackle these three most pressing threats more effectively. Key actions include: \u2022 countering radicalisation : the Commission will set up a centre of excellence to collect and disseminate expertise on anti-radicalisation; \u2022 cutting the financing of criminals : cooperation between competent authorities in Europe will be strengthened. This includes, in particular, national financial intelligence units, which will be connected to Europol; \u2022 enhancing dialogue with the IT industry : in 2015, the Commission will launch an EU forum with major IT companies in order to counter terrorist propaganda on the internet and in social media and to explore ways to address the concerns of law enforcement authorities on new encryption technologies; \u2022 reinforcing tools to fight cybercrime : the priority is to identify ways to overcome obstacles to criminal investigations online, notably on issues of competent jurisdiction, and rules on access to internet-based evidence and information; \u2022 enhancing the capacities of Europol , including through the creation of a European counter-terrorist centre which will help Europol to increase support for the actions taken by national law enforcement authorities to tackle foreign terrorist fighters, the financing of terrorism, violent extremist content online and illicit trafficking of firearms. The EU is not simply a common market for goods and services. It is based on the values of human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.

        "11 T E N P R I O R I T I E S F O R E U R O P E The sudden rise in the number of people who are forced to flee their homes to escape violence and seek refuge, in their own countries or abroad, is a test for the European Union. Europe's response has been comprehensive and decisive in the past months: \u00b7 an extra \u20ac 1.7 billion were made available in September, bringing the total EU budget to address the refugee crisis to \u20ac 9 .2 billion in 2015 and 2016; \u00b7 the EU is the number one donor in the global efforts to alleviate the Syrian refugee crisis . Around \u20ac 4 billion have been granted by the European Commission and Member States in assistance to Syrians in their country and to refugees; \u00b7 Member States have agreed to relocate 160 000 people in clear need of international protection from the Member States most affected to other EU Member States. 22 000 refugees will also be resettled from camps outside the EU; \u00b7 presence at sea has been tripled since May . Over 122 000 lives have been saved since then; \u00b7 efforts to tackle smugglers and dismantle human trafficker groups have been redoubled. In a recent survey of public opinion in the EU, 73 % of Europeans said they were in favour of a common European policy on migration. When asked to identify the two most important concerns facing the EU, immigration was at the top of the list ahead of the economic situation and unemployment. It was the most frequently cited concern in 20 of the 28 Member States. 0 100 000 200 000 300 000 400 000 500 000 600 000 700 000 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 The preliminary figure for the first six months of 2015 is 402 000 NUMBER OF ASYLUM APPLICATIONS IN THE EU While the refugee crisis has put the spotlight on immediate needs and is the current top priority, it has also revealed much about the structural limitations of EU migration policy and the tools at its disposal. The European Agenda for Migration presented by the Commission in May 2015 set out a comprehensive approach to migration management building on four pillars: \u00b7 reducing the incentives for irregular migration; \u00b7 saving lives and securing external borders; \u00b7 a strong common asylum policy; \u00b7 a new policy on legal migration. The world has been shocked by the plight of thousands of migrants putting their lives in peril to enter the EU. No EU country can or should have to face huge migratory pressures on its own. The EU is stepping up its efforts to save lives, fight human trafficking and cooperate with countries of origin and transit. Even more fundamentally, the Commission wants to tackle the root causes that force people to escape and migrate: poverty, wars, persecutions, violations of human rights and natural disasters. Towards a new policy on migration The increase in the number of people wanting asylum in the EU calls for common European solutions.

        "12 T H E E U R O P E A N U N I O N E X P L A I N E D A stronger global actor The EU is a key player on many foreign policy issues, ranging from Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and stabilising the Horn of Africa to global warming. Its joint foreign and security policy, designed to resolve conflicts and foster international understanding, is based on diplomacy, while trade, aid, security and defence all play a complementary role. As the world\u2019s largest donor of development finance, the EU is uniquely well-placed for cooperation with developing countries. The EU also deals with subjects like environment, education, crime-fighting and human rights in its relations with the rest of the world. The EU is currently focusing on supporting the comprehensive reform process underway in the Ukraine, notably through the implementation of an unprecedented support package of \u20ac 11 billion. Against the background of the crisis in eastern Ukraine, the EU supports all efforts to create a lasting peaceful solution. The Syrian crisis has become the world\u2019s worst humanitarian and security disaster. The EU and its constituent countries are leading the international response. As the largest donor, they have mobilised over \u20ac 4 billion in development and humanitarian aid since the conflict began. EU foreign and security policy has developed gradually over many years and enables the EU to speak and act as one in world affairs. Acting together gives the EU\u2019s 28 Member States far greater authority than they would have if each pursued its own policies. The sheer demographic and economic weight of the 28-nation bloc makes it a major power. It is the world\u2019s biggest trader, with the world\u2019s second largest currency, the euro. The trend towards joint foreign policy decisions further strengthens its position. The EU maintains partnerships with the world\u2019s key players, including emerging powers. It seeks to ensure that these relationships are based on mutual interests and benefits, with rights and duties on both sides. The Commission\u2019s current objectives include: \u2022 creating more synergies between Member States in defence procurement; \u2022 bringing peace and stability to the European neighbourhood by continuing ongoing enlargement negotiations, notably with the Western Balkans. This will take time, so no further enlargement is foreseen during the term of the Juncker Commission (i.e. before the end of 2019); \u2022 pooling of defence capabilities by those national governments that wish to do so, thus enabling them to participate in joint EU missions \u2014 and thereby avoiding duplication of programmes and saving money. The political crisis in Ukraine and the unrest in the Middle East have made it clear that the EU needs a stronger common foreign policy. EU GDP 24.1 % Rest of the world GDP 75.9 % EU population 7.1 % Rest of the world population 92.9 % THE EU\u2019S SHARE OF THE WORLD ECONOMY Even if the EU only has around 7 % of the world's population, its economic share counts for over 24 % of the world's GDP.

Its main objectives include: \u2022 proposing new laws only when they are needed and providing a clear European added value once the public has been consulted. The work programme for 2015 only includes 23 new initiatives; \u2022 being fully transparent about what the Commission is doing (for example, Commissioners and senior officials publish details of their meetings: unprecedented transparency has been introduced for international trade negotiations); \u2022 examining existing laws and adjusting them where needed; \u2022 removing unnecessary red tape at both European and national levels; \u2022 creating a mandatory register for organisations and individuals lobbying the Commission, Parliament and Council; \u2022 finding ways to deepen cooperation between national parliaments and the Commission. Since December 2014, Commissioners, members of their cabinets and the Directors-General of the Commission must publish the dates, locations, names of the organisations and self-employed individuals they meet, as well as the topics of their discussion. This is because it is just as important to enable citizens to know who the Commission meets and why as it is for the Commission to maintain an open and regular dialogue with stakeholders. In May 2015, the European Commission adopted its better regulation agenda. This is intended to ensure: \u2022 transparency when preparing, implementing and reviewing policy; \u2022 that evidence always informs policymaking; \u2022 that anyone affected by proposals is involved, including members of the public. The Commission will open up its policymaking process to further public scrutiny and input, with new public consultations when it comes to assessing new proposals or evaluating existing policies. There will also be new opportunities for public comments throughout the entire lawmaking procedure. After the Commission has adopted a proposal, any interested citizen will have 8 weeks to provide feedback or suggestions which will feed into the legislative debate before Parliament and Council. Existing laws will be evaluated, partly through the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT). This assesses existing legislation to make it more effective and efficient without compromising policy objectives. The Commission is already working to reduce burdens for business in areas such as value-added tax (VAT), public procurement, business statistics and chemicals. Comprehensive evaluations in other fields are also under way. The Commission is also renewing its commitment to listen to the views of any stakeholder at any time by means of an online tool called \u2018 Lighten the Load \u2014 Have Your Say \u2019. There has been a growing perception in recent years, reflected in the results of European elections, that the EU is distant from its people and is overly bureaucratic. Citizens expect the EU to make a difference on the important economic and social challenges. The Juncker Commission's work programmes reflect this by considerably reducing the number of new initiatives, scrapping certain former proposals for new laws and reexamining existing laws.
