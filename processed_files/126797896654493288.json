Calls on Frontex to take the initiative of creating a common information-sharing environment between the competent national authorities in order to optimise the collection, analysis and dissemination of sensitive data; calls on the European Security Research and Innovation Forum (ESRIF) to make its contribution to achiev\u00ad ing that objective, giving priority in its work to common applications for the improvement of, and innovation in, the field of surveillance tools; 36. Calls for the strengthening of the democratic control of Frontex by Parliament, and calls on Frontex to inform Parliament of negotiations to conclude agreements signed with third countries, to present tactical assessments focused on particular border regions, and to publish evaluation reports on joint operations and other coordinated missions, risk analyses, feasibility studies and statistics on migration trends; points out that democratic oversight of Frontex\u2019s activities would, among other things, enhance its legitimacy; nevertheless the information published in those reports should not contain confidential data that may affect ongoing operations; 37. Calls on the Commission to clarify which range of logistical support on border surveillance is intended for neighbouring third countries as mentioned under step 3 of Phase 1 of Eurosur; 38.

        "C 45 E /50 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Thursday 18 December 2008 G. whereas there is a large and increasing number of types of counterfeit products, no longer confined to luxury and high-quality goods but also including commonly used products, such as toys, medicines, cos\u00ad metics and food, H. whereas a recent survey by the OECD estimated that international trade relating to IPR infringements amounted to as much as EUR 150 billion in 2005, to which should be added the value of national trans\u00ad actions and counterfeit and pirated products that are distributed through the Internet, I. whereas in 2007 the amount of goods seized by the customs authorities of the European Union that were in breach of IPRs increased by 17 % against the previous year, with an increase of 264 % for cosmetics and personal hygiene products, 98 % for toys and 51 % for medicines, J. whereas counterfeiting and piracy have alarming consequences for the EU economy and for the Com\u00ad munity social and economic system as a whole, reducing incentives to innovate, curbing foreign direct investment, eliminating skilled jobs from industry and laying the groundwork for the development of a hidden economic system, running parallel to the legal one and controlled by organised crime, K. whereas the abovementioned 2007 report by the OECD and the upcoming Phase II report by the OECD on \u2018Piracy of digital content\u2019, emphasise the global scale, rapid growth and detrimental economic impact of digital piracy on rights holders, L. whereas counterfeiting causes serious damage to the environment, both because of the inadequacy of the quality standards of counterfeit goods and the high costs of disposing of and destroying them, M. whereas access to procedures for combating counterfeit goods is complicated, costly and time-consum\u00ad ing, especially for SMEs, N. whereas the single market ensures that European consumers can choose freely, transparently and safely which products to buy, and counterfeiting, unless appropriately curbed, can not only undermine the prin\u00ad ciple of confidence on which the entire system is based but can also pose serious risks to safety, health, and in extreme cases, the very lives of consumers and it is thus necessary to better protect their rights, O. whereas initiatives to raise awareness among consumers about risks to their health and safety and, in gen\u00ad eral, about the consequences of buying counterfeit goods are an effective tool in combating counterfeiting, P. whereas tougher action should be taken against counterfeiters of products that have a direct impact on public health, Q. whereas the ongoing differences between the laws of the Member States on IPRs, particularly with regard to the criminal measures aimed at ensuring that they are respected, weaken the European Union\u2019s nego\u00ad tiating position and may undermine the efforts hitherto made to combat counterfeiting more effectively internationally, R. whereas the simplified procedure laid down in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 in Member States such as Portugal, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands and Lithuania which allows for the destruction of large quantities of counterfeit goods in a short period of time and with relatively low costs, is very successful, ",

( 1 ), U. whereas in 2007 the European Union, Japan and the United States announced the opening of negotia\u00ad tions with a view to a new multilateral agreement designed to strengthen the enforcement of IPRs and combat counterfeiting and piracy (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement \u2014 ACTA), V. whereas a favourable conclusion of the ACTA Agreement will make it possible to establish common stan\u00ad dards for civil and administrative protection, improved inter-institutional cooperation and cooperation with the private sector, and the incorporation of technical assistance, with a view to making respect for IPRs simpler, safer and less costly, W. whereas a distinction needs to be drawn between generic medicines, the distribution of and trading in which should be encouraged, both in the EU and in developing countries, and counterfeit medicines, which, on the one hand, are dangerous for public health and, on the other, cause substantial economic losses to companies in the sector and may delay the development of new discoveries without benefiting the populations of the least developed countries; whereas, moreover, counterfeit medicines account for only part of illegal medicines, X. whereas, as regards products having a direct impact on public health, Internet and parallel trade distri\u00ad bution networks contribute greatly to the spread of counterfeit products that are dangerous to public health, Y. whereas the European Union is pursuing ongoing efforts to harmonise IPR enforcement measures, nota\u00ad bly with a proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on criminal measures aimed at ensur\u00ad ing the enforcement of intellectual property rights of 12 July 2005 (COM(2005)0276), and this process should not be circumvented by trade negotiations which are outside the scope of the normal EU decision- making processes , Z. whereas it is also crucial to ensure that the development of IPR enforcement measures is accomplished in a manner that does not impede innovation or competition, undermine IPR limitations and exceptions or personal data, restrict the free flow of information, or unduly burden legitimate trade, AA. whereas the European Union has demonstrated its commitment to effective and balanced enforcement of IPRs by adopting a set of directives in this field following detailed scrutiny by the Parliament and the Council over many years, AB. whereas it is fundamentally important, when considering legal measures, to recognise the substantive dif\u00ad ference between intellectual and material property rights, and accordingly between infringement of rights and theft, AC. whereas all intellectual property infringements are damaging to trade and business but commercial scale infringements have additional and widespread effects, AD. whereas, in the case of patents on pharmaceutical products, whilst infringements of patents are settled case-by-case on the basis of substantive arguments made in civil proceedings on the grounds of a patent infringement, infringements of copyright and trademarks constitute intentional offences, ",
        "C 45 E /52 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Thursday 18 December 2008 The multilateral framework 1. Takes the view that the Word Trade Organisation (WTO) system aims to ensure that IPRs are more widely recognised internationally, providing for an agreed level of standards of protection through the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), dialogue between Member States and with other institutions such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and the World Customs Organisation (WCO), as well as a dispute prevention and settlement mechanism; 2. Calls on the Commission to persevere in the TRIPS Council to ensure that the minimum rules incorpo\u00ad rated into national law are accompanied by effective enforcement measures and measures to prevent infringe\u00ad ments;takes the view that the flexibilities provided for in the TRIPS agreement and confirmed in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health, should be maintained insofar as they are aimed at ensuring a fair balance between the interests of rights\u2019 holders and those of end users; 3. Calls on the Commission to bring forward proposals to the Parliament to ensure that export, transit and transhipment operations are appropriately dealt with in the TRIPS agreement and to examine the case for fur\u00ad ther changes in the agreement, in order to create a fair balance between the interests of owners and those of potential users of IPRs, particularly bearing in mind the level of development of the parties involved and dis\u00ad tinguishing between countries which produce counterfeit and pirated products, those which use them, and those through which the products transit; 4. Welcomes the progress achieved by the European Union in technical assistance programmes which have helped to strengthen IPRs in emerging and developing countries, and stresses the importance of continuing with such programmes, in view of the benefits which they can achieve in terms of sustainable economic devel\u00ad opment and their important role in combating counterfeiting; 5. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop specific measures, backed up by appropriate financial coverage, in favour of more widespread consumer education in Europe and also in developing coun\u00ad tries, in order to avert the risks relating to potentially dangerous counterfeit products; 6. Supports the solutions put forward at the Twelfth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, within the Creative Africa Initiative, which consider the creative industries to be an essential fac\u00ad tor in the growth of underdeveloped countries, and reaffirm the vital role of IP for the sustainable develop\u00ad ment of such regions; 7. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to propose and support the drafting of a protocol on counterfeiting, in addition to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (Palermo Convention); 8. Points out that in several emerging economies, the production of counterfeit and pirated goods has reached alarming levels; whilst welcoming the cooperation initiatives hitherto implemented, is of the view that special measures are required in order to strengthen coordination between customs, judicial and police authori\u00ad ties with the countries concerned and to encourage the harmonisation of the laws of these countries with those of the European Union; 9. Calls on the Commission to introduce, along the same lines as Article 3(2) ( 1 ) Article 3(2) states that \u2018Those measures, procedures and remedies shall also be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safe\u00ad guards against their abuse.\u2019 ( 1 ) of the Directive 2004/48/EC, safeguards at international level in order to guarantee that any extra patent enforcement measures are not used to hinder legitimate trade; ",
        "23.2.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 45 E /53 Thursday 18 December 2008 10. Encourages the Commission and the Member States to strengthen their cooperation with Euro-Mediter\u00ad ranean partner countries within the Euromed Market Programme and promote in the Euro-Mediterra\u00ad nean region a common approach to legislation, procedures and implementation with regard to customs cooperation and action to combat counterfeiting and piracy in order to facilitate trade between Euro-Mediter\u00ad ranean partner countries; 11. Is convinced that in order to step up the fight against counterfeiting, more regular and targeted use should also be made of the WTO\u2019s Dispute Settlement Body, which, together with the Community and national courts, can provide better protection of European industry and consumers by consolidating case-law which enhances the substance and scope of the TRIPS agreement; 12. Reaffirms that any harmonisation of substantive law must respect national sovereignty and international treaties in this area; ACTA and other bilateral and regional EU initiatives 13. Calls on the Commission to continue its fight against counterfeiting and piracy, in parallel with the mul\u00ad tilateral negotiations, also by means of bilateral, regional and multilateral agreements with a view to approxi\u00ad mating and enforcing laws, and by providing for the establishment of efficient dispute settlement systems and penalties in case of failure to comply with the obligations underwritten; 14. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to negotiate ACTA under conditions of the utmost transparency towards EU citizens, especially with regard to the definitions of the terms \u2018counterfeiting\u2019 and \u2018piracy\u2019 and the criminal sanction measures foreseen; takes the view that the social impact of the agreement as well as the impact on civil liberties must be assessed; supports the establishment of a task force to examine the implementation of the agreement, by promoting this subject in dialogue between the European Union and third countries and as part of cooperation measures with those countries; 15. Considers that it is not yet certain whether the EC Treaty provides a legal basis for Community measures prescribing the type and level of criminal penalties and that, as a consequence, the Commission may not have competence to negotiate on behalf of the Community an international agreement which specifies the nature and level of criminal-law measures to be taken against trademark and copyright violators; 16. Stresses that in all intellectual property enforcement agreements foreseen, personal use, that is not for profit, must be distinguished from the fraudulent and intentional marketing of counterfeit and pirated goods; 17. Calls on the Commission to negotiate with third countries on the establishment of task forces to combat counterfeiting; 18. Asks the Commission to ensure that ACTA will not grant public authorities access to private computers and other electronic devices; 19. Welcomes the growing interest shown by a number of WTO countries in the ACTA, believes that efforts should be made to include emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil as well as regional trade blocs such as Mercosur, CARICOM and ASEAN, in order for them to take part in the negotiations of the agreement, invit\u00ad ing them from n ow to commit themselves to g uarantee I PRs\u2019 respect in their territories; ",
        "C 45 E /54 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Thursday 18 December 2008 20. Calls on the Commission to avoid the danger of contradictions and overlap between the ACTA, the TRIPS agreement and other international IPR treaties; 21. Calls on the Commission to ensure that ACTA only concentrates on IPR enforcement measures and not on substantive IPR issues such as the scope of protection, limitations and exceptions, secondary liability or liability of intermediaries; 22. Calls on the Commission to ensure that ACTA is not used as a vehicle for modifying the existing Euro\u00ad pean IPR enforcement framework, but fully reflects the balance established by the different directives adopted by the European Parliament and Council in this field, and notably the provision of Recital 2 of the Directive 2004/48/EC; 23. Calls on the Commission and the Council to clarify the role and competence of the Article 133 Com\u00ad mittee and the other committees involved in the negotiation of the ACTA; 24. Believes that the Commission should take into account certain strong criticism of ACTA in its ongoing n egotiations, namely that it could allow trademark and copyright holders to intrude on the privacy of alleged infringers without due legal process, that it could further criminalise non commercial copyright and trade\u00ad mark infringements, that it could reinforce Digital Rights Management technologies at the cost of \u2018fair use\u2019 rights, that it could establish a dispute settlement procedure outside existing WTO structures and lastly that it could force all signatories to cover the cost of enforcement of copyright and trademark infringements; 25. In this context, calls on the Commission to ensure a continuous and transparent public consultation pro\u00ad cess, to support the benefits of such a process with all the negotiating countries, and to ensure that the Par\u00ad liament is regularly and thoroughly informed about the state of play of the negotiations; 26. Recalls that the EC Treaty includes derogations where the negotiation and conclusion of agreements in the field of commercial aspects of intellectual property relates to trade in cultural and audiovisual services; points out that, in such instances, the negotiation and conclusion of agreements falls within the shared com\u00ad petence of the Community and its Member States; further points out that, in addition to a Community deci\u00ad sion taken in accordance with the relevant provisions of the EC Treaty, the negotiation of such agreements requires the common accord of the Member States and agreements negotiated in this way must be concluded jointly by the Community and the Member States; 27. Reminds the Commission of, within the framework of ACTA negotiations, Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which concerns the protection of personal data, and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 1 ) OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. ( 1 ); 28. Takes the view that the public interest in disclosure of ACTA preparatory drafts, including progress reports, and of the Commission\u2019s negotiating mandate should not be overridden by Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents ( 2 ) OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 43. ( 2 ), and urges the Council to enforce Article 255 of the EC Treaty in such a way as to ensure the widest possible access to documents, provided that the nec\u00ad essary security measures are taken as required by data-protection law; 29. Notes with regret that IPR protection in Turkey does not yet meet EU standards and therefore needs to be reviewed; points out that Turkey will only become a credible candidate for accession when it is in a posi\u00ad tion to take on the Community acquis and guarantee full respect for IPRs within its boundaries; ",
        "23.2.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 45 E /55 Thursday 18 December 2008 EU-China relations 30. Calls on the Chinese authorities to step up their efforts and take legal action with renewed energy against those who violate IPRs and, in this connection, welcomes the change of attitude on the part of judicial bodies which recently recognised the IPR entitlements of EU citizens in China and condemned local companies which had infringed those rights; 31. Reaffirms the need to step up cooperation with the Chinese customs authorities and to guarantee assis\u00ad tance and support from corresponding European administrative services; 32. Stresses the fact that 60 % of the counterfeit goods seized by the customs authorities of the EU are pro\u00ad duced in China; asks the Commission, together with the Chinese authorities, to present an action plan to fight counterfeiting as soon as possible; External support measures in the fight against counterfeiting 33. Recommends that an effective mon itoring mechan ism b e in troduced with reg ard to possib le in fringe\u00ad ments of IPRs that are protected under the various agreements, coupled with trade incentive tools as part of a specific commitment to the fight against counterfeiting and piracy; 34. Points out that the GSP Regulation also provides for the possibility of temporarily suspending prefer\u00ad ences for those partners which implement unfair trading practices; takes the view that in the event of particu\u00ad larly serious violations of intellectual property, such as cases constituting a serious threat to safety and public health, the use of such a deterrent should be taken into due consideration by the Commission; 35. Is of the view that the Trade Barriers Regulation can provide important assistance to European compa\u00ad nies suffering from problems of third-country market access in relation to intellectual property infringements and calls on the Commission to encourage and facilitate its use, especially by SMEs; 36. Takes the view that improved cooperation between the European Union and the Member States in third countries can guarantee more effective exchanges of information, better use of available resources and a greater impact on measures to combat counterfeiting as regards both political-diplomatic action and more strictly technical aspects; 37. Calls on the Commission to make the \u2018market access team\u2019 in the EU delegations a tangible point of ref\u00ad erence for Commun ity compan ies (in particular SME s) complain ing of in tel lectual property in fringements; Regulatory and organisational issues 38. Notes the Commission\u2019s commitment to consolidating IPRs in the European Union and calls for greater commitment in the combating of counterfeiting and the harmonisation of existing laws in the Member States; 39. Notes that there is no harmonised definition in the European Union of \u2018counterfeiting\u2019 and \u2018piracy\u2019 and that the Member States\u2019 definitions differ; 40. Notes the worrying spread of counterfeiting and piracy, in particular, in a globalised economy, and its serious implications for the competitiveness of the European Union and its businesses, creators and consum\u00ad ers; calls therefore on the Member States to provide consumers with sufficient information on the dangers of counterfeiting and piracy, in particular the considerable health and safety risks which counterfeit products, including medicin es, pose to con sumers; ",
        "C 45 E /56 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 23.2.2010 Thursday 18 December 2008 41. Asks the Commission to investigate specifically the health and safety risks related to counterfeiting in order to assess whether further measures are needed; 42. Calls on the Commission to make all efforts to agree common minimum sanctions for serious infringe\u00ad ments of IPRs; 43. Believes that harmonisation of existing national anti-counterfeiting legislation is necessary in order to ensure effective and consistent application of the future ACTA agreement; 44. Stresses the need for improved coordination within the Commission between departments dealing with combatingg counterfeiting and for better dissemination of the Community initiatives the Commission adopts in this regard, given that the fragmentation of sanction arrangements is detrimental to the internal market and weakens the European Union in its trade negotiations; stresses also that the private and public sectors should extend their cooperation to ensure that measures to combat counterfeiting are more active, dynamic and effective; 45.
