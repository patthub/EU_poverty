        "6 1. Introduction and context: what, where and why? 1.1. Understanding the selected region: key characteristics Towns from two regions of Estonia were chosen for this study: J\u00f5geva, in J\u00f5gevamaa, which is located in the middle of the country, and Kivi\u00f5li, in Ida-Virumaa, in the North- Eastern part of Estonia (see Figure 1). Both are small towns of less than 6,000 inhabitants, and are situated in poorer regions of the country. With this background in mind, an exploration will be made into mainstreaming innovation in two selected schools. Figure 1. The counties of Estonia The Estonian school system comprises of a non-compulsory kindergarten (ages 1.5-7), the compulsory basic school (years 1-9) and the non-compulsory upper secondary school, called \u201cgymnasium\u201d or \u201csecondary school\u201d (years 10-12) 1 . While gymnasiums primarily prepare students for higher education, vocational schools offer a practical alternative education for students after either basic school or gymnasium. Depending on the programme, vocational education can simultaneously offer secondary education or even be geared towards students without basic education. 2 Practical training at a workplace is also one form of vocational education. The general education is offered in primary schools (years 1-6), basic schools (years 1-9) or gymnasiums (years 10-12). However, the most common type of school in Estonia is a full-cycle gymnasium with years 1-12 where students are aged 7-19. In the period 2005-2008, Ida-Virumaa was one of the most problematic regions in the country for dropouts at years 7-10 (IVEK, 2009, 31) 3 . In 2005, 46% of the national dropouts came from Ida-Virumaa. Although the rate fell in 2008 to 27% it was still higher than the national average. In 2008, there were 36 students dropping out from the 1 See: https://www.hm.ee/et/tegevused/alus-pohi-ja-keskharidus 2 See: http://www.innove.ee/et/kutseharidus/kutseharidus-ee 3 There is a lack of current statistics on school dropouts for each county. ",
        "Ida-Virumaa county, from a national total of 131 students. However, the situation has much improved since then. Nationally, the dropout rate from basic schools was 0.5% (ca 150-200 students) in 2014 and 1.1% from gymnasiums. The highest drop-out rate in 2014 was in vocational education with 25.6% (Ministry of Education and Research, 2015, 17). In comparison, the percentage of students who did not continue their education after basic school was in 2015 slightly higher in J\u00f5gevamaa (5%) than in Ida-Virumaa (3%) (HaridusSilm, 2015). J\u00f5geva is a small town with 5,418 habitants 4 and three schools: J\u00f5geva Basic School (years 1-9), J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium (years 10-12) and the Adult Secondary School (years 8-12). J\u00f5gevamaa is not the poorest region of Estonia, but in comparison with the 15 counties, J\u00f5gevamaa county has one of the lowest average salaries in the country: 800-845 Euros gross salary per month in 2015, versus 1,185 euros in Tallinn (Statistics Estonia 2016). J\u00f5gevamaa county ranks fourth from the lowest based on the relative poverty index (31% of the population), and first based on absolute poverty (12%), with the biggest percentage of people living in deep poverty. Single parents are at the greatest poverty risk, followed by single persons, mainly elderly, and families with many children (Statistics Estonia 2014). The unemployment rate in J\u00f5gevamaa county is not high, (approximately 7%) but the participation rate in employment market is below the national average (Statistics Estonia 2016, p. 17). J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium is located close to the town centre in a recently renovated school building. It is one of the three upper secondary schools in the county and the only one that specialises in upper secondary education (forms 10-12). The school has students from other parts of the county as well as neighbouring counties. The county of J\u00f5gevamaa is certainly representative of other relatively disadvantaged regions. While the population of J\u00f5geva have income from various sources such as retailing, service and lumber industry, Kivi\u00f5li is predominantly a mining town in the North-East of Estonia, also with less than 6,000 habitants. As part of the Ida-Virumaa county, it is the most socially deprived area in Estonia. The local population are heavily dependent on the oil shale mining and chemical industry represented by three companies: Kivi\u00f5li Keemiat\u00f6\u00f6stus, Viru Keemiagrupp and Eesti Energia. Due to the low oil prices on the global market, these companies have recently laid off hundreds of workers. There is also a high concentration of people with a migrant/minority background, since 62% of the population in the county of Ida-Virumaa are not ethnic Estonians. Most of them came in from the 1960s onwards from Russia and other former USSR countries to work in Ida- Virumaa as industrial workers. The unemployment rate of Ida-Virumaa was the highest in the country at 13.3% in 2013-2015 while the average salary was at the same level as in most counties outside of the two largest towns, Tallinn and Tartu, ranging 850-919 euros per month (Statistics Estonia, 2016). Within the town limits of Kivi\u00f5li is located one of the largest artificial hills composed of the waste of oil shale processing and now being used as an adventure park, winter sports centre and motocross track. There are two schools in Kivi\u00f5li: Kivi\u00f5li Russian School (years 1-9) and the Estonian speaking Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School (years 1-12) which is a 20-minute walk from the city centre. 1.2. Getting to know selected schools for the field study: brief profile 1.2.1. School 1 - The J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium The J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium was chosen for this study because it is located in a somewhat socially disadvantaged area, and because it was recommended for its innovative practices. According to Mati Heidmets, head of the Educational Innovation Centre at Tallinn University, this school differs \u201cfrom the average school in Estonia\u201d. A recent study of school cultures conducted by Tallinn University in the spring of 2016 4 See: http://jogeva.kovtp.ee/uldinfo. ",
        "8 indicated that this school has managed to implement, by several indicators, \u201cthe changed learning and teaching paradigm\u201d as described in the Estonian Strategy of Life-long Learning (2014). These indicators include, for example, cooperation between teachers, cooperative learning of students and inclusive school leadership. Established in 2013, J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium became a new state funded upper secondary school. The establishment of a so-called \u2018pure\u2019 gymnasium for years 10-12 must be seen as a result of the gymnasium reform in Estonia. The reform aimed at creating at least one or more such schools in every county which differ from the predominant school form in Estonia (years 1-12) by offering multiple choices to students and a modern physical learning environment. In J\u00f5geva, before 2013, with a decreasing number of students at the upper secondary level there were two rivalling schools offering classes in years 1-12. Consequently, these schools could not afford many choices for students. The migration of students to bigger cities such as Tartu constituted another problem. Since the reorganisation of the school network in J\u00f5geva, there is one basic school (years 1-9) and one gymnasium (years 10-12). Many teachers from the former rivalling establishments have now been recruited by the new gymnasium. In opposition to most schools in Estonia which are co-funded by municipalities, the J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium is directly funded by the state. At the moment, this school has 207 students, 29 teachers and 8 other staff members. Based on the national graduation exams, the school usually ranks around the 30 th out of 189 schools in the country, which is a great achievement since the school cannot choose its students from a large list of candidates as some very popular schools in Tallinn and Tartu are able to. In Estonia, over 70% of basic school graduates continue their education in a gymnasium. Usually, there is some selection process based on achievement in the basic school, entrance exams and/ or interviews. J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium uses interviews instead of entrance exams, since they value more the general motivation and competences of students which are better to assess with an interview. The overall image of the school is good, according to the head teacher: \u201csurveys that show the opinion of students and teachers show that the image is good.\u201d Another indicator of the enhanced school image is that students come to this school from other counties besides J\u00f5gevamaa. In line with the school\u2019s development programme, the purpose of the school is to a) implement, in the best way, the educational goals set by the state and b) to be the best school in Estonia 5 . According to the head teacher, this means that \u201cif the students think that this is the best learning environment for them, the teachers think that this is the best environment where they can work, and the parents think that this is the best environment to which they can trust their children, then we can say that we have made the best choice for us.\u201d As stated by the head teacher, the school now has one of the best instruction systems in Estonia which has been copied by many schools. The instruction system is characterised by 75-minute long lessons, the year divided in trimesters and numerous elective subjects. As reported by the instructional leader (assistant head teacher), they already are the best school in Estonia. 1.2.2. School 2 - The Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School The Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School was chosen because it is located in one of the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in Estonia, and because the school also has many students with a migrant/minority background. Despite its difficult socioeconomic background, the school is famous for its emphasis on developing entrepreneurship. The school was recommended by a representative of the Ministry of Education and Research as a school \u201cwhich always has something interesting to say\u201d and \u201cis worth visiting\u201d. The representative of the Estonian Teacher Association also mentioned this school as a positive example of an entrepreneurial school. The history of the Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School goes back to 1932 when an Estonian elementary education class was opened in a Russian elementary school. After the WWII, 5 See: http://jogevagymn.kovtp.ee/arengukava. ",
        "the school grew into a primary and secondary school, and the Estonian school was separated from the Russian school. Since 1950 the school has been called Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School ( Kivi\u00f5li I Keskkool ) 6 . It is a public municipal school with years 1-12. The 340 students are ages 7 to 19. Although the main instruction language is Estonian, the school has some language immersion classes for students with a Russian background. In the upper secondary school, there are classes where Russian students study 60% of the subjects in Estonian and 40% in Russian. The faculty consists of 32 teachers and 3 members of school leadership along with 27 other staff members. The school even has a swimming pool. The overall performance of the school, measured by graduation exams, is average: the school ranks 100th among 187 schools according to unofficial results from 2015 (Delfi, 2016). However, according to the head teacher, obtaining a high position in ranking lists is not the priority of the school: \u201cOur goal is not to prepare the students to be the best test takers, yet at the same time emphasising other things does not interfere with achieving normal results.\u201d Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School emphasises student-centred learning, real life connections and the entrepreneurial values which involve developing courage and initiative in students to better cope with the changing environment. Since 2010, entrepreneurship is one of the cross-curricular themes in the Estonian National Curriculum (Government of Estonia, 2010a). Since 2006, the Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School has been a member of the network of entrepreneurial schools and has launched many projects which include integration of subjects, active participation of students, parents, local municipality and youth centre. The school has appointed a special entrepreneurship coordinator who is responsible for coordinating school-wide projects apart from her subject teaching responsibilities. The school leadership and coordinators plan the activities together and distribute tasks between teachers and classes while helping with the implementation. The development of entrepreneurship takes place in the form of active learning methods and extracurricular activities 7 . 2. Two perspectives on the school innovation process: what supports and what limits innovation? 2.1. The J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium 2.1.1. Presenting the innovative approaches practised in the school J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium is distinguishable by its innovative system of instruction. According to the instructional leader, the school was the first in Estonia to apply a 3 x 11- week trimester system consisting of 10 weeks regular instruction while the 11 th week is reserved for examinations. One trimester contains approximately 9-10 courses. Not all courses end with an examination, primarily the ones that have centralised exams at the end of the gymnasium. The idea is that students get used to taking examinations before the high-stakes test in the year 12. In the beginning of each trimester the schedule changes and new courses are offered. In international comparison, Estonian schools have, according to most indicators, a very high level of autonomy (OECD, 2014, p.49). These indicators include staff and salary policies, budget allocation, student admission, discipline and assessment policies as well as choosing learning materials, determining course content and deciding which courses are offered. Although a national curriculum exists, all schools are additionally required to develop their own school curricula. J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium offers a remarkable variety of elective subjects. Students choose between five general study directions: 1) sciences, with an emphasis on programming, robotics and technical drawing; 2) humanities, with an emphasis on literature and arts; 6 See: http://www.k1k.ee/ajalugu. 7 See: http://www.k1k.ee/ettev%C3%B5tlik-kool. ",
        "10 3) social studies, with an emphasis on economics, entrepreneurship, law and national defence; 4) foreign languages, including Spanish, Finnish and Chinese; and 5) natural sciences, which emphasise practical biology and chemistry. However, students may also combine electives from several directions. Some of the elective courses are offered by universities as online courses, or by teachers as regular courses. Others are of more practical nature and are offered by local institutions or community members such as kindergarten pedagogy or yoga. Kindergarten pedagogy was an elective offered in cooperation with a local kindergarten. The course involved theoretical introduction in kindergarten pedagogy and practical activities with children planned and conducted by students. According to the focus group interview at this school, one of the most popular elective courses is the \u2018national defence course\u2019 during which students practice, among other things, survival in the wilderness. Additionally, once each year, the week of elective courses allows students to pass an entire course in one week. In the school year 2016-2017, there are 68 elective courses on the list. However, only those are offered which are chosen by enough students. \u201cWe have created something that resembles a market situation where everybody has come with an elective course offer to the market and students can choose,\u201d said the instructional leader. \u201cIf you can sell your course in an attractive way then you are a hotshot!\u201d The lessons are 75 minutes long so that students can concentrate on longer units and have time to practice what they have learned already in school instead of doing it as homework. 8 With 75-minute lessons both students and teachers have less daily preparation which eases their workload. While the traditional schedule usually contains 7- 8 different lessons a day, each 45-minutes long, the block schedule of 75-minute lessons reduces the number of subjects to 5 lessons per day. So, instead of doing homework in 8 different subjects every day, students can focus on fewer subjects. The head teacher emphasised the need of easing the workload of students: \u201cWe try to keep it this way so that students could learn as much as possible in school and they don\u2019t have to study so much at home while having time for hobbies, and for resting. In addition, we give them credit for extracurricular activities as part of our instructional system so that those who are active outside of school don\u2019t get punished. Life has shown that students often find their future vocation through their hobbies.\u201d According to the instructional leader, the school has collected feedback from students for three years. One of the questions was whether students liked the 75-minute lessons and \u201calmost 100% of the students, 98 or 99% confirmed that they did.\u201d The school also offers some integrated courses. For instance, in order to take an integrated school exam in the field of culture or nature, students are required to take an integrated course in these fields which is co-designed and taught by several subject teachers. To make time for teachers to collaborate, develop the school and be engaged in professional learning, the school organises, 3-4 times a year, individual studying days where students stay at home to study and teachers meet at school. The instructional system was mainly developed by the school\u2019s instructional leader (assistant principal) in the spring of 2013, having developed his ideas regarding the improvement of the instruction system in gymnasiums during his earlier career. As a new school founded in 2013, J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium gave the school leadership a unique chance to innovate. According to the instructional leader, \u201cthe ambition to create something new was my motivation to take this job. If the school is very traditional or old, then it has developed certain habits and traditions already but when you start a new school you have the chance to develop completely new phenomena and processes\u201d. The 8 The length of the school day in Estonian schools varies, depending on the length of breaks. In J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium, there are five 75-minute lessons with 10-minute breaks and one 40- minute lunch break. The lessons start at 8.30am and are over at 3.55pm. Other gymnasiums usually start the school day at 8.00am and have up to eight 45-minute lessons per day, finishing approximately at 3.45 pm. ",
        "instructional leader was supported by the school\u2019s first head teacher who left for another position in summer 2016. The rationale behind developing the trimester system was to create a more stable learning environment. Most gymnasiums in Estonia have a modularised course system with five periods, each consisting of 35 lessons with the duration of 45 minutes. Every period is assessed with a summative mark. \u201cThe problem with the five-period system is that life is in constant change, there is change all the time. The (instructional) schedule is 6 weeks long, examinations take place in the seventh week and then there is a new schedule. This way you have 10 different schedules per year,\u201d he explained. Another reason for trimesters was that the 75-minute lessons best fit a trimester schedule. The instructional leader considered different alternatives before deciding for the length of 75- minutes per lesson concluding that the optimal length would be between 60 and 75 minutes while double lessons (90 min), which are practiced in many schools in Estonia, would be too long. The variety of elective courses in the gymnasium can be explained by the need to help students discover their interests and future vocation. According to the head teacher, \u201cthe purpose of gymnasium education is (\u2026) that students could try out lots of different possibilities so that everyone can recognise what it is they want to do in the future or the other way around, what it is they absolutely do not want to do.\u201d In 2013 the new system was introduced to the teachers in small groups in May, and in June it was discussed with all teachers. This proved to be a sensible decision according to the instructional leader: \u201cIf you have a new school, don\u2019t organise the first big meeting where teachers come together for the first time, instead discuss the ideas and innovations first in smaller groups to avoid unexpected resistance to change.\u201d Nevertheless, the teachers did not understand everything to start with: \u201cIt seems that by autumn they finally understood though it came through experience.\u201d Regarding the integrated courses, the school leadership had to apply some pressure to motivate the teachers to cooperate. For instance, the integrated culture course and school exam was designed and implemented by music, art, history and literature teachers. An equivalent course and school exam was developed by science teachers. Despite the existence of some integrated courses, they have not been mainstreamed by all teachers in school, although teachers\u2019 own initiative in this regard is appreciated and supported. The mainstreamed innovations include the schedule (the length of lessons and periods), the individual study days and the emphasis on developing a large variety of elective courses. All of these innovations were implemented within the first year of the new school. The steps leading to the adoption of these practices can be characterised as a phase of communication of the goals by the school leadership to the teachers and the learning and adjustment period of teachers. After first three years of implementing the new system, teachers must again \u201cstart filling some gaps in the content, for instance, we had some problems with assessment (focus group interview).\u201d This could possibly mean that the school is, at the moment, going through the second turn of the innovation cycle where practices are evaluated and modified if necessary. The development and implementation of the new instructional system did not require any additional resources. According to the instructional leader, Estonian schools can do anything new they want with the current funding. \u201cThe question is only whether they want to do these things, because it is very convenient for them to keep doing what they are used to do.\u201d 2.1.2. Main enablers for innovations According to the instructional leader of J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium, the main supportive factor was the newly recruited teaching staff who was motivated to implement innovations: \u201cIf there is a new school then people who apply for the job write a motivation letter where they reflect on why they want to work in this school. We did not take just anyone but took the best, because it is very important to have the right staff ",
        "12 who would be ready for change.\u201d All schools in Estonia have the freedom to select and hire their own staff. The legislation and regulations of the state did not hinder their innovations nor interfered with creating the content for the new school, according to the instructional leader. \u201cThe main virtue of the state has been the fact that it did not stick its nose where it does not belong.\u201d This indicates that Estonian schools are quite autonomous to develop pedagogical, content-related or organisational innovations because the State Curriculum (Government of Estonia, 2010b) and the Law of Basic Schools and Gymnasiums (Estonian Parliament, 2010) allow schools to develop their own curriculum based on national guidelines. One facilitator for the J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium was that the ministry did not require a fully developed curriculum from a new state gymnasium in order to get a schooling licence as is usually the requirement for new schools. According to the instructional leader, \u201cThis is complete nonsense! (\u2026) Before the school starts operating it is already supposed to hand in a complete curriculum. Where does it emerge from? (\u2026) Because a curriculum is an agreement between people who start developing the school, most importantly the pedagogical staff.\u201d However, the instructional leader pointed out that if the state would prescribe and regulate less, J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium would be an even better school: \u201c(\u2026) the state should prescribe as little as possible but what is prescribed should also be monitored as to its implementation. Unfortunately, there is a practice of wanting to prescribe many things in a very detailed way while the bigger things are not checked. (\u2026) These sentences in the law are being controlled that include numbers because they can be controlled, but the sentences without numbers which are much more important (e.g. the development of general competencies in the curriculum) are not monitored.\u201d Nevertheless, the chance to create a new school with innovative practices was given due to the gymnasium reform which was initiated by the state in order to avoid internal student migration from rural areas and small towns to bigger towns (Kirss, 2015). \u201cIt was a political decision and part of the school reform,\u201d explained a school board member who experienced the process from inside as a member of the town council (focus group interview). The state provided a newly furnished and completely renovated school building for the J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium and, by separating the gymnasium from the basic school, it ended the fruitless rivalry between the two full-cycle (years 1-12) schools in the town. From the focus group interview one member of the school board explained the situation before the new school was established: \u201cThere was a competition and rivalry between the two schools, which was not always pretty\u201d or could even get \u201cquite ugly\u201d at times, according to a teacher. Nevertheless, the people were accustomed to these schools and in the beginning, there was a strong opposition, as another teacher put it, \u201cto destroying two well-functioning schools.\u201d According to her, initially, the community expressed their fear of what would happen if teachers from two schools \u201cwho had never gotten along with each other\u201d were joined in the new school. By now, reportedly, they have grown together in \u201cone collective.\u201d One teacher from the focus group attributed the innovations mainly to the school leadership \u201cwho had the courage and the will to fight against old routines and to implement innovations which were even on the ministry level considered as pushing the boundaries\u201d. According to this teacher, \u201cAfter explaining their intentions to the ministry they could implement things that other schools did not have yet.\u201d 2.1.3. Main barriers for innovations The main difficulty for the implementation of the new instruction system, according to the instructional leader, was persuading the teachers who were reluctant to change their practices. He considered persuasion a natural part of the tasks that needed to be performed by the school leadership. There was some scepticism among the community regarding the school reform and some opposition to change, particularly among those teachers from the former schools who were not hired by the new school. They disparaged the new school in the town but over time \u201cthe counter-propaganda\u201d died because ",
        "students, teachers and parents were generally spreading positive messages. The most important task was communicating with stakeholders in order to avoid problems and barriers to innovations as explained by the instructional leader, \u201cbecause if you don\u2019t, people will start filling in the gaps with their own opinions and gossip which usually is not true.\u201d However, the teachers and a parent in the focus group represented the opinion that it is not possible to start something new if you are afraid of barriers and it is not possible to foresee and avoid all barriers. People learn from their mistakes. 2.1.4. Main achievements According to the instructional leader, the effects of the instructional system are hard to measure. Cause-effect relationships are particularly difficult to determine because other factors may have been overlooked. Nevertheless, the school witnessed within the first year of operating a considerable increase of the school ranking based on state graduation exams. The two predecessors of J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium had ranked somewhere between 120th and 140th place while the new school suddenly reached place 30. In spring 2016, Tallinn University organised a study among 38 schools in Estonia which showed that the students of J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium experienced the least problems with overload of homework. This could be contributed to the 75-minute lessons and the school\u2019s principle of getting as much work done during school hours as possible so that students do not have an excessive amount of homework. Another study conducted by the foundation Innove 9 showed that the overall satisfaction level of students with their school and teachers is well above national average. A teacher from the focus group said that this instruction system where students have to plan their schedules and choose their own curriculum has made them more active and responsible. A parent confirmed that her child and her classmates are now showing more courage to express their opinion and take responsibility. \u201cThey dare to take risks which they would have never taken before. For example, although the child has chosen the humanities as a curricular emphasis (\u2026) instead of sciences which she is afraid of, she still chooses an elective from the direction of sciences. This is an example of a subject that the child is not good at but he/she is willing to take a risk, to try and pass it and actually she is quite happy afterwards.\u201d Another example showed how a usually shy girl suddenly offered to organise a Halloween party as part of her practical project and surprised all of her teachers. 2.1.5. Sustainability of innovative practices The innovative instructional system is sustainable because students and teachers are now used to it and approve it. Additionally, the system has been adopted by other state- funded gymnasiums as well. However, the instructional leader was not sure if the school would continue with exactly the same system if a new leader replaced him fearing every leader tends to implement systems in a slightly different way. The focus group was more optimistic about the sustainability. One teacher said that the sustainability is guaranteed by flexible responses of the school to the expectations of the society. \u201cThe expectations of society and students to education are in constant change and we are able to respond to these changing expectations by offering different courses.\u201d Another teacher emphasised that the system is very flexible, which enables to implement innovations as the need arises \u201cso we can keep up with the times.\u201d 2.1.6. Monitoring, evaluation, learning loops and planning of innovative approaches J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium uses various monitoring tools while regularly collecting feedback from students, parents and teachers. For instance, every year it conducts satisfaction 9 an educational research and development centre which is funded both by the government and the private sector ",
        "14 surveys among students, teachers and parents. After an event such as the independent learning day, students were asked to evaluate the assignments, the time spent and the effect of such learning compared to regular guided learning at school. The school has recently participated in some externally administered satisfaction and well-being studies such as the study of Tallinn University and the study of the foundation Innove in 2016. So far, the evaluation results have been remarkably positive in the Estonian context 10 . Every Wednesday, the teachers and the school leadership gather to discuss current events, schedules and problems. Additionally, the independent learning days for students are used for teacher professional development and school improvement. For example, the staff has recently brainstormed about ways to improve the student appreciation system. Student holidays are also used for in-service training for teachers, according to a teacher from the focus group, and many teachers participate in online courses offered by universities. 2.1.7. Stakeholders\u2019 engagement The instruction system was mainly developed before students arrived at the school in September 2013. However, students play a major role in deciding which elective courses are opened and they can make suggestions regarding new courses. According to a student in the focus group, at the end of each year, students are asked for feedback about the elective courses and to make suggestions for the coming year. The school tries to find instructors from outside of the school if necessary, in case students are interested in particular courses. The school cooperates with local non-profit organisations. In the previous year (2016), the students had the chance to do an internship in different third sector organisations. The school has cooperated with a kindergarten that offered a course in kindergarten pedagogy where students could do practical activities with children. The course turned out to be very popular with 31 students choosing it. This year the school is offering a chance for students to do an internship in a school for handicapped students. Among people and organisations that offer elective courses are parents and universities. Since other state-funded gymnasiums have taken over many aspects of the instructional system in J\u00f5geva the schools can organise a student exchange during the week of electives, added one teacher from the focus group. According to the instructional leader, the key people in promoting innovations are schools that have actually implemented innovations, and within schools, namely teachers. \u201cIf teachers are enjoying their work and doing bright-eyed interesting things, it tends to spread to others.\u201d The school leader\u2019s role in this case is to minimise obstacles for teachers\u2019 good work and motivate them. In addition, the ministry of education and universities have a role to play: \u201cThe support of the state is certainly important, the people who want to implement reforms and school innovations on the state level could be the key people, and also universities through the people who do research in the field.\u201d 2.1.8. Mainstreaming and transferring innovations The instructional leader had developed most of the ideas while working in other schools. The idea of 75-minute lessons was not unique as other schools had experimented with different lengths of lessons. For example, Hugo Treffner Gymnasium in Tartu, where he had been working as a development director for two years already had this system. 10 The study conducted by Tallinn University (2016) compared many aspects of school culture, the changing teaching and learning paradigm and the perceived workload of teachers and students. According to this study, J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium was one of the leading schools in most aspects, having a good school climate and the least amount of perceived overload of work among students. The foundation Innove conducted in 2016 a school satisfaction survey among the students of Year 11 in Estonia regarding the satisfaction with school, teachers and relationships. According to this survey the students of J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium gave higher than average marks to satisfaction with school, teachers and general satisfaction (Innove, 2016). ",
        "However, he came up with the idea to combine 75-minute lessons with trimesters to create a week of elective courses and the independent study days based on his former experiences and readings. His idea was not to duplicate something that other schools had done, rather create something new. In some form or other this instruction system quickly spread to most state-funded gymnasiums, notable examples: Tartu Tamme, V\u00f5ru, Valga and N\u00f5o Gymnasiums. Moreover, one municipal school from the same county as J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium has taken on the trimester system. Yet the cooperation with municipal gymnasiums is impeded by the fact that many municipal schools are afraid that they cannot sustain an upper secondary school in the future due to the decreasing numbers of students, seeing the state-funded gymnasiums as competitors. According to the instructional leader, \u201cthe project of state gymnasiums is doing the administrative reform in the education sector. It would have been logical to do the administrative reform first and then every bigger and stronger municipality can create its own bigger gymnasium...but they did it backwards: first the state gymnasiums. (\u2026) This is a competition situation.\u201d The administrative reform which aims at reducing the number of local administrations and empowering the remaining ones for better service of local communities has been attempted by many Estonian governments since the 1990s. Until recently, most reform attempts have failed due to the strong opposition of local communities who fear a loss of jobs along with an increasing marginalisation as services accumulate in larger centres. Arguably, one way of quickening the reform has been the closure of smaller, unsustainable gymnasiums and concentration of educational services on upper secondary level in county centres. While the reform is still ongoing, it has provoked mixed reactions from school communities, although the mismatch between the rapidly decreasing number of school-aged children and the disproportionately large school network cannot be ignored (Kirss, 2015). It is not yet clear whether the state intends to take the entire upper secondary education under its control or will it continue to offer competition to municipal schools. However, the state gymnasiums which have been opened so far have certainly been given support for implementing innovations (expert interview with a representative of the ministry) and therefore, the gymnasium reform can be considered as an entire Estonian school system-wide factor for promoting school innovation. Other state gymnasiums got ideas from J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium because the state gymnasiums have a tight cooperation network and their leaders meet regularly. They are not competing institutions because there is generally only one of them in each county. According to the instructional leader, \u201cEvery year more state gymnasiums are created, and all of them have been success stories so far. But since we were one of the first, others have copied us.\u201d According to the instructional leader, it is possible to copy the instructional system, but the concrete application in other schools cannot be identical. What works in one school may not work in another although the main aspects of the system, trimesters and 75- minute lessons, would probably work in every school. However, the way it is done in J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium with its system of elective courses is harder to duplicate. 2.2. The Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School 2.2.1. Presenting the innovative approaches practised in the school Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School is known for promoting entrepreneurial values such as student initiative and responsibility through integrated curriculum and real-life perspective. The head teacher said that the goal was to be \u201cmore learner friendly, learner centred and connected to real life\u201d and in the future the aim is to engage the community and partners more effectively in the school work. The school has been a member of the network of entrepreneurial schools in Ida-Virumaa county since 2006, which has supported some of their projects. Currently, the school is offering a number of integrated courses such as a course that combines history, art history, literature and practical Estonian language for ",
        "16 the year 10, and is co-designed and co-taught by three different subject teachers, as explained by the head teacher and the entrepreneurship coordinator. For example, the school offered an integrated geography and mother tongue class for year 7 students, which was part of a sequence of lessons titled \u201cThe Graffiti Hunt\u201d. It was organised in the cooperation of two teachers. In the first lesson the students photographed, videoed and mapped the graffiti in the town and in the second lesson they were drawing maps of the exact location of the graffiti while using a geographical map legend. All the work was done in small groups. In the next lessons, an orientation game was planned in the town and the sequence was supposed to end with the presentation of each groups\u2019 work in the form of a photo or video session during which students also had to analyse experiences of their group work. In another lesson, which integrated social studies with geography, year 9 students were preparing for a guest lecture about the Estonian dairy industry by finding relevant information on the Internet. Students were organised into groups and had the freedom to work anywhere within the school that they preferred, for instance in the library, in the classroom and in the computer class. Two teachers were walking from one group to another offering guidance where necessary. In the second half of the lesson the groups presented their information on posters. According to the head teacher, the school\u2019s next big goal is to become a community school that involves the community more actively in school\u2019s events and practices. The first steps towards this goal have been taken. In the spring the school organised a day of caf\u00e9s in the town\u2019s apple garden where all community members, citizens and town\u2019s institutions could visit. Since the event was very popular the school plans to continue this tradition outside of school in a way that integrates the preparation process more with the learning outcomes of the curriculum. According to the head teacher, the trigger for change for the Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School was the educational programme \u201centrepreneurial school\u201d, coordinated by the Entrepreneurship Centre of Ida-Virumaa county. It \u201chelped to phrase what we wanted to do and gave a direction how to systematically organise it.\u201d In 2006, the head teacher had the chance to visit an entrepreneurial school in Scotland which gave her some new ideas. The initiators of applying the principles of entrepreneurial schools were the school leadership and a group of interested teachers. According to the instructional leader, the first teachers involved were the primary school teachers because they spend a lot of time with their class. The head teacher explained, what started as a mainly project-based activity involving only interested teachers has developed, step-by step, and reached new people. A problem that the entrepreneurial school is trying to solve was first phrased by employers about ten years ago. According to them, schools were preparing people who were good at obeying orders but reluctant to think for themselves, lacking social skills and courage to use their own creativity. The head teacher opined that schools were \u201cpreparing excellent quiz players who could not manage their own lives.\u201d The school was able to get some financial support from the Entrepreneurship Centre of Ida-Virumaa to buy equipment for their projects such as a photo camera and a colour printer. In addition, the local municipality helped to pay the participation fee in the network of entrepreneurial schools. The membership has enabled the teachers to visit other entrepreneurial schools in Finland, Sweden and Latvia in order to get acquainted with the system elsewhere, according to the head teacher. Another important source of support has been the programme \u201cNoored kooli\u201d [Young people to school], a third sector initiative which promotes a modern learner-centred paradigm to teaching, encouraging and preparing university graduates from different fields to teach in public schools. Over the years, the school has had many young, enthusiastic teachers from this programme contributing to active learning methods with integration of subjects. Here, an integrated curriculum is where the main organising principle for content is the interdisciplinary theme or project instead of the traditional school subject. The mainstreaming within the school, according to the instructional leader, has not been easy taking about ten years to adopt the new student-centred entrepreneurial practices. ",
        "\u201cI guess we wanted to achieve it too fast so that everybody would join but as it happens leading people is not a quick process that leads to a quick result.\u201d It started step-by step: at first, teachers were required to plan one or two school wide major entrepreneurial events or experiences per year, later redefining the events to a smaller scale, making them an almost daily practice. Even now the head teacher could not say that everybody in school is 100% supporting and practicing its principles but at least there is no opposition any more. 2.2.2. Main enablers for innovations The main facilitators of the process to become an entrepreneurial school were, according to the headmaster, pressure from outside to change and the wish and will of people to do something differently. The entrepreneurship coordinator agreed: \u201cI think the most important factor are the people who are interested. If they are interested, they will find the will and the time.\u201d Another important factor was support (both know-how and material support) with encouragement from the Entrepreneurship Centre of Ida-Virumaa county. The latter is a foundation that initiated the education programme \u201cEntrepreneurial school\u201d and is also supporting other schools in the area. The legal framework did not impede the innovation; however, it is not noticed much unless it becomes an obstacle. For instance, for the next innovation that the school is planning (starting a school business) it needs legal advice. According to the instructional leader, a big step forward happened in mainstreaming the innovation when the young teachers from the programme \u201cNoored kooli\u201d (\u201cYoung people to school\u201d) arrived, bringing new blood and fresh ideas. The entrepreneurship coordinator said that their school stands out by the lower average age of teachers in a national comparison: \u201cI think there needs to be a critical mass of younger teachers who tend to join innovations more easily\u2026. The challenge is to come out of your comfort zone.\u201d 2.2.3. Main barriers for innovations According to the head teacher, the main barrier that the school encountered was fear of the unknown by teachers along with the worry that they would not cover all the topics prescribed in the curriculum if they dedicated too much time to project-based, entrepreneurial learning. The instructional leader had to explain to the teachers, \u201cYou can cover the curriculum through integrated learning. You don\u2019t have to cover the programme for the sake of the programme but it\u2019s the life skills that matter and the connections that students can create between bits of knowledge when they leave school.\u201d Another problem was the lack of skills and know-how. Initially, the head teacher thought that lack of money was a problem, but now she has realised that very few innovations fail due to lack of money. The main obstacle is usually mindset. The head teacher said that it is possible to foresee some of the problems. In hindsight, she thinks that she could have dedicated more effort to managing fears and equipping the teachers with the necessary tools, though lack of tools forced the teachers to be creative. \u201cYou just have to talk to the people and manage their fears,\u201d said the instructional leader. It would have been easier to introduce innovations in the context of a new school that can choose its team rather than changing something \u201cif you have to work with the people you have,\u201d said the head teacher. One problem in the beginning was that, according to the instructional leader, \u201cWe understood ourselves what entrepreneurship was but we could not define it and sell it to the others.\u201d 2.2.4. Main achievements According to the head teacher, the most visible change during the last five years is there have been no basic school drop-outs. The head teacher has noticed that students show more enthusiasm, joy of learning and demonstrate a greater desire to participate in decision-making in school. For example, the students suggested that none of the elective ",
        "18 courses in upper secondary schools should be numerically graded. Based on the feedback from the graduates, the head teacher said that their students show more initiative, courage and better cooperation skills than some of their university mates. The indirect effects include a tighter cooperation between the institutions and businesses in the area and the school. The head teacher said the local centre for adventure tourism and a local museum have approached the school with the request to help design educational programmes that would interest students. The change in student\u2019s behaviour was certainly intended as part of achieving the general competences listed in the state curriculum. Furthermore, the school aims at a tighter cooperation between the community and the school even though there is still room for improvement in engaging the community included the head teacher The instructional leader had already noticed positive changes in the students\u2019 attitudes after the first year of being in the programme of entrepreneurial schools, developing a tighter cooperation with parents and implementing more real-life perspective on learning. She described two projects that she did with her students: one about the professions of the parents, another involved opening a bookshop at the school. During the latter students from the Year Four wrote to a bookshop in Rakvere and asked if they could come to see how a \u201creal bookshop\u201d operates. After taking a trip to the bookshop they tried to copy its operation in school, they developed and designed their own currency, divided the roles and played running a bookshop in school. The instructional leader explained, \u201cWhen at first I had to plan and prescribe myself class evenings and field trips (\u2026) then in spring I understood that a change had taken place. I noticed it by small changes, when one child decided that he wanted to write a book. It had a gazillion spelling mistakes but it was the first time in my practice that a Year Three pupil wanted to write a book. He authored about five short, exciting, child-like fantasy stories which he bound in a book himself. Additionally, children started offering ideas for extracurricular class evenings.\u201d Another time students took the initiative when a printing problem caused a delay in the mathematics competition and the guests and students were left alone in the great hall. When teachers returned with the printed diplomas some 10 minutes later they were surprised to see that students had solved the problem of waiting on their own with organising a game for the guests. When they are compared to students from other schools, students from Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School are more open to expression while having more initiative. The differences are particularly noticeable in Russian students who come to the gymnasium from a Russian basic school. It takes them a couple of years to fit in the new culture. \u201cThis is a problem,\u201d said the instructional leader. The Russian parents noticed the difference from the old school where their children were always given exact instructions on what to do and when to do it. Here, they had to take responsibility themselves, including time management. 2.2.5. Sustainability of innovative practices All interviewees said that the changes in the teaching and learning paradigm that are represented by the entrepreneurial school are sustainable. They have become a normal part of the teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 everyday experience. \u201cI could not even imagine life differently anymore, \u201csaid the instructional leader. Apparently, these things are not yet mainstreamed in all schools. Last year, a school delegation that visited Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School was very impressed by their open-door policy and the way the students were open, were used to working in groups and analysing their work. \u201cIt was a surprise for me. I could not understand what they found so special because it is so normal to me, this is how things should be,\u201d explained the instructional leader. The head teacher noted that for some people these innovations really have become a normal part of life, but there are others for whom it is \u201cstill so-so, that they would do it but rather as a game for a change, usually they would take a more traditional path.\u201d The entrepreneurship coordinator related that it is not possible to turn back the clock once the students have gotten a taste of the new practices. The students often start putting ",
        "pressure on more conservative teachers, \u201cWhy are we not doing what class X is doing?\u201d The teachers who are used to working with active learning methods think that working with a textbook and a PowerPoint presentation is not exciting enough, so going back to \u201csitting in straight rows and being silent would be unthinkable.\u201d 2.2.6. Monitoring, evaluation, learning loops and planning of innovative approaches The head teacher stated that the school conducts self-evaluation every three years that is based on the entrepreneurship standard developed by the network of entrepreneurial schools. There are three levels of the standard: basic, silver and gold. At the moment, the school has reached the silver standard and is striving for the gold standard in the next evaluation. The school also collects feedback from parents, students and teachers. However, so far they have not been very satisfied with the quantitative data. Therefore, in the future, the head teacher plans to collect more qualitative data that include questions such as \u201cdescribe\u201d or \u201cbring examples\u201d to better understand the expectations and needs of the parents and students. The school has been piloting the 360\u00b0 feedback system to teachers that includes peer- review. The school applies the open-door policy which means that if a teacher has left the classroom door open, anyone can come and visit. In August, before the school starts, teachers and the school leadership gather to set goals for the coming year and to analyse the developments of the last year. To boost learning, professional development and formulate new ideas, teachers have the chance to shadow a colleague in another school. \u201cOf course, this is a chance for the teacher not to be encapsulated in one environment only, especially after having worked for some years but to keep an open eye to what is happening elsewhere even if it means that it is something that I would never do,\u201d said the head teacher. For example, the entrepreneurship coordinator has recently written a project and received some funding for some teachers\u2019 professional shadowing trip to Greece and the Canary Islands while the instructional leader recently visited a school in Luxembourg. Most shadowing trips take place in Estonia and last for a day although teachers are not limited just being a shadow of another teacher. The head teacher explained that new ideas \u201ctrickle down\u201d from one person to another. If somebody sees or hears something, they discuss it with the colleagues and sometimes it will be put into action. However, it is a more spontaneous activity because life has shown that long plans are almost always subject to change. 2.2.7. Stakeholders\u2019 engagement The head teacher and instructional leader ensured that the school has actively tried to involve parents in different projects (e.g. the caf\u00e9 projects and the film festival) and invite guests to events such as \u201cThe night of scientists\u201d in October, where 24 different guests appeared as teachers before students. Among them were famous artists and fashion designers. The programme \u201cBack to school\u201d has been a useful resource in bringing people with various professions and experiences to school for as guest teachers. During the last parent meeting, a small initiative group was formed among parents who wish to contribute more actively to school development. At the moment, the school is cooperating with Tallinn University in developing the school\u2019s community work. Further, the school has cooperated with a vocational education centre in Ida-Virumaa county where students had the chance to participate in a practical cooking lesson. For an IT topic, the students visited the College of Technology in Ida-Virumaa. They have also been able to take several field trips to the nature thanks to the projects funded by the Environmental Investment Centre. The head teacher emphasised that the key role in mainstreaming innovation is currently held by the initiative \u201cInteresting school\u201d which was initiated by the Ministry of Education and Research. It is a blog where schools and \u201ceducation friends\u201d can share their best practices and ideas. Additionally, the network of entrepreneurial schools spreads ",
        "20 information about innovative approaches. Meanwhile, the Estonian teachers\u2019 newspaper \u201c\u00d5petajate Leht\u201d has lately started showing more interest in writing about innovative schools like Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School. \u201cWe were featured in the newspaper with our curriculum integration,\u201d noted the entrepreneurship coordinator. The network of language immersion schools also includes schools that are examples for others. Moreover, the Educational Innovation Centre at Tallinn University and the Ministry of Education and Research were mentioned by the instructional leader among the key organisations in mainstreaming innovation. Within the school, leadership and teachers play the key role. The example of the Kivi\u00f5li school proves that innovations need strong support and leadership by school and teacher leaders who motivate and guide others. One way to spread awareness of the innovative practices by the school is to organise open door days for prospective students in the region who will continue to spread the word. In light of the self-determination theory (Vansteenkiste & Ryan, 2013), innovations tend to be reinforced by students if they accommodate students\u2019 basic needs, such as autonomy, belonging and competence. This was the case in Kivi\u00f5li where the school developed entrepreneurial values that emphasised these same basic needs. 2.2.8. Mainstreaming and transferring innovations The instructional leader (deputy head teacher) remembers the beginning of the entrepreneurial school programme as follows: \u201cIn 2006, our head teacher was invited by the Entrepreneurship Centre of Ida-Virumaa county to join an educational trip to Scotland to visit an entrepreneurial school. She saw how it worked and told us about it. (\u2026) The head teacher asked who would be interested in dealing with it. I took a day to think it over and went to her next day saying that I was interested but I did not know what to do.\u201d Soon, it became possible for the instructional leader, who was at the time a primary school teacher, to visit an entrepreneurial school in Scotland, where she got an idea of what entrepreneurship actually was. This first impulse came through the Entrepreneurship Centre from a school in Scotland. It quickly became evident that everybody had a different idea of what entrepreneurship was and it was clear that teachers needed some training. The training was provided by the Entrepreneurship Centre which some of the teachers attended and passed on their knowledge to the colleagues. Initially, the problem was that, according to the instructional leader, teachers operated independently without much cooperation since they felt that they were competing with each other. The entrepreneurship coordinator stated that the network of entrepreneurial schools which started as the initiative of the Entrepreneurship Centre in Ida-Virumaa county has spread over the entire country in the past few years. Now the school has gained a reputation for being a successful implementer of the integrated curriculum, active learning methods and real-life perspective on learning so that they often receive guests from other schools who want to observe their practices. According to the head teacher, 14 delegations from different schools and counties visited them in the last year. This year, a delegation of instructional leaders from Harjumaa county plans a visit to observe the school\u2019s practice of integrating subjects. According to the instructional leader, the school has also given workshops for other schools about integrated curriculum in cooperation with Tallinn University, the network of \u201cInteresting school\u201d and during the Education festival. The mainstreaming to other schools has taken place through the network of entrepreneurial schools along with personal contacts. Although the network of head teachers shares some practices, the mainstreaming from school to school through networking is impeded by the competition between schools. The head teacher thinks that there is still a lot of room for improvement in sharing practices. Another system level factor for mainstreaming innovations to other schools has been the initiative \u201cInteresting school\u201d which was created by the ministry and some enthusiasts of school innovation. Additionally, the network of language immersion schools to which Kivi\u00f5li school belongs and the financial support of the municipality have been helpful. ",
        "Concerning the transferability of the practices of the entrepreneurial schools, the head teacher said that all of them are possible to implement elsewhere. It only depends on what we value. 3. Innovation in schools: lessons learned and policy pointers 3.1. Understanding the barriers: what hinders the school innovation process? The schools mentioned, as the most important barrier to innovation, people\u2019s reluctance to change, \u201cleaving their comfort zone\u201d and fear of the unknown which can be exacerbated through poor communication. According to the school leaders, talking to the people, persuading them and managing their fears are the most important activities to avoid these barriers. The key word \u201cfear\u201d was repeatedly mentioned by the focus groups as well. Allowing time to get used to new ideas and offering support and training for implementing new practices were also considered as important factors by the school leaders. One school implemented innovations quicker than the other because it was a new school with fresh and motivated staff. In the other school it took almost 10 years to pull along the last sceptics among the staff. The head teachers expressed the opinion that innovations are usually not impeded by lack of money. The hardest factor to change is people\u2019s mindset and their values. In this respect, the policy makers agreed with the schools that one of the biggest obstacles can be the \u201cattitudes, values and habits\u201d of the people including teachers, parents and the educational authorities in the municipalities. According to the representative of the ministry, school providers usually expect from school \u201cwhat they have experienced themselves as students.\u201d In particular, parents can oppose change and demand that schools operate the same way as they did before. The ministry sometimes gets phone calls from parents who are confused by the changing learning paradigm. \u201c\u2019There is no learning taking place in schools. All they do is hanging around in museums and outside. The ministry has to set it right!\u2019 And then I have to explain to them for 45 minutes that this is learning.\u201d Yet, parents can also demand change and pressure schools into implementing innovations. However, unlike the schools in the case study, the school board of the local municipality mentioned as an impeding factor the shortage of resources in terms of financial and human resources. As an example, there is a shortage of media specialists in the city of Tartu. The lack of financial resources was mentioned as a possible obstacle by the representative of the ministry. Another factor that can impede innovation is, according to the representatives of the local municipality, the very crowded curriculum and fixation on standardised tests: \u201cMaybe schools don\u2019t have enough freedom (\u2026). Even though schools are told to be creative, if they are and there is some kind of trouble afterwards\u2026then there is a big problem.\u201d Moreover, according to interviewees, there could be less bureaucracy. The local municipality was critical about the government institutions which offer funding for innovative educational projects in terms of their timing. For local municipalities, the accountability measures for European funding for projects are way too complicated requiring too much time and energy. They were also critical about the lack of sustainability in education policy: \u201cWhen a new minister comes everything is changed around again. This is something that shocks the schools every now and then.\u201d The insecurity for municipalities concerns for instance the gymnasium education which the state has promised to take under its control. ",
        "22 3.2. Spotting the supporters: what facilitates the school innovation process? According to the school leaders, the most important factor for change are people who are motivated and willing to change by trying something new. The teachers added the keyword \u201cinterested\u201d in new developments. The easiest way to ensure cooperation would be hiring motivated and able people as was the case with the new school. However, change is more difficult but not impossible if the school is older and has a certain habitus . Persuading people takes time and bigger steps forward take place when \u201cnew blood\u201d comes to school as with new teachers. For teachers, the school leadership plays an important role in introducing and supporting change. \u201cSupport\u201d was another keyword used by school leaders which can take different forms. For school 1, support by the ministry meant having free hands to realise their own ideas. For school 2 support translated into guidance, training and financial support by the local Entrepreneurship Centre and the local municipality. Also, young teachers from the programme \u201cYoung people to school\u201d turned out to be very helpful in mainstreaming innovation. It seems that the age of the teachers matters, according to one teacher, younger people are more open to change. Another motivator for change can be from outside societal pressure such as changing expectations to schools, said a head teacher. Both the representatives of the local municipality and the ministry agreed that the attitudes and the enthusiasm of the people (teachers, school leaders, parents and town boards of education) is one of the key factors in facilitating innovations. According to teachers from a focus group, innovations are supported by teacher autonomy which allows teachers to flexibly implement new ideas and react, for instance, to current events. This view was supported by the local municipality who also mentioned leeway in the curriculum as an important factor for innovation. Additionally, the local municipality of Tartu has noticed that schools have started hiring development directors, which indicates that they are putting more emphasis on school development which has been supported by the school governors, \u201cThe schools have started to look further ahead. They don\u2019t just think of what is happening today in school but where will we be in some years and what are our goals.\u201d The ministry representative added that the educational initiative \u201cInteresting school\u201d was a facilitator. The initiative is supported by the ministry which sets the broad direction, however ideas come from schools and community members. Moreover, the need to make the legislation more flexible in order not to hinder flexible solutions was mentioned in the ministry. Nevertheless, policy-makers and schools differed in their view on how important financial resources were for innovation. While schools expressed the view that most innovations are not hindered by lack of resources, policy-makers emphasised lack of money as a constraint. Although the representative of the ministry admitted that sometimes a shortage of financial resources forces schools to be more creative and plan their expenses more carefully. She brought the example of a small Russian-speaking school in the south of Estonia which had participated in a competition on the use of digital technologies in school organised by Samsung. The school happened to win the competition and as a result the whole school was equipped with the latest technology which they continue using in a creative way. 3.3. Reflecting on the transferability of school innovations into the local contexts and their sustainability The transfer of the innovations of both schools to other schools has already taken place to different extents. The instructional system of school 1 has been transferred, in its main features, to many state-funded gymnasiums such as P\u00f5lva, Viljandi, Hiiumaa and Haapsalu gymnasiums. According to the school leaders, it is possible to copy the instructional system. Nevertheless, the teachers from the focus group thought that the exact application of the system of electives with the same courses as in J\u00f5gevamaa gymnasium would be very difficult since much depends on the personal contacts and ",
        "negotiation skills of the school leadership and the available resources. In the second case, the principles of an entrepreneurial school have been applied by other schools in the region and during the last years the network of entrepreneurial schools has spread country-wide. The ministry representative agreed with the teachers from the focus group that elements of school culture are absolutely possible to transfer from one context to another. \u201cHuman attitude, trust, kindness and flexibility \u2013 these are most important,\u201d noted the teachers. \u201cIf we can do it in Kivi\u00f5li in a bilingual school, then anybody can do it.\u201d Another factor of transferability mentioned by the ministry representative was the school leadership, in the large sense of \u201cleadership culture and main principles, for example, engagement of parents, community and the third sector.\u201d The school leaders and the ministry representative mentioned the networking of schools on different levels, on the level of school leadership (school leaders\u2019 associations) and teachers (teachers\u2019 subject associations and work shadowing) as a way of transferring innovations. The municipality added to networking of school events that are organised by municipalities such as \u201cThe Education Festival\u201d in Tartu. Municipalities can learn from each other, \u201cWe have made presentations to other municipalities about our innovative projects such as ARNO (an electronic kindergarten information system for distributing kindergarten places).\u201d There were no major disagreements between the schools and policy-makers as to the transferability of innovations. However, policy makers added some new aspects. The municipality people said that the IT solutions that they have developed in the city of Tartu might be harder to transfer to other countries in Europe. \u201cThey have to start with acquiring the electronically readable ID cards.\u201d The municipality emphasised that innovations can spread even to other countries through \u201cfriendship schools.\u201d One school from Tartu (Raatuse Gymnasium) had offered to their students, during two project days, almost 100 different workshops from which to choose. After a visit the idea was copied by their friendship school in Lithuania. During the project days the students composed their own schedules experiencing out of the ordinary lessons such as learning math through crossword puzzles or building musical instruments. Since both innovations in the studied schools overlap in their main features with the \u201cEstonian Lifelong Learning Strategy 2020\u201d regarding the changing learning paradigm, the changes were considered sustainable by both schools. \u201cWe are adjusting to the changing expectations of the society,\u201d said one participant in a focus group. This was reflected by one policy-maker who affirmed, \u201cEducation has no choice. It has to adapt to the changes in the wide world.\u201d Consequently, the factors that most support sustainability of innovations are the perceived need and pressure from the external environment. 3.4. Policy pointers \uf0a7 Policy pointer 1: school autonomy: As the instructional leader of J\u00f5gevamaa Gymnasium noted, \u201cIf the state would prescribe less we would have an even better school.\u201d This indicates that too precise regulations in educational legislation and the curriculum can be an obstacle for developing innovative content, pedagogies and organisational practices. It is important that teachers and school leaders take ownership of their innovations, therefore schools need to have autonomy. This is also backed up by research, according to the OECD PISA studies (2006), school autonomy mixed with accountability contributes to better educational outcomes. However, the policy makers noted that Estonian schools have already a great extent of autonomy which has led to eclectic developments since autonomy is not always used for innovations. To what extent school autonomy is used for developing innovative solutions depends on the school leaders. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 2: flexible legislation: \u201cOn system level, our holy duty is to create legislation that supports, not impedes, the implementation of educational ",
        "24 innovation in schools,\u201d emphasised the representative from the ministry. The education laws need to be regularly reviewed and even changed because sometimes schools develop faster than the laws allow. She exemplified this need by the following case of a too specific law: Currently, the Estonian Law on Basic Schools and Gymnasiums (2010) states that the school year begins September 1st. Should this day fall on a weekend the school starts on the following Monday. However, many schools have wanted to start the school year on a Monday preceding the first of September if it falls in the middle of the week. According to the current legislation they would be breaking the law. Another example about too rigid legislation was given during the workshop by the schools. It concerns the assessment practices. Currently, the legislation requires that all school subjects have to be assessed in a summative way at the end of the Basic School. Yet, many schools would like to implement in some subjects the grading scale \u201cpassed/not passed\u201d. These examples prove that laws should allow some flexibility and room for interpretation. If laws fail to do so schools should be at least allowed to request amendments to the law. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 3: coordination of the information about research, development work, conferences, workshops and networks on school innovation. The participants of the workshop noted that currently there are too many competing activities that happen simultaneously. \u201cThe problem is the fragmentation of initiatives,\u201d explained one group of teachers, school leaders and NGO representatives. Another group that involved researchers and policy makers added that different state institutions such as ministries do not effectively cooperate with each other. What is needed is a coordination of information about different activities. Additionally, one activity could serve as an input for the other: for instance, research and development could inform teacher education and innovation initiatives. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 4: Media coverage of best practices: \u201cThe key persons for mainstreaming innovations are those connected with the practice: innovatively thinking school leaders and teachers. If they would succeed to raise the media\u2019s interest who would give it some echo then this could contribute to mainstreaming innovation,\u201d added one policy maker. Apparently, there is a need for schools to market their innovations to a wider audience and become more visible on the education landscape. Further, the educational authorities and universities could help by collecting best cases and presenting them in their publications and professional development workshops. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 5: Supporting the networking of schools and teachers: the Ministry of Education and Research funded teacher networks that involved teachers from different subject associations and suggested some topics that promote educational innovations. Instead of financially supporting any networks, those should be given priority which promote innovations that are in line with national education strategies. An idea offered by researchers and policy makers during the workshop was to establish exchange programmes for teachers and school leaders analogously to the student exchange programme \u201cVeni, vidi, vici\u201d which allows them to spend a week or two in another school in Estonia. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 6: Developing master teachers who would contribute to educational innovations: the representative of the Teachers\u2019 Association said: \u201cWe would like to change the attitude towards teachers in the society by giving the master teachers the opportunity to contribute to education and to develop themselves, to give those who have achieved the rank of \u201cmaster teachers\u201d opportunities on the state level to expand their own knowledge, to create a network to learn from each other\u201d. These teachers would have the mission to be mentors for other younger or less experienced teachers. However, the workshop participants added that development work needs to be compensated accordingly and time needs to be freed for the master teachers to do it. They suggested that master teachers could ",
        "either work part-time as developers and teachers or take off a year from teaching for development work and learning. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 7 : addressing the needs of teacher continuous professional development: The policy should not be targeted at the teachers as objects, rather it should be a reciprocal relationship explained by the representative of the Teachers\u2019 Association. As could be learned from Kivi\u00f5li I Secondary School, the providers of teachers\u2019 in-service education can also be local NGOs such as the Entrepreneurship Centre of Ida-Virumaa. Having autonomy is not simply enough; schools need guidance, training and support. Field trips to innovative schools abroad can be used as an additional motivation for undertaking change. Another resource that is becoming more popular are visits of other schools either as a group of teachers with the school leadership or as work shadowing trips to individual teachers, school leaders or representatives of other institutions. Moreover, teachers and school leaders should be better informed about alternative in-service education programmes for teachers that universities are currently offering, such as coaching of school development teams. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 8: sustainable policy environment: The need was primarily expressed by the local municipality to avoid \u201cshocking the schools after every election\u201d but it also reflects the needs of schools to develop long-term educational strategies. Following through on these long-term strategies by providing stable funding even after governments change should be a national priority. At the moment, Estonian municipalities are experiencing insecurity regarding the future of upper secondary schools. The state has not clearly revealed its plans for the gymnasium network or the role of local municipalities in providing gymnasium education. Another obstacle to sustainable development are the short-term projects. This concerns particularly the EU funded projects. Schools often apply for grant money without any long-term vision and drop the development as soon as the project runs out. It would be better if funding would be directed towards long-term development. In this case, less is more: less projects which last longer and allow for more systemic and sustainable developments. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 9: reducing bureaucratic accountability: Both schools and local municipalities suffer from excessive bureaucratic accountability. For schools, it is the \u201caccountability by numbers\u201d that is most frequently perceived as a distracting, time-consuming, bureaucratic endeavour while the most important goals in the national curriculum such as \u201cdeveloping general competencies\u201d are not emphasised enough. Although enriching educational opportunities are provided by the initiatives and projects funded by the EU the amount of excessive paperwork involved in applying for the funding is perceived both by schools and municipalities as unreasonable: \u201cOften, the content and the requirements to the form of project applications are not balanced, \u201cexplained one school leader. The bureaucratic accountability should be reduced to a necessary minimum. \uf0a7 Policy pointer 10: curriculum and assessment guidance by the state. The schools that participated in the workshop suggested that the state could simplify the work of teachers by pointing out the overlaps between different subject syllabi in the national curriculum which could be effectively taught in integration and cooperation between different subject teachers. \u201cThe teachers should not have to reinvent the wheel,\u201d added one teacher. The topics suitable for integration could be provided centrally. Additionally, the assessment system must be reformed because the numerical assessment of students on a scale of five where only the marks 3-5 are positive is neither sufficient nor informative enough. One school leader offered that all subjects could have centrally provided descriptions of competence levels which would provide teachers with assessment tools and students with more informative feedback to their achievements. An example could be the competence levels in the European Common Framework of ",
        "26 Languages which has six levels. The developers of such assessment tool could be master teachers. ",

In the past we had bigger projects during which activities were integrated with different lessons and something more grandiose was created. In the last years I think it is more giving responsibility to the students themselves so that they can organise school events and take more responsibility also for organising their own studying.\u201d For a student entrepreneurship means \u201cyes, taking initiative ",
        "32 yourself, it does not have to have necessarily anything to do with school, and improving something, this is for me at the moment entrepreneurial school.\u201d Another student confirmed: \u201cI have gotten through the projects an experience about responsibility and leadership and also self-reflection: what went wrong, what could we do better the next time. Also teamwork is something that goes along with the projects and the success experience. Once you have achieved something big you are more motivated to repeat it.\u201d The problem that the entrepreneurial school was trying to solve was explained by a teacher as: \u201ceducating active citizens who would be involved, who would think along, would be interested in what is happening, the life, who would not expect that everything is taken care of by somebody else and who would do something if they see that something is wrong.\u201d Mainstreaming the practices of an entrepreneurial school has been a very long process, it has taken approximately 10 years until the last opponents gave up. One teacher said: \u201cIt is clear that every collective has people who don\u2019t like changes but even they don\u2019t say anything anymore.

While schools believed that the autonomy could be larger, particularly in the area of subject syllabi, the policy makers noted that Estonian schools already have a lot of autonomy. Whether the autonomy is used for implementing innovative practices depends on the school leaders whose capacity varies greatly. \u201cWhere there is a strong school leader, things are well, but where not, there are problems,\u201d commented a representor of a municipality. Other differences concerned the concept and scale of innovation. The schools were trying to find practical solutions to questions of assessment, teacher education, development work of teachers and sustainability of innovations. Whereas the people involved in research and policy making emphasised the need of looking at innovations broader than just applying new methods. According to them, attention should be paid to global developments such as \u201cwhat does it mean for education that we now live in a post-truth society.\u201d However, the main conclusion made both by schools, policy makers, research institutions and NGOs was that the isolated efforts of promoting educational innovation (teacher education and school development programmes, research, conferences, projects and initiatives) should be better coordinated and information about them should be gathered and published centrally. Also, more attention should be paid to the sustainability of the innovations. ",
