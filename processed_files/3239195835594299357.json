",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 7 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (3) The goal of a resilient Energy Union with an ambitious climate policy at its core is to give Union consumers, including households and businesses, secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy, and to foster research and innovation by means of attracting investment, which requires a fundamental transformation of Europe's energy system. Such a transformation is also closely linked to the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to promote the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, in particular through the promotion of energy efficiency and energy savings and the development of new and renewable forms of energy. That goal can be achieved only through coordinated action, combining both legislative and non-legislative acts at Union , regional, national and local level. (4) A fully functional and resilient Energy Union would convert the Union into a leading region for innovation, investment, growth and social and economic development, in turn providing a good example of how pursuing high ambitions in terms of climate change mitigation is intertwined with measures to foster innovation, investment and growth. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 8 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (5) Parallel to this Regulation, the Commission has developed and adopted a series of initiatives in sectoral energy policy, in particular with regard to renewable energy, energy efficiency, including on the energy performance of buildings, and market design. Those initiatives form a package under the overarching theme of energy efficiency first, the Union's global leadership in renewables, and a fair deal for energy consumers , including by addressing energy poverty and promoting fair competition in the internal market . (6) In its conclusions of 23 and 24 October 2014, the European Council endorsed a 2030 Framework for Energy and Climate for the Union based on four key Union-level targets: a reduction of at least 40 % in economy-wide greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions, an indicative target of improvement in energy efficiency of at least 27 % , to be reviewed by 2020 with a view to increasing the level to 30 %, a share of renewable energy consumed in the Union of at least 27 %, and electricity interconnection of at least 15 %. It specified that the target for renewable energy is binding at Union level and that it will be fulfilled through Member States' contributions guided by the need to deliver collectively the Union target. A recast of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 has introduced a new, binding, renewable energy target for the Union for 2030 of at least 32 %, including a provision for a review with a view to increasing the Union-level target by 2023. Amendments to Directive 2012/27/ EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 have set the Union-level target for improvements in energy efficiency in 2030 to at least 32,5 %, including a provision for a review with a view to increasing the Union-level targets. 9 Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 16). 10 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1). ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 9 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (7) The binding target of at least a 40 % domestic reduction in economy-wide GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 was formally approved as the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the Union and its Member States to the Paris Agreement at the Environment Council meeting on 6 March 2015. The Paris Agreement was ratified by the Union on 5 October 2016 11 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. It replaces the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which was approved by the Union by Council Decision 2002/358/EC 12 and which will not be continued beyond 2020. The Union's system for monitoring and reporting emissions and removals should be updated accordingly. (8) The Paris Agreement increased the level of global ambition on climate change mitigation and sets out a long-term goal in line with the objective to keep the global average temperature increase to well below 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. 11 Council Decision (EU) 2016/1841 of 5 October 2016 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (OJ L 282, 19.10.2016, p. 1). 12 Council Decision 2002/358/EC of 25 April 2002 concerning the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder (OJ L 130, 15.05.2002, p.1). ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 10 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (9) In pursuit of the temperature goals in the Paris Agreement, the Union should aim to achieve a balance between anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks as early as possible and, as appropriate, achieve negative emissions thereafter. (10) For the climate system the cumulative total anthropogenic emissions over time are relevant for the total concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere. Various scenarios for the Union\u2019s contr ibution to long-term objectives, inter alia a scenario on achieving net zero GHG emissions in the Union by 2050 and negative emissions thereafter, and the implications of those scenarios on the remaining global and Union carbon budget should be analysed by the Commission . The Commission should prepare an analysis for the purposes of a long-term Union strategy for the Union's contribution to the commitments of the Paris Agreement of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, including various scenarios, inter alia a scenario on achieving net zero GHG emissions within the Union by 2050 and negative emissions thereafter and their implications on the global and Union carbon budget. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 11 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (11) Although the Union pledged to deliver ambitious cuts in GHG emissions by 2030, the threat of climate change is a global issue. The Union and its Member States should therefore work with their international partners in order to ensure a high level of ambition by all Parties in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. (12) In its conclusions of 23 and 24 October 2014, the European Council also agreed that a reliable and transparent governance mechanism without any unnecessary administrative burden and with sufficient flexibility for Member States should be developed to help ensure that the Union meets its energy policy goals, while fully respecting Member States' freedom to determine their energy mix. It emphasised that such a governance mechanism should build on existing building blocks, such as national climate programmes, national plans for renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as the need to streamline and bring together separate planning and reporting strands. It also agreed to step up the role and rights of consumers, transparency and predictability for investors, inter alia by systematic monitoring of key indicators for an affordable, safe, competitive, secure and sustainable energy system and to facilitate coordination of national climate and energy policies and foster regional cooperation between Member States. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 12 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (13) In its communication of 25 February 2015 on A Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy, the Commission refers to the need for an integrated governance mechanism to ensure that energy-related actions at Union, regional, national and local level all contribute to the Energy Union's objectives, thereby broadening the scope of governance \u2013 beyond the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy \u2013 to all five dimensions of the Energy Union. (14) In its communication of 18 November 2015 on the State of the Energy Union, the Commission further specified that integrated national energy and climate plans, addressing all five dimensions of the Energy Union, are necessary tools for a more strategic energy and climate policy planning. As part of that communication, the Commission Guidance to Member States on integrated national energy and climate plans provided the basis for Member States to start developing national plans for the period 2021 to 2030 and set out the main pillars of the governance mechanism. The communication also specified that such governance should be anchored in law. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 13 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (15) In its conclusions of 26 November 2015 on the governance system of the Energy Union, the Council recognised that governance of the Energy Union will be an essential tool for the efficient and effective construction of the Energy Union and the achievement of its objectives. The Council underlined that the governance mechanism should be based on the principles of integration of strategic planning and reporting on the implementation of climate and energy policies and coordination between actors responsible for energy and climate policy, at Union, regional and national level. It also underlined that the governance mechanism should ensure that the agreed energy and climate targets for 2030 are met and should monitor the Union's collective progress towards the achievement of the policy objectives across the five dimensions of the Energy Union. (16) The European Parliament's resolution of 15 December 2015 entitled \"Towards a European Energy Union\" called for the governance mechanism of the Energy Union to be ambitious, reliable, transparent, democratic and fully inclusive of the European Parliament and to ensure that the 2030 climate and energy targets are achieved. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 14 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (17) The European Council has repeatedly stressed the need to take urgent measures in order to ensure the achievement of a minimum target of 10 % of electricity interconnections. In its conclusions of 23 and 24 October 2014, the European Council decided that the Commission supported by the Member States will take urgent measures in order to ensure the achievement of a minimum target of 10 % of electricity interconnections, as a matter of urgency, and no later than 2020 at least for Member States which have not yet attained a minimum level of integration in the internal energy market. The communication of the Commission of 23 November 2017 on strengthening Europe's energy networks assesses progress towards achieving the 10 % interconnection target and suggests ways in which to operationalise the 15 % interconnection target for 2030. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 15 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (18) The main objective of the governance mechanism should therefore be to enable the achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union and in particular the targets of the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy , in the field of GHG emission reduction, energy from renewable sources and energy efficiency. Those objectives and targets stem from the Union policy on energy and from the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to promote the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, as provided for in the EU Treaties. None of those objectives, which are indissociably linked, can be regarded as secondary to the other . This Regulation is therefore linked to sectoral law implementing the 2030 targets for energy and climate. While Member States need flexibility to choose policies that are best-matched to their national energy mix and preferences, that flexibility should be compatible with further market integration, increased competition, the attainment of climate and energy objectives and the gradual shift towards a sustainable low-carbon economy. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 16 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (19) A socially acceptable and just transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy requires changes in investment behaviour , as regards both public and private investment, and incentives across the entire policy spectrum , taking into consideration citizens on whom and regions on which the transition to a low-carbon economy could have adverse impacts . Achieving GHG emission reductions requires a boost to efficiency and innovation in the European economy and in particular should also create sustainable jobs, including in high-tech sectors, and lead to improvements of air quality and public health . (20) In view of the international commitments in the Paris Agreement, Member States should report on actions that they undertake to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels. When reporting, Member States may choose to base themselves on existing definitions for fossil fuel subsidies used internationally. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 17 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (21) As GHGs and air pollutants largely derive from common sources, policy designed to reduce GHGs can have co-benefits for public health and air quality , in particular in urban areas, that could offset the near-term costs of GHG mitigation. As data reported under Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council 13 represent an important input for the compilation of the GHG inventory and the national plans, the importance of compilation and reporting of consistent data between Directive (EU) 2016/2284 and the GHG inventory should be recognised. (22) The experience gained in implementing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council 14 indicated the need for synergies and coherence with reporting under other legal instruments, in particular with Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 15 , Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 , Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 and Regulation (EC) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 18 . The use of consistent data to report GHG emissions is essential to ensuring the quality of emissions reporting. 13 Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC (OJ L 344, 17.12.2016, p. 1). 14 Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other information at national and Union level relevant to climate change and repealing Decision No 280/2004/EC (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, p. 13). 15 Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32). 16 Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 concerning the establishment of a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register and amending Council Directives 91/689/EEC and 96/61/EC (OJ L 33, 4.2.2006, p. 1). 17 Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 on energy statistics (OJ L 304, 14.11.2008, p. 1). 18 Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 (OJ L 150, 20.5.2014, p. 195). ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 18 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (23) In line with the Commission's strong commitment to better regulation and consistent with a policy that promotes research, innovation and investment , the governance mechanism should result in a significant reduction of administrative burden and complexity for the Member States and relevant stakeholders , the Commission and other Union institutions. It should also help to ensure coherence and adequacy of policies and measures at Union and national level with regard to the transformation of the energy system towards a sustainable low-carbon economy. (24) The achievement of the Energy Union objectives and targets should be ensured through a combination of Union initiatives and coherent national policies set out in integrated national energy and climate plans. Sectoral Union law in the energy and climate fields sets out planning requirements, which have been useful tools to drive change at the national level. Their introduction at different times has led to overlaps and insufficient consideration of synergies and interactions between policy areas , to the detriment of cost- efficiency . Current separate planning, reporting and monitoring in the climate and energy fields should therefore as far as possible be streamlined and integrated. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 19 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (25) The integrated national energy and climate plans should cover ten-year periods and should provide an overview of the current energy system and policy situation. They should set out national objectives for each of the five dimensions of the Energy Union and corresponding policies and measures to meet those objectives and have an analytical basis. The integrated national energy and climate plans covering the first period from 2021 to 2030 should pay particular attention to the 2030 targets for GHG emission reductions, renewable energy, energy efficiency and electricity interconnection. Member States should aim to ensure that the integrated national energy and climate plans are consistent with, and contribute to, achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In their integrated national energy and climate plans, Member States may build upon existing national strategies or plans. For the first draft and final integrated national energy and climate plan , a different deadline is provided as compared to subsequent plans, in order to provide Member States with adequate preparation time for their first plans after the adoption of this Regulation. Nevertheless, Member States are encouraged to provide their first draft integrated national energy and climate plans as early as possible in 2018, in order to allow proper preparation, in particular for the facilitative dialogue to be convened in 2018 in accordance with decision 1/CP.21 of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 20 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (26) In their integrated national energy and climate plans, Member States should assess the number of households in energy poverty, taking into account the necessary domestic energy services needed to guarantee basic standards of living in the relevant national context, existing social policy and other relevant policies, as well as Commission indicative guidance on relevant indicators, including geographical dispersion, that are based on a common approach for energy poverty. In the event that a Member State finds that it has a significant number of households in energy poverty, it should include in its plan a national indicative objective to reduce energy poverty. (27) A mandatory template for the integrated national energy and climate plans should be established to ensure that all national plans are sufficiently comprehensive and to facilitate comparison and aggregation of national plans, while at the same time ensuring sufficient flexibility for Member States to set out the details of national plans reflecting national preferences and specificities. ",
        "14025/18 ID/ev 21 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (28) The implementation of policies and measures in the areas of energy and climate has an impact on the environment. Member States should therefore ensure that the public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in and to be consulted on the preparation of the integrated national energy and climate plans in accordance, where applicable, with the provisions of Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 19 and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\"UNECE\") Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters of 25 June 1998 (the \"Aarhus convention\"). Member States should also ensure involvement of social partners in the preparation of the integrated national energy and climate plans , and aim to limit administrative complexity when fulfilling their obligations with regard to public consultation . (29) When carrying out public consultations, and in line with the Aarhus Convention, Member States should aim to ensure equal participation, that the public is informed by public notices or other appropriate means such as electronic media, that the public is able to access all relevant documents, and that practical arrangements related to the public's participation are put in place. 19 Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (OJ L 197, 21.7.2001, p. 30).

        "14025/18 ID/ev 22 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (30) Each Member State should establish a permanent multi-level energy dialogue, bringing together local authorities, civil society organisations, the business community, investors and other relevant stakeholders to discuss the different options envisaged for energy and climate policies. It should be possible for the Member State\u2019s integrated national energy and climate plan as well as its long-term strategy to be discussed within the framework of that dialogue. The dialogue may take place by means of any national structure, such as a website, public consultation platform or another interactive communication tool. (31) Regional cooperation is key to ensuring the effective achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union in a cost-optimal manner. The Commission should facilitate such cooperation between the Member States . Member States should get the opportunity to comment on other Member States' integrated national energy and climate plans before they are finalised to avoid inconsistencies and potential negative impacts on other Member States and ensure that common objectives are met collectively. Regional cooperation in elaborating and finalising integrated national energy and climate plans as well as in their subsequent implementation should be essential to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of measures and fostering market integration and energy security.

        "14025/18 ID/ev 24 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (34) Integrated national energy and climate plans should be stable to ensure the transparency and predictability of national policies and measures in order to ensure investment certainty. National plans should however be updated once during the ten-year period covered to give Member States the opportunity to adapt to significant changing circumstances. For the plans covering the period 2021 to 2030, Member States should update their plans by 30 June 2024. Objectives, targets and contributions should only be modified to reflect an increased overall ambition in particular as regards the 2030 targets for energy and climate. As part of the updates, Member States should make efforts to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that become apparent as part of the integrated reporting. (35) Stable long- term \u258c strategies are crucial to contribute towards economic trans formation, jobs, growth and the achievement of broader sustainable development goals, as well as to move in a fair and cost-effective manner towards the long-term goal set by the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, Parties to the Paris Agreement are invited to communicate, by 2020, their mid-century, long-term low GHG emission development strategies. In that context, the European Council invited the Commission on 22 March 2018 to present, by the first quarter of 2019, a proposal for a strategy for long-term Union GHG emission reductions in accordance with the Paris Agreement, taking into account the integrated national energy and climate plans.

At the same time, the sector has huge potential to provide for long-term climate benefits and to contribute significantly to the achievement of Union and international long-term climate goals. It can contribute to climate change mitigation in several ways, in particular by reducing emissions, maintaining and enhancing sinks and carbon stocks, and providing bio-materials that can substitute fossil or carbon-intensive materials. Long-term strategies underpinning sustainable investment aiming to increase effective carbon sequestration, sustainable resource management, and long-term stability and adaptability of carbon pools, are essential.

(39) As is the case for planning, sectoral Union law in the energy and climate fields sets out reporting requirements, many of which have been useful tools to drive change at the national level, complementary to market reforms, but those requirements have been introduced at different times, leading to overlaps and cost-inefficiency, as well as insufficient consideration of synergies and interactions between policy areas such as GHG mitigation, renewable energy, energy efficiency and market integration. To strike the right balance between the need to ensure a proper follow-up of the implementation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and the need to reduce administrative complexity , Member States should establish biennial progress reports on the implementation of the plans and other developments in the energy system.

Member States should therefore adequately integrate the dimensions of human rights and gender equality in their integrated national energy and climate plans and long-term strategies. Through their biennial progress reports they should report information on how the implementation of their integrated national energy and climate plans contributes to the promotion of both human rights and gender equality.

Whereas recommendations have no binding force, as set out in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Member States should nevertheless take due account of such recommendations and explain in subsequent progress reports how they have done so. With regard to renewable energy, the Commission assessment is to be based on the objective criteria. If the Commission issues a recommendation with regard to a Member State's draft national plan, it should do so as quickly as possible, having regard, on the one hand, to the need for the Commission to add up certain quantified planned contributions of all Member States in order to assess the ambition at Union level, and, on the other, the need to provide adequate time for the Member State concerned to take due consideration of the Commission's recommendations before finalising its national plan, and the need to avoid the risk of delay of the Member State's national plan.

        "14025/18 ID/ev 36 ANNEX GIP.2 EN (55) Cost-effective deployment of renewable energy is one of the key objective criteria for assessing Member States' contributions. The cost structure of deploying renewable energy is complex and varies significantly between Member States. It includes not only the costs of support schemes, but, inter alia, the connection costs of installations, system backup, providing system security and costs that need to be borne when complying with environmental restrictions. Thus, when comparing Member States based on that criterion, all costs related to deployment, whether they are borne by the Member State, final consumers or project developers, should be accounted for. The Commission's recommendations with regard to the Member States' renewable ambitions should be based on a formula set out in this Regulation which is based on objective criteria. Thus, the assessment of the renewable energy ambition of the Member States should indicate the relative effort made by the Member States, while also taking into consideration relevant circumstances affecting the renewable energy development. The assessment should also include data originating from independent quantitative or qualitative data sources. ",

Should progress made by the Union towards those objectives and targets be insufficient for their delivery, the Commission should, in addition to issuing recommendations, propose measures and exercise its powers at Union level or Member States should take additional measures in order to ensure achievement of these objectives and targets (thereby closing any 'delivery gap'). Such measures should also take into account early efforts made by Member States towards the 2030 target for renewable energy by reaching in or before 2020 a share of energy from renewable sources above its national binding target, or by making early progress towards its national binding 2020 target or in the implementation of its contribution to the Union's binding target of at least 32 % of renewable energy in 2030 . In the area of renewable energy, such measures can also include voluntary financial contributions by Member States to a Union renewable energy financing mechanism managed by the Commission, which would be used to contribute to the most cost-efficient renewable energy projects across the Union , thus providing the Member States with the option to contribute to the Union target achievement at the lowest possible cost . Member States' national renewable energy targets for 2020 should serve as baseline shares of renewable energy from 2021 onwards and should be maintained throughout the period .
