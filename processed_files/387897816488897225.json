        "1 INTRODUCTION Cohesion policy in Italy will be delivered by a combination of national and regional mono-fund and multi-fund operational programmes (OPs): \u2022 11 national programmes co-financed by ERDF and/or ESF: OP \u201cResearch and innovation\u201d, OP \u201cActive policies for employment\u201d, OP \u201cInclusion\u201d, OP \u201cEducation\u201d, OP Businesses & Competitiveness, OP \u201cNetworks & mobility\u201d, OP \u201cYEI\u201d, OP \u201cMetropolitan cities\u201d, OP \u201cLegality\u201d and OP \u201cGovernance\u201d; \u2022 regional programmes for the 21 regions and autonomous provinces, mostly separate for the two funds ERDF and ESF, with the exception of the regions Calabria, Molise and Puglia which will each have a multi-fund programme, for a total of 39 regional programmes. Of these, eight National OPs and 21 regional OPs receive ESF funding (13 OPs cover more developed regions, three OPs cover transition regions and five OPs cover less developed regions). In addition, the ESIF package foresees 23 rural development programmes, co-financed by EAFRD. Of these, 21 will be carried out at regional level, two at national level; 1 will be provided by the Maritime and Fisheries programme, which is co-financed by EMFF. The Partnership Agreement indicates that a total of approximately 42.086.000.000 Euro is allocated to ESIF, of this figure 10.467.200.000 Euro is allocated to ESF. The ESF contributions amount to approximately 24.87% of the total planned EU funding. 1 The Youth employment initiative provides a further 567.511.248 Euro. Cohesion programming in Italy follows a relatively strong and centralised approach. The Partnership Agreement sets out the overall of intervention strategy, together with a \u201cclosed\u201d list of specific objectives and expected results. Typologies of actions and categories of indicators are also provided; managing authorities can adapt these to develop their own regional strategies. The aim of this report is to provide an overview of the ESF implementation strategy in Italy for the period 2014-2020 for all the ESF-funded OPs in Italy. The report will analyse the following aspects: the strategic orientation (relationship between EU 2020 targets and country challenges) and strategic choices of the countries within the ESIF framework (selection of thematic objectives/investment priorities), the financial allocation (concentration on TO and relative share of total Cohesion Policy spending), the intervention logic relationship between investment priorities, specific objectives, activities, and output and result indicators, and selection of Output and Result Indicators and their relevant target values. The Country factsheets are drawn up based on information extracted from an online database that was developed for the purpose of this study. This database stores quantitative and qualitative information from the 28 Partnership Agreements (PA) and all 184 ESF (mono and multi-fund) Operational Programmes (OP) across the 28 Member States (excluding three Technical Assistance Operational Programmes in France, Greece and Spain). Quantitative information mostly refers to financial allocation to OPs and Investment Priorities (always considering EU funding), target and baseline values of indicators; 1 From the Partnership Agreement - Italy ",
        "2 while qualitative/descriptive information refers to text entries (either extracted directly from the OP such as for the description of specific objectives, actions and target groups , or in the form of justification of assessment scores). All qualitative information in the database was standardised according common categories, called \u201cID categories\u201d , allowing aggregation of data at the country and EU 28 level. Information was collected (and also categorised according pre-defined ID categories) on the following features of each PA and OP: \uf0b7 Issues/challenges as expressed in the CSR and CPP (qualitative information; 17 standard categories); \uf0b7 Investment Priorities (19 standard categories) 2 ; \uf0b7 Specific Objectives (qualitative information; 27 standard categories); \uf0b7 Actions (qualitative information; 24 standard categories) \uf0b7 Target groups (qualitative information; 15 standards categories); \uf0b7 Result indicators (titles; 15 standard categories) \uf0b7 Output indicators (titles; 17 standards categories) \uf0b7 Methodology for target setting (qualitative information; 4 standard categories) Next to this factual information from PA and OP, this study also included a normative assessment on how each of the above elements corresponds and forms a coherent intervention logic, explaining a clear link between challenges identified, Investment Priorities, Specific Objectives, Actions, target groups, output / result indicators and target values selected: \uf0b7 assessment of coherence between IPs and relevant challenges; \uf0b7 assessment of coherence between Specific Objective (or Specific Objectives) and relevant IP; \uf0b7 assessment of coherence between result indicators and relevant Specific Objective (SO) \uf0b7 assessment of coherence between actions and relevant SO; \uf0b7 assessment of coherence between target groups and relevant SO; \uf0b7 assessment of coherence between output indicators and actions; \uf0b7 assessment of methodology used for target setting. In order to ensure a homogeneous and transparent assessment across different MS and OPs, ordinal (likert) scales have been developed for categorising and \u201cranking\u201d various types of assessments of the intervention logic of the OP (from \u201cnot at all\u201d, \u201clittle\u201d, \u201csomewhat\u201d, to \u201cvery\u201d coherent). Every assessment score made by the expert was accompanied by a descriptive entry justifying the attributed score, allowing consistency checks across all assessments made. All the above categories and definitions are presented in Annex 1. The database was completed by Country experts on the basis of a note providing step by step guidance on the data to be collected (including reference to specific sections/tables of the OPs, and categories of information). Country experts received ad hoc support by the Core Team during the data entering phase (including answers to Frequently Asked Questions). Database entries were further quality checked by the Core Team on the basis of the justifications provided by Country experts and following an iterative process of fine-tuning and standardisation of information. 2 regardless of its allocation to one or more Priority Axes within the same OP ",
        "3 In the Annex of this country report, a methodological note details how data has been gathered, stored and allocated to common categories; there will also be an outline of how assessments were made to test the external and internal coherence of the OPs for the purpose of the compiling the data present in this Factsheet. ",
        "4 1. S UMMARY Italy\u2019s progress towards Europe 2020 targets is still critical and is characterised by significant underachievement with respect to the target rate of tertiary education among 30-34 year-olds. Furthermore, the employment rate remains low and a high number of people still live in or at risk of poverty or social exclusion. The CPP and CSRs (2013 and 2014) for Italy call for actions that promote access to employment, focussing particularly on the most vulnerable groups (women, youth, older unskilled, migrants). The strengthening of labour market institutions (such as PES and orientation entities for students in higher education) is also a key action suggested by the CPP and CSRs, along with promoting the effectiveness of welfare benefits, focussing especially on low income families with children. Improving the quality of education, training and research is also a major goal, including the set up of a national register of qualifications. Italy is also expected to reinforce the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of its public administration, including support to the civil justice system. Overall, the challenges identified in the CPP and in the CSR find an adequate response in the PA. The ESF architecture in Italy includes 29 programmes: eight National OPs, 13 OPs for more developed regions, three OPs for transition regions, and five OPs for less developed regions. ESF allocation totals 10.467.200.000 Euro, including the ESF matching support of YEI. The Youth employment initiative specific allocation provides a further 567.511.248 Euro. At country level, the ESF (excluding TA and non-ESF- funded YEI) allocates the largest budget share to TO8 (about 42%), followed by TO10 (30%), TO9 (22%) and TO11 (6%, mainly through national OPs). National OPs account for 43% of the total budget; more developed regions\u2019 OPs account for 31%; less developed and transition regions\u2019 OPs account for 27%. The national OPs mainly focus on: Active Labour market Policies (TO8), marginalised groups\u2019 labour market integration (IPs 9i, 9ii and 9iv), access to social policies (IPs 9i, 9ii, 9iv, 11i and 11ii), access to education (IPs 10i and 10iv), and also governance and systems actions (IPs 11i and 11ii). Regional OPs cover all TOs, with a focus on the labour market relevance of education and training (IPs belonging to TO10, in particular 10i and 10iv) and access to employment for jobseekers and inactive people (IPs 8i and 8vii). The evidence collected throughout the study clearly indicates that IPs selected by OPs adequately address the country and regional challenges. ESF programming in Italy follows a centralised approach, with the Partnership Agreement setting the overall strategy of ESF intervention, together with a predefined list of Specific Objectives/Expected results, typologies of actions and categories of indicators. As a result of the screening process carried out for the preparation of this report, most of the specific objectives are assessed to be fully coherent with the relevant Investment Priorities in that they narrow down the scope of the IPs while capturing the direction of change that the MS/MA seek to achieve and can be quantitatively evaluated. The actions are equally distributed between individuals and entities, and well balanced across IPs. They are assessed to be sufficiently appropriate to achieve the specific objectives in all IPs. The focus spanning across both individuals and entities is confirmed also by looking at target groups, with unemployed people and local public institutions being the most frequently targeted groups across the different ",
        "5 IPs. National public institutions are also a focal point of national Ops. Young people in education tend to be the most frequently targets of regional OPs, along with disadvantaged individual at risk of social exclusion in the more developed regions. The selected target groups fully match the relevant specific objectives. Output and result indicators represent fully, or to a large extent, the specific objectives and scope of the activities implemented and changes foreseen. Selected output indicators refer to both individuals and entities. The number of projects targeting public administration or public services at national, regional or local level is selected by at least oneIP in all Thematic Objectives, both in national and regional OPs. Among the most frequently selected result indicators for individuals, we find those that refer to: the number of unemployed and long-term unemployed, NEET, unskilled participants, employed people, participants who live in jobless households and other disadvantaged. According to methodological annexes to the OPs, the justification of target values is provided for 62% of output indicators. For 58% of these, where justification has been provided, target setting is based on historical ESF data on costs for similar interventions; the remaining part is almost equally divided between those based on historical ESF data on placement for similar interventions (16%), benchmarking (e.g. On relevant administrative or statistical data, 15%) and expert assessment and/or educated guess (11%). Result indicators are typically expressed in percentage. Indicators referring to the attainment of a qualification upon leaving, as well as the improved capacity and/or competence of institutions and organisations, are observed in at least one IP across all Thematic Objectives. Moreover, result indicators referring to participants with an improved labour market situation six months after leaving, disadvantaged participants engaged in job searching education/training or employment upon and six months after leaving, and participants in employment upon leaving are often used. The justification of the target is provided for basically all result indicators. For 65% of result indicators, target setting is based on benchmarking (e.g. on relevant administrative or statistical data) or using evidence from similar programming. 25% of targets are set using previous ESF monitoring data, but no adequate methodological basis and/or modelling examples of quantifications are provided; in the majority of remaining cases targets are based on expert assessment. Active labour market policies account for about one third of total ESF budget. Great emphasis is based upon labour market institutions in particular, to qualify the quality of PES services and to integrate the most disadvantaged people into the labour market. Actions targeted at youth employment account for more than 2,1 billion Euro (21,2% of total ESF budget), which is supplemented by almost 0,6 billion Euro of the YEI specific allocation (ie. not including the ESF matching support to Youth Employment Initiative which is included in the previous figure). Approximately 5,9% of total ESF budget is allocated to actions promoting the efficiency of the public administration. ",

Challenges for Italy In 2013, the early school leaving rate was the only indicator close to the national EU 2020 target (just 0.8 percentage points higher than the 16% target set at national level to contribute to the EU2020 target of 10%). Italy underperformed in relation to all other national ESF-related EU2020 targets: there was a shortfall of 4 percentage points in the rate of 30-34 year-olds completing tertiary education, along with a 8 percentage point deficit between the actual employment rate and the established target, while almost 4.5 million more people were living at risk of poverty or social exclusion than the EU target had planned for 2020. Table 2 EU2020 headline targets Europe 2020 ESF-related headline targets Baseline value Italy Europe 2020 indicators 2013 National 2020 target in the NRP 75% of the population aged 20-64 should be employed 59,7% 68% Reducing early school leaving to less than 10% 16,8% 16% At least 40% of 30-34 years old completing tertiary or equivalent education 22,5% 26,5% Reducing the number of people in or at risk of poverty or exclusion by at least 20 million 17.326.000 people 12.899.000 people The Country Specific Recommendations (2013 and 2014) and the Commission Position Paper address the relevant challenges for TO8/TO9/TO10/TO11. Below, an overview is provided on the main challenges identified in these strategic documents, clustered by thematic objective. Regarding TO8: \uf0b7 Access to employment for the unemployed (CSR and CPP): promote access to employment, particularly for women and young people, by modernising and strengthening labour market institutions (CPP) \uf0b7 Youth employment (CPP): fighting youth unemployment, namely through the YG (CSR); \uf0b7 LM relevance of education and training (CSR): strengthen VET; improve effectiveness of PES and guidance for students in higher education \uf0b7 Other (CPP): combating undeclared work, promoting labour mobility, and Integrating the most vulnerable in the labour market (women, older workers, migrants and people at risk of social exclusion and poverty) Regarding TO9: \uf0b7 Social services (CSR): promote effectiveness of welfare benefits, especially for low income families with children \uf0b7 Other (CPP) : integrating the most vulnerable in the labour market (women, older workers, migrants and people at risk of social exclusion and poverty) ",
        "10 Regarding TO10: \uf0b7 Access to education (CSR): improve quality of education and its effectiveness; set up a national register of qualifications; improve capacity of teachers; more funds to quality of education and research \uf0b7 Early school leaving (CSR):fight early school leaving \uf0b7 LM relevance of education and training (CSR): support work-based training in secondary and tertiary education \uf0b7 Other (CPP): improving quality of education and training Regarding TO11: \uf0b7 Good governance (CSR and CPP): reinforce the efficiency of public administration and improve coordination between layers of government; simplify the administrative and regulatory framework for citizens and business in addition to reducing the duration of case-handling in civil justice; strengthen the legal framework for repression of corruption; adopt structural measures to improve management of EU funds in Southern regions (CSR); support the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of the public administration (CPP) Overall, the challenges identified in the CPP and in the CSRs find an adequate response in the PA. The PA makes a direct and clear reference to the challenges identified in CSR2013 and CSR2014, which are fully in line with the recommendations. The CPP is referenced on several occasions throughout the document, especially in relation to priority funding for active inclusion. Complex accounts of the national/regional/thematic OPs ensure a strong and in depth coverage of such challenges without losing sight of the important specificities within the Italian territory. For the great majority of identified challenges, the PA acknowledges them and provides fully adequate operational information on how they are to be addressed (i.e. challenges, actions, target groups, implementation framework, expected results and funds are described). 3.2. Coherence of ESF programmes to challenges addressed Table 3 provides an overview on how the challenges, as identified in the CSR, are addressed by the ESF OPs in the country at IP level. The first row in the table indicates whether a certain challenge is mentioned in CSR. The table shows that all development challenges identified by the CRS are tackled by selected IPs within the OPs. The national OPs mainly focus on labour market integration of marginalised groups (IPs 9i, 9ii and 9iv), education (IP 10i, 10iii, 10iv), access to social policies (IPs 9i, 9ii, 9iv, 11i and 11ii) and good governance (IPs 11i and 11ii). The regional OPs mainly focus on the relevance of education and training for the labour market (IPs belonging to OT10, in particular 10i and 10iv), as well as on access to employment for jobseekers and those who are inactive in the labour market (IPs 8i and 8vii).

A LLOCATION AND CONCENTRATION OF BUDGET This chapter provides an overview of the financial allocation data provided for each IP and shows how the budget distribution complies with the ESF Regulation provisions on the financial allocation. This includes information on how much of budget is spent on Social Inclusion (Thematic Objective 9) and respects the concentration principle. Table 4 provides an overview of the budget allocated to each IP by typologies of OP and the total per country. It shows that 10.096.758.853 Euro ESF budget (excluding TA and YEI specific allocation) is available to Italy. NOTE: - This allocation includes 10 MEUR under IP 10iii of OP Lombardia as per the relevant CoI, even though this IP has not been activated by the OP - This allocation includes 203,7 MEUR under IP 10iv of the National OP Research and Innovation (as per the relevant CoI), although this budget is allocated by the OP to the IP 10ii - This allocation includes 53 MEUR under IP 11i of the National OP Legality Analysing the distribution and concentration of budget between IP across OP the following can be concluded: \uf0b7 Focus of ESF : the ESF allocates the largest budget share to TO8 (about 42%), followed by TO10 (30%), TO9 (22%) and TO11 (6%, mainly through national OPs). National OPs account for 43% of the total budget; more developed regions\u2019 OPs account for 31%; less developed and transition regions\u2019 OPs account for 27%. \uf0b7 Social inclusion : the budget allocated to social inclusion (covering all IPs that belong to TO9) is 21.99% of ESF budget, which is above the 20% required by ESF Regulation. In particular, national OPs allocate 10% of the total budget to TO9, more developed regions OPs provide 7%, less developed and transition regions Ops assign 6%. Among national OPs, the range of TO9 budget share varies greatly between 100% of the ESF budget in the National OP Metropolitan Cities (multi-fund, i.e. it also includes ERDF resources), 95% in the NOP Social Inclusion, and 0% in all other NOPs. Among regional OPs, the range of TO9 budget shares vary much less markedly, with between 26% of ESF budget in the ROP Abruzzo (multi-fund, i.e. it also includes ERDF resources), 25% in the ROP Social Basilicata, 18% in ROP Marche and 19% in ROPs Valle d\u2019Aosta and Friuli Venezia Giulia. \uf0b7 Concentration: at country level, the IPs accounting for the largest share of the budget are 9i (around 16%), 8ii and 10i (15%), 8i (11%), and 10iv (9%). Overall, they account for 67,5% of the total budget and are mostly funded by regional OPs. More in detail, all National OPs allocate 100% of resources to the five biggest IPs (with the number of IPs selected being always less than five). At the regional level thematic concentration on the five largest IPs is higher for OPs in more developed regions and lower for transition and less developed regions. In more developed regions concentration ranges from 84.7% for Lombardy (followed at short distance by Tuscany) to 80% in Lazio and Liguria. In the remaining regions it spans from 61% in Puglia to 70% in Campania.. ",

        "17 5. I NTERVENTION LOGIC AND INTERNAL COHERENCE This section provides an overview of the intervention logic of in the Italian OPs. In Italy ESF programming followed a centralised approach with the Partnership Agreement defining common linkages across specific objectives (SOs), actions and result indicators at the IP level so that all OPs share a common architecture. 5.1. Relationship between Specific objectives and Investment priorities Overall, the most commonly selected SOs by the ESF aim to: improve educational attainment at all levels (10iv, 10i, 10ii and 10iii); increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector (11i and 11ii); reduce poverty and social exclusion (11i and 11ii); and promote employment (8i). A similar ranking is observed also in national OPs. In more developed regions, the most selected SOs focus on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector, as well as promoting employment. In less developed and transition regions, the improvement of educational attainment and the reduction of poverty and social exclusion are of particular priority. In principle, the specific objective of an IP should narrow down the scope of the IP and fully capture the (direction of) change which the Member State seeks to achieve with EU support. Moreover, the specific objectives should be specific enough to be quantitatively evaluated. All SO across the different OPs were assessed on this aspect by ranking each SO according to a three-point scale score. Figure 1 provides an overview of the assessment made per SO for all OPs. Most of the Specific Objects are deemed to effectively narrow the scope of the IPs, capturing the direction of the change the MS seeks to achieve and are specific enough to be quantitatively evaluated. For a relatively small number of SOs the operationalisation of the IP is less effective: the Specific Objective, as described in the OP and operationalised by expected results, is rather broad with respect to the IP, although it still captures the expected change sought by the OP. Figure 1 Relationship between Specific Objectives and Investment Priorities 246 13 0 3. the specific objective narrows down the scope of the IP and captures the (direction of the) change which the Member State seeks to achieve with EU support, and is almost specific enough to be quantitatively evaluated. 2. the specific objective is not very specific, but captures the (direction of the) change which the Member State seeks to achieve with EU support, and is almost specific enough to be qualitatively evaluated. 1. the specific objective is broad and reflects to a limited extent the (direction of the) change which the Member State seeks to achieve with EU support, and is not specific enough to be evaluated ",
        "18 5.2. Relationship between actions and Investment Priorities Actions should contribute to the achievement of the Results and the Specific Objectives. The table below provides an overview of the types of actions that have been selected per IP. Country experts identified a maximum of four actions selected per IP and clustered them across standard categories of actions (for a full list and explanation of categories, see the Methodological annex), based on the description in the OP, as identified in the columns of table 6. The rows reflect the IPs across all ESF programmes in the country. Overall, the actions of the Italian OPs are equally distributed on individuals and entities, which are also well balanced across Investment Priorities. The most frequently activated action type according to the categorisation of the country experts includes a mix of integrated measures targeted at individuals (e.g. a combination of personal and career advice, training, hiring subsidies etc.), which focuses in particular on TO8, TO9 and TO10. Other frequent action types include career support/guidance for individuals (especially in TO8 and TO10 of regional OPs), and actions to introduce and manage the change for operators, firms, institutions and stakeholders (especially in TO11 and IP 8vii of regional OPs). Actions to develop new programmes, tools and instruments are also quite frequently carried out in regional OPs. ",

        "20 In order to assess whether actions contribute to the achievement of the specific objectives, all actions falling under an IP were analysed and were assessed to be appropriate to achieve expexted results as expressed by the specific objectives. 5.3. Investment Priorities and target groups addressed Investment priorities and specific objectives address different target groups. Country experts identified a maximum of four target groups selected per IP and clustered them across ID categories of actions (for a full list and explanation of categories, see the Methodological annex). The table below provides an overview of the target groups addressed by IPs on country level. The focus spans both individuals and entities, which is confirmed by also looking at target groups, with unemployed people and local public institutions being the most frequently targeted. National public institutions are also frequently targeted by national OPs, as are young people in education by regional OPs as well as people at risk of disadvantage and social exclusion in the more developed regions\u2019 OPs. An assessment was also made on the coherence between the target groups and actions on IP level, which indicated whether the defined target groups fully matched the specific objectives falling under that IP. Figure 2 shows the outcomes of this exercise, providing an overview for how many IPs this is, or is not, the case. In all cases, the defined target groups fully match the specific objective, while the remainder are somewhat relevant for reaching the specific objectives.

        "24 Figure 4 Coherence between output indicators and actions 6. PROGRAMME PERFORMANCE One of the key elements introduced by the Regulations is that the programme should provide clear, transparent, measurable aims and targets for accountability and results. Countries and regions are requested to clearly state the objectives they intend to achieve with available resources and indicate how progress towards these goals will be measured (Performance Framework). This will allow regular monitoring and debate on how financial resources are used. 6.1. Outputs of ESF on country level The actions undertaken by the different programmes lead to outputs. Output indicators are measured in physical (or monetary) units. In the context of the intervention logic of the programmes under cohesion, policy output indicators should be logically linked to, and reflect, the types of actions planned. The outputs should also contribute towards the achievement of the results and targets set by the output indicators, which should be consistent with the financial allocation envisaged. Total aggregations of target values of output indicators by Investment Priority For the purposes of this analysis and in order to allow aggregation at the national level and cross country comparison output indicators have been clustered by country experts around common categories, roughly corresponding to the Common Output Indicators of Annex 1 of ESF Reg. (for a full list of categories and their description, see Annex I \u2013 Methodological Note). Table 7 illustrates the results of this aggregation. In total Italian OPs plan to reach out to almost 3 million individuals with low education levels, mostly under 10i, and approximately 2.5 million of unemployed individuals mostly under 8i, 8ii and 10 iv. 725 98 0 3. the output indicator represents to a large extent the scope of the activities implemented 2. the output indicator represents to some extent the scope of the activities implemented 1. the output indicator represents to a limited extent the scope of the activities implemented ",

ESF will also benefit employed individuals mostly under 10i (mostly school personnel and staff) and 10iv and 8v (contributing to increasing adaptability of workers) and disadvantaged people under the different IPs of TO9. Overall approximately 400.000 NEET will be involved in ESF interventions. The number of projects targeting public administrations or public services at national, regional or local level is selected in at least one IP across all TOs in both national and regional OPs. The high target value under the \u201cother\u201d category (clustering the indicators that could not be aggregated around standard categories) refers to 10M pages of cultural heritage to be made available in digital format through the Lombardy ROP. The number of inactive people and the support of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (including cooperative enterprises, enterprises of the social economy) are specific targets in TO8, TO9 and TO10 of regional OPs, while the number of projects dedicated to sustainable participation and the progression of women in employment is higher in less developed and transition regions OP.

Table 8 Financial milestone targets Information on the methodology of target setting Figure 5 illustrates the methodologies used for target setting of selected output indicators according to information provided in the operational programmes or related methodological annexes. As detected in the screening of OPs and related methodological annexes, the justification of target values was screened for 62% of output indicators. For 58% of those for which a justification was identifed, target setting is based on historical ESF data on costs for similar interventions; the remaining part is almost equally divided between those based on historical ESF data on placement for similar interventions (16%), benchmarking (e.g. On relevant administrative or statistical data, 15%) and expert assessment and/or educated guess (11%).

The table distinguishes between indicators expressed in absolute values and percentages 5 .YEI Result Indicators are considered in a separate table. Results indicators in Italian OPs are expressed in percentage in 61% of cases, while they are expressed in number (of people, entities and projects) in the remaining 39% of cases (including those RI expressed in percentage and for which the absolute value could be calculated on the basis of the reference common output indicator). Indicators related to improved capacity and/or competence of institutions and organisations are observed in at least one IP across all Thematic Objectives. Moreover, result indicators referring to participants with an improved labour market situation six months after leaving are often used in TO8, TO10 and TO11; indicators referring to disadvantaged participants engaged in job searching, education, training or employment six months after leaving education are very common in TO9, and those referring to participants in employment upon leaving are frequently used in TO8, TO9 and TO10. YEI Result Indicators are expressed in numbers. Almost 286.000 unemployed young people are expected to complete the intervention and an additional 207.000 inactive young people. After the YEI interventions, it is expected that 125.000 young people will have found an employment. 4 The indicators that are closely linked to the indicators as presented in Annex 1 and 2 of the ESF regulation have similar definitions and levels of measurement. These indicators were allocated to one of the common result indicators, and target values were aggregated for these groups of indicators. 5 The indicators that are closely linked to the indicators as presented in Annex 1 and 2 of the ESF regulation have similar definitions and levels of measurement.

The justification of the target values is provided for almost all result indicators. The methodological approach for calculating the target values of the indicators was made following an assessment of the methodology, which is used to calculate the targets. Figure 6 provides an overview on the number of indicators for which a certain methodology was used (taking into account all output indicators of all OPs in the country). For 65% of result indicators, target setting is based on benchmarking (e.g. on relevant administrative or statistical data) or using evidence from similar programming; around 25% of targets are set using previous ESF monitoring data, but no adequate methodological basis and/or modelling examples of quantifications are provided; in the majority of remaining cases, targets are based on expert assessment and/or educated guess.

        "32 7. F URTHER EXPLORATION OF A NUMBER OF SELECTED THEMES This section analyses a number specific themes, which include: the youth employment strategy and the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI); the institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders; efficient public administration; and the investment in Active Labour Market Policies (ALMPs). These themes are operationalised in terms or Investment Priorities that are related to these themes. Table 10 below provides an overview of how these themes are addressed in the ESF OPs in the country. \uf0b7 Considering youth employment policies (IP 8.ii) Regional OPs and the national Ops for Youth Employment Initiatives envisage a wide range of actions devoted to dealing with the issue. Most of the actions are organised using an integrated approach, which combines a designed personal path on the skills, needs and interests of the young person. Schemes such as the remote counselling system, skills assessment system, training actions, apprenticeships, traineeships, civil service, support to self-employment and entrepreneurship have an important role. \uf0b7 Concerning \u201cenhancing institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration\u201d (IP 11.i) The national OP for Governance and Institutional Capacity, along with most regional OPs, envisage a wide range of actions aimed at: rationalising the public administration, developing digital skills and models for the joint management of advanced services, improving the efficiency and the performances of judicial offices, and improving the management of health services. Most interventions are coordinated at the state, regional and local level; they aim to qualify and strengthen institutions, operators and stakeholders, while reducing the duration procedures and costs. \uf0b7 Considering investments to Active Labour Market Policy (IPs 8i, 8ii, 8v and partly 8iii) Regional OPs and the national OP for Labour Active Policies Systems envisage a wide range of actions devoted to dealing with the issue. It is evident that the focus is on labour market institutions in particular to qualify the quality of PES services; integrating the most disadvantaged people into the labour market is in line with challenges raised by CSRs and CPP. Great emphasis is also placed on actions combining different forms of career advice, motivational activities and skills development. ",
