        "On the basis of the amount allocated, will the Commission also provide its assessment of this system, especially with regard to the competitiveness of companies using starch, farmers\u2019 yield and compensation for the structural disadvantages obtaining in the starch sector? Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (18 December 2001) The Commission would like to point out that the budget of \u20ac 900 million mentioned by the Honourable Member for 2000 includes expenditure of \u20ac 500 million on direct area-aid for cereals, as the Court of Auditors Special Report indicates in Point I of the Summary and in Table 2 of the Annex ( 1 ). A proposal for a Council Regulation on a common organisation of the market in potatoes ( 2 ) was presented by the Commission in 1992. This Commission draft, revived in 1995 and 1996 by the Spanish and Irish Presidencies of the Council respectively, was not adopted because of the opposition of some Member States. The Commission is sending direct to the Honourable Member and to Parliament\u2019s Secretariat the requested information on potato starch expenditure by Member State. As the beneficiaries are paid by the paying agencies of the Member States, which are in turn reimbursed based on their monthly declarations by budget heading, the Commission does not have the information on beneficiaries requested by the Honourable Member. The Commission has ordered an evaluation of the potato and cereals starch sector, which is still under way. The Commission expects the final report to be ready within the next few months and, once it has drawn its own conclusions from the report, it will then be able to present its own evaluation of the scheme.

(2002/C 134 E/228) WRITTEN QUESTION E-3290/01 by Christopher Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE) to the Commission (27 November 2001) Subject: Social inclusion in Member States What EU funds are available to promote social inclusion in Member States? How much has been allocated and under what budget line(s) do they fall? Answer given by Mrs Diamantopoulou on behalf of the Commission (21 January 2002) The European Social Fund (ESF) is an important source of Community funds to promote social inclusion in Member States. The ESF Regulation ( 1 ) outlines the five policy fields through which ESF will support the development of the labour market and human resources. One of these policy fields aims to \u2018promote equal opportunities for all in accessing the labour market, with particular emphasis on those exposed to social exclusion\u2019. Following negotiations between the Commission and Member States, over \u20ac 9 billion of ESF will go to promote social inclusion across the Community during the period 2000-2006. 6.6.2002 EN C 134 E/215 Official Journal of the European Communities ",
        "Funded by the ESF, the Community Initiative EQUAL will test new ways of tackling discrimination and inequality experienced by those in work and those looking for a job. EQUAL will co-finance activities in all Member States. The Community will contribute around \u20ac 3 billion to EQUAL over the period to 2006. As with all ESF spending this will be \u2018matched\u2019 by national funding. EQUAL differs from the European Social Fund mainstream programmes in its innovative dimension and in its emphasis on active co-operation between Member States. In addition, the programme of Community action to encourage co-operation between Member States to combat social exclusion may provide financial support to transnational activities of exchange of good practice in the field of social inclusion. This programme is part of the open method of coordination to combat social exclusion launched at the Lisbon Council in March 2000. It was agreed by the Parliament and the Council at conciliation on 18 September 2001 and the decision was published in the Official Journal on 12 January 2002. It starts on 1 January 2002. Its budget amounts to \u20ac 75 million over five years (2002-2006). It is composed of three strands: improving the understanding of social exclusion and poverty; organising policy co-operation and mutual learning in the light of the national action plans to combat poverty and social exclusion; developing the capacity of actors to address social exclusion and poverty at Community level. ( 1 ) Regulation (EC) no. 1784/1999 of the Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999 on the European Social Fund, OJ L 213, 13.8.1999. (2002/C 134 E/229) WRITTEN QUESTION E-3291/01 by Christopher Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE) to the Commission (27 November 2001) Subject: Funding for sport What EU funds are available for developing sport in Member States? How much has been allocated and under what budget line(s) do they fall? Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (21 December 2001) There are no EU funds allocated specifically to the development of sport in the Member States. The only appropriations allocated directly to sport are for the prevention of doping. The sum for 2001 is EUR 5 million and this is provided under budget heading B3-2020. However, in general, some sports projects may be financed by other Community funds, provided they meet the award criteria for these funds. For example, the Socrates and Leonardo programmes, the Framework Programme for research and technological development and indeed the Structural Funds have financed projects related to sport, as long as the projects are in line with the general objectives of these programmes. Thus, under the Socrates programme, a school sports project to promote the Olympic ideals has just received EUR 195 215 of funding. However, to date no general record has been compiled of sports projects funded by the Community. An inventory of this kind would be difficult because a significant percentage of these projects are carried out at the initiative of the Member States.
