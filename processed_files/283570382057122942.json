About FEMIP The Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) brings together the whole range of services provided by the European Investment Bank in the Mediterranean partner countries. Operational since October 2002, FEMIP has contributed to an enhanced dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and the Mediterranean partner countries. Moreover, it is now the key player in the economic and financial partnership between Europe and the Mediterranean region, providing over EUR 7.3 billion of financing between October 2002 and Decem- ber 2007 to finance 105 capital investment projects in the Medi- terranean region. Over the period 2007-2013, FEMIP has at its disposal EUR 10.7 bil- lion to support projects in the nine Mediterranean partner coun- tries. FEMIP encourages the modernisation and opening-up of the economies of the Mediterranean partner countries. Activities are focused on two priority areas: development of the private sector and the creation of an investment-friendly environment. ",

Firstly, they help improve people\u2019s living conditions and reduce the incidence of poverty, thereby contributing to economic and social cohesion; secondly, investment in human capital also improves produc- tivity, which is essential in order to raise labour market standards and lay the basis for private sector-based economic growth in the medium and long run. Given the utmost importance of educa- tion in order to promote sustainable and long-lasting economic growth, human capital investments have become one of FEMIP\u2019s priorities in the Mediterranean region, with the aim of contributing to employment and the development of the private sector in the Mediterranean region. FEMIP support for education- related projects in FEMIP countries Between 2002 and 2007 FEMIP provided EUR 250 million in loans to support human capital projects. In particular, some EUR 70 million was earmarked for education and training-related projects. In addition to loans, via its Technical Assistance Support Fund FEMIP can sup- port education-related projects by provid- ing technical assistance to accompany the preparation, implementation and moni- toring of projects. Project examples: FEMIP has recently approved a project with the Moroccan Ministry of Employ- ment, Social Affairs and Solidarity in order to cover the creation of 15 new voca- tional training centres. The purpose of the project is to increase the capacity of the vocational training system in Morocco and thus deliver skilful personnel to busi- nesses in the fields of tourism, textiles and information and communications technologies. The project will also help to improve the existing vocational train- ing centres, allowing them to adapt to the needs of a global economy. The project is part of the Moroccan Government\u2019s pri- vate sector development strategy. FEMIP financial support for this project amounts to EUR 30 million. FEMIP has also committed itself to pro- vide financing of up to EUR 40 million for the Jordan Education Project. The project is being undertaken with the purpose of tackling unemployment and poverty in Jordan. To this end, four key issues will be addressed: sector governance and administrative organisation; curriculum enhancement; replacement of unsafe and overcrowded educational facilities; and development of early childhood educa- tion programmes. FEMIP Internship Programme In 2006, FEMIP launched its Internship Pro- gramme, which is open to students who are nationals of the Mediterranean partner countries. The goal of the programme is to contribute to capacity-building efforts by providing the successful candidates with an opportunity to improve their skills as well as the experience of working in a multicultural international environment. The programme, open on an annual basis, is funded by the FEMIP Trust Fund 1 . The FEMIP Internship Programme has been received with great interest, as reflected in the significant number of applications. Following the selection process, 26 students and young profes- sionals from the Mediterranean partner countries took part in the initiative and were offered traineeships in different departments at the EIB. 1 More information on the FEMIP Internship Pro- gramme is available at: http://www.eib.org A Trust Fund for the Mediterranean The FEMIP Trust Fund was created in 2004, following a decision by the ECOFIN Council to establish a fund dedicated to the Mediterra- nean partner countries. The purpose of the FEMIP Trust Fund is to direct resources to operations in certain priority sec- tors in order to foster private sec- tor development in the region. To attain this objective two windows were defined: upstream technical assistance and support for pri- vate equity. By December 2007, 15 Member States and the European Com- mission had together contributed EUR 34.5 million. ",

The initiative will be a unique opportunity to address the main challenges posed by economic growth and the development of labour markets in the Mediterranean region, since it will bring together rep- resentatives from various backgrounds, including representatives of the Member States, multilateral organisations, the pri- vate sector and NGOs. FEMISE and UNIMED, the networks of universities working in partnership with the European Investment Bank, will also play a significant role.
