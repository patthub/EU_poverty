It acknowledged the steps taken by Albania towards greater democracy and stressed the importance of the general elections of 26 May 1996 for the smooth development of the process of democratization.

It called on them also to give public sup\u00ad port to the appeals of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi for a national reconciliation between the military and democratic forces, which would guarantee the rights of all minorities and the full restora\u00ad tion of freedom of expression, political rights, right of association and religious freedom.

In this recommendation, drawn up in conformity with Article 103(2) of the EC Treaty and taking account of the Com\u00ad mission's latest economic forecasts, according to which growth in the European Union as a whole is expected to be around 1.5% in 1996, the Commission in essence confirms the guide\u00ad lines adopted by the Council in 1995. It stresses that, although the Community's economy expe\u00ad rienced a marked slowdown in 1995 and early 1996, it enjoys very favourable economic funda\u00ad mentals (expanding world trade, low inflation, improvement in monetary conditions) which suggest a recovery in activity in the second half of 1996. In order to take full advantage of this, the Commission stresses the need for a macro\u00ad economic policy geared towards growth, em\u00ad ployment and stability, accompanied by appro\u00ad priate structural initiatives. In particular it emphasizes the following points: \u25a1 sustained efforts to consolidate the public finances by Member States; price and exchange\u00ad rate stability, \u25a1 agreement among the social partners on wage developments consistent with price stability and the need to stimulate investment and consump\u00ad tion; \u25a1 strengthened coordination of the economic policies of the Member States; \u25a1 improving the functioning of product and ser\u00ad vice markets, mainly by reinforcing competition, improving the transposai of single market legis\u00ad lation, promoting innovation to favour the emer\u00ad gence of the information society and the devel\u00ad opment of SMEs; \u25a1 improving the operation of the labour market, and mobilizing all actors to tackle the top pri\u00ad ority of fighting unemployment, in particular by developing further the Member States' multian\u00ad nual programmes, and by implementing the con\u00ad fidence pact for employment presented by the Commission to the Turin European Council.

Reference: Commission report: COM(96) 86; Bull. 3-1996, point 1.3.4 Adopted on 9 May. Parliament welcomes the Commission's 1996 Annual Economic Report, and on the whole supports the guidelines for economic policy it sets out. In particular it agrees with the Commission's analysis concern\u00ad ing the adverse effect of currency fluctuations on employment and urges that interest rates be reduced further and that monetary union be pur\u00ad sued. It also supports the stimulation of invest\u00ad ment, including public investment, in particular by an expansion of the role of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund as well as by the creation of Community bonds, for the financing of major Community investment projects. Parliament also recalls its attachment to the European social model, which constitutes a major positive aspect of Europe's competitiveness. OJ C 152, 27.5.1996 Internal market General 1.3.7.

Reference: Commission report to the European Council on the application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles, on simplification and on consolidation ('Better law-making'): Bull. 11-1995, point 1.9.2 Adopted on 8 May. The SLIM initiative is part of the general process under way of simplifying Community rules and improving their efficiency with a view to stimulating job creation and strengthening the competitiveness of European firms. The Commission's SLIM pilot project is a response to a request from internal market min\u00ad isters and seeks to identify concrete progress towards the simplification and improvement of the rules in the areas selected (construction products, the system for collecting statistics on intra-Community trade (Intrastat), ornamental plants and the recognition of diplomas). The originality of the initiative lies in the use of a streamlined work structure: the SLIM teams, consisting of representatives of the Commission and of the interests directly affected by the rules and experts from the Member States, will decide which aspects lend themselves to the simplifica\u00ad tion of Community and national legislation; they will do so quickly, so that they can put specific- ideas to the Council at the end of the year. If the approach proves fruitful, it can be extended to other sectors. COM(96) 204 1.3.8.

It also proposes that workers, SMEs and consumers should be associated with the preparation of European standards at national level. With regard to public procurement, it stresses the lack of linguistic transparency on the part of the Member States and favours completing the preparation of national legislation before any amendment of current Community law. 1.3.9. Economic and Social Committee opin\u00ad ion on the Commission's report to the Council and Parliament on the single market in 1995. Commission report: COM(96) 51; Bull. 1/2-1996, point 1.3.5 Adopted on 29 May. While noting the progress achieved, the Committee is disturbed to find that there are still considerable handicaps in terms of international competitiveness, job creation and monetary stability; it is worried about the pos\u00ad sible effects on the functioning of the single market of the Member States' increasing tenden\u00ad cy to regulate in this sphere. It would also like the Intergovernmental Conference to examine ways of extending qualified majority voting to all questions obstructing the functioning of the single market. Lastly, the Committee calls upon the Commission, when the latter draws up its report in the second half of 1996 on the impact of the single market, to lay down a timetable for the adoption of the remaining measures required by the completion of the market. It would also like to be involved in the planning of a clear explanatory guide for all citizens. Free movement of goods Technical aspects Motor vehicles 1.3.10.

The Green Paper seeks to identify consumers' requirements and concerns in the field of finan\u00ad cial services (banking, insurance, securities trad\u00ad ing), particularly when these services are sold at a distance. On the basis of the debate generated by the Green Paper and the responses received, the Commission will assess whether consumers' needs and concerns are adequately met by exist\u00ad ing legislation and what further initiatives may be needed. In the first part of the Green Paper, the Commis\u00ad sion explains to what extent Community legisla\u00ad tion already takes into account the interests of private consumers of financial services, parti\u00ad cularly with regard to the information that should be available to them, the legal protection of their interests and the means of redress open to them. The second part identifies a number of consumer concerns that have emerged, parti\u00ad cularly in regard to cross-border transactions. Lastly, in part three, the Commission considers future trends in the marketing of financial ser\u00ad vices, including distance selling.

The proposal complements the proposal for a Direc\u00ad tive on cross-border payments and is aimed at reducing 'systemic risk' in payment systems. Systemic risk means the risk that the bankruptcy or failure of one participant in a payment system and its resulting inability to pay its debts when due will have knock-on effects leading to the bankruptcy of other participants. The proposal sets out rules for both domestic and cross-border payment systems as regards settlement finality (definition of when a payment order becomes final) and collateral security (the guarantees lodged by payment system participants in case they are unable to meet their obligations), thus providing a minimum legal framework for pay\u00ad ment systems in the European Union.

The Green Paper, addressed to Parliament, the Member States and interested parties, seeks to analyse single market problems in the area of commercial communication (which comprises all forms of advertising, direct marketing, sponsorship, sales promotion and public relations) and to put forward a possible future policy on this subject. Competition Rules applying to businesses Mergers The Commission first of all makes a compara\u00ad tive analysis of the national rules and shows that the significant differences between them may not only result in inadequate protection of a whole series of public interest objectives, such as the protection of children, but may also increase the cost of supplying such services across borders. Current problems may become worse with the introduction of the information society.

Ciba\u00adGeigy I Sandoz Recognizing that a case\u00adby\u00adcase regulatory re\u00ad view is necessary, the Commission suggests a threefold approach to ensure the introduction of a consistent policy on commercial communi\u00ad cation: \u25a1 adoption of a methodology to deliver a more uniform assessment of the rules. This represents a fact\u00adfinding, optional procedure to assess the proportionality and coherence of national mea\u00ad sures and future Community proposals in the field. Based on the case law of the Court of Jus\u00ad tice and a sound economic evaluation of the functioning of commercial communication, the methodology should help identify the key fac\u00ad tors that future policy decisions should be founded upon: \u25a1 establishment of a committee of Member States' representatives chaired by the Commis\u00ad sion, which would discuss the specific problems raised by the review and the issues relating to new developments particularly in the context of the information society; \u25a1 improved information exchange between the Commission and interested parties. Interested parties are invited to submit their ob\u00ad servations on the Green Paper by the end of Oc\u00ad tober 1996. In the light of the responses received, the Commission will decide the nature and form of its activity in this area. COM(96) 192 1.3.29. Adopted on 2 May. The decision initi\u00ad ates the second stage of investigation. The Ciba\u00adGeigy/Sandoz merger will give rise to a new undertaking called Novartis. Novartis will be the world's leading supplier of crop protec\u00ad tion products and second largest supplier in the pharmaceuticals, animal health and seed sectors. Ciba\u00adGeigy and Sandoz have been market lead\u00ad ers across a range of products in these sectors for many years. Although preliminary findings seem to indicate that, essentially, the merging parties have complementary activities, the Com\u00ad mission's enquiries have nevertheless revealed that, in a number of specific sectors, especially pharmaceuticals, crop protection products and animal health, there are areas where the parties have overlapping activities which require detailed investigation. The pooling of the R &D capabilities of Ciba\u00ad Geigy and Sandoz will create a potential which, at least in the crop protection sector, will be far greater than that of other competitors. The impact of this combined R &D potential on Novartis' market position calls for further inves\u00ad tigation. Krupp 11 Previous decision: Bull. 10\u00ad1994. point 1.2.31 1.3.30. Adopted on 2 May.

Krupp AG Hoesch- Krupp (Krupp) acquires sole control of AST by purchasing shares in FAR, one of the holding companies controlling AST (taking its share\u00ad holding to a total of 90%), and by a change in the articles of association of KAI, the other holding company controlling AST. AST is currently controlled jointly by Krupp and a group of Italian steel-producing and trad\u00ad ing companies following a concentration exam\u00ad ined by the Commission in 1994. The proposed concentration will not signifi\u00ad cantly affect the structure of competition in the relevant steel product markets. Since 1993 the market shares for stainless steel of the under\u00ad takings concerned have decreased overall in Eu\u00ad rope following the expansion of the EU, and in particular the entry of new competitors such as Outokumpu of Finland. In the world market for grain-oriented electrical sheet, the parties' share is small (less than 15%). The market leader, Nippon Steel, has about twice this market share. An increase in the volume of imports of the rele\u00ad vant products into Europe indicates that compe\u00ad tition is working properly. The Commission has accordingly decided to declare the operation compatible with the com\u00ad mon market and with the functioning of the EEA Agreement. BHF-BanklCr\u00e9dit commercial de France 1.3.31. Adopted on 2 May. The decision autho\u00ad rizes the formation of a joint venture between BHF-Bank and Cr\u00e9dit commercial de France. The operation involves the formation of a joint venture, BHF&CCF GmbH, between the Ger\u00ad man BHF-Bank and Cr\u00e9dit commercial de France. The company will provide consultancy services and devise ways of financing large- scale investment and. in this context, will also be active in the aircraft, ship and industrial-plant leasing sector. There will be no overlap between the activities of BHF-Bank and those of Cr\u00e9dit commercial de France because BHF is not present in the mar\u00ad kets covered by the joint venture. BHF&CCF Leasing GmbH will be a new entrant to the leas\u00ad ing sector. Moreover, the joint venture will face competition from firms such as Deutsche Leas\u00ad ing AG, KG Allgemeine Leasing, BNP and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. The Commission has accordingly decided not to oppose the operation and has declared it com\u00ad patible with the common market. Frantschach! Bischof+KleinlVolfin 1.3.32. Adopted on 8 May. The decision autho\u00ad rizes the formation of a joint venture in the flexible packaging sector. The operation involves the acquisition by Frant- schach AG, Vienna, and Bischof+Klein GmbH+Co, Lengerich, Germany (B+K) of a 32% stake and important veto rights in the Ital\u00ad ian family-owned group Volfin SpA, San Pietro in G\u00f9. Through Mondi/Frantschach, Frantschach ac\u00ad counts for the main paper and packaging inter\u00ad ests of its parent Anglo American Corporation and is active at European level as an integrated paper and packaging company. B+K is a diversified European manufacturer of flexible packaging products based on plastics and paper and is currently controlled jointly by its family owners and Frantschach. Volfin is a group of companies active in Italy in the production and distribution of industrial sacks. It has a market share in Italy of about 5%. Frantschach/B+K and Volfin are active in the European market for industrial sacks, with mar\u00ad ket shares of around 15% (Frantschach/B+K) and 1% (Volfin). Consequently, their combined market share will be less than 20%, reaching 40% at national level, a figure which will be increased only slightly by the operation. There are many other integrated competitors in the market, and intra-European trade is fairly sub\u00ad stantial (about 25% of production). The bargain\u00ad ing power of those on the demand side (fillers) is strong and barriers to entry into flexible pack\u00ad aging are low. The Commission has accordingly decided to clear the proposed operation. 20 Bull. EU 5-1996 ",
        "Competition GECIThomson-CSF (II) 1.3.33. Adopted on 15 May. The decision au\u00ad thorizes the formation of a GEC/Thomson-CSF joint venture in non-military sonars. The military aspects of the joint venture are the subject of an Article 223 request by the United Kingdom and French Governments. They have therefore not been notified to the Commission following instructions to the two companies from the two Governments. Although, under the Merger Regulation, the entire concentration would otherwise qualify for examination exclu\u00ad sively by the Commission, Article 223 entitles a Member State to take such measures as it con\u00ad siders necessary for the protection of its essen\u00ad tial security interests connected with the supply of armaments. On the basis of the information provided by the United Kingdom and French Governments, the Commission considers that the instructions not to notify the military aspects of the operation were acceptable in this case. Only a very small proportion of the joint ven\u00ad ture's turnover is generated by non-military products. This concerns sonar devices for ocean\u00ad ography, environmental and offshore activities, marine navigation systems, fisheries and land- based systems. The two parties have small mar\u00ad ket shares for these products. In view of the fact that the operation neither creates nor strengthens a dominant position in any market, the Commis\u00ad sion has declared it compatible with the com\u00ad mon market. Thomson! Daimler-Benz 1.3.34. Adopted on 21 May. The decision au\u00ad thorizes the formation of a joint venture between Thomson SA and Daimler-Benz AG. The parent companies will merge into the joint venture, which will be called ATDM Holding SAS. Their worldwide business activities will be in the field of gallium-arsenide-based micro\u00ad wave components. Thomson SA is a holding company, majority- owned by the French State, that is active mainly in the fields of consumer electronics and elec\u00ad tronics for industrial applications and defence systems. Daimler-Benz AG is a holding com\u00ad pany active mainly in vehicles for passenger and freight transportation, rail systems, aerospace, propulsion systems, defence systems, automa\u00ad tion, energy systems technology and information technology services. In the Community market for the manufacture and sale of gallium-arsenide-based microwave components, the parties have a combined market share of less than 5%. Besides the parties, there are five other suppliers based in Europe. In addi\u00ad tion, the European suppliers face strong compe\u00ad tition from companies based in the United States and Japan (imports into the Community account for about 82% of the overall market value). The Commission has accordingly decided not to oppose the operation and has declared it compat\u00ad ible with the common market and with the func\u00ad tioning of the EEA Agreement. CGEAINetwork South Central 1.3.35. Adopted on 21 May. The decision au\u00ad thorizes a merger in the passenger rail services sector in the United Kingdom. The French undertaking Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'entreprises automobiles (CGEA), which belongs to the G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Eaux group, has acquired, following a tender procedure, the Brit\u00ad ish company Network South Central Limited (NSC), which provides passenger rail services in the south of England. NSC is one of the 25 rail\u00ad way companies resulting from the break-up of British Rail. At the same time. CGEA has also acquired the licence the operate NSC's rail net\u00ad work for a period of seven years. In view of the fact that CGEA carries on no ac\u00ad tivity of any sort in the public passenger trans\u00ad port sector in the United Kingdom, the notified operation raises no competition issues and has accordingly been granted clearance by the Com\u00ad mission. Toro Assicurazioni/Nuova Tirrena 1.3.36. Adopted on 22 May. The decision au\u00ad thorizes the acquisition of sole control of Nuova Tirrena by Toro Assicurazioni.

However, in view of the parties' small market shares (less than 5% for the Fiat group and less than 2% for Nuova Tirrena) and the presence of major competitors (such as Generali, INA, Allianz-RAS, Fondiaria, SAI and Reale) in both markets, the Commission has con\u00ad cluded that the operation does not raise any serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and has therefore decided not to oppose it. Hoechst/'Kl\u00f2cknerlH artfolien 1.3.37. Adopted on 23 May. The decision au\u00ad thorizes the formation of a joint venture between Hoechst and Kl\u00f6ckner Werke.

Both partners will hold 50% of the joint venture. Rigid films are used for a variety of products such as packaging, credit cards and office mate\u00ad rials. The joint venture will have a market share in rigid films made of PVC within the EEA of less than 30%. It will compete with other interna\u00ad tional groups such as EVC and Solvay. Its mar\u00ad ket share in rigid films made of other plastics will be below 5%. The Commission has accordingly decided not to oppose the operation and has declared it compat\u00ad ible with the common market and with the func\u00ad tioning of the EEA Agreement. Ford/Mazda 1.3.38. Adopted on 24 May. The decision au\u00ad thorizes the takeover of Mazda Motor Corpora\u00ad tion (a Japanese firm) by Ford Motor Company (an American firm). Both companies are active in the manufacture, distribution and leasing of motor vehicles and in the provision of financial services to purchasers of such vehicles. The combined Ford/Mazda market share will remain fairly small both for passenger cars and for commercial vehicles (13% and 15% respec\u00ad tively at European level). Moreover, there are strong competitors who are active in all sectors of the motor vehicle market. The Commission has accordingly decided not to oppose the oper\u00ad ation. Emerson/Caterpillar 1.3.39. Adopted on 31 May. The decision au\u00ad thorizes the formation of a joint venture between Emerson Electric Co and Caterpillar Inc. Caterpillar has acquired joint control of F. G. Wilson (Engineering) Limited (FGW), a British firm which, prior to the notified operation, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Emerson. Caterpillar and Emerson are both US multina\u00ad tionals and they manufacture a wide range of electrical and mechanical products and compo\u00ad nents. FGW manufactures diesel generator sets. Although Caterpillar will, following the notified operation, consolidate its position as the world's leading diesel genset maker and will become the undoubted leader at European level, the oper\u00ad ation will neither create nor strengthen a dom\u00ad inant position at either world or European level. In all the relevant geographic markets, the com\u00ad bined market shares of FGW and Caterpillar do not exceed 25%. The same holds true for the various segments of the diesel genset market. The Commission has established that entry bar\u00ad riers are low in this market, that there are a large number of competitors and that, upstream, there are a large number of independent suppliers of intermediate products and components. As a result, the notified operation will not give rise to any serious risks of vertical restrictions. State aid General rules 1.3.40.

Commission decision on the review of the regional aid map. Adopted on 15 May. The Commission has decided to raise no objection to amendment of the Luxembourg regional aid map and of the as\u00ad sociated rates of intensity as proposed by the Luxembourg authorities. The amendments con\u00ad sist primarily in a reduction in the eligible pop\u00ad ulation coverage, alignment on the population coverage rate of the Structural Funds in the con\u00ad text of their regional objectives, concentration of aid on areas needing industrial restructuring, and a relative reduction in aid intensity rates. 1.3.42. Commission decision on the Danish 'Energy 2000' action plan. Adopted on 15 May. The Commission has decided to raise no objections to implementation of a Danish scheme included in the 'Energy 2000' action plan and aimed at reducing CO, emissions through more efficient electricity gen\u00ad eration from new and renewable energy sources (excluding wind power) and through reduced reliance on coal. The objective is to be attained with the help of incentives in the form of pur\u00ad chase guarantees and selling prices which may constitute State aid for the power stations and electricity generators concerned. The Commission considers that reducing CO, emissions is one of the EU's priority objectives, that the aid element is not on such a scale as to affect trade to an extent contrary to the common interest and that, as matters stand in the Com\u00ad munity, the incomplete and imperfect applica\u00ad tion of the 'polluter pays' principle places alter- Requests for information Germany 1.3.44.

Commission decision on an employ\u00ad ment aid scheine for the textile, clothing and leather/footwear industries known as the 'Boro- tra plan'. Adopted on 15 May. The Commission has decided to initiate proceedings in respect of measures planned by the French Government in favour of the textile, clothing and leather/foot\u00ad wear industries. It consists of employment aid in the form of reductions in employers' social se\u00ad curity contributions in the event of the creation or maintenance of jobs. In view of the economic situation of the sectors concerned, the parti\u00ad cularly strong intra-Community competition there and the arrangements for the scheme's implementation, the Commission has serious doubts as to the compatibility of the aid with the common market and with the provisions of its guidelines on employment aid.

The companies in question are Diano, which is located in Calabria, and four companies located in Brescia, namely Ferriera Lamifer, Ferriere Demafer, Lavorazione Metalli Vari \u2014 LMV and Nuova Sidercamuna.

In its resolu\u00ad tion the Council recognizes that cooperation on tourism between the European Community and the Mediterranean non-member partner coun\u00ad tries, as put forward in the Barcelona Declara\u00ad tion, requires action on information, training and promotion.

        "Transport measures are part of the Danish Government's action plan 'Energy 2000' to reduce CO, emis\u00ad sions by 20% in 2005 compared with their 1988 level. They require distributors, on the one hand, to purchase electricity supplied by local com- bined-heat-and-power stations and by producers using new and renewable energy sources and, on the other, to pay a price that reflects the costs they would have to bear for the generation of electricity from traditional fuels and its trans\u00ad port. The Commission notes that this purchase and selling price guarantee may constitute a State aid to the extent that it represents an economic advantage for local power stations and certain electricity producers. However, it concludes that this system merely maintains a pre-existing sit\u00ad uation created by voluntary agreements con\u00ad cluded between producers and distributors and considers that, by aiming to reduce C0 2 emis\u00ad sions, it meets one of the European Union's pri\u00ad ority objectives in the environment field. It concludes that this system does not affect the terms of trade to a degree contrary to the com\u00ad mon interest. Transport Infrastructure General 1.3.88.

In light of the WTO Minis\u00ad terial Conference in December 1996 and the Committee on Trade and Environment meeting in May, Parliament calls for substantial progress to be achieved in respect of issues such as the acceptance and integration in the WTO of multi\u00ad lateral environmental agreements, increased transparency and openness in WTO procedures, including participation by NGOs, the establish\u00ad ment of non-mandatory and non-discriminatory eco-labelling schemes and the taking into ac\u00ad count in WTO dispute settlement procedures of the provisions of both trade and environment instruments. It is concerned that the implementa\u00ad tion of environmental clauses in world trade should not give rise to a new outbreak of protec\u00ad tionism and calls for the establishment of a new international framework for competition that would induce international undertakings to adopt trade practices compatible with environ\u00ad mental protection. While it believes that it must be possible to impose trade restrictions on a country whose actions jeopardize the implementation of a mul\u00ad tilateral environmental agreement to which it is not party, Parliament opposes unilateral import restrictions and recommends recourse in such cases to the WTO arbitration procedure.

        "Agriculture Adopted by the Commission on 29 May. The Commission proposes that a European veter\u00ad inary and phytosanitary inspection agency be created, to take over, as regards inspection tasks, from the Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspec\u00ad tion Office set up in December 1991. It takes the view that the existing structures need to be strengthened to ensure that Community legisla\u00ad tion and standards covering animal and plant health are observed. The agency, located in Ire\u00ad land, in accordance with the conclusions of the Brussels European Council in 1993, would be administered by an executive committee, with a staff of 40, including 30 inspectors, during its first year of operation, and would be financed by 1% of the fees charged by Member States for veterinary inspections, plus a Community sub\u00ad sidy if needed. COM(96) 223 Animal health official veterinary control which had put in place a system for tracing the raw material which would guarantee the origin of the material throughout the whole production chain. The date of resumption of exports of tallow and gelatin would be set after Commission inspections on the spot to verify the application of these provi\u00ad sions and after consultation of the Member States meeting in the framework of the Standing Veterinary Committee. Semen could be exported immediately. This proposal was pre\u00ad sented to the Council after the Standing Veter\u00ad inary Committee failed to deliver an opinion at its meeting on 20 May. 1.3.122.

Proposal for a Council Decision amending the Commission Decision 96/239/EC on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Decision to be amended: Commission Decision 96/239/EC: OJ L 78, 28.3.1996: Bull. 3-1996, point 1.3.127 Adopted by the Commission on 22 May. This proposal, based on the scientific advice issued in April by the Scientific Veterinary Committee, would exclude certain products from the export ban on cattle and cattle products from the United Kingdom imposed in March. The proposal pro\u00ad vides for a resumption of dispatches of semen, gelatin and tallow from British cattle. Produc\u00ad tion of gelatin and tallow in the United Kingdom would be subject to special rules laid down by the international scientific community, and in particular the World Health Organization, with the introduction by the British authorities of a veterinary inspection system involving, in par\u00ad ticular, labelling to show the method of produc\u00ad tion. Meat, meat products and meat-based prep\u00ad arations for human consumption and food for domestic carnivores obtained from bovine ani\u00ad mals which were not slaughtered in the United Kingdom could be exported if they came from establishments in the United Kingdom under Organization of veterinary checks 1.3.124.

The first proposal would establish a new system of veterinary checks on products from non-member countries entering the Community, taking ac\u00ad count of experience gained and the develop\u00ad ments that have occurred in connection with the implementation of Council Directive 90/675/ EEC. It also provides for measures applicable to consignments which have been introduced into the territory of the Community without being presented for veterinary checks and to the re\u00ad entry of Community consignments which have been refused by a third country. Since this pro\u00ad posal affects a number of existing Directives, the purpose of the second proposal is to adapt them accordingly. COM(96) 170 Consolidation 1.3.125.

For those stocks likely to face an increase in fishing effort, the Commission proposes that there be stabilization at the current levels. For stocks in a situation of equilibrium the Commission consid\u00ad ers it necessary only to compensate for technical progress and proposes a 12% reduction in fish\u00ad ing effort.

Previous meeting: Review Conference of the States parties to the United Nations Convention on 'inhuman\" weapons (Vienna, 25 September to 13 October 1995): Bull. 10-1995, point 1.4.3 Meeting held in Geneva from 22 April to 3 May. The Review Conference, attended by representa\u00ad tives of the 57 countries parties to the Conven\u00ad tion, was part of a process initiated in Vienna in October 1995. The amendments made to the Protocol on anti-personnel mines at the confe\u00ad rence were aimed at widening its scope to include non-international armed conflicts, imposing stricter conditions on the use and export of mines, increasing their detectability and making them self-destructing or self-dis\u00ad arming. In the final declaration, the High Contracting Parties reaffirmed their determination to elim\u00ad inate anti-personnel mines and to step up coop\u00ad eration to that end. They also agreed to meet each year to discuss implementation issues and to organize another review conference in 2001 at the latest. 1.4.2.

Reference: Parliament resolution on the failure of the international Conference on anti-personnel mines and laser weapons: OJ C 323, 4.12.1995; Bull. 11-1995, point 1.4.3 Adopted on 23 May. Parliament considered the new provisions of the protocol on landmines adopted at the Geneva Conference ( \u2014\u25ba point 1.4.1) to be too weak, and called on the Council to adopt tougher joint action with a view to achieving a total ban on anti-personnel mines, to draft a common policy to convince those coun\u00ad tries that had not already done so to sign the Conventional Weapons Convention, and to de\u00ad velop a compensation scheme for developing countries that decide to offer their anti-personnel mines for destruction. It called on the Member States to unilaterally ban the production and use of anti-personnel mines, to destroy existing stocks, and, together with the EU, to consider prospects for conducting specific mine-clear\u00ad ance operations.

While recognizing the enormous efforts already made by neighbouring countries to assist the hundreds of thousands of existing Liberian refugees, the Council deplores the fact that the thousands of people crammed in precarious conditions on ships in the area are still in search of a friendly port. It appeals on humanitarian grounds to the neighbouring countries to give at least temporary shelter to these victims of the fighting and affirms its own willingness to give humanitarian aid to cover their most urgent needs. The Council calls on all the Liberian factions to stop the fighting immediately and put the peace process back on track in order to avoid further suffering.' Dominican Republic 1.4.6.

Given the short notice with which the request was formu\u00ad lated, the European Union regrets not being able to ensure adequate coordination of the initiative.

The EU further expresses its appreciation for the active and construc\u00ad tive role played by Ukraine in favour of regional and European stability, and is confident of early approval of the new constitution, whose entry into force will further legitimize Ukraine's aspiration to integrate fully into the family of European nations. The European Union also supports the efforts of the Ukrainian people and its leadership aimed at estab\u00ad lishing a market economy, as a prerequisite lor econo\u00ad mic and social development corresponding to Ukraine's huge human and natural potential. The European Union will continue to use the available instruments to encourage and assist further consoli\u00ad dation of the achievements in the field of economic stabilization and liberalization. The European Union will also assist the process of integration of Ukraine into the world economic order, through support for its efforts to meet the requirements for WTO member\u00ad ship, and will further examine the possibility of recog\u00ad nizing Ukraine's status as an economy in transition. More in particular, the European Union considers that implementation of the Interim Agreement and sub\u00ad sequently the PCA will be a priority for its relations with Ukraine in the coming years. This requires from Ukraine a far-reaching effort to adapt its legislative framework in various domains, economic as well as administrative, an effort which the EU is prepared fully to support. Clear measures of liberalization and privatization as well as stable, non-discriminatory leg\u00ad islation will represent the requisites for a satisfactory level of foreign investment. The European Union expresses its utmost satisfaction and appreciation at the great progress made by Ukraine in the field of arms control and non-prolifer\u00ad ation. We are particularly satisfied with the positive implementation by Kiev of the Lisbon Protocol and associated documents, which has allowed the Start I Treaty to enter into force. The Union also welcomes the process of deactivation of strategic forces, the re\u00ad moval and transfer of warheads and destruction of car\u00ad riers. The Union welcomes Ukraine's accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapons member State, which strengthened the Treaty on the eve of its review and extension conference. We appreciate, as well, the pos\u00ad itive attitude of Ukraine vis-\u00e0-vis the indefinite exten\u00ad sion of the Treaty, which will enhance the non-prolif\u00ad eration regime. As far as nuclear safety is concerned, the Union attaches the greatest importance, as was also stated in the declaration by the G7 and Russia at the Nuclear Safety Summit in Moscow, to the implementation of President Kuchma's decision to close down the Chernobyl nuclear power station definitively by the year 2000. For its part, the EU is, with the G7, committed to assisting with the implementation of this decision, in accordance with the terms of the MOU signed in Ottawa last December. The Union regards with deep interest the ongoing intensification of Ukraine's dialogue with WEU, as a significant step in the process of bringing Ukraine closer to European security structures. In the interests of European stability, the European Union will encourage and facilitate the establishment of good relations between Ukraine and its neighbours. In the same perspective, it is in favour of the renewal of the mandate of the OSCE mission in Ukraine. The meeting of Foreign Minister Udovenko with the min\u00ad isterial troika of the European Union, held on 2 1 May in Rome, confirmed the excellent state of their rela\u00ad tions and endorsed their further evolution in all fields, in parallel with future processes of European Union enlargement, and in full compliance with the terms of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.'

The European Union, which had adopted in May 1995 a joint action in order to reaffirm its commitment to the objective of an overall strengthening of Protocol II to the CCW, considers that the achievements of the Review Conference (such as the extension of the scope of Procotol II, the strengthening of restrictions on the use of mines, the new and immediate prohib\u00ad itions regarding transfers, the provisions on techno\u00ad logical cooperation and assistance, the regular review mechanism, etc.), taken together, are significant steps forward, both in tenns of the landmines protocol itself and of the development of international humanitarian law. The European Union however underlines that the results of the Review Conference fall short of its expectations and of some of the goals set out in its joint action. In particular, the EU should have liked an effective and binding verification mechanism and no periods of deferral of compliance, or at least much shorter ones. The European Union is convinced that the conclusion of this Review Conference is only the beginning of a challenging process which requires constant and wide\u00ad spread efforts and persistence in order to fully achieve its basic humanitarian objectives. The European Union will continue to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel landmines and will strive towards the goal of their eventual elimination as stated in UN Resolution 50/70 (O). In the meantime, the Member States of the European Union will seek early ratification of the amended Protocol II, as well as of the new Protocol IV on blinding laser weapons, and will take urgent steps to ensure their compliance with all the provisions of these two Protocols pending their entry into force. The European Union will also continue to lend active efforts with a view to achieving universal adherence to the CCW. since its objectives can only be effec\u00ad tively attained through implementation of its provi\u00ad sions by the widest number of States and parties to conflicts. Furthermore, the European Union recalls its determi\u00ad nation to pursue its contribution to the international mine clearance efforts. The EU has already contrib\u00ad uted to the UN Voluntary Trust Fund, financing in particular projects in Angola and Mozambique as well as in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. In addition, the EU will consider the possibility of conducting specific demining actions and will continue to seek to that effect the contribution of the WEU to the elaboration and implementation of such actions. The Central and Eastern European countries associ\u00ad ated with the European Union (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia) and the associated coun\u00ad tries Cyprus and Malta, as well as the EFTA countries members of the EEA, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Nor\u00ad way, align themselves with this statement.'

In the report the Commis\u00ad sion sums up progress in 1995 both in the legis\u00ad lative field (in particular, the adoption of the Regulation and the Convention on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and tougher measures in specific sectors) and in the operational field (strengthening partnership with the Member States, developing the initiative for sound and efficient financial management, reor\u00ad ganizing the Commission's central fraud unit, extending the freephone) and reviews the fraud and irregularity cases detected during the year. Of the total, 1 853 cases (1 636 in 1994) involv\u00ad ing ECU 316 million (ECU 489 million in 1994) were in the field of EAGGF Guarantee expendi\u00ad ture; 306 cases (113 in 1994) involving ECU 67 million (ECU 21 million in 1994) were in areas covered by the Structural Funds; and 31 cases (16 in 1994) involving ECU 28 mil\u00ad lion (ECU 23 million in 1994) were in the area of direct expenditure managed by the Commis\u00ad sion. On the revenue front some 2 600 cases of fraud (2 358 in 1994) amounting to ECU 735 million (ECU 577 million in 1994) were detected, mainly concerning customs, especially the transit procedure. The Commission gives a rundown of the main cases investigated, pinpointing a small number of cases of large\u00adscale fraud, which often involve international organized crime and which account for a large share of the sums at stake. It underlines the importance, in this respect, both of partnership between the Member States and the Commission in carrying out the investiga\u00ad tions and of reinforcing cooperation in criminal justice between the Member States to ensure that fraudsters are punished uniformly throughout the Community. And it emphasizes the need to improve the recovery of sums wrongly paid. COM(96) 173 1.6.8. Proposal for a Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) concerning on\u00adthe\u00adspot checks and inspections by the Commission for the detection of frauds and irregularities detrimental to the financial interests of the European Communi\u00ad ties.

Table 15 shows the trends in wages and salaries in real terms (nominal wages and sala\u00ad ries deflated by the private-consumption index) since the beginning of the 1960s in the 15 Mem\u00ad ber States of the European Union, the United States and Japan. It shows that, after increasing far more rapidly in Japan and Europe than in the USA up to 1991, real wages and salaries slowed down markedly in the last few years in both Japan (where they fell in 1992 and 1993) and the European Union (where there was little change in 1993 or 1994). The overall figures for the European Union nevertheless mark wide var\u00ad iations from one Member State to another.

(2) Where a breach of Community law by a Member State is attributable to the national legislature acting in a field in which it has a wide discretion to make legis\u00ad lative choices, individuals suffering loss or injury thereby are entitled to reparation where the rules of Community law breached are intended to confer rights upon them, the breach is sufficiently serious and there is a direct causal link between the breach and the dam\u00ad age sustained by the individuals. Subject to that reser\u00ad vation, the State must make good the consequences of the loss or damage caused by the breach of Commu\u00ad nity law attributable to it, in accordance with its national law on liability. However, the conditions laid down by the applicable national laws must not be less favourable than those relating to similar domestic claims or framed in such a way as in practice to make it impossible or excessively difficult to obtain repara\u00ad tion. (3) Pursuant to the national legislation which it applies, reparation of loss or damage cannot be made conditional upon fault (intentional or negligent) on the part of the organ of the State responsible for the breach, going beyond that of a sufficiently serious breach of Community law. (4) Reparation by Member States of loss or damage which they have caused to individuals as a result of breaches of Community law must be commensurate with the loss or damage sustained. In the absence of relevant Community provisions, it is for the domestic legal system of each Member State to set the criteria for determining the extent of reparation. However, those criteria must not be less favourable than those applying to similar claims or actions based on domes\u00ad tic law and must not be such as in practice to make it impossible or excessively difficult to obtain repara\u00ad tion. National legislation which generally limits the damage for which reparation may be granted to dam\u00ad age done to certain, specifically protected individual interests not including loss of profit by individuals is not compatible with Community law. Moreover, it must be possible to award specific damages, such as the exemplary damages provided for by English law, pursuant to claims or actions founded on Community law, if such damages may be awarded pursuant to similar claims or actions founded on domestic law. (5) The obligation for Member States to make good loss or damage caused to individuals by breaches of Community law attributable to the State cannot be limited to damage sustained after the delivery of a judgment of the Court finding the infringement in question.

The first May part\u00adsession was dom\u00ad inated by debates on 'mad cow disease' (BSE), the Commissions's Annual Economic Report, the situation in Burundi and postal services. After giving a rundown of developments since the Council meeting on 29 and 30 April, in par\u00ad ticular the measures being implemented or announced by the British authorities, Mr Fis\u00ad chler, for the Commission, answered various questions on 'mad cow disease' and the beef market situation. Questions focused on the sta\u00ad tus of research on spongiform encephalopathies, the compensation measures envisaged for farm\u00ad ers and employees in the food industry and the timeliness of partially lifting the ban on exports of British beef products. Mr Fischler empha\u00ad sized the need for the Community as a whole to show solidarity towards those affected by the crisis and for appropriate action to be taken to restore consumer confidence. During the debate on the Commission's Annual Economic Report the majority of speakers expressed approval of the Commission approach but insisted on the need to make the fight against unemployment the top priority of econo\u00ad mic policy. A resolution was adopted at the end of the debate (\u00ad> point 1.3.6). In the field of external relations, Parliament adopted a resolution on Burundi at the end of a lengthy debate in which it expressed concern at the deterioration of the situation there (\u00ad\u00bb point 1.4.96). On the internal front, it adopted a resolution on the Commission communication on racism, xenophobia and anti\u00adSemitism (\u00ad> point 1.2.2). On the legislative front Parliament gave its opinion: \u25a1 under the consultation procedure, on the gen\u00ad eralized system of preferences for agricultural and fishery products (\u00ad> point 1.4.37) and the proposal to designate 1997 European Year against Racism (\u00ad> point 1.2.1); \u25a1 under the cooperation procedure, at first read\u00ad ing, on the fight against AIDS in developing countries ( \u2014\u25ba point 1.4.38) and environmental measures in developing countries in the context of sustainable development (-\u00bb point 1.4.34) and, at second reading, on boatmasters' certif\u00ad icates (-\u00bbpoint 1.3.91); \u25a1 under the codecision procedure, at first read\u00ad ing, on the capital adequacy of investment firms and investment services in the securities field (\u00ad> point 1.3.26) and postal services (\u00ad* point 1.3.102), this last point giving rise to a lively debate, and, at second reading, on pollution caused by motor vehicles (\u00ad\u00bb point 1.3.10). Record of proceedings: OJ Annex 4\u00ad473 Full text of opinions and resolutions: OJ C 152, 27.5.1996 Strasbourg, 21 to 24 May 1.10.2. The key events of the second May part\u00adsession were the formal homage paid by Parliament on 23 May to Mr Altiero Spinelli in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of his death and the debates on agricultural prices, Member States' excessive deficits and hooligan\u00ad ism in sport. The debate on agricultural prices for 1996/97 was coloured by the 'mad cow disease' crisis, the majority of speakers calling for aid measures for the farms affected. Mr Fischler, for the Com\u00ad mission, presented its proposals for support for the beef sector. Other issues debated included the fallowing percentage, the rice and cereals sectors, and measures relating to the permanent abandonment of areas under vine. At the end of the debate Parliament gave its opinion on the Commission's proposals (\u00ad> point 1.3.130). 94 Bull. EU 5\u00ad1996 ",
        "Parliament Mr de Silguy, for the Commission, made a state\u00ad ment at Parliament's request on Member States' excessive deficits. He explained the background to the excessive deficit procedure and stressed that any speculation on the list of countries likely to fulfil the criteria for transition to a sin\u00ad gle currency in 1998 was premature and coun\u00ad terproductive. He also emphasized the impor\u00ad tance of interinstitutional cooperation if progress were to be made in preparing for the introduc\u00ad tion of the single currency and congratulated both Parliament and the Commission on their joint involvement in the launch of the informa\u00ad tion campaign on the euro. During the debate on hooliganism in football stadiums, a number of speakers, albeit deploring such behaviour, expressed the wish that mea\u00ad sures for control and restraint should not be such as to restrict the free movement of persons. Mr Monti, for the Commission, stressed that the Commission did not have the right of initiative in this area and invited all the Member States to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Spec\u00ad tator Violence at Football Matches.
