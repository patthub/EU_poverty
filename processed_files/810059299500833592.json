        "3 Introduction The European standardisation system has been instrumental in tackling the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as shortages of personal protective equipment and medical devices. Looking ahead, the Commission has called for a collective and cohesive recovery focused on accelerating the twin green and digital transitions to strengthen Europe\u2019s competitiveness, resilience and position as a global player 1 . To achieve this, the EU\u2019s standardisation system and its unique public-private partnership have an important role to play. The Commission has therefore asked the European standardisation organisations (ESOs) to undertake a mapping exercise of their activities in relation with the industrial ecosystems (as preliminarily identified in the Staff Working Document accompanying the Recovery Plan 2 ). This staff working document summarises this mapping. It is divided in two sections, with section A focusing on the work of CEN and CENELEC and section B on ETSI. Disclaimer: Views, opinions and facts expressed in this staff working document are however those of the European standardisation organisations only and do not necessarily reflect those of the Commission. Section A: Standardisation work by CEN and CENELEC 1 Aerospace & defence Standardisation plays a crucial role in the market uptake of space services and data, ensuring compatibility, interoperability, and the safety of downstream space applications, i.e. services and data from satellites, be it navigation, observation, telecommunications or combination of these. Work at CEN and CENELEC is ongoing in the following areas. 1.1 Role of standardisation - indicative work \uf02d smartphone compatibility with Galileo so that a caller to an emergency number can benefit from Galileo\u2019s accuracy; \uf02d performance requirements of sophisticated on-board localisation units in connected and automated driving systems; \uf02d the creation of a truly European market for drone services and aircraft; \uf02d aircraft and spacecraft production. 1 COM(2020) 456. 2 SWD(2020) 98 final ",
        "4 1.2 European standardisation organisations In cooperation with ASD-STAN 3 and other CEN or CENELEC technical committees looking into developments in the electrical power supply and hydrogen supply, one important future prospect is the development of hydrogen or electrical (or hybrid) propelled vehicles. Activities of CEN-CLC/JTC 4 5: Current developments and prospects for new Galileo applications - Development of the EN 16803 series standards to support Global Navigation Satellite Systems. 2 Health The interoperability of ICT-enabled solutions and of data exchange are a precondition for improving public health for all European citizens, for improving the delivery of healthcare services, and for unlocking the EU digital single market in health. This includes ICT solutions to support active and healthy ageing and related data exchange. Standardisation work can be beneficial to these aims, along with the European Electronic Health Record exchange format, to ensure interoperability, offer secure access, support data infrastructure and facilitate feedback and interaction between patients and healthcare providers. 2.1 Work ongoing in European standardisation organisations The CEN/TC 251 committee is working towards finalising a technical specification on 'International Patient Summary - Guidelines for European Implementation'. When finalised, it will be submitted to the European Commission, together with the recently published EN 17269:2019 'Health informatics - the international patient summary', as a starting point for potential standardisation work on the prioritised European Electronic Health record Exchange Format, as described in the Commission\u2019s Recommendation 'On a European Electronic Health Record exchange format'. The CEN/TC 251 committee is also working on a technical specification on \u2018Health and wellness apps - Quality and reliability\u2019. This work is in cooperation with the committee\u2019s international counterpart ISO/TC 215. Over recent months, this piece of work has been brought to the attention of the European Commission regarding the EU toolbox for the use of mobile applications for contact tracing and warning in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Draft standards developed by CEN/TC 215 for respiratory equipment is aligned with Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 on medical devices to support European manufacturers in bringing to market products that are safe and clinically effective in supporting patients with respiratory diseases as well as improving long-term health outcomes.

Semiconductor devices capture, generate, process, transfer and act on data. They are key enabling technologies for digitalisation and make a significant contribution to the broader policy objectives of the Green Deal, not only to energy efficiency-enabled solutions. 4.1 Role of standardisation - indicative work \uf02d interoperability with other areas of manufacturing, such as textiles (smart textiles in particular); \uf02d incipient wireless charging technology for mobile phones; \uf02d autonomous driving, setting standards to tackle the potential safety impacts of electronics-enabled vehicles on the road interacting with the environment, infrastructure, other vehicles and humans; \uf02d 6G by setting wireless communication specification standards in particular to support autonomous driving and critical infrastructure operability and security; \uf02d edge computing AI by setting standards to support data processing and storage at device level or closer for specific functions, requiring real-time decision making, and solutions to data privacy, security and energy efficiency issues; \uf02d security, by improving existing standards on hardware-integrated security or setting new standards reflecting at best the EU\u2019s GDPR. 4.2 Work ongoing in European standardisation organisations Work of the CLC/TC 23BX committee on electronic systems (HBES) and sensors for homes and buildings; Work of the CLC/TC 79 committee on door entry systems; Work of the CLC/TC 85X committee on measuring equipment; Work of the CLC/TC 108X & CLC/TC 100X committees linked to HBES and power supplies (USB); Work of the CLC/TC 205 committee on safety and EMC of HBES/building automation and control systems (BACS) (EN 63044 series); ",
        "9 Work of the CLC/TC 210 committee on electromagnetic compatibility standards encompassing emissions (for radio spectrum protection) and immunity (to ensure continued correct operation of products in the presence of electromagnetic disturbances); Standards developed by the CEN/TC 442 committee in support of digitalisation in the construction sector, from the design stage to end-of-life for all built assets. The standards cover the digitalisation of processes and representation of digital twins, buildings, infrastructure and other manmade constructions; CEN/TC 442 has developed standards that support a digital marked for construction products. CEN/TC 442 will also deliver standards to support other construction sector CEN technical committees with data structures to ensure the standards support the digitalisation of the construction sector. 5 Mobility-automotive sector Mobility is the most integrated sector in intra-EU value chains, as almost half of all production (45.3%) relies on cross-border value chains in the single market. It is particularly relevant for the most highly innovative products, such as electric vehicles. Standardisation work may help bring down emissions and the further integration of innovative solutions, in particular, digital technologies in all modes of transport, in an inter- connected way that increases the efficiency of the transport ecosystem. 5.1 Role of standardisation - indicative work \uf02d facilitate intermodal transport to ensure (a) compatibility between mobile assets and infrastructure/transhipment technologies and (b) interoperability between different modes of transport and its infrastructure; \uf02d calculation of emissions for transport and logistics; \uf02d measures on the cleaning of vehicles and on user behaviour regarding passenger transport in public or shared vehicles; \uf02d passenger transport in public or shared vehicles; \uf02d in-freight transport on general aspects of the logistics value chain; \uf02d train-to-ground communication systems; \uf02d digitalisation and automation, multimodality and mobility as a service for the mobility sector as a whole, and for rail as a central part of it; \uf02d cybersecurity as an essential element to ensure the resilience of the mobility system; \uf02d the European rail traffic management system and the (5G-based) automatic train operation, future railway mobile communication system, as well as modular architecture and integrated traffic management for the system; \uf02d digital automatic couplers for freight wagons and innovative solutions for intermodal and combined transport; \uf02d virtual certification (e.g. the use of simulations for the authorisation process); \uf02d condition-based maintenance, and the use of new materials and alternative fuels (batteries, hydrogen and fuel cells, etc.). ",
        "10 5.2 International aspects There is an opportunity to engage with countries in Africa on standardisation in the railway sector in order to support the EU\u2019s industry. This work strand should focus on the use of common technical standards and other interoperability aspects and support the uptake of EU technical specifications. Inter-modality and the expansion of railway networks are important if Africa is to develop a modern transport system that responds to climate change imperatives. In particular, rail connections to ports are strategically important. Currently, no integrated system is in place in the Sub-Saharan region, hindering economic development, the stability of the region and the increase of intra-regional trade. For a multi-state rail system to function, work should focus on the use of common technical standards and other aspects of interoperability. There is also an opportunity to engage with African countries on standardisation in the automotive industry. Africa is an important market for car dismantling and for the re-use of raw materials. Africa is endowed with critical minerals and raw materials needed to produce batteries and other components essential to producing more sustainable vehicles in the EU (notably: lithium, graphite, platinum, natural graphite). The EU calls for responsible sourcing of these materials, and faces strong competition from other trading partners. 5.3 Work ongoing in European standardisation organisations The CEN/TC 301 committee is currently planning the revision of the Repair and Maintenance (RMI) package standards in the light of the impact of Regulation (EU) 2018/858. In parallel, the CEN/TC 301 and CLC/TC 9X committees are working on the draft standardisation request on batteries and on how they could contribute to new deliverables under this framework. Finally, CEN/TC 301 is also addressing vehicle-to-grid communication for road vehicles and implementing the Commission standardisation request on alternative fuels infrastructure 8 . Deliverables in the CEN/TC 326 committee will include workshops for natural gas vehicles fuelled with compressed natural gas (CNG) (revision of EN 13423:2000 \u2018CNG vehicle operations\u2019) and with liquefied natural gas (LNG); Work of the CEN-CLC/JTC 14 committee: revision of EN 16247-4 \u2018Energy audits: transports\u2019; Work of the CEN-CLC Sector Forum on energy efficiency - energy transition, working group on hydrogen, that will address the requirements and needs for hydrogen applications in the rail, maritime (including inland navigation), heavy truck and aviation sectors; The CEN/TC 119 committee is currently exploring and debating an ambitious revision of the European swap bodies standards for intermodal loading units. This initiative could feed in technical requirements to the project to revise the Combined Transport Directive in the 8 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION C(2015) 1330 final of 12.3.2015 on a standardisation request addressed to the European standardisation organisations, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, to draft European standards for alternative fuels infrastructure.

Regarding road freight transport, the railway sector is also active on freight standards; The CEN/TC 256 and the CLC/TC 9X committees, notably (but not only) in the context of interoperability, are developing standards to facilitate the shift of freight transport from road to rail; The CEN/TC 326 committee will address safety requirements for the transport and delivery of LNG as automotive fuel (two strands of work to prepare electrostatic discharge (ESD) and connectors for LNG tanker truck, terminal and fuelling stations); Work of the CEN-CLC/JTC 14 committee to revise EN 16247-4 \u2018Energy audits: transports\u2019; The work of CEN-CLC Sector Forum on energy efficiency and the energy transition, and the working group on hydrogen will address the requirements and needs for hydrogen applications in the rail, maritime (including inland navigation), heavy trucking and the aviation sectors. 6 Low-carbon energy-intensive industries Standardisation work can support the significant reduction of emissions of energy-intensive industries by applying innovative methods that maintain a high level of competitiveness, such as methods that reduce the EU\u2019s dependency on critical raw materials that are crucial for e- mobility, batteries, renewable energies, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, defence and digital applications. Recycling plastics is key to complement the circular economy and to reduce pollution, both being instrumental for the transition to a low-carbon economy. Standards in these areas can support the recyclability of plastic products, the quality of sorted plastic waste and the integration of recycled plastics per product category or market segment. 6.1 Work ongoing in European standardisation organisations The CEN/TC 12 committee will work on the \u2018lower carbon standardisation agenda\u2019 in the context of materials, equipment and offshore structures for the petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries. This will include, for example, work in the ad hoc group on green manufacturing covering aspects of circularity (the R-ladder 9 ) and reducing the carbon footprint. It should cover the following areas of work: power generation; energy optimisation; flares and vents; reliability; drilling; carbon capture, utilisation and storage; and hydrogen; The CEN technical report on the assessment of methane emission in gas transmission and distribution systems, under the leadership of CEN/TC 234, also as part of standardisation 9 The waste hierarchy concept, known as 'Lansink's Ladder': waste prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery including energy recovery, and safe disposal.

        "13 7 Renewable energy The European Commission\u2019s policy framework for climate and energy for 2020 to 2030 (COM/2014/015) highlights the important role of renewable energy in the transition towards a more competitive, secure and sustainable European energy system. The rapid deployment of renewable energy already poses challenges for the electricity system in particular, as it needs to adapt to increasingly decentralised and variable production (solar and wind). Moreover, most renewables development in the EU is driven by national support schemes, which although it can address national and regional specificities can at the same time hinder market integration and reduce cost-efficiency. Standards may provide the solutions needed to adapt the electricity system to increasingly decentralised and variable production and to provide European solutions replacing national and regional specificities. 7.1 Work ongoing in European standardisation organisations Work of the CLC/TC 23BX committee on HBES products; Work of the CLC/TC 23H and CLC/TC 69X committees on EV 11 charging; Work of the CLC/TC 57 committees on data models for hydro power plants and distributed energy resources (Genset 12 , generation aggregation, CHP 13 , \u2026); Work of the CLC/TC 85X committees on measurement equipment; Work of the CLC/TC 88 committees on wind farms and wind turbines including data models; Work of the CLC/TC 205 committees on HBES - Customer energy manager, \u201cSmart Appliances REFerence\u201d (SAREF) - data models for distributed energy resources in smart buildings\u2019 and associated ontologies; Work of the CEN-CLC/JTC 14 committee on the revision of EN 16325 \u2018Guarantees of origin related to energy.

This would mean, in principle, adding a layer of purpose as marketing standards have so far been mainly used in the direct interest of consumers and producers of the products concerned and relate to quality expectations and fair competition. It is important that, if any standardisation initiative is carried out in the agri-food ecosystem, it should consider sustainability as defined in the European Green Deal (COM/2019/640) and the Farm-to-Fork strategy (COM/2020/381), i.e. that it includes economic, environmental and social dimensions. This should mean paying particular attention to the position of farmers in the food chain i.e. assessing the impact of agro-industrial standards on farmers. ",
        "16 8.1 Work ongoing in European standardisation organisations CEN has received a mandate to draft harmonised standards in support of Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 for EU fertilising products, through standardisation request M/564. To provide the market with the means to claim proof of compliance, technical specifications followed by harmonised European standards (hENs) will be developed by CEN/TC 223, CEN/TC 260 and CEN/TC 455.
