        "2 Foreword Climate change is no respecter of national borders. It is a truly global issue that threatens every corner of the world. Yet the sad fact is that those countries in the front line against climate change are the poorest developing countries that have contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions and have the fewest resources to tackle it. Their plight is compounded by their reliance on natural resources through sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries, their vulnerability to more frequent extreme weather and a history of poverty and conflict. The climate change threat is not receding. It is increasing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that, even if emissions could be reduced to below half of 1990 levels by 2050, a temperature rise of up to 2\u00baC would be difficult to avoid. Unmitigated climate change beyond 2\u00baC is likely to trigger a number of tipping points and lead to further accelerated, irreversible and unpredictable climate changes. Meanwhile the most vulnerable and poorest people around the world are already experiencing the effects of climate change: temperatures are rising, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and water and food are becoming scarcer. Climate change is, therefore, not only an environmental problem. It is also a development problem that is overburdening developing countries and threatening to hinder the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It could wipe out years of development efforts. The EU is taking decisive action on addressing climate change and making it an integral part of EU development aid. In 2007, it established the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA), its flagship initiative to strengthen dialogue, exchange of experiences and cooperation on climate change with developing countries most vulnerable to climate change, in particular the Least Developed Countries and the Small Island Developing States. The GCCA promotes innovative and effective approaches to address climate change and makes sure through mainstreaming that it is at the heart of the development planning of partner countries. It also employs effective delivery methods such as budget support, ensuring full alignment with developing countries\u2019 agendas, the use of country systems and long-term capacity building, ownership, and sustainability. With support from the GCCA, partner countries are implementing climate change programmes on the ground, integrating climate change into national and sector strategies, reducing deforestation and disaster risks, and promoting adaptive agriculture and clean energy. Through the GCCA, the EU is spearheading the drive towards low-emission and climate-resilient development. Under the GCCA initiative EU Member States including the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Ireland and Sweden, and the European Commission are joining forces to provide common donor support through joint financing and programming. From 2008 to 2011, the GCCA has contributed over \u20ac200 million in support of more than 30 country and regional programmes in the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. An additional 11 countries and regions are expected to benefit from the GCCA in 2012 and 2013. This publication shows examples of the GCCA\u2019s wide-ranging programme and provides some early results and lessons learned. Having learnt those lessons and understood where our strengths lie, we can then set about achieving even more through the GCCA in the future.

        "4 The GCCA fosters dialogue and exchange of experiences between the EU and developing countries on climate policy and on practical ap- proaches to integrate climate change into develop- ment policies and budgets. The results feed into the discussions on the post- 2012 climate agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and inform the technical and financial cooperation sup- ported by the GCCA. The dialogue takes place at global, regional and national levels. The GCCA provides technical and financial support to targeted developing countries to integrate climate change into their development policies and budgets and to implement adaptation and mitigation interventions, with a focus on five priority areas (See Box 1). The technical and financial support in turn informs the dialogue and exchange of experiences at regional and global levels between the EU and partner countries. The Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) is an initiative of the European Union (EU) to strengthen dialogue and cooperation on climate change with developing countries most vulnerable to climate change. What is the GCCA? The GCCA focuses on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Small Island Developing States (SIDS), which are often the most affected by climate change but have the fewest resources to tackle it. The initiative was launched in 2007 and is coordinated by the European Commission (EC). About the Global Climate Change Alliance Adaptation . The GCCA promotes the improvement of the knowledge base of the effects of climate change and the design and implementation of appropriate adaptation actions, in particular in the water and agriculture sectors. The GCCA builds on National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and other national plans. Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). In LDCs 60% of emissions originate from land use change, primarily deforestation. The GCCA therefore supports solutions to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from deforestation and create incentives for forest protection, while preserving livelihoods and ecosystems depending on forests. Enhancing participation in the global carbon market. The GCCA aims to promote a more equitable geographic distribution of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) by building the capacities of partner countries, particularly in the field of energy. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The GCCA seeks to help developing countries to prepare for climate- related natural disasters, mitigate their risks and limit their impacts. 1 2 3 4 5 The GCCA focuses the technical support along five priority areas : Mainstreaming climate change into poverty reduction and development efforts The GCCA supports the integration of climate change into national development planning, from policymaking and budgeting to implementation and monitoring. This priority area, which focuses on institutional strengthening, is often combined with another priority, in particular, adaptation.

        "5 How are needs prioritised under the GCCA? Why a Global Climate Change Alliance? Scientific data analysed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides compelling evidence that climate change is happening and that the observed acceleration is the direct result of increased emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from human activity. Projections of the effects of climate change show that LDCs and SIDS will be hit earliest and hardest. These are the countries and territories with the fewest resources to prepare for, and adapt to, these changes in their climate. This means climate change is a major threat to meeting The criteria to select countries that will benefit from the GCCA build on the Bali Action Plan (2007) which stresses the need for action on adaptation, particularly with LDCs, SIDS and African countries affected by drought, desertification and flooding. To be eligible for GCCA funds, a country has to be among the 73 LDCs or SIDS recipients of aid. An assessment is made of each country\u2019s vulnerability to climate change, in particular its risk related the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for many of these countries. The Stern Report published in 2006 demonstrated that the world does not need to choose between averting climate change and promoting growth and development. Not acting on climate change will, in the long term, be a lot more costly to the global economy than acting on it now. The report explicitly highlighted the global imbalance in terms of the costs of climate change on the poorest countries and called for the international community to support them. to floods, droughts, storms, sea level rise or glacier melting and the coastal zone elevation, taking into account the proportion of the population at risk. The importance of the agricultural sector, as one of the most sensitive sectors to climate change, is also included in this assessment, which uses United Nations (UN) and other expert sources. The assessment also incorporates an estimate of the country\u2019s adaptive capacity using the United Nations The EU has taken a lead in promoting international action to address climate change. In line with the IPCC\u2019s findings, the EU established the GCCA to tackle the urgent, linked challenges of climate change and poverty reduction in developing countries. With an emphasis on aid effectiveness and integrating climate change into national development planning, the work of the GCCA supports the adoption of purposeful action at national and regional levels as well as negotiations towards an international post-2012 agreement. Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Index as a source. Finally, eligible countries are assessed for their engagement in dialogue on climate change and expression of interest by their government to receive support from the GCCA. Funds are then allocated to countries, based on availability of resources and on population figures. ",
        "6 What are the key developments to date? From 2008 to 2011, the GCCA has committed over \u20ac200 million from the EC budget, the 10th European Development Fund, and from contributions from Ireland, Sweden, Estonia, Cyprus and the Czech Republic. This includes fast start finance pledged at the UNFCCC 15th Conference of the Parties (CoP) in Copenhagen in 2009. To date, fast start finance from the EC, Ireland, Estonia and Cyprus has provided \u20ac74 million to GCCA-supported interventions in Africa, Asia and the Pacific. By the end of 2011, the GCCA will be funding programmes to address climate change in 25 countries across the globe. The GCCA is supporting the mainstreaming of climate change into national development planning in over half of these countries. It is supporting adaptation programmes in climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, coastal zone protection and land and water management. The GCCA is also active in the fields of forestry, DRR, and clean energy. These programmes in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific are strengthening the capacity of some of the most vulnerable developing countries to tackle climate change. As well as supporting individual countries, the GCCA is active at a regional level, supporting programmes that tackle climate change issues that cross the borders of individual countries. That means pooling resources, strengthening capacities, sharing knowledge and working in partnership with the regional organisations already in place to build on existing work and successes. The global range of these GCCA supported programmes is illustrated in Map 1. In its role promoting dialogue and the exchange of experiences, the GCCA is rolling out a programme of events. It has organised regional conferences in Bangladesh in May 2010, in Addis Ababa in October 2010, and in Vanuatu and Belize in March 2011. The aim here has been to support wider EU initiatives working towards a shared vision on tackling climate change. The GCCA is also organising regional workshops on mainstreaming climate change into national development planning and budgeting. It is expected that over 250 senior officials from ministries of finance, planning and environment will have received this training by the end of 2012. This is a far-sighted initiative to provide the planners and decision makers responsible for national policymaking and budgeting with the tools and expertise to ensure climate change is embedded in their countries\u2019 development policies and budgets. From programmes delivering the changes needed to safeguard the future of countries most at risk from climate change, to initiatives that are promoting international dialogue and consensus on the way forward, the GCCA is paving the way for lasting progress on climate change.

        "10 Using innovative and effective approaches The GCCA was established to help developing countries tackle climate change in a way that integrates climate change with wider development objectives. It is complementary to, but different from, other climate change funds or initiatives. What sets the GCCA apart is its emphasis on innovative and effective approaches to delivering climate change support and addressing the capacity needs of partner countries. The GCCA is driven by a commitment to the principles of aid effectiveness established by the Paris Declaration (See Diagram 2) and the Accra Agenda for Action. This commitment translates into a range of delivery methods and approaches, such as joint programming and financing, sector policy support programmes, climate change mainstreaming and budget support. The GCCA\u2019s sharp focus on mainstreaming climate change into national and sector development planning and budgeting ensures that climate change is addressed in a systematic, long term and sustainable way. It ensures the use of country agendas and systems and fosters institutional strengthening and capacity building. Mainstreaming also paves the way for budget support, a delivery method used and promoted under the GCCA. Budget support involves channelling funds directly to partner governments\u2019 treasuries subject to a set of agreed conditions. It fully uses country agendas and systems, encourages dialogue and ownership and allows partner countries to make best use of all available resources to tackle climate change in the context of poverty reduction and development more generally. Another added value of the GCCA comes from a double layer of action: the dialogue and exchange of experiences and the cooperation though country or regional interventions. This double stream enables the GCCA to promote the transfer of knowledge from the field, informing the international climate change debate and decision- making, at the highest level. It also ensures coherence between political commitments or internationally agreed principles like the MDGs and aid effectiveness and the way climate aid translates into practice. Thanks to these innovations, the GCCA is in a unique position to help developing countries vulnerable to climate change respond to its impacts. ",
        "11 Diagram 2: The Paris Declaration pyramid Applying aid effectiveness principles International development aid has not always delivered the expected development results on the ground. The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness was formulated in 2005 to address this and today over 100 countries adhere to it. The Paris Declaration is founded on five core principles \u2013 ownership; alignment; harmonisation; managing for results; and mutual accountability, as illustrated by Diagram 2. These core principles underpin the GCCA approach to supporting partner countries. The GCCA promotes ownership and alignment through support to climate change mainstreaming, the use of decentralised management, sector policy support programmes and budget support, as well as through dialogue. The GCCA aims to complement and support ongoing frameworks and processes and it engages in joint financing and programming and partnership working whenever possible, supporting the harmonisation principle. The use of sector and budget support puts the focus on using effective performance assessment frameworks as each tranche of aid is delivered once agreed criteria are met. This is in line with the Paris principle of managing for results. The GCCA is also committed to mutual accountability, sharing knowledge and lesson learning. The Accra Agenda for Action of 2008 has built on the success of the Paris Declaration, with an emphasis on three main areas: ownership; inclusive partnerships and delivering results. These principles have shaped the GCCA approach to delivering climate finance and supporting countries most vulnerable to climate change. 1 5 4 2 3 Developing Countries set the AgenDA Donors Align with Country AgenDAs Donors estAblish Common ArrAngements Donors simplify proCeDures Donors shAre informAtion Donors use Country systems ownership (Partner Countries) managing for results m u t u a l A cc o u n t a b ili t y Alignment (Donors-Partners) harmonisation (Donors-Donors) ",
        "12 Piloting budget support for climate change In an increasingly complex climate finance landscape, the GCCA is piloting the use of budget support as a delivery mechanism to enhance aid effectiveness. With budget support, aid goes directly to the partner governments\u2019 treasuries subject to agreed conditions. It is released to the countries in tranches as set eligibility criteria or targets have been reached. The objective is to fully support country agendas and systems, encouraging policy dialogue, political commitment, ownership and sustainability. Ultimately, climate change would be fully integrated into a country\u2019s overall development. The GCCA is using various forms of budget support. Climate change programmes in the Seychelles, the Solomon Islands and Mauritius - which aim to integrate climate change into overall poverty reduction and development efforts - are delivered through general budget support. The GCCA also makes use of sector budget support when a programme is meant to address climate change at the level of a whole sector, from policymaking to budgeting and implementation. Typically, the GCCA enhances the adaptation or mitigation components of existing sector programmes. In Guyana, GCCA sector level actions have focused on the implementation of the National Mangrove Management Action Plan. In other countries there are different focuses. In Samoa, it is the water sector; in Rwanda, land tenure; and in Bhutan, the natural resources sector. The GCCA believes there is significant potential for increased use of budget support, as highlighted by Diagram 3 which shows the distribution of different aid modalities used to date. As climate change finance is expected to increase in the coming years, the use of budget support provides interesting prospects to improve the absorptive capacities of developing countries. A move from project specific to sector level support also leads to better climate risk management and helps to ensure that climate change adaptation is integrated into a country\u2019s overall development effort.

        "13 Map 2: Overview of GCCA mainstreaming programmes of climate change not just today, but for years to come. Climate change mainstreaming translates the principles of aid effectiveness into practice through the use of country agendas and systems and by supporting institutional strengthening and capacity building in the long term. Mainstreaming also helps partner countries prepare the ground for possible future use of budget Climate change is inherently linked to all sectors of development and the achievements of the MDGs. That means climate change needs to be a central not peripheral consideration in national planning and development. This is the case for all countries, but it is particularly important for LDCs and SIDS, which often have fragile economies and face a range of different challenges with limited capacities to address them. The GCCA is, therefore, committed to the practice of mainstreaming, which means embedding climate change into national and sector development planning and budgeting, as illustrated by Map 2 showing the GCCA mainstreaming interventions. Mainstreaming is all about sustainability. It is a way of ensuring that partner countries are in a strong position to tackle the effects Mainstreaming climate change GCCA partner country Regional programmes: Lower Mekong Basin Eastern and Southern Africa Western Africa South Pacific ",

In certain cases, such as Nepal, Vanuatu and the Pacific, the GCCA programmes explicitly aim at having future assistance for climate change being delivered through budget support, and for example, include in their activities governance and fiduciary risk assessments or the strengthening of public financial management. Awareness raising and increasing capacities are also essential. The GCCA is spreading the word and passing on the tools and knowledge for successful mainstreaming through a range of initiatives at country and regional levels. These include country and regional programmes as well as a series of workshops all over the world which bring together senior climate experts and budgetary planners from the ministries of partner countries. The workshops involve exchanging experiences and knowledge about mainstreaming and the tools to make it happen. The GCCA\u2019s vision is for a global effort to place climate change at the heart of national and regional policymaking and planning. ",

Reaching across continents and safeguarding livelihoods, the GCCA has channelled over \u20ac200 million in support of 32 programmes in over 25 countries and regions. Africa, the continent which has contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions and is suffering acutely from the impact of climate change, has received a total of \u20ac108.4 million to date. This represents 54 per cent of the GCCA\u2019s total climate funding. GCCA initiatives in developing countries across the world are making a difference in key sectors affected by climate change. Programmes that focus on climate change mainstreaming are under way in 13 countries including Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos and Nepal in Asia, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Seychelles in Africa and Solomon Islands in the Pacific. The GCCA is funding programmes addressing adaptation in climate sensitive sectors like agriculture in Uganda, coastal zone management in Gambia, Guyana and Senegal, land management in Rwanda, and water management in Belize and Samoa. It is working at the local level in Tanzania. In Mauritius, the GCCA is addressing the need for energy efficiency. It is funding forestry programmes in Mali, Benin, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo, addressing disaster risk reduction in Jamaica, and adaptation or mitigation more generally in Bangladesh, Maldives and Vanuatu. Whatever and wherever the project, from the Pacific Islands to the heart of Sub-Saharan Africa, the GCCA supports national or sector priorities (See Diagram 4 and Diagram 5). At country level, the interventions of the GCCA are designed in close collaboration between EU Delegations and national governments, and they are shaped in close consultation with relevant stakeholders.

        "19 Restoring mangrove forests in Guyana Like many coastal countries in the Caribbean, Guyana is vulnerable to increased coastal erosion as a result of climate change. A GCCA initiative to restore and plant new mangrove forests has proved an interesting way of contributing to carbon sequestration and bolstering sea defences. Activities include rehabilitating and mapping mangrove fields, and raising awareness of their benefits as a means of tackling climate change so that the Guyanese government incorporates the protection and development of sustainable mangrove forests in its forest planning and regulations. The rehabilitation element of the programme has involved selecting existing mangrove forests for protection and identifying sites that are more difficult to rehabilitate but are of high value in terms of sea defence. To date, mangrove seedlings have been planted along different sections of 4.5 km of coastline. The project has been embraced by the local communities and is contributing to climate change abatement and mitigation in Guyana. The programme is an excellent example of working to reduce the vulnerability of local people to climate change through nature conservation. The momentum built by its success will contribute to long term sustainability. The programme is also proving to be pioneering as it relies mainly on sector budget support, a new and effective method to deliver climate change aid to developing countries. \u201cThe efforts to protect, restore and manage Guyana\u2019s mangroves forests efforts will continue long after the three-year Guyana Mangrove Restoration Project has ended.\u201d Agriculture Minister Robert Persaud, Guyana Title: Sustainable Coastal Zone Protection through Mangrove Management.

Ethiopia faces uncertainty over rainfall and climate models suggest that the country will see further warming of between 0.7 and 2.3 degrees Celsius by 2020. Climate change has already led to an increasing number of hot days and the effects on crop and livestock production threaten food and water shortages, further hindering economic growth. For these reasons, the GCCA is supporting a programme which aims to increase the awareness and capacity of Ethiopian Government institutions and the rural population to deal with climate change. The Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority has been designated to deal with the climate change challenge and it is working to mainstream climate change into policy, regulatory and strategic development planning. In support of this objective, the GCCA programme includes a range of measures. Visit to a mangrove forest, Guyana Rehabilitated Bahra watershed, Medebay Zana District, Ethiopia ",

        "23 The project has a particular focus on the most vulnerable communities in rural areas. The aim is to deliver in three areas \u2013 capacity building; awareness and training; and field operations. Efforts in the field of capacity building include reviewing sector development strategies in order to mainstream environmental and climate change themes against the most recent legal and policy framework. There is also a plan to improve the coordination and monitoring of climate change interventions and strengthening the environment monitoring system. On awareness and training, the programme is looking to increase understanding of climate change among key stakeholders and improve the responsiveness of development agents at all levels. On-the-job training is planned at a local level and information networks are being identified to promote climate change awareness. In field operations, the emphasis is on involving environment institutions in promoting innovative solutions to climate change. There will also be pilot projects, mainly in the agrarian, agro-forestry and DRR sectors. Key achievements to date: Completion of the Institutional Performance and Impact of Climate Change studies; approval of budget and activity plan for 2011 based on the National Annual Economic and Social Plan; terms of reference for the National Climate Change Strategy are nearing completion. Lessons learned: Environment and climate change are not yet adequately treated as cross-cutting issues at policy level, with environmental management too often perceived as an obstacle to economic development. As a result, investment decisions are often made with little consideration to environment regulation and sustainable development. Institutional and capacity strengthening and financial support to government institutions responsible for the coordination of climate change is crucial for a sustainable integration of the issue in sector policies and investment decisions. The way forward: Further support for strong coordination; approval by the steering committee of the climate change action plans of the government institutions at central and provincial levels and integration into the Government National Annual Economic and Social Plan 2012.

It focuses on areas including coordinating national policymaking, monitoring the implementation of the national climate change strategy, policy and plans, increasing awareness and knowledge sharing and preparing for a nationally owned trust fund. In addition, mainstreaming road maps and guidelines are prepared to support the integration of climate change into sector activities and work is progressing to address policy and regulatory gaps for successful mainstreaming. The country\u2019s negotiation capacity on climate change is also being strengthened. Under the programme, an outreach and learning campaign is under way targeting all regions and vulnerable groups. A particular effort is being made to include women in the process, both as beneficiaries and as participants and decision makers. Key achievements to date: Inter-ministerial technical body established; road map for sector climate change mainstreaming and climate change strategic plan defined and endorsed; trust fund secretariat established; second National Forum on Climate Change organised; common platform for technical and policy dialogue in place; 16th UNFCCC CoP attended by inter-ministerial delegation; increased awareness and information sharing with public; launching of two key supported national documents to create opportunities for increased communication and public debate on climate change impacts; undertaking of grant operations management to allow Government agencies and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to access grants. Lessons learned: Good national, sub-national and inter-ministerial communication is key to sharing of lessons learned and up-scaling of successful approaches; the shift to national-owned climate change institutional and financing arrangements is linked to the national government reforms; support is needed for the Government to put in place adequate policies and procedures; outreach on understanding of climate change response as development and livelihood issues is crucial; capacities of local civil society is key to any climate change response. The way forward: Further the capacity and visibility of the national climate change committee; strengthen partnerships and develop a collaborative environment between Government agencies and between the Government, communities and the private sector; complete the climate change strategic plan in a consultative manner; pilot outreach activities; website and knowledge management platform; second call for proposals; roadmap for the nationalisation of the Trust Fund. 2008 2018 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Project Start February 2010 Project End December 2012 Crop diversification, Cambodia ",

Sector: Overall development and poverty reduction. Budget: Total value \u20ac2.8m GCCA, through general budget support. Partners: Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Management and Ministry of Planning. The Solomon Islands are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and the weakness of the economy has aggravated this vulnerability. The country is heavily dependent on natural resources and the decline of logging has affected the economy. Through this climate assistance programme the GCCA is working to strengthen the Government capacity for policy enhancement, coordination and implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy. The programme will, in particular, contribute to climate change adaptation and reduce the vulnerability of communities living on low-lying atolls, artificially built islands and other low lying coastal areas. The programme intends to support effective mainstreaming of climate change and disaster risk reduction priorities in national development policies and in key sector strategies; to ensure that budgets are allocated to key institutions carrying out climate change and disaster risk reduction activities; and to strengthen institutional capacities within the Ministry of Environment and the National Disaster Management Office. Consultations with stakeholders are undertaken for the preparation of the National Climate Change Strategy. This will involve the identification and ranking of affected communities according to their level of risk and realistic cost estimates for climate change adaptation measures including relocation. \u201cThere is growing concern seeing first-hand the impacts of climate change as it slowly erodes the very low lying atoll of Ontong Java.

It affects virtually every corner of the globe regardless of a country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, or its capacity to deal with the effects of climate change. Often neighbouring countries that share a common geography such as a river basin face similar climate change challenges. This is the case in the Lower Mekong Basin, for example, and in regions such as the Pacific and the Caribbean, where a number of small island states face similar climate change issues but are ill equipped to deal with them because of their size or the fragility of their economies. Many partner countries supported by the GCCA also belong to regional organisations that already have programmes in place to tackle climate change in their member countries. Building partnerships and ensuring complementarity underpin the work of the GCCA, and for these reasons the GCCA currently supports seven regional programmes to complement its existing 25 country interventions. For regional programmes, the emphasis is generally on capacity building, applied research and technical assistance, and promoting the exchange of experiences between countries. GCCA supported programmes on the African continent are delivered through a number of existing organisations that seek common development objectives for their member countries. These include the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). In West Africa, the partner organisations are ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, and CILSS, le Comit\u00e9 permanent Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la S\u00e9cheresse. The GCCA is also working with the African Union on continent wide initiatives. In the Pacific, the GCCA is working with the University of the South Pacific and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) across various Pacific states. In the Caribbean, the GCCA is supporting the 17 member countries of the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) through the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC); whilst in south-east Asia, the GCCA is supporting the Mekong River Commission\u2019s (MRC) Climate Change Adaptation Initiative (CCAI) (See Table 2).

        "32 Increasing the climate resilience of the Pacific Islands As half the population of the Pacific Islands live near the coast, these island states are highly exposed to threats such as sea level rise and extreme weather events, both in terms of economic opportunities and subsistence. They have limited opportunities for economic growth, face structural capacity constraints and are vulnerable to recurrent natural disasters including cyclones and typhoons. Climate models suggest the Pacific region will continue to warm. Coastal communities, atoll islands and the densely populated low-lying deltaic regions on larger islands are particularly vulnerable to even small changes. For all these reasons the GCCA is supporting the governments of the Cook Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Tonga and Tuvalu and the efforts of regional bodies in tackling climate change. Awareness of the climate change risk is very high on a regional level, but there is a lack of national strategic frameworks in place at a national level.

Projects on the ground are tailored to countries\u2019 needs. They cover sectors such as the sustainable management of natural resources, food security, waste management, water, health, tourism, fisheries, coastal management and urban planning. Activities at a national level include shaping adaptation road maps for each country, implementing projects outlined in these road maps, reviewing existing plans, holding coordination workshops and implementing pilot projects. At a regional level, the focus is on strengthening regional capacity to support national adaptation needs and the establishment of innovative regional coordinating mechanisms. Key achievements: Contribution agreement with the SPC signed in July 2011; initial steps towards establishing the project team taken. Lessons learned: From the identification and formulation of the project a key lesson is that a system embracing both \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cbottom-up\u201d approaches to adaptation has the best chance to improve the adaptive capacity of Pacific inhabitants. As part of this, facilitating autonomous adaptation by focusing on the positive aspects of cultural and communal-based societies in the Pacific is often a decisive element, particularly if combined with an active engagement with all stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and Regional Pacific Organisations. The way forward: The next steps are to carry out in-country assessments and consultation missions in each of the nine countries to identify priorities and to prepare draft national implementation plans. This will coincide with the start of sub-regional technical training workshops, short term technical advisory support, and pilot adaptation projects.

In the Lower Mekong Basin, the GCCA is supporting the efforts of an existing initiative by the MRC to implement priority adaptation and mitigation measures and to integrate climate change into the development strategies of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Viet Nam. In 2007, the MRC called for a regional initiative to provide knowledge, tools and capacity building to help the member countries adapt to the effects of climate change. These include more droughts and flooding and changes to the natural ecosystems, agriculture and food production. As a result, the Climate Change Adaptation Initiative (CCAI) was established in 2009 with a long- term programme for climate change and planning running until 2025. The CCAI focuses on addressing basin-wide and trans-boundary issues and the sectors for which the MRC has a mandate and experience, for example, floods and droughts, agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture, hydropower, and river transport. The initiative covers the piloting and demonstration of adaptation planning and implementation throughout the region drawing lessons learned from existing practices to improve performance and influence strategies and plans. Through the initiative, the GCCA also supports capacity building and the use of specific tools for adaptation. Using these mechanisms, it aims to see strategies and plans for adaptation at various levels being put in place, regularly updated and integrated with appropriate development plans, while the implementation is monitored and reported on a regular basis. In addition, regional cooperation, \u201cThe sea comes closer and has claimed the mangroves first, and then the eucalyptuses.

These relate to demonstrating best practices to improve performance and influence planning and strategy development across sectors; improving the capacity to manage and adapt to climate change at different levels and planning stages including through the use of tools; ensuring that strategies and plans for adaptation are integrated with development plans, monitoring and reporting; and regional cooperation, exchange and learning. By supporting long-term existing climate change initiatives and working with partners, the GCCA is delivering on its key objectives and leveraging support for one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change. Key achievements of the CCAI to date: Number of demonstration projects established; Institutional and working arrangements established; climate change impact and vulnerability assessment tools developed; collaboration fostered. Lessons learned: The need to maintain a strong strategic framework and steering arrangements for the CCAI; high quality inputs from expert networks, technical working groups and partners are required to guide the CCAI; a regional network of local demonstration projects is a key foundation for the CCAI. The way forward: A regional network of local demonstration projects are a key priority; basin-wide, sector and trans-boundary assessments of wetland and ecosystems, flood and drought risks and hydropower is also a priority; the establishment of a Mekong Panel on Climate Change and a Mekong Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan are also high on a raft of agenda items; in addition, the network and partnerships will be expanded; and gender mainstreaming pursued.

The countries of West Africa face a stark future as climate change affects food and water security at the same time as the population increases, with a prediction that it will double by 2050. Climate change is already adversely affecting the people of West Africa. Temperatures are rising and since the 1990s there have been alternating dry and wet years combined with extreme weather events. As a result agricultural production and water supply have become increasingly unstable. Land degradation is also a major problem. The GCCA is addressing the challenge by supporting ECOWAS and CILSS, through a \u20ac4 million programme to tackle climate change. ",
        "37 Launched in March 2011, the programme focuses on increasing the capacity of the countries and the region to formulate and implement climate change policies and strategies. The emphasis is on integrating low carbon and resilient climate change practices and techniques into regional and national development strategies. The programme also aims to strengthen the capacity of the countries and the region to deal with climate negotiation themes that are particularly important to the Sahel and West Africa. These include adaptation, technology transfer, the carbon market, and agriculture, forestry and land use. The programme is working to improve access to climate information through systems of weather information and an enhanced capacity to analyse climate data and trends, so as to reduce climate related risks and disasters. \u201cDroughts, floods and storms are likely to increase, not only in frequency but also in intensity.

The aim is to promote climate change as a core issue in the partnership between these countries and the EU, building confidence and supporting a convergence of visions on how best to address climate change. Through its wide network of delegations, and its established policy dialogue with partner governments, the EU has the appropriate channels to effectively raise awareness of this issue of global concern with a view to integrating it in the national development policy context. In particular, the dialogue can focus on the importance of complementing projects with macro or sector-level support, thereby increasing the chances to promote a cross-sector approach towards better climate risk management. Such an approach can help ensure that climate change adaptation is no longer dealt with exclusively by environmental ministries, but is integrated into a country\u2019s overall development effort, and EU development cooperation. The GCCA national and regional approaches are parallel and complementary. At national level, the dialogue focuses first and foremost on the effective integration of climate change into national development strategies, plans and budgets, and on identifying and implementing concrete actions to tackle climate change. At regional level, the emphasis is on bringing key As an example, the EU Strategy for the Pacific adopted in 2006 includes a commitment to systematically integrate climate change into development cooperation.

Regional conferences in Asia, Africa, the Pacific and the Caribbean have provided a forum for dialogue and commitment on climate change. \u201cNow the time has come to for us to speak up loud. If we don\u2019t unite and make ourselves heard, the outcome might leave us as the worst victims of climate change.\u201d Honourable Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh In Asia, the GCCA complements existing forums, with a sharp focus on the LDCs in the region, many of which share common climate change concerns. The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) has provided a forum between Europe and Asia since 1996. Each year ASEM summits and meetings maintain dialogue on a wide range of topics including disaster preparedness, climate change and development. The GCCA has taken the dialogue a step further through its Asia Regional Conference held in Dhaka, Bangladesh , in May 2010 . High level politicians including the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and the European Commissioner for Climate Action attended the event. Countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos, Maldives, Myanmar and Nepal, all highly vulnerable to climate, also sent representatives. The participants Rehabilitation of livelihoods after the passage of Cyclone Sidr, Bangladesh agreed to work together to mobilise international support for stronger action on climate change. The conference led to Bangladesh, Cambodia, Maldives and the EU signing a joint declaration, agreeing to cooperate towards the successful conclusion of a post- 2012 agreement under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. Under the declaration they pledged to work together to mobilise political support for stronger action on climate change and to cooperate to adapt and integrate DRR and climate change considerations into development and poverty reduction strategies.

        "42 The GCCA supports the Africa-EU Partnership on climate change In Africa, the GCCA dialogue is taking place within the established Africa-EU Strategic Partnership. The 2007 Joint Africa-EU Strategy defines the long-term policy orientations between Europe and Africa, based on a shared vision and common principles. Climate change is one of the eight areas of the Strategy\u2019s Action Plan covering 2011 to 2013, whilst strengthening climate change adaptation, in particular through the GCCA, is one of the six deliverables of this Africa-EU- Partnership on climate change. A key step in the process was the adoption in November 2008 of a joint EU-Africa Declaration on Climate Change during the 11th Ministerial Meeting of the African and EU Troikas. The GCCA African Regional Conference subsequently took place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in October 2010 as a pre- event of the Seventh African Development Forum, \u201cActing on Climate Change for Sustainable Development in Africa\u201d. It provided a useful opportunity to discuss Africa\u2019s concerns and interests in preparation for the 16th CoP of the UNFCCC which took place in Cancun two months later in December 2010. The Conference was an excellent forum to further the dialogue between African and European partners on the next steps in international climate negotiations, regional experiences and Pan- African Climate initiatives. \u201cTogetherness is indispensable to tackle Climate Change challenges as the atmosphere is a global public good\u201d, Jato Sillah, Chair of the conference, Honourable Minister of Forestry and Environment of The Gambia Fishing boats, The Gambia ",

Caribbean countries, regional organisations and EU partners took forward their joint climate change agenda and discussed the follow-up to the Joint Declaration. Their work focused on capacity building needs, DRR, experiences in the region, as well as next steps towards international climate negotiation and the draft implementation plan of the Caribbean Regional Strategy on Climate Change, to be endorsed later in the year. During the first EU-Latin American and Caribbean Ministerial Conference on the Environment in March 2008, climate change adaptation, renewable energy, and deforestation were at the top of the agenda. The 2008 Lima Summit also identified climate change adaptation as a priority, placing emphasis again on the role of the GCCA. Through the CARIFORUM-EU Declaration on climate change and energy, endorsed in May 2008, the Heads of State and Government affirmed their commitment to work together to enhance cooperation in international negotiations and strengthen efforts to address climate change, energy and food security. They also welcomed the EU intention to assist and support the Caribbean region in its adaptation and mitigation efforts, through the GCCA, and other appropriate instruments.

The Joint EU-Pacific Declaration on Climate Change of November 2008 signalled a commitment between Pacific Island Forum Member States and Europe to address the challenges posed by climate change. The GCCA Regional Conference on climate change in the Pacific held in Port Vila, Vanuatu in March 2011 moved forward the dialogue and debate. It provided an opportunity for Pacific countries, territories and regional organisations and EU partners to focus on practical elements of the implementation of the Joint Pacific-EU Initiative on climate change, formalised by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the EC through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in Strasbourg in December 2010.

        "45 Giving policy makers the tools for mainstreaming climate change The GCCA is organising a series of workshops to bring together climate change experts and decision makers responsible for national development planning and budgeting in beneficiary countries (See Table 3). To date the participants have generally been senior officials working in ministries of finance or planning with key roles in the budgetary process, and senior officials from ministries of environment who are in charge of climate change. Participants do not necessarily have in-depth knowledge of all the issues at stake or of mainstreaming, but they are instrumental in any mainstreaming effort. Equally critical, political leaders and senior officials from ministries connected with climate change can also attend the workshops. The workshops aim to raise awareness of the need to mainstream climate change adaptation and mitigation into national development policies, plans and budgets. They introduce participants to a framework and tools available for mainstreaming and give them the practical support and encouragement to put what they have learned about mainstreaming into action in their home countries. In addition, the workshops provide an opportunity for discussions and networking, allowing participants to share their experience and knowledge. It also provides the climate change experts with a valuable insight into the views and experience of those decisions makers who are in key positions to put mainstreaming at the heart of national development plans. The workshops are tailored to meet the needs of each region in terms of their structure, focus and seminar materials (See Box 2). The feedback from workshop participants has been positive and there is demand for additional workshops. The Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) have, for example, expressed an interest in the GCCA organising a climate change workshop tailored to their needs. A number of participants are also looking at replicating the workshop in their home countries. By the end of 2012, an estimated 250 senior officials from ministries of finance, planning and environment will have attended technical workshops, helping make the connections and the knowledge exchange that will drive change in their countries.

The feedback was also used to guide changes to some of the modules. All these lessons were integrated in the design and delivery of the four workshops which took place in Africa later in 2011. A more interactive delivery was adopted, with the use of a clear framework to guide participants through the workshop, for later use for each country to develop a mainstreaming action plan. Participants from 18 Pacific countries and territories and six regional organisations attended the GCCA\u2019s three day technical workshop held in Port Vila, Vanuatu, at the end of February 2011. They included senior officials from ministries in charge of national planning and budgeting, environment and climate change government officials, representatives of regional organisations, development partners and EU delegation staff. Topics covered included sessions on the basics of climate change science and mainstreaming climate change into national, sector and local policies, strategies and programmes. Participants had an opportunity to find out more about costing, assessing and selecting adaptation and mitigation options and measures. There were also modules covering other important aspects of mainstreaming including awareness raising and partnership building, and mainstreaming climate change into monitoring systems. The workshop was structured to incorporate roundtable sessions, discussion and networking opportunities. These discussion sessions allowed the participants to integrate key messages in the draft outcome document of the GCCA Regional Conference on Climate Change which took place over the following days, encouraging ownership. There was also an opportunity for presentations by countries and regional organisations.

        "48 Overcoming challenges and seizing opportunities The GCCA was launched with a vision of a more secure future for developing countries struggling to deal with the impact of climate change. Back in 2007, it embarked on an ambitious, far-reaching programme built on the solid foundations of aid effectiveness principles and adopting innovative approaches to deliver climate change finance. These approaches include the piloting of budget support and placing an emphasis on mainstreaming climate change into national and sector development planning. Like any ambitious initiative, the GCCA has faced challenges. It has expanded its wide-ranging programme of activities rapidly across countries, sectors and regions. In 2008, it was working with four countries and by 2013 the number of beneficiary countries will have increased more than ten-fold. In addition to regular development aid devoted to climate change, the GCCA relies on new and additional fast start funding pledged at the UNFCCC 15th CoP in Copenhagen in 2009. The availability of this fast start funding has contributed to the rapid expansion of the initiative. At the same time, there is an understanding of the need to demonstrate that this funding is delivering results on the ground in the countries and regions supported by the GCCA. In this context, each GCCA programme is identified and formulated within an extremely tight timeframe. The programmes are by their nature complex and involve multiple stakeholders, while the GCCA needs to ensure complementarity with on-going interventions, engage partners and foster ownership in partner countries in a relatively short space of time. The beneficiary countries are LDCs and SIDS where there are challenges because of issues such as their climate vulnerability or lack of capacity - the very reasons why they have been selected for support in the first place. The limited capacities therefore also contribute to the challenge \u2013 as well as the ambition of the GCCA. The focus of many programmes is institutional strengthening and mainstreaming which is vital to ensure that developing countries are well prepared to tackle the impact of climate change, but less visible and immediately beneficial than hard interventions such as building a school or a road. Embedding climate change in national policies will, for example, require raising awareness at all levels of the society, an objective which is essentially a long term process. All these significant challenges have been addressed through an approach that puts the emphasis on cooperation, learning lessons and sharing knowledge. This ensures that experiences and achievements inform an expanding GCCA and the continuing global fight against climate change. The results can also help inform the development of a post-2012 climate agreement and supporting the work of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. ",

        "50 Charting a path to climate compatible development The EU is in a unique position to help developing countries respond to the effects of climate change, given its leading role in development, global climate policy, the wide array of tools and instruments at its disposal, and its extensive presence in the developing world. The GCCA is making a difference by addressing the links between climate change adaptation and development, ensuring countries and regions across the globe receive the support they need for climate change. In doing so, the EU is also supporting the fight against poverty and progress towards achieving the MDGs because of the way it is linking climate change to the development processes of partner countries. As climate change is inextricably linked to development and the most vulnerable countries are also facing issues of accessing and absorbing climate change finance, the GCCA is applying the principles of aid effectiveness established by the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action, promoting ownership, alignment, harmonisation, results and mutual accountability. Both existing and new climate finance must fully subscribe to these principles. The GCCA is continuing to expand its support to developing countries and it is seeking more climate change funding to maintain this momentum. It is embarking on a further 11 programmes in countries and regions, whilst ensuring that lessons learned from earlier interventions are incorporated in new ones. By the end of 2013, the GCCA will support over 40 country and regional programmes across the world, amounting to over \u20ac250 million of aid. As it is growing, the GCCA keeps concentrating on using innovative and effective approaches to climate change, such as mainstreaming and budget support, fostering a sustainable integration of climate change both at the country level and in the EU development cooperation. The GCCA also ensures that lesson learning is an integral part of the process and that the knowledge created is shared across countries and regions and with development partners. A review in 2012 will give a more detailed picture of achievements and priority areas for the future. As the EU is preparing for its next programming cycle, one important avenue will be to further the integration of climate change into EU regular aid and geographical programmes. This can be achieved through the use of country environmental and climate change profiles, the undertaking of environmental and climate assessments, the inclusion of climate change in regional and country strategy papers and the focus on climate change in national indicative programmes, based on country needs and priorities. Climate change is a complex issue that is changing the development landscape. If we succeed in putting climate change at the heart of national strategies and policymaking, the benefits will be lasting and the most vulnerable countries will gradually move towards climate compatible development, for the benefit of all.

        "The Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) is an initiative of the European Union to strengthen dialogue and cooperation on climate change with developing countries most vulnerable to climate change. The GCCA focuses on the Least Developed Countries and the Small Island Developing States, which are often the most affected by climate change but have the fewest resources to tackle it. What sets the GCCA apart is its emphasis on innovative and effective approaches to delivering climate change support and addressing the capacity needs of partner countries. This commitment translates into a range of delivery methods and approaches, such as sector policy support programmes, climate change mainstreaming and budget support, ensuring full alignment with developing countries\u2019 agendas, the use of country systems and long-term capacity building, ownership, and sustainability. With help from the GCCA, partner countries are implementing climate change programmes on the ground, integrating climate change into national and sector strategies, reducing deforestation and disaster risks, and promoting adaptive agriculture and clean energy. From 2008 to 2011, the GCCA has contributed over \u20ac200 million in support of more than 30 country and regional programmes in the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. An additional 11 countries and regions are expected to benefit from the GCCA in 2012 and 2013.
