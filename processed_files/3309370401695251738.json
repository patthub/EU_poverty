O BJECTIVE OF THE C OMMISSION \u2019 S PROPOSAL The Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) \u2013 Global Europe is a key component of the Union\u2019s toolbox for cooperation with its immediate neighbourhood and the world, under the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021- 2027. The proposal is for a spending instrument to uphold and promote the Union\u2019s values and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of its external action, as laid down in Article 3(5), 8 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The NDICI-Global Europe Regulation will cover actions previously covered under 11 different Regulations 1 , thus increasing the coherence and consistency of the Union\u2019s external action. It is part of the EU budget and the aligment with the Financial Regulation will ensure a level playing field as it provides for a common rulebook, establishes simpler, more transparent and more flexible rules for EU funds. It will contribute to the reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty, consolidate, support and promote democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights, sustainable development and the fight against climate change and address irregular migration and forced displacement, including their root causes. It will also contribute to the promotion of multilateralism, the achievement of the international commitments and objectives that the Union has agreed to, in particular the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. It will promote stronger partnerships with third countries, including with the European Neighbourhood based on mutual interests and ownership with a view to fostering stabilisation, good governance and building resilience. The Regulation has the following specific objectives: (a) to support and foster dialogue and cooperation with third countries and regions in the Neighbourhood, in Sub-Saharan Africa, in Asia and the Pacific, and in the Americas and the Caribbean; (b) to develop special strengthened partnerships and enhanced political cooperation with the European Neighbourhood, founded on cooperation, peace and stability and a shared commitment to the universal values of democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights, and aiming at deep and sustainable democracy and progressive socio-economic integration as well as people-to-people contacts; (c) at global level: \u2013 to protect, promote and advance human rights, including gender equality and the protection of human rights defenders, including in the most difficult circumstances 1 Regulations (EU) No 230/2014, (EU) No 232/2014, (EU) No 233/2014, (EU) No 234/2014, (EU) No 235/2014 , (EU) No 236/2014 and (EU) 2017/1601 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Decision No 466/2014/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009, (Euratom) No 237/2014 and (EU) 2015/322 and the 11th European Development Fund (EDF)'s Internal Agreement.

C OMMENTS ON THE POSITION OF THE C OUNCIL The Council\u2019s position fully reflects the agreement reached in the trilogues. The most important changes it has introduced, compared to the Commission\u2019s proposal, include: \u2013 Concerning the budget: \u2013 a modified budget for the instrument and its components, in line with the July 2020 European Union Council Conclusions and with a pro-rata adjustment for the amounts not explicitly disaggregated in the Conclusions; \u2013 a cap for the actions on capacity building of military actors in support of development and security for development of EUR 270 million; \u2013 an indicative amount of EUR 1 800 million for Erasmus; \u2013 the possibility to dedicate up to 25% of the thematic programme on human rights and democracy to electoral observation missions; \u2013 an indicative amount of at least EUR 500 million for the Pacific and at least EUR 800 million for the Caribbean within the corresponding geographic envelopes; \u2013 an indicative amount of at least EUR 500 million for local authorities under the geographic programmes; \u2013 additional funds guaranteed from the emerging challenges and priorities cushion for the thematic programmes on human rights and democracy (EUR 200 million), civil society organisations (EUR 200 million) and global challenges (EUR 600 million). \u2013 Concerning the governance elements of the Regulation: \u2013 additional delegated acts to modify the provisioning amount and ceiling for the External Action Guarantee and to modify the cap on capacity building for development and security for development; \u2013 an additional delegated act to frame geographic programmes, to be adopted in 2021 and covering: ",
        "EN 4 EN \u2013 specific objectives and priority areas of cooperation drawn from common areas of cooperation, including a prioritisation, in annex II per sub- region; \u2013 sub-regions are the following: Neighbourhood South, Neighbourhood East, West Africa, East and Central Africa, Southern Africa and Indian Ocean, Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia, North and South East Asia, the Pacific, the Americas, the Caribbean; \u2013 thematic targets for the geographic pillar, as per Annex IV (1) (b) of the DCI; \u2013 financial allocations for West Africa, East and Central Africa and Southern Africa and Indian Ocean. \u2013 a compulsory mid-term review of the delegated act to frame geographic programmes; \u2013 a recital on suspending assistance in cases where there is degradation of democracy and the rule of law; \u2013 a reference to respect for conventions on nuclear safety standards as a programming principle; \u2013 a compulsory mid-term review of programming documents; \u2013 a reference to the possibility of establishing a Pan-African programme and an Africa, Caribbean and Pacific programme. \u2013 Concerning migration: \u2013 a level for the spending target of \u2018indicatively 10%\u2019; \u2013 a reference to the fact that migration-related actions should contribute to the effective implementation of EU agreements and dialogues on migration with third countries by encouraging cooperation relying on a flexible incitative approach and supported by a coordination mechanism. \u2013 Concerning the Neighbourhood: \u2013 keeping the existing wording of the European Neighbourhood Instrument on the incentive-based approach; \u2013 setting the share of the Neighbourhood\u2019s financial envelope that can be indicatively allocated to cross-border cooperation at \u2018up to 5%\u2019. \u2013 Concerning spending targets other than the ones mentioned above: \u2013 raising the spending target for Official Development Assistance to at least 93%; \u2013 raising the spending target for climate action to 30%; \u2013 inserting \u2018at least\u2019 before the spending target of 20% of Official Development Assistance expenditure for human development and social inclusion; \u2013 adding a reference to the contribution to the MFF spending target of 10% for biodiversity objectives; \u2013 setting an additional target of \u2018at least 85%\u2019 of actions with gender equality as a principal or significant objective, of which at least 5% should have gender ",

These amounts can be amended by a delegated act; \u2013 strengthening the articles on the purpose, governance, eligibility of operations and reporting of the EFSD+, as well as the annex on priority areas of EFSD+ operations. The text on governance is no longer in an annex that could be amended by a delegated act, but is incorporated in articles in the main body of the Regulation; \u2013 specifying the role of the EIB in the EFSD+, notably by establishing an exclusive dedicated investment window for sovereign and non-commercial sub-sovereign operations and, if appropriate, the establishment through the relevant standard procedure of two dedicated-investment windows for commercial sub-sovereign and private sector operations, for an overall indicative amount of EUR 26 725 million; \u2013 introducing relevant definitions concerning the EFSD+, notably on additionality; \u2013 introducing an article on a grievance and redress mechanism and on protecting the EU\u2019s financial interests. \u2013 Name of the instrument: \u2013 adding \u2018Global Europe\u2019 to the name, which therefore becomes \u2018Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument \u2013 Global Europe\u2019. The agreement preserves the aims of the Commission\u2019s original proposal, maintaining the level of ambition and allowing for sufficient flexibility in implementing the new rules. The Commission therefore supported the changes highlighted above. 4. C ONCLUSION The Commission supports the results of the inter-institutional negotiations and therefore accepts the position taken by the Council. 5.

        "EN 6 EN APPENDIX Declarations from the Commission The Commission\u2019s declaration on a geopolitical dialogue with the European Parliament on the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument \u2013 Global Europe: \u2018The European Commission, mindful of the European Parliament\u2019s functions of political control laid down in Article 14 of the Treaty on the European Union, commits to conduct a high-level geopolitical dialogue between the two institutions on the implementation of Regulation (EU) XXX/XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) \u2013 Global Europe. This dialogue should allow exchanges with the European Parliament, whose positions on the implementation of the NDICI will be fully taken into consideration. The geopolitical dialogue will discuss general orientations on the implementation of the NDICI, including on programming before the adoption of programming documents, and concerning specific subjects such as the use of the emerging challenges and priorities cushion or applying leverage leading to possible changes in allocation of funding dedicated to migration or suspension of assistance to a partner country when it persistently fails to observe the principles of democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The geopolitical dialogue will be structured as follows: i) A high-level dialogue between the High Representative/Vice President and the Commissioners in charge of International Partnerships and of Neighbourhood and Enlargement and the European Parliament. ii) A permanent dialogue at senior officials\u2019 level with AFET and DEVE working groups to ensure an adequate preparation and follow-up to the high-level dialogue. The high-level dialogue will take place at least twice a year. One of the meetings may coincide with the presentation by the Commission of the draft annual budget. The Commission\u2019s declaration on Recitals 50 and 51 and Article 8.10: \u2018Regional migration support programmes will support comprehensive, balanced and tailor-made partnerships with relevant countries of origin or transit and host countries, following a flexible incitative approach, and supported by the coordination mechanism within the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument \u2013 Global Europe. They will be complemented by actions under the country programmes, where appropriate. In order to ensure the most efficient and impactful use of these funds, in line with the Union\u2019s and partner countries\u2019 policy priorities, the European Commission will actively implement these priorities using all relevant Union instruments and participate in the coordination with the Member States in a synchronised and efficient manner. It will ensure that the European Parliament and the Council are closely and regularly informed, allowing for exchanges of views. "
