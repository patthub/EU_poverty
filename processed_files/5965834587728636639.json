        "\u0018 What is Eurovoc for? Each year thousands, or rather tens of thousands, of items are added to the documentation generated by the activi- ties of the European Union. In the face of this growing mass of information, the doc- umentation departments of the European Union institu- tions have sought since the early 1980s to equip them- selves with a tool for indexing these documents. This need was felt particularly keenly in the Office for Official Publications, for the catalogue of the institutions\u2019 publi- cations and the indexes to the Official Journal, and in the European Parliament, for parliamentary documentation and for the library. After examining the available tools, the Publications Office and the European Parliament decided to develop a multilingual thesaurus covering all the fields of activity of the European Union: the Eurovoc thesaurus. Work on selecting descriptors and structuring the thesau- rus was started by a team of documentalists and librar- ians from the European Parliament, the Commission of the European Communities and the Publications Office. This work was assisted by the Commission\u2019s Directorate- General for the Information Market and Innovation, a field taken over by the Directorate-General for the Infor- mation Society and Media, as part of its policy of sup- porting the development of multilingual thesauri. The first edition of the thesaurus was published in 1984 in seven languages. Eurovoc has since had to adapt to developments in the European Union, to geopolitical changes and to language developments. In addition to the ad hoc updates, Eurovoc has been updated six times, undergone a number of linguistic revisions and incor- porated the new languages as the need arose, expanding to 9 languages in 1987, 11 in 2000 and 19 in 2006. Responsibility for the project was entrusted to two inter- institutional committees \u2014 the Steering Committee and the Maintenance Committee. These committees are made up of representatives of the institutions involved in the project: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors. Eurovoc is the fruit of a real cooperative effort that has brought together not only the European institutions but also national parliaments, which are increasingly active in the development of Eurovoc. Most of the update proposals made with a view to developing the thesaurus come from the national par- liaments, the European Parliament and the Publications Office. INTRODUCTION Eurovoc has played an important part in the indexing of European legislation and other legal texts (legislative proposals and other documents related to the decision- making procedure). It facilitates access to the acquis communautaire and, thanks to the standardisation of terminology, prevents problems in the preparation and/ or translation of legislative instruments, particularly in the case of an accession country processing secondary legislation at the time of an enlargement. New tools for managing and disseminating the Eurovoc thesaurus In December 2000, Eurovoc users were able to access the Eurovoc website for the first time. Online access to Eurovoc has considerably increased its audience. The site allows users to consult the thesaurus in a simple way that closely follows the paper version. Besides subject-orient- ed consultation and alphabetical searches for a particular term, the site offers various other possibilities: a lexicon of terms belonging to a microthesaurus; translation of a descriptor or of the complete semantic environment of a descriptor; a multilingual list; downloading in pdf format. At the same time, a maintenance system for the Eurovoc thesaurus based on web technology has been developed entirely for the needs of the thesaurus management sys- tem. This restricted-access system can be used to man- age all types of amendment, make proposals, visualise or propose new concepts, and handle the proposals made by users in all language versions. The electronic maintenance system is now open to the members of the Maintenance Committee and to national parliaments for submitting their proposals, and to the translator\u2013terminologists for translating concepts in all the language versions. ",
        "4 Information for users The European Parliament organises a conference on the Eurovoc thesaurus on a regular basis. These meetings allow members of the national parlia- ments to share their experience, exchange points of view, present developments in the Eurovoc thesaurus, and dis- cuss prospects. The European Centre for Parliamentary Research and Documentation (ECPRD) establishes contact between the documentation services of all the parliaments repre- sented in the Council of Europe. One of its objectives is to facilitate the exchange of information between the par- liaments. This network of multilingual cooperation has been a further factor in the growing use of Eurovoc. Contributions to the development of Eurovoc also emerge within the EU institutions and other bodies, whose libraries have set up a structure for cooperation called Eurolib. All of this allows for regular exchanges of experience between the European Union institutions and the exten- sion of cooperation on cataloguing and document analy- sis. Latest edition and future of Eurovoc In this context, the Steering Committee is now presenting version 4.2 of the Eurovoc thesaurus. This latest version, available online since July 2005, includes new descrip- tors submitted by the Spanish, Czech, Polish and Swedish parliaments and the geographical entities and regions of the enlarged Europe. It includes 6 645 descriptors, 155 of which are new. Euro- voc is currently available in 21 official EU languages and Croatian. The Eurovoc thesaurus evolves under the influence of all its users, national parliaments, EU institutions and Eurovoc licence-holders. Multilingual coverage and the generic character of Eurovoc are factors which contribute to its success. The number of Eurovoc user licences increased by 4\u0018 % in 2005 (25 licences in 2004, 44 licences in 2005). This thesaurus evolves according to the activities of the EU and the needs of indexers, and also of the managers and users of documentary resources and databases. This is particularly true for Eurovoc, which must reflect the ever-developing concepts of the European Union and deal with them in strict compliance with the documen- tary standards. The Eurovoc Steering Committee and its Maintenance Committee will continue to welcome any suggestions for the development and improvement of the thesaurus.

        "6 1. P RESENTATION 1.1. Objectives 1.1.1. PURPOSE Of A THESAURUS A thesaurus is a structured list of expressions intended to represent in unambiguous fashion the conceptual content of the documents in a documentary system and the queries addressed to that system. In natural language, a concept can be represented by a number of equivalent expressions (for example, agro- industry and agri-foodstuffs industry or processing of agricultural products and agricultural product process- ing industry). The role of the thesaurus is to monitor vocabulary, ensur- ing that each concept is represented by a preferred term or descriptor. The meaning of the descriptor is clarified by the links between terms in the thesaurus. Synonyms or equivalent terms, called non-descriptors, are never allocated as indexing terms, but instead direct users to the appropriate descriptor. 1.1.2. PURPOSE Of EUROvOC Eurovoc is a multilingual thesaurus which was original- ly built up specifically for processing the documentary information of the EU institutions. It is a multi-disciplinary thesaurus covering fields which are sufficiently wide-ranging to encompass both Commu- nity and national points of view, with a certain emphasis on parliamentary activities. Eurovoc is a controlled set of vocabulary which can be used outside the EU institu- tions, particularly by parliaments. The aim of the thesaurus is to provide the information management and dissemination services with a coher- ent indexing tool for the effective management of their documentary resources and to enable users to carry out documentary searches using controlled vocabulary. 1.1.3. ADvANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS (a) Advantages Using the thesaurus has the following advantages: \u2014 terminological standardisation of indexing vocabu- laries, allowing more accurate documentary search- es; \u2014 multilingualism: establishing language equivalences between identical concepts expressed in different lan- guages allows documents to be indexed in the lan- guage of the documentalist and searches to be made in the user\u2019s language; \u2014 exchange of bibliographic records between docu- mentary services using the Eurovoc thesaurus. (b) Limitations However, Eurovoc has limitations. \u2014 Eurovoc has been designed to meet the needs of sys- tems of general documentation on the activities of the European Union; it is not suitable for indexing and searching for specialised documents; \u2014 Eurovoc cannot claim to cover the various national situations at a sufficiently detailed level; however, ef- forts are being made to take account of the needs of users outside the EU institutions. 1.2. fields covered The Eurovoc thesaurus covers all the activity fields of the European institutions: \u00a7 POLITICS \u00a7 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS \u00a7 EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES \u00a7 LAW \u00a7 ECONOMICS \u00a7 TRADE \u00a7 FINANCE \u00a7 SOCIAL QUESTIONS \u00a7 EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATIONS \u00a7 SCIENCE \u00a7 BUSINESS AND COMPETITION \u00a7 EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS \u00a7 TRANSPORT \u00a7 ENVIRONMENT \u00a7 AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHERIES \u00a7 AGRI-FOODSTUFFS \u00a7 PRODUCTION, TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH \u00a7 ENERGY \u00a7 INDUSTRY \u00a7 GEOGRAPHY \u00a7 INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS Some fields are more highly developed than others because they are more closely related to the EU\u2019s centres of interest. Thus, for example, the names of the regions of each EU Member State are in Eurovoc but not those of third countries. The grouping of descriptors into fields is to a certain extent arbitrary. One of Eurovoc\u2019s distinctive features is the limitation of polyhierarchy. Descriptors which could fit into two or more subject fields are thus generally assigned only to the field which seems the most natural for users, in order to facilitate the management of the the- saurus and limit its volume. ",
        "7 1.3. History \u2014 successive editions 1.3.1. THE bEGINNINGS Of EUROvOC In 1982, following a comparative study of the documen- tary languages used internally in the institutions, the European Parliament and the European Commission decided to construct a multilingual thesaurus covering the fields which were of interest to the European institu- tions that would comply with the relevant international standards. The work was based on: \u2014 an initial draft of a monolingual thesaurus drawn up by the European Parliament, using in particular the content of the OECD macrothesaurus; \u2014 an initial version of the ECLAS thesaurus used by the Commission\u2019s Central Library, dating from 1978, to- gether with the indexing frequency of its descriptors; today, the Eurovoc and ECLAS tools are still closely linked, particularly with regard to the choice of can- didate descriptors; \u2014 candidate descriptors from the Automated Central Documentation Service (SCAD); \u2014 free descriptors used for indexing documents in the Commission\u2019s EC-01 database, with their indexing frequency; \u2014 free descriptors used by the Publications Office to draw up the indexes to the Official Journal. After an initial test carried out by the European Parlia- ment and the Publications Office, the first edition of the Eurovoc thesaurus was published in 1984 in seven lan- guages (Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, English, French and Italian) in two volumes: an alphabetical thesaurus and a subject-oriented thesaurus. This thesaurus imme- diately came into use at the European Parliament and the Publications Office. 1.3.2. EDITION 2 The second edition of the thesaurus, published in 1987, was the result of a thorough revision of the first edi- tion, based on the indexing experience gained at the European Parliament and the Publications Office. Two new language versions (Portuguese and Spanish) were added to the seven original languages. Three additional versions \u2014 the multilingual thesaurus (1987), the per- muted thesaurus (1989) and the terminogrammes edition (1990) \u2014 accompanied the two original versions (alpha- betic thesaurus and subject-oriented thesaurus). The second edition of Eurovoc met with increasing inter- est outside the EU institutions among national parlia- ments, in national and regional administrative bodies and even in the private sector. In 1989, the European Parliament and the Publications Office, respective owner and manager of the thesaurus, took the initiative to organise a first seminar for Eurovoc users. This seminar provided guidance for decisions on the management and maintenance of the thesaurus. One of these decisions was to set up a maintenance struc- ture which would take account of the proposals of all thesaurus users, irrespective of whether they worked in the EU institutions. An update of the second edition was published in 1990 in the form of a fascicule. 1.3.3. EDITION 3 The third edition of Eurovoc was published in 1995. Following observations from users concerning the accu- racy of certain language equivalents, the different lan- guage versions of Eurovoc were revised thoroughly by a multilingual team of translators and terminologists at the European Commission. The third edition comprises three volumes per language, instead of the five volumes of the previous edition. After consulting the users, the permuted and alphabeti- cal presentations of the thesaurus were merged. The new alphabetical presentation provides descriptors in their semantic context and includes references for non-descriptors. The new subject-oriented version comprises the associa- tive relationships present in the terminogrammes edition. The publication of terminogrammes was abandoned fol- lowing the difficulties experienced when publishing the second edition and owing to the fact that users were less interested in this type of presentation. Compared with the previous edition of the thesaurus, 566 descriptors were added and 26 deleted. Based on this edition, Eurovoc has been used as an index- ing tool for the documentary databases of the Publica- tions Office for the production of catalogues and tables of the Official Journal. 1.3.4. EDITION 3.1 In October 1999, the Management Committee of the Publications Office entrusted the task of preparing a new edition of the Eurovoc thesaurus to two new interinsti- tutional committees \u2014 the Steering Committee and the Maintenance Committee. These two committees are made up of representatives of the institutions involved in the project: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors. The Steering Committee is responsible for directing the Eurovoc project. In particular, it determines the objec- tives and priorities, lays down the overall timetable, decides on the use of resources and draws up the provi- sional budget. The Steering Committee is the authority which officially adopts each new version. This commit- ",
        "8 tee meets twice a year under the chair of the European Parliament. The Publications Office takes charge of the technical organisation of these meetings and provides the committee\u2019s secretariat. The Maintenance Committee, made up of permanent representatives of the institutions (mainly specialist doc- umentalists), is a key component in the system. It has the task of examining the proposals for updating the Euro- voc thesaurus, and meets twice a year. The Publications Office takes charge of the technical organisation of these meetings and coordinates the work. A standing group in the maintenance team is managed by the Publications Office. Edition 3.1 was developed with a view to meeting the urgent indexing requirements. In addition to the termi- nological updates and 142 new descriptors, this edition exists in two new languages, namely Finnish and Swed- ish. On 22 December 2000, two Internet sites were opened on the Europa server: \u2014 for the public, the dissemination site presenting Edi- tion \u0018.1 (http://eurovoc.europa.eu/); \u2014 for the members of the Maintenance Committee, a special system which automates the shared manage- ment of the thesaurus. 1.3.5. EDITION 4 The fourth edition of Eurovoc was disseminated on the Internet on 26 November 2002, following a thorough revision of the thesaurus. In view of changes in spelling rules, corrections were made to the Dutch, English and German versions. In accordance with users\u2019 wishes, no changes were made to the overall structure but \u001864 new descriptors were added, compared with Edition \u0018.1, and nine were deleted. Since February 200\u0018, the website has offered the option of downloading the subject-oriented and permuted alpha- betical versions of Eurovoc in the form of PDF files, and of consulting a multilingual list. This list replaces the old multilingual printed version. 1.3.6. EDITION 4.1 Edition 4.1 of Eurovoc was disseminated on the Internet on 1\u0018 February 2004. Eurovoc now contains 6 501 descriptors: 6\u0018 new descriptors; 1 descriptor was deleted. The list of differences between the new edition and the one immediately before it can be consulted on the Eurovoc website. 1.3.7. EDITION 4.2 Edition 4.2 of Eurovoc was disseminated on the Inter- net on 15 July 2005. It incorporates the proposals sub- mitted by the Spanish, Czech, Polish and Swedish par- liaments, and by the geographical entities and regions of the enlarged Europe. It includes 6 645 descriptors, 155 of which are new. Euro- voc is currently available in 21 official languages, and Croatian. 1.4. Main uses The Eurovoc thesaurus is used for European documenta- tion, mainly: \u2014 for indexing and searching for legal documents in EUR-Lex (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/), the gateway to European Union law; \u2014 by EU Bookshop (http://bookshop.europa.eu/), the electronic catalogue of all EU publications; \u2014 by the European Centre for Parliamentary Research and Documentation for indexing parliamentary stud- ies (Studies database); \u2014 by the European Parliament for indexing the docu- mentary holdings in its library and archives; \u2014 by a number of libraries of EU institutions and bodies which use Eurovoc for indexing their documentary holdings; \u2014 at national and regional levels by the parliaments and administrations of a number of European countries; \u2014 by private users (universities, research centres, com- panies, students, etc.) with a user licence. 1.5. Language versions Since Edition 4.2, the Eurovoc thesaurus has been published and made available over the Internet in 21 offi- cial EU languages as well as Croatian: \u00a7 Bulgarian \u00a7 Czech \u00a7 Danish \u00a7 Dutch \u00a7 English \u00a7 Estonian \u00a7 Finnish \u00a7 French \u00a7 German \u00a7 Greek \u00a7 Hungarian \u00a7 Italian \u00a7 Latvian \u00a7 Lithuanian \u00a7 Polish \u00a7 Portuguese \u00a7 Romanian \u00a7 Slovak \u00a7 Slovenian \u00a7 Spanish \u00a7 Swedish ",
        "9 Eurovoc is already available in Croatian. All 22 lan- guages are currently available on the website. All lan- guage versions have the same status: each descriptor in one language necessarily matches a descriptor in each of the other languages. However, equivalence between the non-descriptors in the different languages does not necessarily exist. Each lan- guage is characterised by its wealth and its semantic and cultural differences, and a concept in one language is not always represented in another language. 1.6. Current standards The Eurovoc thesaurus has been compiled in accord- ance with the standards of the International Standards Organisation: \u2014 ISO 2788-1986: Guidelines for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri; \u2014 ISO 5964-1985: Guidelines for the establishment and development of multilingual thesauri. In all the language versions, the descriptors and non- descriptors are generally in the singular, and the plural is used when the singular does not correspond to normal usage. Abbreviations have been avoided as far as possible in order to make the thesaurus easier to understand and use. Only the acronyms of well-known international organisations have been taken as descriptors. Reciprocal relationships are always established between the acronym and the unabbreviated form. The alphabetical sorting of terms is not organised in a uniform manner for all language versions. No standard classification norm has yet been introduced in the man- agement of the Eurovoc thesaurus. 1.7. Monitoring vocabulary The role of the thesaurus is to remove ambiguities, ensur- ing that each descriptor is contextualised in such a way that its meaning is univocal. Each descriptor is limited to one meaning in the field to which it belongs. A thesaurus is composed of: \u2014 descriptors, or preferred terms, used for indexing and denoting in an unambiguous fashion the con- cepts of the field covered by the thesaurus (for exam- ple, \u2018application of legislation\u2019); \u2014 non-descriptors, or non-preferred terms. Synonyms or non-descriptors are never intended as indexing terms. They are used as access points in the thesaurus and guide users to the appropriate descriptor with an instruction (USE, UF); Examples: application of legislation UF implementation of the law UF application of the law UF derogation from the law UF enforcement of the law UF implementation of the law UF validity of a law implementation of the law USE application of legislation \u2014 semantic relationships, i.e. relationships based on meaning, firstly between descriptors and non-de- scriptors and secondly between descriptors. If the meaning is not clear enough, a scope note, intro- duced by the symbol \u2018SN\u2019, can accompany a descriptor to clarify its meaning or use. Example: \u00a7 A note on definition, if this clarifies the meaning of the descriptor: share farming SN: Arrangement under which the landowner lets his land in return for part of the produce. \u00a7 A note on use, if it provides guidance on how to use the descriptor: retail price SN: Use in opposition to wholesale price, otherwise use consumer price. When homographs \u2014 terms with the same spelling but a different meaning \u2014 are taken as descriptors or non- descriptors, their meaning is clarified by an explanation in brackets. Example: Land (Germany) department (france) conciliation procedure (part of co-decision procedure) ",
        "10 1.8. Structure 1.8.1. fIELDS AND MICROTHESAURI At generic level Eurovoc has a two-tier hierarchical clas- sification: \u2014 fields, identified by two-digit numbers and titles in words: Example: 10 EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES \u2014 microthesauri, identified by four-digit numbers \u2014 the first two digits being those for the field containing the microthesaurus \u2014 followed by titles in words: Example: 1011 COMMUNITY LAW The numbering of fields and microthesauri is identical in all language versions. 1.8.2. SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS At the specific level of descriptors and non-descriptors, the structure of Eurovoc depends on semantic relation- ships: \u2014 microthesaurus relationship (MT); \u2014 equivalence relationship (Uf, USE); \u2014 hierarchical relationship (bT, NT); \u2014 associative relationship (RT). 1.8.2.1. Microthesaurus relationship All descriptors are accompanied by a reference to a microthesaurus, introduced by the abbreviation MT (microthesaurus) to show to which microthesaurus or microthesauri they belong. Example of a descriptor belonging to a single microthesaurus: nationality MT 12\u00181 international law 1.8.2.2. Equivalence relationship The equivalence relationship between descriptors and non-descriptors is shown by the abbreviations: \u2014 \u2018Uf\u2019 (used for), in front of the non-descriptor; Example: technology park UF science park \u2014 \u2018USE\u2019, in front of the descriptor. Example: science park USE technology park (6806) When a number of terms represent the same concept, the equivalence relationship clarifies which indexing term should be used. In the example above, the terms \u2018tech- nology park\u2019 (which belongs to microthesaurus \u20186806 industrial structures and policy\u2019) is the descriptor which must be used for indexing concepts such as \u2018science park\u2019. In Eurovoc, reciprocity between descriptors and non- descriptors applies to: \u2014 synonyms; Example: IEA (OECD) USE International Energy Agency (7621) \u2014 near-synonyms or terms considered as different in ordinary use but treated as synonyms for indexing purposes. Examples: slaughter of livestock USE slaughter of animals (6036) technological dependence USE technological independence (0806) In the case of terms which are marginal in relation to the fields covered by the thesaurus, the user is referred back to the generic term. The name of a class and of its mem- bers are treated as equivalents. The generic term of the class is then considered to be the descriptor. Example: apple fig pear pome fruit quince USE pip fruit (6006) ",
        "11 1.8.2.3. Hierarchical relationship This relationship is based on hierarchical levels of superi- ority or subordination between descriptors. The superior term constitutes a class, whereas the subordinate terms represent elements or parts of this class. It is indicated by the abbreviations: \u2014 \u2018bT\u2019 (broader term or generic term) between a spe- cific descriptor and a more generic descriptor, togeth- er with an indication of the number of hierarchical steps between the specific descriptor and each broad- er term. Example: standard BT1 standardisation BT2 technical regulations Descriptors with no broader terms are called \u2018top terms\u2019. \u2014 \u2018NT\u2019 (narrower term or specific term) between a generic descriptor and a specific descriptor, together with a figure showing the number of hierarchical steps between the generic term and each narrower term. Example: standardisation NT1 approval NT2 Community certification NT1 EC conformity marking NT1 harmonisation of standards NT1 international standard NT2 European standard NT1 standard NT2 production standard NT2 quality standard NT2 safety standard NT2 technical standard The hierarchical relationship allows those using a docu- mentary system to adapt its level of specificity by brows- ing in the hierarchy. They can expand or detail their question by selecting descriptors with a broader meaning (for example, \u2018standardisation\u2019, or \u2018technical regulations\u2019) or a more precise meaning (\u2018production standard\u2019, \u2018qual- ity standard\u2019, \u2018technical standard\u2019). The hierarchical relationship clarifies the meaning of the descriptor in its context; for example, the sense in which the descriptor \u2018press\u2019 is to be understood is clarified by its being subordinated to the descriptor \u2018mass media\u2019. Example: press BT1 mass media BT2 means of communication In Eurovoc, the hierarchical relationship is established on the basis of logical situations. (a) Generic relationship This identifies the link between a class (superior term, broader term or top term) and its constituents (subordi- nate terms or specific terms). Example: protected area NT national park NT nature reserve (b) Partitive relationship Concerns a limited number of situations in which the name of a part indicates the name of the whole, regard- less of the context. The name of the whole represents the superior term and the name of the part the subordinate term(s). In the framework of Eurovoc, it applies mainly to the following classes of terms: \u2014 Geometric places Example: ocean NT1 Antarctic Ocean NT1 Arctic Ocean NT1 Atlantic Ocean NT1 Indian Ocean NT1 Pacific Ocean \u2014 Disciplines or areas of knowledge Example: chemistry NT1 analytical chemistry NT1 biochemistry NT1 electrochemistry NT1 photochemistry \u2014 Hierarchised social structures Example: bureau of parliament NT1 Deputy Speaker of Parliament NT1 Speaker of Parliament NT1 treasurer (c) Polyhierarchical relationship Some descriptors can belong to several fields at once for logical reasons. One of Eurovoc\u2019s distinctive features is the limitation of polyhierarchy. Descriptors which could fit into a number of subject fields are thus generally assigned only to the field which seems the most logical for users. However, polyhierarchy is accepted in the thesaurus for the fields \u201872 GEOGRAPHY\u2019 and \u201876 INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS\u2019. ",
        "12 Descriptors which belong to these two fields can be sub- ordinate to a number of broader terms. For example, \u2018Nigeria\u2019 belongs to all of the following cat- egories: \u2018West Africa\u2019, \u2018ACP countries\u2019, \u2018OPEC countries\u2019 and \u2018CEAO countries\u2019. Thus the various policies of the European Union, which could logically belong to the field \u2018EUROPEAN COM- MUNITIES\u2019, are actually in the fields to which they directly relate. For example, the descriptor \u2018Common Agricultural Pol- icy\u2019 belongs to the field \u201856 AGRICULTURE, FOREST- RY AND FISHERIES\u2019, and the descriptor \u2018Community research policy\u2019 to the field \u201864 PRODUCTION, TECH- NOLOGY AND RESEARCH\u2019. Example of a descriptor belonging to more than one microthesaurus: Panama MT 7216 America MT 72\u00181 economic geography MT 72\u00186 political geography 1.8.2.4. Associative relationship The associative relationship is a relationship between two descriptors which do not belong to the same hier- archical structure, although they have semantic or con- textual similarities. The relationship between these two descriptors must be made explicit because it suggests to the indexer the use of other descriptors with connected or similar meanings which could be used for indexing or searches. The associative relationship between descriptors is shown by the abbreviation RT (related term), placed between two associated descriptors. Example: standardisation RT industrial cooperation RT labelling RT mutual recognition principle RT technical barrier The associative relationship between two descriptors is reciprocal: Examples: credit guarantee RT financial solvency financial solvency RT credit guarantee There is no associative relationship between descriptors with the same top term. Examples: There is no associative relationship between the descriptors \u2018gaming\u2019 and \u2018sport\u2019, which are subordi- nate to the same top term \u2018leisure\u2019 (microthesaurus \u20182826 social affairs\u2019). 1.9. The thesaurus in figures All language versions of the Eurovoc thesaurus com- prise: \u2014 21 fields; \u2014 127 microthesauri; \u2014 6 645 descriptors (of which 519 are top terms); \u2014 6 669 reciprocal hierarchical relationships; \u2014 \u0018 6\u00186 reciprocal associative relationships. The fields, microthesauri, descriptors, hierarchical rela- tionships and associative relationships are strictly equiv- alent in all languages. The numbers of non-descriptors and scope notes, on the other hand, vary from language to language.

        "1\u0018 1.10. Paper versions In each of its language versions, Eurovoc is published in two volumes: \u2014 Volume 1: Permuted alphabetical version; \u2014 Volume 2: Subject-oriented version. Since March 2002, the multilingual version is available only on the Eurovoc website. A multilingual list presents the descriptors and their language equivalents in the selected languages. Up to four languages can be selected at once. The descriptors of the target language are classed alphabetically and displayed in bold type. Each equiva- lent descriptor in the other languages appears on the same line in its respective column in ordinary type. A list of the equivalent descriptors in all the language ver- sions can also be downloaded in Excel format from the website. 1.10.1. PERMUTED ALPHAbETICAL vERSION The permuted alphabetical version appears in two parts: \u2014 Part A, which contains the terms beginning with the letters A to I; \u2014 Part B, which contains the terms beginning with the letters J to Z. In the permuted alphabetical version, there are five types of entry, set out in three columns per page in alphabeti- cal order according to the first word or each of the other significant words. Alphabetical entry based on the first significant word of a descriptor \u2014 the descriptor, in bold type; \u2014 explanatory note, preceded by the abbreviation \u2018SN\u2019 (scope note), which clarifies the meaning or use of the descriptor; \u2014 the number(s) and name(s) of the microthesaurus or microthesauri to which the descriptor belongs, pre- ceded by the abbreviation \u2018MT\u2019 (microthesaurus), in italics; \u2014 non-descriptor(s) associated with the headword de- scriptor, preceded by the abbreviation \u2018UF\u2019 (used for) and listed in alphabetical order; \u2014 broader descriptor(s) with which the headword de- scriptor is associated, preceded by the abbreviation \u2018BT\u2019 (broader term) and a figure showing the number of hierarchical steps between the hierarchically supe- rior descriptor and the headword descriptor; broader terms are listed: \u2022 firstly, in ascending hierarchical order, indented further to the right for each successive step, \u2022 secondly, within each hierarchical level, in alpha- betical order. \u2014 specific descriptor(s) associated with the headword descriptor, preceded by the abbreviation \u2018NT\u2019 (narrower term) and a figure showing the number of hierarchical steps between the subordinate descriptor and the headword descriptor; narrower terms are listed: \u2022 firstly in descending hierarchical order, indented further to the right for each successive step, \u2022 secondly, within each hierarchical level, in alpha- betical order; \u2014 descriptor(s) related to the headword descriptor, pre- ceded by the abbreviation \u2018RT\u2019 (related term) and listed in alphabetical order. Example: originating product SN Product produced in a given country where more than one country is involved in the manufacture of a product, it is an originating product of the country where processing last took place. MT 2021 international trade UF origin of goods UF product origin UF rule of origin BT1 GATT BT2 international trade NT1 certificate of origin RT commodity agreement RT free circulation RT generalised preferences RT import restriction RT tariff preference RT third country Alphabetical entry based on another significant word of a descriptor If a descriptor is listed in the form of a compound term, a permuted or inverted entry is created, based on each of the significant words in the descriptor, other than the first significant word. The permuted entry of a descriptor comprises: \u2014 a significant term of the descriptor other than its first significant word, followed by the rest of the wording if the term in question is not the last word in the de- scriptor, followed by a comma and the first significant term, followed by a dash and the number of the field to which the descriptor belongs, in brackets, all in bold type. Examples: \u00a7 Two significant terms: Product, originating \u2014 (2021) \u00a7 More than two significant terms: product nomenclature, agricultural \u2014 (5611) nomenclature, agricultural product \u2014 (5611) ",
        "14 Alphabetical entry based on the first significant word of a non-descriptor \u2014 the non-descriptor, in ordinary type; \u2014 on the following line, the descriptor or indexing term in bold type, preceded by the word \u2018USE\u2019 and followed in brackets by the number of the microthesaurus to which it belongs. Examples: domestic accident USE accident in the home (2826) rule of origin USE originating product (2021) Alphabetical entry based on another significant word of a non-descriptor If a non-descriptor is listed in the form of a compound term, a permuted or inverted entry is created based on each of the significant words in the non-descriptor, other than the first significant word. The permuted entry of a non-descriptor comprises: \u2014 a significant term of the non-descriptor, other than its first significant word, followed by the rest of the wording if the headword term is not the last word of the descriptor, followed by a comma and the first significant term, followed by a dash, all in ordinary type; \u2014 on the following line, the descriptor or indexing term in bold type, preceded by the word \u2018USE\u2019 and followed in brackets by the number of the microthesaurus to which it belongs. Examples: \u00a7 Non-descriptors with two significant terms origin, rule of \u2014 USE originating product (2021) \u00a7 Non-descriptors with four significant terms agreement, European road transport \u2014 USE AETR agreement (4816) road transport agreement, European \u2014 USE AETR agreement (4816) transport agreement, European road \u2014 USE AETR agreement (4816) Alphabetical entry based on another significant word of a unified compound word (descriptors or non- descriptors) Some unified compound words (descriptors or non- descriptors) can be broken down into separate signifi- cant parts. In this case, an entry is created using each significant lexical unit composing the descriptor or non- descriptor: \u2014 entry based on one of the significant terms compos- ing the descriptor or non-descriptor, followed by the rest of the wording if the headword term is not the last word, followed by a comma and the start of the word- ing or root, followed by a tilde and a dash, in ordinary type; \u2014 on the following line, the descriptor in bold type, preceded by the word \u2018USE\u2019 and followed in brackets by the number of the microthesaurus to which it be- longs. Example: forestry, agro~ \u2014 USE agroforestry (5616) 1.10.2. SUbjECT-ORIENTED vERSION The subject-oriented or systematic version is presented by field and organised into microthesauri. Each field is displayed in two parts: a subject-oriented version of the microthesauri belonging to the field and a terminology of the field. 1.10.2.1. Subject-oriented version of the microthesauri Each page is identified by a title composed of the number and name of the microthesaurus. The title is followed by an arrow to the right if the micro- thesaurus continues on the following page, or preceded by an arrow to the left if it is the continuation of a micro- thesaurus. Example: 0421 parliament \uf0a6\b \uf0a5 0421 parliament The subject-oriented version is classed by number of microthesaurus and is identical in each language ver- sion. Each page is divided into two columns and contains: \u2014 the higher descriptors with no broader descriptor (top term), in bold type and alphabetical order; \u2014 under each top-term descriptor, the specific descrip- tors, presented in bold type, preceded by the abbre- viation \u2018NT\u2019 (narrower term) followed by a figure showing the number of hierarchical steps between the specific descriptor and the hierarchically higher descriptor (top term); \u2014 the specific descriptors are listed in ascending hier- archical order and, within each hierarchical level, in alphabetical order. ",
        "15 Each descending hierarchical level is shown by a further indent compared with the previous level. The descriptors in the hierarchical chain can be accompanied by their associated descriptors, in ordinary type, preceded by the abbreviation \u2018RT\u2019. The associated descriptors are followed by the number, in brackets, of the microthesaurus to which they belong, except when they are classified in the same micro- thesaurus. An arrow pointing right at the bottom of the page indi- cates that the hierarchical list in the second column con- tinues on the next page. 1.10.2.2. Field terminology The terminology organises the descriptors and non- descriptors in the field alphabetically. The terminology of the field is identified by a title which consists of the words \u2018Field terminology:\u2019 followed by the number and name of the field in capital letters. It is organised in two columns and comprises two types of entry, listed alphabetically. Alphabetical entry based on the first word of the descriptor: \u2014 the descriptor followed by the number, in brackets, of the microthesaurus to which it belongs, in bold type. Example: air force (0821) Alphabetical entry based on the first word of the non- descriptor: \u2014 the non-descriptor in ordinary type; \u2014 on the following line, the corresponding descriptor in bold type, preceded by the word \u2018USE\u2019 and followed in brackets by the number of the microthesaurus to which it belongs. Example: conditions of detention USE prison system (1216) 1.11.

The aim may be simply to consult the thesaurus, to integrate Eurovoc into an application, or to design derived or value- added products. The licence is free of charge, except in the case of a commercial application or redistribution. The different types of licence cover: \u2014 simple consultation for the user\u2019s own purposes or for redistribution (universities, government); \u2014 the linguistic adaptation of the thesaurus; in return, the licence-holder undertakes to provide the new lan- guage version to the Publications Office free of charge; the Publications Office reserves the right to adapt and integrate the data supplied into the Eurovoc thesau- rus; \u2014 the transformation or enhancement of the thesau- rus in cases of regional adaptation or specialist vo- cabulary; in return, the licence-holder must make the differences apparent and offer the additions free of charge to the Publications Office; the Publications Office reserves the right to incorporate these add- itions into the existing structure of Eurovoc. Anyone wishing to obtain the electronic files should contact the originating departments at the following address: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities Originating departments \u2014 Copyright 2, rue Mercier L-2985 Luxembourg E-mail: copyright-info@publications.europa.eu Anyone wanting technical information on the Eurovoc files should contact the Eurovoc maintenance team at the following address: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities Eurovoc maintenance team 2, rue Mercier L-2985 Luxembourg E-mail: eurovoc@publications.europa.eu ",
        "16 2. A DMINISTRATION AND MAINTENANCE The Eurovoc thesaurus is adapted continually to take account of developments in the fields in which the Euro- pean Union institutions are active and of changes in its language arrangements. The special feature of Eurovoc is that it aims \u2014 and is able \u2014 to meet the needs expressed by all its users while keeping in mind the objective of covering in a homog- enous fashion the fields of activity of the European Union. A maintenance system has been established to deal with the administration and maintenance of the thesaurus: \u2014 \u03a4he team at the European Parliament examines and evaluates the proposals put forward by the national parliaments and passes them, together with its own proposals, to the maintenance team at the Publica- tions Office; \u2014 The maintenance team at the Publications Office col- lects and examines the proposals made by all users. It coordinates the work of the Maintenance Committee and is responsible for IT and technical developments and for monitoring translations; \u2014 The Maintenance Committee, made up of representa- tives of the various EU institutions, votes on the vari- ous proposals and decides on the amendments to be made to the thesaurus; \u2014 The Steering Committee supervises the project and officially adopts each new version. All Eurovoc users with proposals and suggestions for amendments are invited to submit a maintenance form, a copy of which is attached to this publication and can be found on the Eurovoc website. 3. H OW TO USE THE THESAURUS 3.1. Indexing documents Indexing consists of analysing the concepts dealt with in a document or documentary query and representing them with selected descriptors in the thesaurus. The purpose of indexing is to match document displays to queries entered in the system. Search performance in a documentary system and the ability to supply relevant documents depend on indexing quality. 3.1.1. SELECTION Of CONCEPTS The intellectual analysis phase is used to identify con- cepts represented in the content of the document or in the query to be entered in the system. Indexing must be selective (selectivity criterion) Not all the concepts identified when analysing the docu- ment need be used for indexing. Only those for which the document provides meaningful information for the user must be selected. The selectivity of indexing is unrelated to the quality of the thesaurus. It depends on the index- ing policy adopted for each documentation system and the average number of descriptors assigned to a docu- ment (depth of indexing). Indexing must be exhaustive (exhaustiveness criterion) All the concepts for which a document is relevant must be used. Exhaustiveness is the degree of detail with which a document is indexed. It is a function of the features of the thesaurus, its level of pre-coordination (compound terms), the indexing policy determining the depth of indexing and the accuracy of indexing. The degree of relevance of a document varies according to the importance of the concepts. The concepts can be weighted on two levels according to their importance: \u2014 main descriptors, which convey the concepts for which a document is relevant in all cases and for each query; \u2014 secondary descriptors, which represent concepts for which the document may be useful, depending on the user\u2019s query. 3.1.2. TRANSLATION Of CONCEPTS The concept is translated into the working language of the indexer. The indexer searches for the \u2018entries\u2019 which correspond to the concepts selected in the permuted alphabetical version of the Eurovoc thesaurus. There are three possibilities: (a) the concept corresponds to a descriptor (for example, \u2018 education policy\u2019); (b) the concept corresponds to a non-descriptor: the non-descriptor then indicates the descriptor to be used: Example: education subsidy USE education grant (3216) (c) if no entries correspond to the concept, the thesau- rus offers assistance with converting a concept into a descriptor: \u2014 by consulting the permuted alphabetical version for each of the concept equivalents; for example, \u2018budgetary competence\u2019 is not a descriptor of the thesaurus. Looking for the term \u2018budgetary\u2019 in the alphabetical index will lead users to the descriptor \u2018budgetary power\u2019. \u2014 by reformulating the concept in natural language and checking whether it corresponds to an entry in the permuted alphabetical version of Eurovoc; for example, the concept \u2018infamy\u2019 does not exist in the thesaurus, but is represented by the descriptor \u2018defamation\u2019; ",
        "17 \u2014 by identifying the theme(s) or category/ies encom- passing the desired concept and by consulting the subject-oriented version, by microthesaurus (the concept \u2018ecological consequence\u2019, for example, is not included in the thesaurus, but it belongs to the field of the environment. The microthesaurus \u20185206 environmental policy\u2019 includes a descriptor entitled \u2018environmental impact\u2019); \u2014 by expressing a concept through the combination of two or more descriptors (for example, \u2018Wash- ington Convention\u2019 is not in the thesaurus, but can be represented by the descriptors \u2018interna- tional convention\u2019, \u2018animal life\u2019 and \u2018plant life\u2019). The environment of a descriptor clarifies its meaning. The indexer is advised to examine the contextual and semantic environment of each descriptor systematically. The descriptor chosen to represent a concept must be the most specific one or that which is closest to the concept in question, in application of the rules of specificity. \u2014 vertical specificity: the descriptor must be at the same level of specificity as the concept or, failing this, at the next higher level in the thesaurus. Examples: \u00a7 A document dealing with the concept \u2018province\u2019 must not be indexed with the broader term \u2018regional and local authorities\u2019, but only with the descriptor \u2018province\u2019; \u00a7 A document dealing with the function of anaesthet- ist, a concept which is not found in the thesaurus, must be indexed using the broader term \u2018doctor\u2019; \u00a7 A document which examines a particular situation in each Benelux country must be indexed \u2018Belgium\u2019, \u2018Luxembourg\u2019 and \u2018Netherlands\u2019, and not \u2018Benelux countries\u2019. \u2014 horizontal specificity: a concept made up of two or more words must be expressed by a compound or pre-coordinated descriptor, if there is one in the thesaurus, rather than by a combination of single- word descriptors. A descriptor\u2019s degree of specificity increases with the degree of pre-coordination. Example: A document dealing with EU research policy must be indexed using the descriptor \u2018Community re- search policy\u2019, not the descriptors \u2018Community po- licy\u2019 and \u2018research\u2019. The specificity of indexing also depends on: \u2014 the thesaurus itself, which may or may not contain a large number of specific descriptors; \u2014 the indexing policy; \u2014 the indexers\u2019 knowledge of the field. 3.2. Performance of the documentary system The performance of a documentary system relates to its ability to provide one or more documents of relevance to a query. It is measured by the hit or precision rate. \u2014 The hit rate measures the system\u2019s capacity to find all the relevant documents. The hit rate is the proportion of relevant documents found by the system, divided by the number of relevant documents contained in the documentary system. When the system does not retrieve all the relevant documents, there is an infor- mation loss or \u2018silence\u2019; \u2014 Accuracy is a measurement of the system\u2019s capacity to retrieve only the relevant documents or the right answers obtained by the system. The accuracy rate is the number of relevant documents retrieved, divided by the total number of documents retrieved. The retrieval by the system of irrelevant documents is referred to as \u2018noise\u2019. The notions of exhaustiveness and specificity are closely linked: \u2014 Exhaustiveness improves the hit rate but decreases the accuracy. In other words, more documents will be retrieved, but they will be less relevant; \u2014 Specificity improves accuracy but decreases the hit rate. In other words, fewer documents will be re- trieved, but they will be more relevant; To improve the hit rate, it is possible to use an inclusive search or hierarchical autoposting (i.e. the automatic allocation of the descriptors belonging to the same hierarchical chains as the descriptors allocated directly by the indexer). This operation can take place, when the documents are entered in the database, by moving up the hierarchical chain or, when a query is entered in the database, by moving down the hierarchical chain. ",
        "18 \u2014 Ascending autoposting: for example, a search using the descriptor \u2018apprenticeship\u2019 can come up with all the documents indexed under \u2018apprenticeship\u2019 and \u2018vocational training\u2019, which is the higher-level broader term; \u2014 Descending autoposting: for example, a search us- ing the descriptor \u2018dismissal\u2019 will come up with all the documents indexed under \u2018dismissal\u2019, \u2018allowance for dismissal\u2019 and \u2018severance pay\u2019, which are narrower terms. If some concepts are not represented in the Eurovoc the- saurus, an authoritative list with \u2018free\u2019 descriptors should be created. These candidate descriptors can be made available to the Eurovoc maintenance team via the maintenance form annexed to this publication or via the website. ",
