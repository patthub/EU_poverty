        "4 OPEN DAYS 2014 - 12 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 4 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Editorial These were my first OPEN DAYS as European Commissioner for Regional Policy. I was very happy to be part of this annual event and I was impressed by the variety of exchanges that took place during the week. The OPEN DAYS clearly demonstrate the important role of Europe\u2019s regions and cities in delivering the EU\u2019s political priorities. The themes chosen for 2015 reflect this link between action at the local level and the challenges we face in today\u2019s increasingly interdependent world. Workshops on the \u2018Energy Union\u2018 looked at how European regions and cities can help the EU become a world leader in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Events on the Digital Single Market allowed for exchanges on the contribution of cohesion policy to investments in vital infrastructure, and the development of online services for businesses and citizens. The discussions that took place under the heading \u2018Regions open for business\u2018 were to me of the utmost importance, as the vast majority of European businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises, and SMEs provide two in three jobs in the private sector. Debates focused in particular on the role of Smart Specialisation Strategies, development of innovation capacities and support to setting up micro enterprises. Finally, the theme \u2018Places and spaces\u2018 emphasised how EU interventions in urban areas play a key role in developing cities\u2019 ability to innovate, create new economic activities, and address social cohesion challenges, in particular in deprived urban areas. A specific OPEN Urban DAY was organised on 14 October in the Canal area of Brussels gathering more than 800 practitioners, officials and experts from all over Europe. In addition to these priorities, stakeholders had the opportunities to discuss challenges and solutions related to programme management and better implementation and simplification, as well as to the cross border, inter-regional or transnational dimension of cohesion policy. As every year, part of the workshops focused on academic/policy relevant research in the frame of the OPEN DAYS University that included a Master Class for PhD students aiming to improve the understanding of EU Cohesion Policy and its research potential. The OPEN DAYS, again, gave cities and regions the opportunity to share about their capacities to create growth and jobs and implement cohesion policy, and to prove the importance of their contribution to sound European governance. In this publication you will be able to find the main outcomes of their exchanges and discussions. I would like to thank all those that attended the events and contributed to make the OPEN DAYS a success. I look forward to collaborate with President Markku Markkula and his team for the preparation of the next European Week of Regions and Cities taking place from 10 to 13 October 2016.

        "OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 5 Editorial The 13 th edition of OPEN DAYS underscored the fact that regional policy is at the heart of Europe. This year\u2019s event focused on \u2018Europe\u2019s regions and cities: partners for investment and growth\u2018 and almost 6 000 people from 40 countries took part in over 140 workshops, debates and seminars between 12 and 15 October 2015. Against the backdrop of EU cohesion policy and its EUR 350 billion investment budget for 2014 to 2020, participants had the opportunity to learn about and discuss three key themes: Modernising Europe - the role of regions in delivering the Energy Union and the Digital Single Market; Regions open for business \u2013 boosting SME development, innovation and job creation on the ground; and Places and spaces - urban and rural development and integration. The OPEN DAYS\u2019 success lies in its openness, a perfect match for the changing mind-set in innovation, a key topic of the 2015 event. As stated in the CoR\u2019s five-year priorities, Europe needs to renew the urban agenda to boost the bottom-up approach and the entrepreneurial mind-set. The OPEN urban DAY, the presence of the robot NAO, developed as part of the ERDF-funded project \u2018Juliette\u2018; the Seal of Excellence launched by Commissioners Moedas and Cre\u0163u in order to foster synergies between research and cohesion funding; and the 2015 RegioStars Awards honouring Europe\u2019s most innovative regional projects, all demonstrate that regional and local authorities are innovation leaders guaranteeing open innovation ecosystems and a thriving environment for public and private investments. I would also like to flag up the 200 OPEN DAYS local events in 30 countries, organised by the 177 regional and independent partners. These events, which take a broader approach to EU cohesion policy and European issues, were organised in cooperation with European associations, networks, universities and specialist agencies, bringing Europe home to an estimated audience of some 30 000-40 000 people. These proceedings are a testament to the wealth of know-how, experience and views shared this year between regions and cities. I would urge you to keep networking and exchanging ideas until the next event on 10 to 13 October 2016. I wish to thank all participants for their commitment and valuable contribution and to salute the excellent working relationship with Commissioner Corina Cre\u0163u and her team as well as with all the other partners involved. I am really looking forward to meeting you again at the European Week of Regions and Cities 2016!

        "14 OPEN DAYS 2014 - \u2260European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 14 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Opening session The 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities, co-organised by the European Commission and the European Committee of the Regions, gathered in Brussels some 6,000 EU, national, regional and local leaders, fund managers and final beneficiaries to discuss the challenges and opportunities of mobilising funding for bottom-up growth projects from the more than \u20ac350 billion of EU Cohesion Policy funding made available for 2014-2020. A high-level debate on Monday 12 October on \u2018A smart EU Cohesion Policy\u2019 opened the week\u2019s programme. Under the title \u2018Europe\u2019s regions and cities: partners for investment and growth\u2019 the 13 th OPEN DAYS were opened by the European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Cre\u0163u and the President of the European Committee of the Regions, Markku Markkula . Commissioner Cre\u0163u introduced the key themes of the event: \u2018Modernising Europe - The regions in the Energy Union and the Digital Single Market\u2019 looking at renewable energy and energy efficiency; \u2018Regions open for business\u2019, with emphasis on SMEs and Smart Specialisation Strategies, and \u2018Places and spaces\u2019 about future challenges for European cities\u2019 territorial development, rural competitiveness and the issue of rural-urban population drift. Over the next 8 years, the ESI Funds will deliver a critical mass of investments in a number of key areas, which should make a significant contribution to getting the European economy growing and creating jobs again. Commissioner Cre\u0163u announced that in 2014-2020, 20 billion euros would be invested in digital projects, and more than 38 billion euros would be devoted to fostering the low-carbon economy, which is twice the amount invested in this area during the previous funding period. Also, over the next 8 years, the ESI Funds will deliver a critical mass of investments in a number of key areas, such as support to SMEs, investments in basic infrastructure to improve peoples\u2019 lives and the competitiveness of their business environment, but also investment in the skills and adaptability of the workforce, which should make a significant contribution to getting the European economy growing and creating jobs again. In his welcoming address, the President of the European Committee of the Regions, Markku Markkula , emphasised the need to jointly defend the principles of solidarity and smart cohesion policy. Cities and regions remain the driving force for investments and sustainable growth. However, in order to boost investments and stimulate growth it is also necessary to take into account the inter-linkages between urban and rural areas as many regions still need support in assuring balanced growth, in particular when it comes to job creation. Moreover, President Markkula drew attention to a more effective and integrated use of all resources while striving to simplify procedures, and welcomed the co-creation of the Knowledge Exchange Platform, together with the DG for Research, Science and Innovation, as a new tool for engaging regional and local authorities as innovation leaders in open innovation ecosystems. To conclude, President Markkula reminded the audience that regional and local authorities are directly confronted with concrete challenges, and citizens expect tangible results from EU policies. The Europe of the future is a Europe of citizens and hence enhancing forward-looking partnerships between the EU and its people is critical. Ram\u00f3n Luis Valc\u00e1rcel Siso , Vice-President of the European Parliament, stressed the importance of cities\u2019 and regions\u2019 ability to create jobs and growth, in which the active involvement of local and regional authorities was critical in implementing policies to support sustainable growth. The new cohesion policy was a central pillar for public investment, which nevertheless required adequate implementation of the projects that it financed. The Member States and their regions must select high quality projects which foster more well-being and produce the most spin-off effects. Vice-President Valc\u00e1rcel \u201dOur Funds represent a forward-looking investment policy, an essential pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe, which is ready to tackle the challenges we are facing, today and in the years to come. Now it is up to Member States, regions and cities to seize this opportunity.\u201d European Commissioner Corina Cre\u0163u Livre OD2015.indb 14 08/01/2016 15:33 ",
        "OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 15 Opening session Siso then pointed out that Europe\u2019s cities and regions could learn from each other and create strong alliances to face major challenges such as global warming, youth unemployment and migration. The latter needed to be tackled on a European scale, in which the Member States must stand united and find the political will to support the frontline border regions dealing with high migratory flows. After the introductory statements a special guest, NAO, an interactive, programmable humanoid robot, whose development was co-funded by the ERDF project \u00abJuliette\u00bb, took the floor and had a short discussion with the afore- mentioned speakers. Today over 5000 of these NAO-robots are used for research and education purposes, operating in over 70 countries. NAO\u2019s visit brought the OPEN DAYS to the new robotic era, and was a fitting introduction to the keynote speech by Carlos Moedas , European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation. He presented two new initiatives that were launched recently: The \u2018Seal of Excellence\u2019 and the \u2018Knowledge Exchange Platform\u2019, which aimed to maximise European innovation potential. The \u2018Seal of Excellence\u2019 would be awarded to excellent proposals which do not get Horizon 2020 funding, permitting innovative Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs) to benefit from positive Horizon 2020 evaluation results when seeking support from other sources. The Horizon 2020 SME Instrument, designed for SMEs to develop, test and produce innovative products and services, would serve as a pilot. On the other hand, the Knowledge Exchange Platform will have an impact at local and regional level as a facilitator for the transfer of knowledge related to EU funding priorities. Commissioner Moedas encouraged the building of synergies between Horizon 2020 and the Structural Funds, including new \u2018teaming actions\u2019, such as the establishment of centres of excellence in partnership with leading research institutes, and encouraged local and regional actors to become active drivers of change and to embrace innovation, particularly in the areas of biotechnology, energy, key-enabling technologies and public sector innovation. Karl-Heinz Lambertz (BE/Party of European Socialists), First Vice-President of the European Committee of the Regions, drew attention to the need to guarantee the capacity for action and investment of all regions and cities, including the less-developed ones, to make sure that the true objective of cohesion policy would be achieved. Moreover, the European Commission was called upon to apply its margin of interpretation in implementing the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pack to mitigate the costs related to the migrant crisis, which threatened the important work carried out so far within the framework of European cross- border cooperation. Catiuscia Marini (IT/Party of European Socialists) emphasised the need to use the European Fund for Strategic Investments to its full potential to mobilise private financing. Urban areas were centres for research and innovation, but these activities should be spread more extensively across territories to help overcome territorial differences. Moreover, the success of the Cohesion Policy requires improved indicators, more efficiency in resource management and more emphasis on sustainability. Michael Schneider (DE/European People\u2019s Party) alerted the audience to the fact that the EU seemed to be constantly in crisis mode, dealing with an increasing number of challenges. Mr Schneider called for a clear demonstration of the continuity of policy work and for showcasing what was achieved in regions with both regional support and with help from EU funds. Moreover, a working group on the future development and simplification of the Cohesion Funds, beyond 2020, should be set up. Bas Verkerk (NL/Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe) stressed the link between the EU and its cities and regions, which should be reinforced. Mr Verkerk drew attention to the need to make the European integrated urban agenda a reality, including better coordination and more involvement of cities in the legislative process. This required policies targeted at the realities faced by cities. \u201cEach time the EU is confronted by serious challenges \u2013 from the economic crisis to the unprecedented flow of refugees seen in recent months - structural funds are identified as a crucial tool in shaping the EU\u2019s response to shared problems\u201d. President Markkula Livre OD2015.indb 15 08/01/2016 15:33 ",
        "16 OPEN DAYS 2014 - 12 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Opening session Stanislaw Szwabski (PL/European Alliance Group) reminded that regions drive investments and growth. A new vision of innovation was needed, as well as targeted investments across European territories. Innovation and Smart Specialisation were crucial for improving competitiveness. Public-private partnerships should be strengthened, and the roll-out of the Juncker plan enhanced. To conclude, Mr Szwabski highlighted the importance of regeneration for all regions, including both urban and rural areas. Gordon Keymer (UK/European Conservatives and Reformists Group) called for greater localism: rural areas must be kept alive, made attractive for young generations, and be easily accessible by transport. He pleaded for a Green Paper on Mobility, because mobility challenges were a barrier to sustainable and inclusive growth. Mobility issues in challenged regions should be better-recognised and addressed in the full range of the EU\u2019s programmes. Andrey Novakov , Member of the European Parliament (BG/European People\u2019s Party) highlighted that the Cohesion Policy was not only about infrastructure. Moreover, the young generation was an engine for much-needed change, from traditional industry to a knowledge economy. A European Unitary Patent System, protecting inventions in 25 countries, must be put in place, enabling the protection of innovative ideas. The European Union should create an enabling environment for fostering sustainable growth. The second part of the OPEN DAYS Opening session included a discussion between three academics on the topic of \u201cSmart EU Cohesion Policy\u201d. It addressed challenges for EU Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 and the move towards smart regional specialisation strategies and \u201csmart implementation\u201d of the policy. Roberta Capello , Professor of Regional Economics of the Polytechnic University of Milan, welcomed the paradigm change in Cohesion Policy, which included a broader interpretation of innovation as more than just a research and development- driven policy, together with a more bottom-up approach, which enabled regions to develop their own strategies. Major risks in the actual implementation phase, particularly in less- developed regions, included the lack of preconditions when it came to innovating and to identifying their technological domain, and diversifying their innovation activities. Professor Capello stressed the importance of identifying the real regional competitive advantage and providing leverage for territorial capital assets. Philip McCann , Professor of Economic Geography, University of Groningen, pointed out that Smart Specialisation was an element amongst others in the reformed cohesion policy. How these elements (Urban Agenda, LLCD, partnership principle, results orientation) would work together, complemented by the bundling of different funds, was critical. Smart specialisation focused on putting the competing priorities on a sound footing in order to foster a shared understanding between stakeholders, so as to create scale advantages. It embodied a continuous process of learning, including monitoring and evaluation for the purposes of building more effective policy frameworks. Slavo Rado\u0161evi\u0107 , Professor of Industry and Innovation Studies, University College London, elaborated upon the challenge of integrating place-based innovation policy with global value chains and on complementing innovation and value chain policies. Smart specialisation required developed institutional set-up and needed to be tailored according to national and regional needs, taking into account the different levels of research and development capacities among the EU-28. A discussion between the audience and the academics followed. The Opening session was concluded with a networking cocktail at the European Commission premises. 16 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Workshops Modernising Europe Livre OD2015.indb 16 08/01/2016 15:33 ",

        "Workshops Modernising Europe 18 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have for a considerable time been hailed as the miracle cure for a number of problems that ail Member States \u2013 business stagnation, inefficiency, opacity, online usability problems etc. In this respect, the development and implementation of ICTs for e-government is of particular interest. E-government aims to facilitate the interaction between citizens and the central or local authorities. The idea is to deliver more efficient government services in order to enhance knowledge sharing, capacity building and sustainable development. However, in a number of Member States, the focus is still on making services available rather than providing transparency or good governance. This leaves ample room for development in areas such as user centricity, speed and service delivery. The workshop explored successful case studies where ICT solutions have enhanced good governance, empowered citizens and proved to be an effective platform for generating benefits in the form of new employment, better health and education. Main messages and conclusions: The moderator, Fran\u00e7ois Decoster, Mayor of Saint-Omer, kicked-off the seminar by introducing the example of France \u2013 large number of cities needing to coordinate their work \u2013 to illustrate the benefits of e-government. Maximilian Strotmann outlined that \u2018e\u2019 should automatically be part of government and that it also stood for effective, economic and engaging government. According to him, government should be digital, open, and interoperable, which was also why the European Interoperability Framework was created. However, he regretted that the rules set by this framework did not apply to the European institutions, which were well placed to bring about the most significant changes as they were in constant interaction with the public and private sectors. Frank Leyman presented the ambition of Belgium\u2019s Ministry for Digital Agenda, Telecom and Postal Services to be in the EU\u2019s digital TOP 3 by 2020. This was why the Digital Belgium project was created to prepare an environment for using e-government. It was based on the following 5 pillars: digital infrastructure, digital economy, skills and digital jobs, trust and digital security, and digital government. Eriks Zegelis addressed the more practical solutions and explained the objective of the ICT centre in Riga, namely to provide a data centre with one cloud for employees and one for clients, which adapted new e-services to the citizen lifecycle and user centricity. He added that this centre used ICT to transform its public service delivery and promote good urban governance. Its greatest asset was to provide all services \u2013 front office as well as back office \u2013 electronically. The three guest speakers presented the European, Belgian and Latvian points of view respectively, as well as specific e-government practices and ICT solutions. They all agreed that although e-government was a high-risk matter, it was also an opportunity to be seized. However, one technical and practical difficulty remained: getting out of the legacy system; and it had to be overcome since the cost of keeping it would grow exponentially in the coming years.

Hughie McGrath , CoR Member, Tipperary County Council, Ireland EU policy for regenerating town and city centres Outline The seminar examined the issues local and regional authorities face in the process of regenerating their town and city centres. Many of these centres have lost their \u2018focus of activity\u2019 due to the development of large-scale shopping outlets on the outskirts of towns and also to the development of estates around towns and cities. There are also issues concerning planning and a lack of investment in urban centres. Bringing together policy- makers and practitioners, the discussion followed a focussed approach and has put forward policy proposals that could further develop into an \u2018EU policy for regenerating town and city centres\u2019. Main messages and conclusions: Many town centres have lost the vibrant spirit that characterized them just a few decades ago due to the relocation of shopping and business centres at the outskirts of towns. Although the EU has invested considerable amounts in sustainable urban regeneration, there is a fear that much of it has focused on investments in larger cities, while towns and small cities have been neglected. Linda Gillham (CEMR) called for the EU Urban Agesnda to recognize local needs and provide fit for purpose instruments to adresss those needs. A clear example of a coherent strategy for regenerating town centres was examined, showing how a bold property investment plan of the Runnymede Borough Council is shaping the town centre and creating more opportunities for development. Towns situated in the proximity of metropolitan areas see their best skills being drained towards the big cities - due to good transport links and attractive salaries, thus the urgent need to think outside of the box and demostrate confidence in investing in the local economy. Towns and cities differ greatly from eachother, in terms of history and development and thus no one-size- fits-all solution can be put forward. The problems that city centres encounter vary from traffic, pollution and crime, to loss of attractiveness , visiual chaos or mosaic structures. Moreover, private developers and ownership structures issues may pose problems to the regeneration processes. Three models for city centres regeneration have been proposed by Prof. Dutkowski . Whereas \u2018side-effect regeneration\u2019 and \u2018partial regeneration\u2019 provide incomplete solutions, the model of comprehensive regeneration addresses the whole array of issues that city centres face. This requires planning, programming and coordination at the EU, national, regional and local level. In terms of initiative, approaches to town centre regeneration may be community led, business led or community led. The particular case of East Renfrewshire Council was looked into and presented by Ms McNamara , showing how the different approaches are not mutually exclusive. The Business Improvement Districts were among the best welcomed initatives. Cllr McGrath addressed the issue of previous planning and the need for a traffic management plan, while calling for the preservation of the towns\u2019 character. Issues of maintaining incomes within the community as well as brand identity taking over local historical footprint, were raised during the debate.

Its huge potential for jobs and investment creation is seen as the way forward by many European regions seeking economic renewal; its role in regions\u2019 smart specialisation strategies is therefore crucial. The workshop explored and shared best practices on bioeconomy policies built up by the regions, the European institutions, and other stakeholders. It was also the first initiative of the Knowledge Exchange Platform jointly developed by the European Committee of the Regions and DG Research and Innovation of the European Commission. Main messages and conclusions: In the context of the newly launched Knowledge Exchange Platform, whose first theme is the bioeconomy, the workshop explored policies and best practice. The chair of SEDEC, Yoomi Renstr\u00f6m , launched the debate by noting that the bioeconomy is a wide concept, covering the parts of the economy that use renewable biological resources from land and sea to produce food, materials and energy. Thus to the lay person it seemed that almost anything can be included in the bioeconomy: from raising pigs to producing biofuel for aviation, from growing carrots to manufacturing antibiotics. Forestry was a key component too. We tended to forget that about 40% of the EU is covered with forest. For some countries, it is more than 70%. Ms Renstr\u00f6m also noted that for branches of industry concerned about their image the bioeconomy label can be useful, but she expressed the hope that the bioeconomy, and the related concept of the circular economy, would be a paradigm shift rather than a rebranding exercise. She also mentioned the \u201cfood vs. fuel\u201d debate taking place in relation to the bioeconomy: some researchers argued that the debate was artificial and that the same hectare of land could produce both. John Bell from DG Research and Innovation presented the latest EU strategies and measures in this area. He pointed out that the bioeconomy represents 22 million jobs and annual turnover of 2 trillion euros. Mr Bell called for better cooperation with the regions and better use of R&I results. The new European Strategic Investment Fund and the just launched Seal of Excellence initiative were further avenues to explore. The importance of the regions was echoed by Rogier van der Sande , the CoR\u2019s rapporteur on the bioeconomy. He pointed out that the regions have the best understanding of available value chains and that the triple or quadruple helix structure of cooperation needed to be in place to guarantee success. Biomass had to be mobilised in a smart and sustainable way to create business opportunities and jobs, he argued. The workshop then examined best-practice case studies from the Champagne-Ardenne and Picardy regions as well as the success story of Novamont S.p.A in Italy.

The workshop also included a networking and partner brokerage session that gave participants the opportunity to find partners and develop project ideas more fully. The Smart Energy Partnership workshop included presentations from Nicosia (Cyprus), Cambridge (UK), Sardinia (Italy), Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag (central Norway), Flevoland (The Netherlands), Silesia and Warmia-Mazury (Poland), and West Norway. There were also introductions from both the European Commission and the EU\u2019s Executive Agency for SMEs (EASME). Main messages and conclusions: The event was opened by a keynote speaker from the European Commission, Margot Pinault , Policy Officer, DG Energy, who spoke about the Energy Union and EU financing for local/regional sustainable energy investments. She presented the energy and climate targets that have been set for 2020 and 2030 and the EU\u2019s Energy Union policy. Ms Pinault also drew participants\u2019 attention to a new Energy Efficiency call that had recently opened under the Horizon 2020 programme and presented some of the opportunities that this call offered public authorities. Presentations were given by speakers representing each of the eight European regions of the Smart Energy Partnership, on good practice in delivering the EU\u2019s Energy Union ambitions: - addressing green skills shortages in the construction sector - the need to build skills, capacity and understanding to mobilise local energy investment - developing regional policy on green public procurement and energy efficiency - delivering a sustainable energy approach in an industrial region - establishing a demonstration site for new technologies: a living lab - developing a new spatial plan and wind energy strategy - investing in renewables with the aim of producing, distributing and selling own energy - delivering the first zero-emission ferry in the world After the presentation of project examples, a brokerage event was held to allow participants to develop project ideas. Four sessions were held, each focusing on a different theme: green skills and jobs, energy efficiency, innovative financing and low carbon. This part of the event was opened by Vincent Berrutto , Head of the Energy Unit at the Executive Agency for SMEs. Mr Berrutto presented the EU funding landscape for local sustainable energy projects and highlighted some of the call topics that might be of particular interest to public authorities.

        "Towards resilient, sustainable and resource-efficient Energy union - the role of European capital cities and regions Outline The European Commission Energy Union initiative aims at providing efficient, environmentally sustainable and economically affordable energy for the EU. Creating a pan-European energy network will contribute to higher long-term economic growth, energy security and reaching ambitious CO 2 reduction goals. During the debate, the representatives of six capital cities/regions briefly presented their different strategies and case studies. These included technical measures implemented to improve energy security and resilience to future shocks, electricity and gas monitoring and control systems at distribution and transmission levels, building efficient heating networks to reduce demand, implementing long-term energy strategies and projects in the field of energy storage to name just a few. Main messages and conclusions: City of Berlin Through its principal power company, Stromnetz Berlin GmbH, Berlin focuses on technical measures and smart grid while trying to reduce power consumption and lower its CO 2 emissions. The following trends characterise developments in the Berlin power network: \u2022 Power generation is becoming decentralised \u2022 Mobility is becoming more electric \u2022 Electricity is gaining importance as a source of energy \u2022 The grid is becoming digital A Number of measures are being implemented to decrease power consumption in Berlin (from 6.689 GWh in 2010 to 5.940 GWh in 2015) despite the growing population (+ 40 000 inhabitants in 2012 alone).

        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 23 Outline In recent years, the multilateral dimension of the EaP has developed and moved beyond governments to encompass parliaments, local authorities, civil society and business. Since the Vilnius summit in 2013, the EU has signed Association Agreements with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The Association Agreements are a key means of achieving the democratic development and deep modernisation in the partner countries for which their populations are calling. Main messages and conclusions: CoR President Markku Markkula opened the event by noting that the Riga summit had put into focus the implementation of the Association Agreements and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements (DCFTAs) which was seen as a top priority for the EU and the partners concerned for the coming years. He appreciated the excellent cooperation with Euronest on areas of common interest. He also presented the outcome of the CoR-Ukraine Task Force meeting which had taken place on 30 September and reaffirmed the commitment of the European Committee of the Regions to supporting the reform process in Ukraine by mobilising political and practical support from regions and cities in the European Union. In her statement, Heidi Hautala , co-president of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, expressed her concern about the lack of democratic reform and about human rights violations in both Azerbaijan and Belarus, and commended the historical steps which Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine had made in deepening their European integration by signing Association Agreements with the EU. Ms Hautala appreciated the good cooperation between Euronest and CORLEAP and was committed to fulfilling the ambitions of future objectives and turning the commitments of the Eastern Partnership and its parliamentary dimension into concrete deeds and achievements. Martin Hagstr\u00f6m , Ambassador for the Eastern Partnership and Swedish foreign minister, presented the perspective of the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the EaP, expressed the support of his government for the principle \u201cmore for more\u201d and appreciated the progress made by the three EaP countries which had signed Association Agreements. Mykola Povoroznyk , Head of Economy and Investment Department at the executive body of Kyiv City Council, presented the activities undertaken by Kyiv municipality in order to gradually implement EU requirements and standards in various fields of city administration. He spoke about the ambition of the Ukrainian capital to achieve reform in order to become an example and a model for other Ukrainian cities in the EU integration process. The main session of the event was followed by a networking session where Sergey Tatusyak, chairman of the Dniester Euroregion, presented the achievements and future prospects of the area, and said that he believed that synergies would make it possible to adapt rapidly to European standards.

        "Emission Impossible? \u2013 Linking policy and low-carbon transport projects Outline The workshop presented four Interreg projects focusing on low-emission transport; North Sea Region Electric Mobility Network; Baltic Biogas Bus project; HyTrEc and CARE-North+. It examined the motivation for participating in these projects and their results. Low-carbon transport solutions are essential to modernising Europe, but how do these projects reflect and support regional policies? The workshop was chaired by the Chair of the NSC Transport Group, Cllr Preben Friis-Hauge . Head of the Interreg North Sea Region Programme, Christian Byrith , moderated a political discussion on transnational cooperation in sharing good practice and policy development, seeking to link regional policymaking and transnational projects in terms of how these elements interact. Main messages and conclusions: The Chair, Cllr Preben Friis-Hauge , began by emphasising the importance of international cooperation and sharing best practice, especially with regard to projects for innovating new technology and solutions to current challenges. The issue of green, low-emission transport was a focus area in the North Sea Region 2020 strategy, adopted by the North Sea Commission in 2011. The projects chosen for this workshop were among the most successful transport projects from the North Sea Region in recent years. Each project had a different focus for their presentation, based on their successes and results. E-mobility concerned communication strategy; Care North + focused on their success with citizen involvement; Baltic Biogas Bus focused on the challenges and possible solutions for procurement and tender procedures for technological projects, and HyTrEc ended with a presentation on the project\u2019s close link to the regional strategy and planning of Aberdeen City. The workshop ended with a panel discussion, involving the following panellists: Cllr Andreas Lervik , Cllr Henk Brink , Cllr Preben Friis-Hauge , and the project managers. The main conclusions were the need for citizen involvement and dissemination of knowledge and the importance of sharing best practices in order to achieve this. At the same time, there was no doubt that change hurt, which meant that governments had to take the lead. A strong link between project portfolio and regional policy was vital. The world was changing fast and policy/strategy needed to keep up the pace. 13A09 13 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: North Sea Commission Chair/moderator: Councillor Preben Friis-Hauge , Chair in North Sea Commission Transport Group, Denmark Christian Byrith , Head of Secretariat, Interreg North Sea Region Programme, Denmark Speakers: Councillor Henk Brink , executive board, province Drenthe, The Netherlands Rebecca Karbaumer , Project Manager, City of Bremen, Germany Councillor Andreas Lervik , Vice Chair Transport Committee, \u00d8stfold County Council, Norway Nelson Rojas , Project Manager, Hordaland Oil, Gas and Energy, Norway Yolanda Schmal , Interreg coordinator, Province of Noord-Holland, The Netherlands Amy Smith , Project Officer, Aberdeen City Council, Scotland Jan Wijkhuizen , Region of Noord-Holland, The Netherlands \u201cIn order to change hearts and minds you have to educate people, both the people and those governing the people.\u201d Workshops Modernising Europe 24 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Livre OD2015.indb 24 08/01/2016 15:34 ",
        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 25 Outline The objective of the workshop was to present the outcomes of a study developing a competency framework for efficient management and implementation of the ERDF/CF. This included a presentation and demonstration of a self-assessment tool that could be used by administrations to identify competency and skills gaps among their staff and thus define training and recruitment needs. This was part of a wider goal of supporting further professionalisation of the management of the ESI funds. There was a presentation on experiences in Lithuania with using a competency framework for public administrations. Finally, a speaker from Croatia presented some ideas on the possible benefits of the competency framework for their management and control system. Main messages and conclusions: Alessandro Cenderello gave an overview of the study on the competency framework for efficient management and implementation of the ERDF and CF. Vytautas Krasnauskas then demonstrated a draft version of the self- assessment tool. The audience learned how the self-assessment tool could be used to identify know-how gaps in the organisation and how this could be translated into training and/or recruitment plans. Loreta Maskalioviene shared the experience of the Lithuanian managing authority on using a competency framework for public administration. The final presentation was given by Helga Bubanovi\u0107 Dev\u010di\u0107 , who talked about the perspective of a Member State that sees itself as a potential future user of the competency framework. One major challenge when developing a competency framework was to do it in such a way that it could be used by different types and sizes of administrations, working in different contexts. A balance also needed to be struck between the framework being detailed and specific enough to be useful, but at the same time not being too complex. It was important to bear in mind that the self-assessment tool should help in setting up and developing an efficient and effective organisation. It was thus not only about the competencies of each individual staff member but also about the competencies of the administration as a whole. What key competencies are required for managing and implementing the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund? 13A10 13 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG REGIO Chair/moderator: Ann-Kerstin Myleus , Deputy Head of Unit, Competence Centre for Administrative Capacity Building, DG REGIO, European Commission Speakers: Alessandro Cenderello, Partner, Ernst & Young Special Business Services Vytautas Krasnauskas , Manager, Ernst & Young Baltic Loreta Maskalioviene , Director of the EU Structural Assistance Management Department, Ministry of Finance, Lithuania Helga Bubanovi\u0107 Dev\u010di\u0107 , Assistant Minister, Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds, Croatia More information links: http://bit.ly/1MvyvYx http://bit.ly/ZOCxFR Livre OD2015.indb 25 08/01/2016 15:34 ",
        "Using a smart combination of funding sources to boost energy investment at a regional level: synergies between European Structural and Investment Funds and HORIZON 2020 Outline Research and innovation are key drivers for jobs and growth at regional level. They are the first among the Thematic Objectives of European Structural and Investment Funds for the period 2014-2020. Furthermore, the existence of a Smart Specialisation Strategy, focusing on a place-based research and innovation strategy, is an ex-ante conditionality for any Operational Programme supporting research and innovation investments under ESIF in the current programming period (2014-2020). The aim of this workshop was to show how regions could boost research and innovation in the field of energy by using a smart combination of funding initiatives. Special attention was given to synergies between HORIZON 2020 and European Structural Investment Funds and to cross-border and interregional cooperation. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop provided us with a good understanding of the \u201csmart specialisation\u201d process on the basis of the conclusions reached by the \u201cRIS 3 Assessment\u201d Expert Group set up by the European Commission\u2019s DG R&I. RIS 3 aims at optimising R&I investments through European Structural and Investment Funds. Its design implies an entrepreneurial development process and requires openness. Synergies between HORIZON 2020, ESIF and COSME in particular are key to increasing the impact of our investments. We also learned more about European research, innovation and competitiveness in energy thanks to an introductory presentation on the integrated Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) and its importance within the Energy Union strategy. Two thirds of all regions defined energy as one of their priorities for smart specialisation and the ten priorities of the SET-Plan should encourage regions and cities to contribute even more actively to Energy Union. Synergies in EU funding should also be promoted in the field of energy in order to contribute to more growth and jobs. Two FP7 projects helped us to understand how these objectives could be translated into concrete actions with EU support. The COOLSWEEP project aims at promoting ways to extract energy from waste and the innovative use of by-products thanks to active cooperation between regional research-driven clusters. The Joint Action Plan defined at the end of the project is very much based on interesting synergies promoted by the regions involved, such as Lombardy and the Basque country. In the case of Aragon, the FP7 We@EU project contributed to a better definition of water and energy priorities in the regional innovation strategy. The implementation of such a strategy however remains a difficult challenge while offering opportunities in terms of cooperation and internationalisation. 13A11 13 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: DG Research and Innovation, European Commission Chair/moderator: Doris Neumann , DG Research and Innovation, European Commission Speakers: G\u00fcnter Clar , Chair of the \u201cRIS 3 Assessment\u201d Expert Group Gwenna\u00ebl Joliff-Botrel , Head of unit in DG Research and Innovation, European Commission Marianne Reime , The COOLSWEEP project, synergies between the RIS 3 and a \u201cRegions of Knowledge\u201d project in the field of renewable energy from waste, Norway Marisa Fernandez , WE@EU project, opportunities and difficulties to boost water and energy innovation, a regional perspective in a European context, Spain Workshops Modernising Europe 26 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Livre OD2015.indb 26 08/01/2016 15:34 ",
        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 27 Outline This workshop demonstrated how regions had put in place appropriate channels/means to make the necessary investment in second-tier cities and to create a favourable business environment to foster transition to smart urban development of the future in the framework of several EU flagship initiatives. In order to attract sustainable energy investments into urban areas, information on investment opportunities should be channelled, exchanged and better targeted \u2013 the concept of \u201cone-stop shops\u201d should be further developed for investors and public administrations alike with regard to administrative simplification and blending of financial instruments, particularly in buildings, energy infrastructure and waste management. Smart investments would have an impact on the construction sector and would therefore affect the value chains in which cities and industrial centres were organised. Innovative smart city projects could challenge the working methods of traditional construction firms, but potentially also their business models. ICT was not only used for administrative purposes, but more and more as a tool for process management construction projects. Main messages and conclusions: Financial instruments and technical assistance schemes offer concrete opportunities for a wide range of urban development projects, covering the needs of various economic operators (communities, SMEs and property owners). Different tools are available for managing authorities and have proved successful in various contexts. However, good governance is also vital to align urban development funds with city investment strategies and local economic structure. Actual experience should be more widely shared amongst managing authorities and economic operators. The participants agreed that the territorial impact of EU policies, and not just of the cohesion policy funds, should be better ascertained. This applies to existing EU flagship initiatives (e.g. Energy Union) and to forthcoming initiatives such as the Single Market Initiative, which could further improve the business environment. Innovation, economic diversity, human capital, transport connectivity, place of quality and strategic governance capacity are key factors not only for territorial performance but also for attracting enterprises and investors in urban development projects in second-tier cities.

        "How can local projects benefit from the Juncker Plan? The Long-Term Investors (NPBs) approach Outline National Promotional Banks and Institutions (NPBs), having a public mandate and a wide array of financial products, combined with deep knowledge of domestic markets and local projects, are willing to support EU policies and contribute to the success of the EU Investment Plan. President Juncker sees them working in close cooperation with the Commission and EIB Group to enable Europe to draw together appropriate resources and expertise to restore growth, by fostering strategic investments and attracting private investors. The members of the ELTI Association presented their contribution to the Juncker Plan and how they can help local communities in their countries. Main messages and conclusions: The priority of the Juncker Plan is to foster investment in order to develop European competitiveness and enable a sustainable rebound in growth in the European Union. \u2022 Local authorities are the natural stakeholders to support investment projects initiated locally, because of their management capacity and their role as public investors. \u2022 The National Promotional Banks (NPBs) exist to facilitate the deployment of the Investment Plan in their own countries. They can mobilise financial and technical resources in order to encourage the emergence of local development projects. \u2022 The NPBs want to use their close cooperation to foster the emergence of joint investment platforms, which can be bilateral or multilateral (e.g. Marguerite II). Effective cooperation with the European Investment Bank will also be a key element in the success of the Juncker Plan in the European Union. 13A14 13 October 2015 14h30-17h00 Organiser/leader: European Long-Term Investors (ELTI) Association Chair/moderator: Dominique de Crayencour , Secretary-General of ELTI Association, Belgium Speakers: Christophe Bourdillon , Head of European Division at Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations, France Nicolas Merigo , CEO, Marguerite Fund, Luxembourg Bernardo Bini Smaghi , Head of Business Development, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, Italy Robert Kasprzak , Head of Structured Finance Department, Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, Poland Workshops Modernising Europe 28 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Livre OD2015.indb 28 08/01/2016 15:35 ",
        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 29 Outline Making the transition to a secure and sustainable energy system is a key feature of the European Energy Union package. Investment in local networks and energy efficiency projects are fundamental to its success. Costs are estimated at EUR 200 billion annually in the next decade alone. Access to financing will be a major challenge for the public sector at a time when financial capacity is limited. As the implementation of new EU Structural & Investment Fund (ESIF) programmes gets underway, there are many opportunities for local authorities to finance smart and energy-efficient cities that run projects designed to benefit citizens, save energy and reduce carbon emissions. Main messages and conclusions: Integrating sectors is an essential element of smart city solutions. The Urban Platform was introduced by DG Connect in order to bring together different application providers and services. It is a shared space where collective standards can be used to test the most efficient tools for integration and impact. The representative from DG Regio underlined the importance of \u201cSmart city local energy services\u201d and discussed thematic objective four (supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy) and thematic objective seven (removing bottlenecks when applying for ERDF and Cohesion Fund financing during the 2014-2020 period) extensively. The Cohesion Policy aims to double investment under the low-carbon thematic priority alone. Future applicants were reminded to be aware of synergies between Research and Innovation and the ESIF, as well as the key role played by ESIF in the practical implementation of the Energy Union. All speakers underlined that citizen\u2019s expectations are growing, whilst local authorities face a number of competing challenges. Technology and the internet of things offer a real opportunity for new technologies to make a big difference to water and energy consumption patterns locally. Local authorities still need to innovate to meet citizens\u2019 rising expectations and shrinking public sector budgets. Case studies: Veolia demonstrated the benefits of the \u201cSmart Water box\u201d and the \u201cHubgrade.\u201d These are innovative solutions that allow cities and/or their utilities to optimise water and energy management. \u201cUrban Pulse\u201d is an application that grants citizens an optimal overview of their city. Case studies: INFRAX Belgium showed how connected infrastructure can deliver economies of scale and improved services to smart city communities. Case studies: The City of Valladolid is delivering smart city innovation through an ecosystem approach rather than the traditional service delivery approaches that local governments have adopted in the past. The moderator concluded that the smart city local energy services agenda needs to innovate and find different ways of working \u2013 i.e. public-private partnerships (PPPs) / ecosystem approaches \u2013 in order to cope with the various risks it addresses. The speaker from Primo highlighted the challenges that local government CEOs face, namely: complex issues, budgets that are larger than the municipalities, a lack of cooperation, linear/hierarchal rather than ecosystem approaches due to traditional ways of working, lack of overall ownership and a fragmentation of stakeholders. Some of the key opportunities for local authorities identified in the session included the need for funding and the refurbishment of district heating networks. The need to promote performance-oriented public services at EU level was highlighted.

        "Workshops Modernising Europe 30 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings How to modernise transport services through a smart combination of Innovation Procurement and ICT Outline The workshop focused on the transport sector, highlighting ways to modernise public transport services through the smart combination of Innovation Procurement and ICT. Ms Bos shared key information on the implementation, benefits and funding opportunities for PCP/PPI under H2020. Dr Tsanidis explained how synergies between H2020 and ESIF could be achieved to support Innovation Procurement in the transport sector. Mr Kerstjens presented an example of a PCP implemented by the Brabant Region in the Netherlands to reduce shockwave traffic jams on highways through R&D breakthrough solutions. Dr Somma presented the P4TS project, which funded a network of transport procurers aiming at identifying common needs and preparing joint procurements. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop illustrated that Innovation Procurement was a powerful tool that helped drive innovation from the demand side in Europe. In periods of economic crisis, Innovation Procurement offered a unique opportunity to optimise public expenditure in an effective way that resulted in the modernisation of public services and also provided support for new market players such as SMEs and start-ups. The European Commission recently launched an initiative called European Assistance for Innovation Procurement. Under this initiative, key procurers in different domains of public interest (transport included) will be identified, practical guidance (toolkit) on how to implement Innovation Procurements will be produced, events to raise awareness about Innovation Procurement will take place across Europe and on-the-spot assistance will be provided to procurers across the EU on how to implement PCPs/PPIs. The workshop also highlighted that the momentum could not be more appropriate for regional stakeholders to benefit from available H2020 and Structural Funds co-financing opportunities as well as the synergies between these two funding programmes to boost innovation in Europe through Innovation Procurement. Examples from the transport sector showed that Innovation Procurement could also be an effective tool in the transport domain. Regions and regional stakeholders should seize the opportunity and opt for new and innovative solutions in the transport domain instead of buying off the shelf, pushing the market to deliver better quality products/services at a lower cost and at the same time paving the way for a more effective use of the Structural Funds budget that would also help the regions to meet the goals set by their Smart Specialisation Strategies. 13A16 13 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG CONNECT Chair/moderator: Dr Maria-Cristina Marolda , Policy Officer, European Commission, DG MOVE Speakers: Lieve Bos , Policy Officer, European Commission, DG CONNECT Dr Vasileios Tsanidis , Policy Officer, European Commission, DG CONNECT Oene Kerstjens , Advisor IT Province of Brabant, The Netherlands Dr Giacomo Somma , Project Manager, Ertico, Belgium More information links: EU policy initiatives on Innovation Procurement https://ec.europa.eu/digital- agenda/en/news/eu-policy- initiatives-pcp-and-ppi European Assistance for Innovation Procurement Initiative www.eafip.eu Livre OD2015.indb 30 08/01/2016 15:35 ",
        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 31 Outline Modernising Europe through regional and urban policy means implementing the operations agreed in the corresponding strategic documents (Partnership Agreements and Operational Programmes) of the Member States and timely achievement of expected results. These operations may include projects (infrastructure, productive investments, etc.) defined as \u2018major\u2019, based on their total eligible costs. Their successful implementation lies primarily in the preparation stage; thus the early and appropriate knowledge of requirements and risks is crucial. The workshop presented and discussed these issues with participants from national, regional and local authorities, consultants, financial institutions, European and national associations, academics and researchers from EU and non-EU countries. Main messages and conclusions: In the 2014-2020 programming period, major projects under the European Regional Development or Cohesion Fund have to go through new and different appraisal and approval procedures before the Commission can make a final decision about their eligibility for EU funding (one of these procedures foresees a tacit agreement within three months of the project\u2019s submission to the EC, if no substantial weakness exists). There are important changes compared to the 2007-2013 programming period. These require project promoters and managing authorities to make smooth and timely adaptations: compulsory list of major projects in operational programmes; major projects defined on the basis of new criteria (total eligible costs instead of total costs, higher thresholds for some type of projects); stronger emphasis on results and project feasibility; first works contract to be concluded within three years of the date of approval; and simplified rules for financial and economic analysis while demonstrating that projects warrant EU financing. Due to their dimensions, complexity and impact, major projects require considerable financial resources and time to be prepared to the appropriate standards. The main risk factors in project appraisal and approval concern the project\u2019s effects on the environment, the potential effects of the environment on the project due to climate change (a new requirement), the justification for public contribution and its relation to state aid matters, and the overall quality and consistency of the project information provided. From a Member State\u2019s perspective, the importance of ensuring the project\u2019s financial sustainability and avoiding a very optimistic approach to future financial flows at the project planning stage were highlighted. The importance of using external expertise wisely by also ensuring the internalisation of received knowledge was emphasised. Researchers\u2019 findings provided insights into the particular behaviour patterns that major and megaprojects (over 500 million euro) exhibit and the importance of the regulatory environment\u2019s strength, external stakeholder involvement and governance structures. The creation of Special Purpose Entities for ensuring sound project management was suggested. Addressing the above issues, having early and appropriate risk assessments and active monitoring during the project\u2019s lifecycle can reduce delays and cost overruns, which otherwise could jeopardise the timely achievement of expected results.

        "Workshops Modernising Europe 32 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Innovative and socio-ecological urban dynamics Outline The seminar highlighted how European cities may become emblematic places for attracting jobs and economic activities, transforming them into \u201chubs of innovation\u201d preserving natural resources and limiting environmental damage for the next generations. At the core of this transformation, innovation and sustainable urbanisation stimulate green but also blue growth. These would make it possible to move towards resource-efficient and more liveable cities enjoying technological, marketing, organisational and especially social innovations. This workshop exploited the most recent EU research and innovation initiatives sponsored by the EU Framework Programme. Main messages and conclusions: Dr Rossetti di Valdalbero emphasised that through Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme, more than EUR 400 million would be invested in urban research in 2016 and 2017. Topics included Smart and Sustainable Cities, demonstrations of urban road transport automation, and EU-China cooperation on sustainable urbanisation. Dr Rossetti advocated the sustainable reconciliation and exploitation of the concepts of \u201cindividual empowerment\u201d and \u201ccollaborative economy\u201d. Professor Lombardi talked about \u201cEuropean cities as leaders of the socio-ecological transition\u201d. She showed how EU cities were improving their energy efficiency in the built environment despite the overall increase in energy consumption (rebound effect). The new transformation included renewables and the circular economy. Anticipatory experiences demonstrated that the transition was ongoing and that several EU cities were leading the way internationally. Citizens were becoming active decision-makers. I\u00f1igo Bilbao provided concrete examples of how the City of Vitoria-Gasteiz had become a European Green Capital. Vitoria had 90 km of bicycle and pedestrian routes in the Green Belt. Vitoria could inspire medium-sized cities (where 84% of the EU population live) to green their policies and their environment, increase new public spaces and create innovative functions like public gardens. The passive house standard (which uses 90% less energy) could become the norm for new large-scale refurbishments. Dr de Boissezon underlined the importance of \u201cnature-based solutions for smart, sustainable and resilient cities\u201d. Nature provided many options for fighting floods, soil contamination and air pollution. \u201cOpen innovation, Open science and Open to the world\u201d supported trends towards sustainability and integrated resource-efficient solutions. Nature helped cities to become more resilient. EU activities leveraged investments (public and private sectors) and supported replicable solutions. Dr Gr\u00fcnig presented the work carried out on establishing a \u201cRoadmap for European post-carbon cities\u201d. The transformation was a paradigm shift to answer the challenges of climate change and biodiversity. One example of good value for money investments was Copenhagen\u2019s blue cycling lanes or car-free superblocks (400/400 m). Foresight research activities had to take account of the youngest citizens - such as primary school children - as they were building future urban sustainability. 13A19 13 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG Research and Innovation Chair/moderator: Dr Domenico Rossetti di Valdalbero , Principal administrator, European Commission, DG Research and Innovation Speakers: Prof. Patrizia Lombardi , Head of Department, Politecnico di Torino, Italy Arch.

        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 33 Outline Regions and cities are showing leadership in fostering sustainable development, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and driving the low-carbon economy agenda in Europe. While local authorities face the urgent socio-economic challenge of ensuring secure, sustainable and affordable energy for their communities, the Energy Union and the development of a single energy market are intended address the current challenges of integrating variable renewable energy and guaranteeing security of supply. This event shared solutions and provided insight into communities\u2019 increasingly important role in spurring low-carbon investments to implement climate policies, as well as generating local employment through utilising Structural and Cohesion Funds and innovative financing models. The event was followed by a networking session during which the Mayors in Action and 50000&1 SEAPs projects presented best practices, providing the opportunity to network and discuss. Main messages and conclusions: As the transition will occur at local level, city and regional governments are the key players in achieving the EU\u2019s sustainable energy goals. Civil society and consumer choice are crucial for the success of the Energy Union. Cities need ambitious strategies, and financing is a means of implementing their vision. The regional level can support cities in finding their own way to apply good models of investment and financing, adapting them to their local context. Projects like Mayors in Action and 50000&1 SEAPS show how working together and learning from each other can catalyse local sustainable development, providing inspiration for implementing sustainable energy measures. Planning for sustainability and resilience is an exercise that needs to be reviewed in light of the evolving economic situation and that must be realised by all stakeholders in a cooperative way so as to improve the performance of European cities while reinforcing the resilience of their job markets.

        "Workshops Modernising Europe 34 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Sharing costs and infrastructure amongst network operators: a win-win scenario for broadband, smart growth and inclusion Outline The workshop objective was to raise awareness about the mutual benefits of cross-sector cooperation between electronic communications providers and utilities and facilitate the sharing of best practice. The role of local and regional actors in incentivising the synergies and efficient use of infrastructure as well as the role of the regulators in enhancing the implementation of the provisions of the Cost Reduction Directive was also emphasised. To set the context for the discussion the workshop opened with a presentation on the opportunities for cross-sector synergies created by the Cost Reduction Directive. This was followed by best practice examples of existing cross-sector synergies in infrastructure deployment and operation. Main messages and conclusions: Several best practice examples of cross-sector synergies presented at the workshop show that cooperation between sectors is already ongoing, and that there is scope for mutual synergies and benefits, enabling the development of innovative technological solutions and business cases. First, Alexandre Serot spoke about Vodafone\u2019s experience in fostering the deployment of FTTH in Ireland, Spain and Portugal in cooperation with the energy sectors. In Ireland ESB (electricity provider) and Vodafone entered a complex JV agreement to build and operate a fibre network. The synergies achieved in Spain and Portugal allow for better service differentiation and innovation, greater control over the product development cycle, and ultimately better connectivity. Second, Simon Simonsen from Vejen Municipality in Denmark emphasised the importance of the municipality\u2019s role in enhancing broadband roll-out for the community\u2019s benefits. Vejen had become one of the leading regions in Europe with around eight out of ten households connected to a high-speed fibre network. This was the result of very successful cooperation between municipalities and two local utility companies owned by consumers as well as the search for future-proof solutions and synergies at all levels. The fibre infrastructure, network operation and provision https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/ of services and content have to be considered holistically to identify potential synergies and cost reductions at all levels. Third, Alessandro Zorer presented the experience of the alpine Province of Trentino which, since 2008, had been successfully implementing its plan to turn Trentino into a land of innovation, based on NGA networks. The synergies with electricity networks as well as lessons learned were discussed. Trentino Network is a local public company, fully owned by the Autonomous Province of Trento, which deploys, manages and operates broadband Telecom infrastructure and offers services to public institutions and to private network service providers under fair, transparent and non-discriminatory conditions. Trentino Network collaborates with local municipalities and utilities in fibre optic deployment in conjunction with other public services (energy, lighting, gas). Finally, Katalin Gallyas presented Amsterdam Smart City project, which is a PPP initiated in 2009 with the aim of transforming Amsterdam into a Smart City. Once again the emphasis was on the role of the municipality combined with the search for long-term sustainable solutions based on NGA networks. 14A02 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Commission DG CONNECT Chair/moderator: Wolf-Dietrich Grussmann , Head of Unit B1 Regulatory Coordination and Business, European Commission, DG CONNECT Speakers: Wolf-Dietrich Grussmann , Head of Unit B1 Regulatory Coordination and Business, European Commission, DG CONNECT Alexandre Serot , Head of Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs for Fixed Services, Vodafone Group, Great Britain Simon Simonsen , Project Leader, Vejen Municipality, Denmark Alessandro Zorer , President, Trentino Network Srl, Italy Katalin Gallyas , Open Innovation Manager, Amsterdam Municipality, The Netherlands More information links: http://ec.europa.eu https://ec.europa.eu/digital- agenda/en Livre OD2015.indb 34 08/01/2016 15:35 ",
        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 35 Outline Part 1: EUSALP: an opportunity to foster sustainable growth in the Alps The aim was to analyse the added value and steps taken to foster sustainable growth, ecological transformation, jobs and innovation in the Alps. Part 2: Save energy and create new jobs \u2013 the use of sustainable materials The intention was to discuss both how to save energy and how to create new \u201cgreen\u201d jobs, products and services. Main messages and conclusions: The European Strategy for the Alpine region (EUSALP) is based on three pillars which are essential for its future. The third pillar aims to ensure sustainability in the region, i.e. fostering of an integrated and environment- friendly framework and an energy strategy that is both renewables-based and reliable (with a view to the international agenda and the upcoming COP21 in Paris). The first part of the conference focused on opportunities to boost sustainable growth in the Alps. Key aspects were the implementation of the action plans, the role of the regions and the mix of various European, national and regional instruments. Speakers emphasised ongoing challenges in relation to implementing the EUSALP strategy, e.g. multi-level-governance and its coordination, lack of cooperation between cities and regions and climate change issues. It was therefore necessary for regions to cooperate strategically and to focus on clear objectives. Regions needed strong support from all stakeholders to achieve these goals. The second debate concentrated on the potential for saving energy and creating new jobs by using sustainable materials. Speakers stressed the need to further improve energy efficiency. In this context, wood might play a key role as a raw material. Speakers also underlined the urgent need to promote renewable energy sources. The Alpine macroregion should aim to become a role model for self-sufficient energy sourcing. An inside view was given by the private sector that show-cased the benefits and rewards of successfully enacting this vision. The arguments put forward highlighted the crucial importance of implementing projects whose outcomes could be measured and that provided direct feedback.

        "Future sustainable energy supply \u2013 biomethane and CNG as an example Outline Turning organic waste into biomethane, a second generation biofuel, creates great opportunities, jobs and economic growth, while improving energy security, emissions reductions and rural development. The EU has ambitious targets for renewable energy, and transportation must be recognised as a sector that can contribute to achieving these goals and overall decarbonisation of the industry. Introducing innovative energy solutions requires cooperation, and we have a number of successful public-private cooperation projects in place across Europe. The workshop showcased successful partnerships and experiences and their potential benefits for regional communities, presented funding opportunities and discussed biomethane\u2019s role in relation to the EU\u2019s 2020 objectives. Main messages and conclusions: We are all dependent on transport. Having said this, biomethane and natural gas are very good alternatives in the management of transport needs and also in dealing with external emissions and climate change. The workshop gave the audience a good overview of the biomethane industry in Europe, as well as the growing market for CNG vehicles. Several speakers said that it was clear biomethane provided many benefits to society, such as clean fuel for city buses and cars, organic fertiliser, improved air quality, and jobs and growth. Biogas and biomethane were a means of creating a sustainable society, e.g. within a circular economy. Waste became a resource and drove new business opportunities. Nevertheless, the single business case was hard for a company to handle. The EU and its Member States could not expect the transition to biomethane to happen if the industry had to compete on the same terms as fossil fuels. The extra cost to benefit fully from biomethane must be covered by society. All speakers highlighted the need for instruments and policies to integrate biomethane into the renewable energy contribution. The transition from oil to natural gas was important to the EU Commission, but Antonio Tricas from DG Move said that this transition must include a reasonable proportion of biomethane. Biomethane could potentially cover 10% of the total needs of the transport sector. It was thus clear that biogas, biomethane and natural gas needed to co-exist if we wanted to create a viable market for CNG vehicles. There are many successful biogas and biomethane projects in Europe. We saw examples of biomethane production, digestate business \u2013 including algae treatment \u2013 grid injection and waste separation. Today\u2019s examples were from Uppsala and Skellefte\u00e5 in Sweden, Vaasa in Finland, Valmiera City in Latvia, Gas Networks in Ireland, Miskolc in Hungary, Lille in France, Vienna in Austria and Ljubljana in Slovenia. We also learned that interest in biogas and biomethane varies between the Member States. The success factors for these examples were: - collaboration - a holistic view of the system - brave and consistent politicians The barriers to achieving a growing market across Europe were: - expensive production costs compared with the market price for fossil fuels - lack of consistent policies - lack of knowledge of biomethane possibilities at local and regional level About 90 people from 13 countries took part in the workshop. 14A04 14 October 2015 09:00-13:00 Organiser/leader: BioFuel Region AB Chair/moderator: Dr Jan Stambasky , president of the board, European Biogas Association, Belgium Speakers: Antonio Tricas , policy officer, European Commission, DG Move Lennart Pilskog , secretary-general, Natural and biogas Vehicle Association, Belgium Agata Przadka , secretary general, European Biogas Association, Belgium Ian Kilgallon , innovation & business development manager, Gas Network Ireland, Ireland Gy\u00f6rgy V\u00e9csi , president of the board, Miskolc Holding PLC, Hungary M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Niklass , development engineer, Zieme\u013cvidzemes Atkritumu Apsaimnieko\u0161anas Organiz\u0101cija, Latvia Johan Saarela , development engineer, Stormossen Oy, Finland Anna S\u00e4fvestad Albinsson , project manager, BioFuel Region AB, Sweden More information links: www.biofuelregion.se/ipse2020 and www.youtube.com/ watch?v=Gm-TaIwi82M Workshops Modernising Europe 36 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Livre OD2015.indb 36 08/01/2016 15:35 ",

This approach is tailor-made and bottom-up, and is inspired by the EGTC-Regulation. However, it clearly has a different focus and is complementary to it, as an EGTC alone does not change the legal framework. Main messages and conclusions: Mr Dobroslavic is the rapporteur of the European Committee of the Regions\u2019 opinion requested by the Luxembourg Presidency, which was adopted on 13 October 2015, the day before the workshop. The opinion highlights the importance of cross-border cooperation for regional urban and rural development, and welcomes the initiative of the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union\u2019s Council of Ministers to enhance the cross-border regulatory framework with new tools. It also backs the European Commission\u2019s plans to analyse the gaps, solutions and best practices in cross-border cooperation. Mr Peyrony presented a possible typology of obstacles in the field of cross-border obstacles: institutional, administrative, economic, lack of knowledge, lack of propensity to cooperate. He quoted a number of issues at the Cerdanya hospital, which constituted serious obstacles and needed legal certainty, which could be addressed through the tool proposed by the Presidency. Mr Sik highlighted ongoing differences in the national implementation of European regulations in border regions, the unpreparedness of entrepreneurs and difficulties in obtaining comprehensive information and services. The TRANSARMON project in the Italy-Slovenia Interreg programme sought to create a tool against administrative barriers affecting SME operations in the cross-border area. Mr Oser analysed 3 examples of the differences in the approach of various countries and the keys for success for cross-border projects for tram lines, child care and vocational training for young people. Another project for a cross-border Industrial Park could not be achieved due to different labour laws. Ms Monfret recalled the recent conference to mark 25 years of Interreg. She mentioned the achievements of Interreg, as well as the success factors of cross-border cooperation: trust building, connectivity, health, safety and growth. She gave an overview of the additional strategic actions to tackle persistent border obstacles. The Commission had started a study and launched a public consultation (up to 21 December 2015). The outcome would be published in an issue paper, due by the end of 2016.

        "Research Infrastructures (RI) as drivers of knowledge and innovation in European Regions Outline The workshop aimed at raising awareness and showcasing concrete examples of synergies between different EU funds for construction and/or upgrade of Research Infrastructures (RI) and their role as knowledge drivers within regional innovation ecosystems. PaneI I \u2018Setting the Scene - Role of RI: regional drivers of knowledge\u2019 gathered the views of: the European Commission, the Committee on Regional Development (EP, managing authorities and the OECD. Panel II \u2018RI and the European Regions\u2019 showcased examples of projects supported by FP7, H2020 and ESIF: Extreme Light Infrastructure and European Spallation Source and the framework conditions allowing synergies. Around 80 participants (managing authorities/regional representatives) attended the workshop. Main messages and conclusions: The panellists not only shared their experiences by presenting cutting-edge research infrastructures but also by explaining the specific role played by synergies between FP7/H2020 and the Structural Funds, which the new ESIF Policy Framework had made possible since it provided more opportunities. The workshop underlined the key role played by Research Infrastructures in regional development and capacity building, as \u201chot spots\u201d for science and innovation, which attracted human capital and investments. By generating benefits and positive spill-overs, RIs have an increasing socio-economic impact for society at large. The need to improve coherence across EU policies, and boost synergies between EU, national and regional efforts in science and innovation was stressed. Smart Specialisation Strategies were presented as a powerful tool to support innovation in the regions. The importance of open policy coordination involving all relevant actors was highlighted. The main conclusions of the OECD report on the major economic and societal impacts of CERN were summarised, underlining both long-term impacts which could be planned (employment, scientific advance, training, international cooperation), positive spill-overs which could be incidental and the indirect impacts on innovation. The event illustrated how synergies could positively contribute to fostering the attractiveness of a region, investing in a centre of scientific excellence and enhancing the human factor, creating the right environment for fostering endogenous skills and creating new talents. Moreover, it showed how a cutting-edge single-sited research infrastructure was already generating positive spill-overs through the use of different funding sources by mobilising resources from various regions, even outside the main site location. Emphasis was placed on the importance of referring to Smart Specialisation Strategies and, where relevant, to the ESFRI Roadmap when designing operational programmes. The tools and platforms available to support regions and managing authorities during the implementation process were also described. During the final remarks, useful recommendations were presented, including the need to further stimulate the implementation of simplification measures in the Structural Funds, as already done for H2020. 14A06 14 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG Research and Innovation Chair/moderator: Dr Peter Dr\u00f6ll , Director - Innovation Union and ERA - DG Research and Innovation, European Commission and Dr Antonio di Giulio , Head of Unit - Research Infrastructure - DG Research and Innovation, European Commission Speakers: Dr Robert-Jan Smits , Director- General, European Commission, DG Research and Innovation Iskra Mihaylova , MEP, Chair of REGI, Belgium Prof. Manuel Garcia , Director- General for Research and Knowledge, Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, Spain Dr Carthage Smith , Senior Policy Analyst and co-ordinator, OECD Global Science Forum, France Prof. Wolfgang Sandner , Director General, ELI-DC International Association, Germany Ute Gunsenheimer , Head of External Relations & EU projects \u2013 ESS, Sweden Katja Reppel , European Commission, DG REGIO Dr Alessandro Rainoldi , DHoU, JRC-SEVILLA, Spain Prof. Maria Gra\u00e7a Carvalho , Cabinet - Commissioner Research, Science and Innovation, European Commission More information links: https://ec.europa.eu/research/ infrastructures/index_ en.cfm?pg=events https://flic.kr/s/aHskiFGCLy Workshops Modernising Europe 38 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Livre OD2015.indb 38 08/01/2016 15:35 ",
        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 39 Outline The European Commission is committed to revitalising social dialogue at both EU and national/regional level. The social partners can play a crucial role in managing transition and implementing EU policies, but need the capacity to do so. Member States can draw on technical assistance from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) to support capacity-building for the social partners. The European Code of Conduct on Partnership provides the framework for involvement of the social partners in the ESIF. Main messages and conclusions: Social dialogue is a key contributor to growth and jobs. However, social dialogue and the role of the social partners have been weakened over the last years, also due to the impact of the crisis. The Commission wants to give renewed impetus to social dialogue in the form of a \u201cnew start for social dialogue\u201d \u2013 enhancing involvement of the social partners in the design and implementation of reforms at European, but even more importantly at national, level. In order for the social partners to play this role at all levels, they need to have the necessary capacity. The workshop identified how EU financial means, the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), and in particular the European Social Fund (ESF), can be used to strengthen social partners\u2019 capacity, when resources are earmarked to this end. Involvement of the social partners in managing these European funds was also discussed. The 2014 European Code of Conduct on Partnership (ECCP) paves the way for a substantial improvement in social partners\u2019 involvement in the implementation of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) at national level. An online survey recently launched by the Commission is intended to gather information from the Member States about good practices. Social Partners have always played, and will continue to play, an important role in the use of the ESF, for instance in the ESF Committee as well as in the Monitoring Committees for each Operational Programme. The social partners need to step up their efforts at national level, given that the ESF is a shared-management fund. The workshop also focused on experience with using the ESF, in particular the use of financial means within the technical assistance for capacity-building, with examples from Poland and the Netherlands. The social partners underlined the positive experience in using the ESF and in particular the capacity-building resources. Active involvement of the social partners in implementing the ESF is crucial and therefore a national strategy for each Member State should be established. However, the administrative burden should be reduced and cooperation between the national and the regional levels as well as different groups of stakeholders should be improved. While there is a general recognition that the capacity of the social partners needs to be enhanced, the exact need for and use of funding for capacity-building depend strongly on the individual Member State Capacity-building for the social partners 14A07 14 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG EMPL Chair/moderator: David-Pascal Dion , Head of Unit, Social Dialogue, European Commission Speakers: Pawe\u0142 Chor\u0105\u017cy , Director, Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, Poland Isabel Coenen , Policy Advisor, Trade Union Confederation (FNV), The Netherlands Artur Mazurkiewicz , President, Dolno\u015bl\u0105scy Pracodawcyde, Poland Stefan De Keersmaecker , Deputy Head of Unit, ESF coordination, European Commission More information links: http://ec.europa/socialdialogue http://ec.europa/esf Livre OD2015.indb 39 08/01/2016 15:35 ",

        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 41 Outline Buildings are responsible for 40% of energy consumption in the EU, whereas heating and cooling for buildings and industry accounts for nearly half of the EU\u2019s total final energy consumption. Upscaling investment in these sectors is essential to meet the EU\u2019s energy targets for 2020 and 2030. New approaches to investment are required. Local and regional authorities can influence the building value chain through policies and projects layered over national and EU regulations. They can enable a shift towards a low-carbon energy system by developing integrated approaches to planning and implementation. Using EU funding, mobilising stakeholders, and developing project pipelines and the business case for attracting private investment are essential to stimulate building refurbishments. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop focused on EU funding programmes for energy efficiency in buildings, as well as heating and cooling. The chair was Vincent Berrutto . Colin Wolfe opened the discussions with a keynote speech highlighting the significance of European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) available for a low-carbon economy (EUR 40 bn in 2014-2020), as well as good practice examples for the use of financial instruments e.g. from Estonia and Lithuania. Paul Hodson presented key outcomes of the work done by the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG) and pointed out that EUR 100 bn/year of investment was needed to achieve the EU energy efficiency target. He also drew attention to the focus on three aspects of financing energy efficiency measures: aggregation, de-risking and market-based culture. Robert Pernetta presented details of the financial instruments and innovative funding opportunities available for energy efficiency under the ESI funds and described specific project examples in the buildings and heating and cooling sectors, from Latvia and the Nord-Pas de Calais region. Joan Josep Escobar presented the Catalan Energy Renovation Strategy for Buildings and its implementation at regional level, also mentioning the public and private stakeholders involved. He gave an overview of different funding sources identified (ERDF, EIB, local, regional and national funding, private investment, etc.) and reflected on how to use them in the most strategic way. Bj\u00f6rn Zapfel gave an overview of instruments available under H2020 and IEE for financing EEF measures in the buildings and heating and cooling sectors. He focused on instruments facilitating innovative financing and in particular on the project development assistance (PDA) mechanism provided by different facilities (EASME, EIB, etc.). Specific project examples from cities and regions (Marche, Italy; Mazovia, Poland; and Purmerend, The Netherlands) and from Slovakia that use these instruments were presented in detail. Overall the event succeeded in showing how innovative ways to address energy efficiency financing can be implemented \u201con the ground\u201d. However, one of the main conclusions was that there was still a need to further increase synergies between projects and funding programmes in order to simplify and enhance implementation and potentially achieve greater energy savings.

        "Digital Skills and entrepreneurship in the Digital Revolution Era: from EU funding opportunities to job creation Outline The Digital Single Market strategy calls for \u2018\u2019the Commission to address digital skills and expertise as a key component of its future initiatives on skills and training\u2019\u2019. We support and encourage stakeholders to make better use of European funding to address the digital skills deficit. Skills are high on the agenda during discussions with European industry on competitiveness. Synergies can be obtained in closer cooperation in view of the skills gap, (also with respect to entrepreneurship) and the skills shortage that affects industry and the economy. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop discussed ways to mobilise funding for digital skills at regional level. Several best practices of regions utilising public funding to implement successful ICT learning programmes (e.g. for young people, jobseekers, career changers) were presented. Furthermore, the workshop addressed the role of industry and the synergies that could be obtained in closer cooperation in view of the skills gap, (also with respect to entrepreneurship) and the skills shortage affecting industry and the economy. We brought together stakeholders who play a key role in mobilising digital skills funding, promoting stakeholder alliances and developing digital skills policies. The presentations and main messages were \u201cnano-electronics for tomorrow\u2019s society: raising skills to pave the way\u201d, \u201cHow to enthuse young people for technology: A View from the Brainport Region\u201d, \u201cThe contribution of the European Social Fund in supporting digital skills development\u201d, \u201cEffective use of EU funds for the implementation of national ICT training and e-skills priorities: Latvia case study\u201d and finally \u201cAMETIC/fTI: 20 years of ICT training experience with public (national) funding\u201d.

The workshop provided very useful discussions and insights into the role of education and industry in skills development, with a very strong participation and engagement from the participants. 14A11 14 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG CONNECT Chair/moderator: Lucilla Sioli , Head of Unit, European Commission Willy Van Puymbroeck , Head of Unit, European Commission Speakers: Prof. Liesbet Van der Perre , Director, IMEC-Academy, Belgium Jos Vreeker , ASML, Belgium Maria Baroni , Policy Officer, European Commission Dr M\u0101ra J\u0101kobsone , Vice president, Latvian Information and Communication Technology Association (LIKTA), Latvia Ventura Pobre , President, Spanish Information and Communication Technology Association (AMETIC), Spain Workshops Modernising Europe 42 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Livre OD2015.indb 42 08/01/2016 15:36 ",
        "Workshops Modernising Europe OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 43 Outline As part of the IT-LV-LU Trio Presidency Programme, this workshop aimed at exploring the potential for a political debate on European territorial scenarios and visions for 2050 and at critically assessing the available material and approaches. Different players and stakeholders from the European and transnational level presented examples of previous experiences and ongoing projects with regard to scenarios or visions. The ensuing debate and interaction with the audience helped to outline access points for a constructive debate with regard to the methodology, output, and maps of a potential scenario or visioning process. Main messages and conclusions: In his introduction as moderator, Dr Eser outlined the ongoing debate on this theme at the intergovernmental level. This outline included a list of policy debates at the European level that could benefit from territorial scenarios or visions and the defining features concerning the methodology, presentation, and added value of such a process. His conclusion summed up the proposals of the Luxembourg Presidency: promoting territorial scenarios in discussions on sector policies at the EU level and in the review of the Europe 2020 Strategy; using territorial scenarios as territorial impact assessments in policy development; and linking a revision of the Territorial Agenda 2020 to a territorial scenario and visioning process. Peter Mehlbye presented the results of the ESPON Project ET2050 on European territorial scenarios and visions for 2050. The presentation explained the scenario-building process and illustrated the three alternative scenarios. The main finding was that, in the short term, the promotion of second-tier cities would create the highest levels of economic growth and territorial cohesion, whereas, in the long term, economic growth in Europe would not be significantly affected by the promotion of any of the scenarios. Lastly, the Director of the ESPON EGTC also outlined the territorial vision of making Europe open and polycentric. Lewis Dijkstra presented the ongoing project of the European Commission to set up territorial scenarios based on economic and demographic regional projections. The purpose of this project is to create a central baseline scenario for EC territorial impact assessments and inform the discussions on the future of Cohesion Policy and related themes through alternative scenarios (including a convergence scenario). T\u0101lis Linkaits presented the VASAB experience of long-term visions for and transnational spatial planning of the Baltic Sea Region, including the Tallinn Vision 2010 and the Territorial Development Perspective of the Baltic Sea Region in 2030. He stressed that these joint visions and strategies were not comprehensive \u2018mega plans\u2019 for the region, but should act as guiding documents for the national authorities. The documents themselves were based on a broad consultation of stakeholders. The ensuing debate and interaction with the audience focused on awareness of external developments, the objective of polycentric and balanced development, and the role of maps as a communication tool.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 46 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline The objective of the workshop was to introduce and promote the use of Integrity Pacts for safeguarding EU funds against fraud and corruption and as a tool to increase transparency and accountability in public procurement. The project, which was funded by DG Regional and Urban Policy and entitled \u201cIntegrity Pacts - civil control mechanisms for safeguarding EU funds\u201d, seeks to pilot Integrity Pacts in several EU Member States with the aim of ensuring that regional policy funds are well spent for the real benefit of the people. The workshop presented the concept of the Integrity Pact tool, the experience of implementing IPs for EU-funded projects in Bulgaria, as well as the ambitions of the upcoming project on implementing Integrity Pact pilots in several EU Member States. Main messages and conclusions: Pascal Boijmans presented the European Commission\u2019s position on the growing importance of the fight against corruption in the new programming period 2014-2020 for ESI funds. He presented the anti-corruption measures and awareness-raising events that were organised in 11 Member States and a large conference in Brussels. Greater focus on preventive action should increase the accountability of public officials, promote good governance and increase the transparency of public procurement. Anja Osterhaus provided general information on the benefits and challenges as well as details on the process of implementing the Integrity Pact (IP), a preventive anticorruption tool to address corruption in public procurement. According to the OECD report from 2013, between 20-25% of the procurement budgets (EUR 1.8 trillion) are lost to corruption. Therefore, the increase in transparency and public control and the introduction of independent monitoring provided by the Integrity Pact should enhance the efficiency of EU public investments. Michaela Rajkova presented Bulgaria\u2019s experience with the Integrity Pacts and the lessons learned, as well as the key benefits of taking part in an IP for contracting authorities and economic operators. She also elaborated on the challenges of implementing an IP. Inguna Kramina presented the DG REGIO pilot project carried out with Transparency International as a lead partner. She explained that in May 2015 DG REGIO published two Calls for Expression of Interest with the aim of identifying public authorities and NGOs in Member States willing to pilot Integrity Pacts in projects co-financed by EU funds. As a result, 18 projects have been shortlisted where further preparatory work should be done to set up and implement an IP. Conclusions: The launch of the pilot project on IPs is a learning exercise both for the European Commission and Member States. An Integrity Pact is a collaborative and voluntary tool, thus its success depends on the willingness of all stakeholders involved. The speakers and a number of representatives from the audience acknowledged the complexity of public procurement. The exchange of experience between speakers and audience members from various regions and institutions proved very fruitful. The European Commission would like to utilise the know-how gained from the pilots to promote good governance and good practice in public procurement.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 47 Seal of Excellence: implementing synergies through Horizon 2020 and the European Structural and Investment Funds Outline The European Commission has launched the Seal of Excellence initiative which represents an opportunity for regions and Member States interested in increasing the impact of their investments in research and innovation, by supporting projects from the most dynamic and innovative SMEs. The initiative aims at creating a link between the Horizon 2020 proposals meriting funding and the managing authorities of the European Structural and Investment Funds or any other alternative funding source in the regions and Member States interested in providing the proposals with the required support. The Seal of Excellence initiative is part of the European Commission\u2019s new policy ambition of reinforcing synergies between Horizon 2020 and the ESIF with the aim of achieving a greater impact. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop focused on the Seal of Excellence initiative and synergies already realised in the area of providing funding from alternative sources for positively evaluated Horizon 2020 proposals (but not funded due to the limited Call budgets available). A discussion was held on the opportunities and known barriers for these alternative funding processes as well as new ways of maximising synergy impacts in this area. The speakers from the European Commission explained that the \u2018Seal of Excellence\u2019 is a quality label, awarded to project proposals - submitted for funding under the Calls of the Horizon 2020 SME instrument - which successfully passed a rigorous evaluation but could not be funded under the available Call budget. The \u2018Seal\u2019 therefore identifies high quality proposals which merit funding. Through the \u2018Seal\u2019, regions and Member States can identify these high quality proposals and decide to support them, for example through their Structural Funds, though not exclusively as the label is an open invitation for other funding sources. The use of the \u2018Seal\u2019 represents a saving for the managing authorities of the Structural Funds, both in terms of time and money: it allows them to make the most of the Horizon 2020 high quality evaluation process. Two concrete cases of alternative funding for positively evaluated proposals under the Horizon 2020 SME instrument from Spain and Italy (Lombardy Region) - with their own national/regional funds - were presented. A means of implementing this approach at ESIF level, starting with the strategy and programming levels was illustrated using an example from the ESIF Operational Programme Research and Innovation from the Slovak Republic which arranges synergetic and complementary funding for positively evaluated (but not funded) Horizon 2020 proposals.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 48 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Less than 10% of all projects supported by ETC/Interreg programmes during the 2007-2013 programming period involved SMEs as beneficiaries. However, the 2014-2020 period has given rise to a growing number of programmes that provide opportunities for SMEs to be directly involved in their implementation (as direct beneficiaries, as target groups or as external service providers). This mainly applies to thematic objectives (TO) 1 (Research & Innovation), 3 (SMEs competitiveness) and 8 (Employment & Labour Mobility). The speakers presented different ways to involve SMEs and discussed the challenges and benefits thereof. The discussion also revealed capitalisation between programmes by explaining how one programme can inspire another to take up a specific scheme and adapt it to suit their local circumstances. Main messages and conclusions: The involvement of SMEs is viewed by the programmes both as a necessity and as an opportunity to better address territorial challenges, while increasing prosperity (in terms of growth and jobs). The participation of SMEs improved the quality of project output, thanks to the expertise offered by the SMEs in question and the new and innovative approaches applied. However, the programmes should be ready to take some risks (e.g. audits). From an SME perspective, the benefits of participating in Interreg programmes is also clear, in terms of networking and learning from others. However it also enables them to improve the quality of their products (real industrial value). On the negative side, there is a general concern that procedures are too complex and cumbersome, and often too long to meet SMEs\u2019 short-term needs. The main obstacles identified are as follows: state aid rules, intellectual property rights, public procurement rules, and pre-financing/co-financing schemes (incl. slow reimbursement). In order to address these challenges as effectively as possible, the programmes will carefully assess the options for involving SMEs depending on the type of project and the type of partner. In light of experience gained during the past period, the programmes call for project partner light schemes (e.g. including the SMEs not as partners, but as secondary beneficiaries at a later stage, as applied by the Interreg A programmes Germany- Netherland and Hungary-Croatia) and SME voucher schemes (giving incentives to project partners to involve companies in other countries, applied by the Interreg B North West Europe programme) as tools to increase flexibility and attractiveness. Better information for SMEs on the opportunities available within the programme also appears to be an important means of increasing participation. Such communication should avoid bureaucratic language and help public operators to become more market-oriented.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 49 How the Entrepreneurial Discovery Process contributes to growth and employment Outline Rather than being a strategy imposed from above, smart specialisation involves businesses, research centres and universities working together to identify a region\u2019s most promising areas of specialisation. The key factor for regions open for business is a successful entrepreneurial discovery process. The first session focused on the key innovation stakeholders in regional entrepreneurship systems. The main question was: How to improve governance and to get stakeholders \u2013 especially SMEs and research centres that are disconnected from the local entrepreneurial eco-systems \u2013 more closely involved? The second session focused on the role of public bodies. The effect of entrepreneurial activity on regional development is driven by the institutional context and its quality. Main messages and conclusions: All participants emphasised the sophistication of the entrepreneurial discovery process. This new type of governance is difficult to implement and demands strong bottom-up and multilevel participatory tools to identify and support the most promising activities for economic development. The debate between speakers and attendees was mainly focused on the practicalities of involving higher education institutions in the entrepreneurial discovery process. It was pointed out that there is a clear gap between small businesses and academia which must be closed with the help of specific measures such as technology broker intermediation, specialised support services as in the IOT of Bistra Ptuj centre at Maribor University, or networking events such as the transHAL organised annually by Martin Luther University Halle- Wittenberg. Another approach is that of the Helsinki Think Company Association from Helsinki University, which provides an extensive training program for students and researchers, empowering them with co-working space and advisory and mentoring services to promote entrepreneurship among university students. All participants agreed on the importance of fostering a culture of entrepreneurship, including a second chance for those who fail in their first attempt at setting up an enterprise, and on the need to improve existing industries through innovation. Entrepreneurship should consider new ways of creating companies, by taking into account social and sustainability aspects, as is promoted in the Region of Valencia. It is necessary to coordinate initiatives, as is the case in the Region of Murcia with an acceleration programme for technology- based firms which combines European, national and regional funds. It was pointed out how difficult it is to involve companies in the entrepreneurial discovery process. Clusters have proximity to companies and play an important role in the practical implementation of smart specialisation strategies. This is particularly useful in regions where it is difficult to prioritise, such as Mazovia (with over 60 clusters initiatives). Clusters are also important when analysing global value chains, for identifying competitive advantages and for providing an environment where companies survive. It is worth mentioning the H2020 Call for \u2018Cluster facilitated projects for new industrial value chains\u2019 aimed at supporting the creation of new cross-sectorial industrial value chains for the development of emerging industries. 13B04 13 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: Representation of Saxony-Anhalt to the EU Chair/moderator: Antonio Garc\u00eda Gomez, Esteban Pelayo Speakers: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pinna , CEO, ARITT, Regional Innovation Agency, Centre-Val de Loire Region, France Matti Petteri P\u00f6nti\u00f6 , Chairman at Helsinki Think Company Association, Helsinki Uusimaa, Finland Andr\u00e1s Ibr\u00e1nyi , Head of Department, Local Government of Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County, \u00c9szak-Alf\u00f6ld, Hungary Francisco \u00c1lvarez Molina , Director General, Regional Ministry for Entrepreneurship, Region of Valencia, Spain Aleksandra Pivec , Director, Scientific Research Centre Bistra Ptuj, Slovenia Javier Celdr\u00e1n Lorente , Director, Region of Murcia Development Agency, Instituto de Fomento, Spain Moritz Bradler , Project Manager Knowledge and Technology Transfer / Start-Up Service, Martin Luther University Halle- Wittenberg, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany Piotr Popik , Member of the Management Board, Mazovia Development Agency Plc, Poland More information links: http://ec.europa.eu/growth/ smes/cluster/ http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ http://thinkcompany.fi/ www.eoi.es/blogs/ebtmurcia www.gruendung.uni-halle.de www.armsa.pl Livre OD2015.indb 49 08/01/2016 15:36 ",
        "Workshops Regions open for business 50 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline The area of Research and Innovation is a source of renewed growth and jobs. It is necessary to tackle major social challenges. Aligning this area with the values, needs and expectations of society is fundamental to the EU agenda for jobs and growth, and to contributing to well-being of citizens. Each region is a small eco-system in continuous evolution, and is a result of the different interactions that happen within it. If we work together through the Framework for Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), regions will have the opportunity to achieve better results, more efficiently and more responsibly. This workshop aimed to look at examples of how RRI at regional level has brought sustainable solutions to many social problems. It also addressed current challenges facing RRI, and knowledge on potential ways to develop RRI was exchanged. Main messages and conclusions: There are three main reasons why science and society must work hand in hand. Firstly, technology should not be accepted solely on the basis of economic sustainability. Secondly, diversity in research and innovation is vital for enhancing creativity and improving scientific quality. Thirdly, involving all stakeholders continuously from the early stages is essential for sustainable, desirable and acceptable innovation. Hence, excellence today is about more than ground-breaking discoveries: it includes openness, responsibility and the co-production of knowledge. We need ambition at all policy levels to support the best science for the world and not the best science in the world. Some of the challenges discussed during the workshop included: communicating science to the public and decision makers, integrating responsible research into regional development and innovation strategies and the role of local \u201cliving laboratories\u201d. Experts also stressed the importance of integrating social sciences into the innovation process, which many still perceive as a purely technological one. Experts acknowledged that journalists, the public and decision makers have trouble understanding scientific reports and as a result the information is often mistranslated. \u201cLiving laboratories\u201d may play an important role in engaging the public and demonstrate the benefits of specific scientific research to their region. The final solution discussed was the creation of open spaces and facilities that allow innovative activities to take place. Initiatives like the European Charter and Code for Researchers were endorsed by experts. Among others, this Charter aims to ensure that the relationship between researchers, employers and financial backers encourages the successful development, transfer, sharing and circulation of knowledge and technological advancements, as well as the career development of researchers. Experts and participants were not in agreement over who should be the driving force behind the implementation of RRI within the regional innovation eco-system. It was indicated that the public administration and universities should initiate the process. The need to develop a new framework for knowledge transfer to the community and vice versa was acknowledged, however the fear of additional bureaucracy was expressed both by scientists and business sector representatives.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 51 Innovative Solutions to SME Support Outline Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the European economy, accounting for over 90% of jobs. Thus, supporting SMEs, both emerging and existing, is vital for the current and future health of the European economy, as shown in the EU2020 strategy. Regions need to constantly support their SMEs to improve or maintain their attractiveness as a place to live and do business. This debate presented examples of regional best practice in supporting SMEs, including examples of multi-stakeholder working, how to harness the triple helix effect and how to ensure opportunities for young entrepreneurs. In addition, it focused on how regional authorities have provided and coordinated support for SMEs through EU or regional policies and funding programmes. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop was opened by Micheal Freericks and moderator Richard Tuffs . It emphasised the importance of SMEs in both the European and regional economy, and how learning from best practices can stimulate economic growth and progress in all regions. Tom Schulpen presented a new, successful approach for allocating ERD funds within the Southern Netherlands. Project proposals are prepared in collaboration with triple helix organisations and then pitched to an independent committee. Cross-over between different top sectors is an important criterion for approval. Melinda From introduced Verksamt V\u00e4rmland, a web portal aiming to match entrepreneurs\u2019 needs with the Swedish region\u2019s services. By asking three questions the regional authorities can identify what each SME needs and provide personalised support through a network of experts. Clare Jortveit introduced The Big Money Day, a regional event in South Norway where SMEs and entrepreneurs can learn from best practices and meet with regional funds and organisations that can fund them directly or help them apply. Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011bh\u00e1vka talked about the Olomouc Region in the Czech Republic\u2019s support activities for SMEs and entrepreneurs. He particularly focused on the positive results stemming from the government\u2019s facilitation of strong cooperation between SMEs and local universities through the use of innovation vouchers. S\u00f8ren Bjerregaard Pedersen presented advice on how to achieve economic growth from regional investments. Based on North Denmark\u2019s experiences, he emphasised the role of the public sector as a facilitator and the importance of external financing as a necessary safety net to make SMEs take the plunge into innovative, yet risky, projects. Paul Vigmostad presented West-Norway\u2019s model for getting local SMEs engaged in Horizon 2020. Here, SMEs are chosen from a selection of prioritised industry clusters, and relevant calls are brought directly to them. In addition, there is support for writing applications and for linking SMEs to universities. Cllr Keith Mans talked about the growth hub model being championed by the Local Enterprise Partnerships in Hampshire, UK, which supports high growth SMEs as drivers of growth and jobs. Ard Van der Tuuk presented the Northern Netherlands/city of Drenthe\u2019s support scheme for start-ups and young entrepreneurs.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 52 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Employment is one of the greater challenges for European cities and regions, and instruments such as the ESF and ERDF will provide support for job creation, development of SMEs and investments in training, long- life learning, education and social inclusion. These resources have helped to improve the quality of life of EU citizens, to generate new jobs and to promote research, development and innovation. In the debate, our experts analysed how our cities and regions use the funding made available through cohesion policy, combined with their own resources and strategic approaches, in order to stimulate sustainable, quality employment. The discussion was structured around four main questions: 1. What are the cities/regions\u2019 strategic approaches to creating long-term quality jobs in order to face Europe\u2019s economic challenges? Can you describe the initiatives developed in your city by giving concrete examples? 2. What are the employment strategies included in the OPs of your region to improve growth and employment? Do you involve new stakeholders/PPP in the strategy? 3. Do you have new instruments for implementing your strategy? What has changed from the previous programming period? 4. Is the new cohesion policy allowing for better involvement of cities and regions to tackle Europe\u2019s employment crisis? \u2026Can cities/regions be involved more effectively and with quicker results? Main messages and conclusions: The integration of social and economic agents and cooperation among administrations are key elements for successful projects in the province of Barcelona. The new ERDF concentrates resources in economic areas that can contribute to improving territorial competitiveness by giving more support to companies, innovation and quality employment. In the Hannover region, innovation (especially in sustainable energy solutions), life-long learning and special training offers for under-performing young people in schools and for foreign workers are key for more growth and employment. The Malm\u00f6 model demonstrates the strategic approach and the sustainable vision within the city. Creating an inter-sectoral platform allows for the development of a strategy under which innovative approaches contribute to a sustainable city with improved growth and health equity. The city must work in tandem with the industry and the private sector to identify job opportunities and new trades. In the Wielkopolska region it is proving very challenging to use ESF money properly (i.e. in a credible, efficient way, and to make the effects permanent). In Gothenburg, housing, roads and jobs are not enough to secure the quality of life of the people, their human dignity and the economy. This also requires the development of the social-green related economy integrated into new forms of city planning and business development. European structural funds have made an important contribution to the development of graduate employability in the Liverpool City Region, but there is now a danger that key providers may find that the challenges that come with the funding will outweigh the benefits.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 54 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Bio-Based products for growth and jobs in the EU: the crucial role of regions in boosting the bioeconomy and the circular economy Outline Bio-based industries and products offer significant new opportunities for regions and cities. The workshop examined the economic and growth potential of the bioeconomy for regions, focusing on innovative capabilities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It presented concrete examples of how regional authorities can foster Smart Specialisation Strategies to exploit the potential of the bioeconomy and the development of emerging industries, which in turn lead to growth and jobs in the EU. The workshop outlined, among other things, the Finnish government\u2019s bioeconomy strategy, which included a competition to build a bio-refinery that was won by 3 SMEs. A presentation was given on EIB/EIF SME financing instruments supported by Horizon2020. Main messages and conclusions: Regions and cities depend on local biomass resources such as farming, forest and urban waste streams. It is often at a regional level that investments in new bio-based industries are best planned and where the positive impact is felt in terms of value chain deployment and job creation. While implementing the smart specialisation strategies, it is important that regions make an analysis of the socio-economic and innovation engines of regional growth, competitive advantages and weaknesses. They should involve all stakeholders to sound out potential for critical mass and joint efforts working towards economic transformation. This will also require the identification of a limited set of development priorities on which investment should be concentrated, as well as technological support. Regions should refine their strategies by feeding back information into the policy cycle and allowing strategy adjustment to sharpen priorities. This will imply ensuring the continuity of strategies, implementing the right tools and capacities and generating critical mass by combining forces. The examples showed how public authorities and clusters can work together to foster emerging industries. In order to do so, it is important to use all feedstock resources available (agriculture, forest, industrial residues and municipal waste) in a sustainable way, to develop industrial infrastructure, to get the necessary competence base, as well as to seek new partners and new business, including the reallocation of existing funds or the mobilisation of new funds. Last but not least, political will is decisive for refining the strategies in the bio- economy sector. 13B09 13 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) in cooperation with the European Commission, DG Research and Innovation Chair/moderator: Philippe Mengal , Executive Director, Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU), Belgium Speakers: Katja Reppel , Deputy Head of Unit, European Commission, DG REGIO, Unit G1/Smart and sustainable growth Agnieszka Truszczynska , Policy Officer, European Commission/DG GROW Mika Aalto , Head of Division, Dr. Tech.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 55 Outline This workshop demonstrated the importance of the outward dimension of smart specialisation strategies (S3) and presented the support offered to regions in this domain by the S3 platform and the Interreg Europe interregional cooperation programme. Participants discovered the main results of a survey carried out by the Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in this domain and saw examples of successful interregional R&I partnerships. It also provided an opportunity for regions to learn how they can benefit from the services offered by the Interreg Europe programme on innovation policy-related issues and the links to the S3 platform. Main messages and conclusions: Research and innovation networks are becoming increasingly global and regional innovation policies seek to go beyond regional borders and to take into account the connectedness of regional stakeholders. The new cohesion policy with S3 as ex-ante conditionality is reinforcing the importance of interregional collaboration. However, lack of engagement from key stakeholders, political commitment, clarity of objectives and resources are still the most important barriers to collaboration. The Know-Hub project, co-financed by the Interreg IVC programme, presented its collaboration with the Smart Specialisation Platform (S3) in their work on reviewing and improving their Smart Specialisation Strategies for Research and Innovation (RIS3) and how they built on lessons drawn from the implementation of the previous Regional Innovation Strategy (RIS and RITTS) initiatives. Cooperation, collaboration and community engagement are at the heart of the new Interreg Europe Programme. These \u20183 Cs\u2019 are incorporated into two main support services: interregional cooperation projects and policy learning platforms. Regions involved in projects aimed at improving their structural fund programmes have to explain whether the cooperation project connects with their smart specialisation strategies. This is particularly important for regions applying under the first priority axis, since this axis (innovation) focuses on the implementation of these strategies in European regions. RIS3 development is entering the implementation phase and now is the time to reinforce the collaboration on implementation and policy mix which, according to the findings from a survey carried out by the S3 Platform, are the least developed. To this end, the Interreg Europe\u2019s policy learning platform on the thematic objective of research and innovation will work in cooperation with the S3 platform. The policy learning platform complements the work of the IPTS by focusing on content-related issues and \u201cvertical priorities\u201d, i.e. what is financed in the regions through the S3, while the S3 platform will continue to develop strategy/concept-related aspects (e.g. the six steps in the RIS3 Guide). The policy learning platform in a way represents the \u201cmultiplier of the S3 platform services\u201d in particular with regard to thematic content and its development.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 56 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Evidence-Based Employment Policies \u2013 What Works for Regions? Outline Youth unemployment, demographic change, skills shortages and migration are just a few of the challenges that influence regional economic development and labour markets in Europe. At the same time, regional labour markets play an increasingly important role for the economic power and competitiveness of Europe\u2019s regions. The event \u201cEvidence-based Employment Policies \u2013 What Works for Regions?\u201d organised by Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH aimed to address these issues. Policy makers, researchers and practitioners explored possible approaches, as well as critical factors for building employment policies based more on evidence and \u2018objective\u2019 information through concrete examples from the Veneto region in Italy, North-Rhine Westphalia in Germany, and the Greater Region SaarLorLux. Main messages and conclusions: Successful employment policies build on sound facts and figures (rather than beliefs or assumptions) and require a careful interpretation of the evidence base. Context matters and has to be taken into consideration to capture otherwise disregarded or misunderstood phenomena e.g. cultural norms or trends in the informal sector. The panellists agreed that data sets often co-exist, creating the challenge of assessing the credibility of the data. The speakers stressed that relevant stakeholder groups, such as the private sector or unions should be consulted so that their views are fairly represented.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 57 Outline This workshop presented tools and experience to improve SMEs\u2019 access to public procurement and provided examples of best practice from the stock-taking study which looked at administrative capacity, systems and practices across the EU. Procurement errors remain the largest cause of irregularities, frequently leading to significant financial corrections. Public procurement is the key policy for creating a functioning internal market and open competition. For 2014-2020, DGs REGIO, GROW, EMPL, AGRI and MARE and the European Investment Bank launched a coordinated Action Plan both to reduce error rates and to promote the use of public procurement as an instrument for mainstreaming Europe 2020 policies. The stock-taking study on administrative capacity was one of the key elements of the joint action. Main messages and conclusions: Pascal Boijmans introduced the topic of the workshop highlighting the importance of public procurement for the ESIF funds and the shift from error detection and correction to a focus on preventive measures. He provided information about the joint working group of DGs and explained the measures under the action plan ranging from PP guidance for practitioners and the stock-taking study to trainings and capacity-building measures. Pascal explained that PP is a strategic tool for cohesion policy. Anna-Lena Zademach-Schwierz provided insight on the stock-taking study and its preliminary results. The study is yet to be finalised, therefore suggestions or remarks were welcomed. The expected results of the study will form specific recommendations for MS and the European Commission. Anna-Lena outlined general good practices for authorities to follow, such as ad hoc support for contracting authorities, guidance documents and standardisation or professionalisation of those working in procurement, while the subsequent presentations went into detail about establishing e-procurement or forming consortia in particular Member States in order to increase SMEs\u2019 access to PP. Kerstin Wiss Holmdahl provided the Swedish experience of implementing e-invoicing by central and local administrations. The Swedish experience showed that the need for leadership of core authorities, training for representatives of both public and private sector and the introduction of standards were fundamental for the implementation of e-procurement. Florence Jacquemot presented measures introduced in France that would strengthen the active participation and position of SMEs in the public procurement process. Open sourcing and cooperation of SMEs through the creation of regional eco-systems and platforms should enable French SMEs to exchange experience, provide easier collection of data and increase their chances of securing a tender. Conclusion: While public procurement is a key policy for the functioning of the internal market and open competition within the EU, it is an area of significant financial corrections. The speakers therefore stressed the need for capacity building of contracting authorities and the exchange of good practices that should better enable SMEs to compete for tenders. The stock-taking study will not only provide insight on MS procurement systems and country recommendations but will also promote good practices on how to increase SMEs engagement.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 58 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Supporting SMEs to take advantage of resource efficiency Outline Resource efficiency is one of the main drivers of company competitiveness. This workshop offered the opportunity to find out how public funds can be used effectively to support SMEs resource efficiency and their access to international markets with the help of clusters. Examples from England and Spain were presented in pairs by the managing authority and the contractor implementing the measure. They demonstrated the potential for SMEs and offered the participants ideas on how European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) can be used to assist in making the transition to a low-carbon economy. Main messages and conclusions: ENWORKS, the winner of the RegioStars Award for Sustainable Growth, offers long-standing support to businesses, helping them to increase their profitability by reducing their environmental impact and taking advantage of the growing low carbon and environmental goods and services market. This initiative is supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the UK Regional Growth Fund. Ms Nicholson , the Director of ENWORKS, shared the key to success with SMEs. First of all, SMEs need to have an awareness of economics in order to employ resource efficiency measures. ENWORKS is able to quantify the results of their projects and thus illustrate the benefits available to any company. Moreover, SMEs need free access to services. The role of environmental auditors is essential in helping SMEs see what can be done. One-off projects will fail. SMEs need ongoing support and assistance to deliver results. Mr Joslyn , from the local authority, acknowledged that the \u201cresource efficiency\u201d priority set out under the cohesion policy gives better results if clear indications of the benefits that accompany it are given to businesses. He explained that training was offered to cross-cutting teams within the managing authority, in order to provide them with a good understanding of how the legal requirement to integrate resource efficiency can be included in their projects. Mr Hormaeche , from the European Strategic Cluster Partnership REINA \u2013 that comprises clusters from Spain, Finland and Austria \u2013 explained that due to decreasing demand for renewable energy technologies from European companies, REINA partners, with the support of the EU, prepared long- term strategies to target markets in America. They also organised joint business missions to the US. He concluded that demand for greater resource efficiency also comes from abroad and that SMEs can certainly enter these markets with the support of cluster organisations. Mr Guichard , from the European Commission (the managing authority for this project), explained the reasons behind EU\u2019s support for and promotion of the European Strategic Cluster Partnership. Moreover, he also outlined how the Commission set up the two-step procedure for this call, which helped potential applicants to assess their readiness to establish European partnerships. This procedure also helped to increase the quality of the proposals. Mr Happaerts , from the European Commission, concluded the workshop by explaining the possibilities that the ERDF offers to support resource efficiency in SMEs. 13B15 13 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG GROW Chair/moderator: Peter Czaga , Policy Officer, European Commission Speakers: Samantha Nicholson , Director, ENWORKS, UK Mark Joslyn , ERDF Sustainability Manager, Department for Communities and Local Government, UK Jos\u00e9 I.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 59 Outline The workshop brought together European Commission services (GROW, REGIO, JRC, MARE) with innovative EU regions and networks committed to using the innovation potential of tourism, culture and creative industries (CCIs) for jobs and growth creation. The main goal was to find the best way to effectively implement ESIF funds on the basis of smart specialisation strategies (S3), illustrating the good practices of EU regions, networks and clusters and the synergies between horizontal sectors such as tourism and CCIs. Due to their positive impact on local and regional development, the challenge for the Commission is to reinforce innovative regional eco- systems, adding value at EU level, supporting, coordinating and complementing regional S3 in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty provisions for the next period 2015-2020. Main messages and conclusions: - Innovation is a driver of regional development; - Governance: stakeholders are concerned about the governance process and holistic participation in the life circle of regional S3 process; - Cooperation: need to involve stakeholders from academia, businesses, public administrations and civil society (\u201cquadruple helix\u201d) and investigate synergies between funding instruments (EU, national, regional); - Entrepreneurial discovery: indispensable process when searching for competitive advantages matching R&I with businesses and developing links, adopting technologies for diversification/modernisation of sectors and exploring emerging areas; - Policy choices: S3 are based on policy choices involving the selection of a few priorities on the basis of specialisation and integration into international value chains; - Critical mass of resources and talent: cooperation between regions to avoid duplication and fragmentation; - Tourism diversification: provides competitiveness, sustainability and resilience (contributes to seasonality). It widens the market, having spill over effects in other sectors (creative industries, agro-food, healthcare for elderly, ICT development, etc.); - Relative nature: Innovation depends on the context and capabilities in each region; what is new for one region/area/country is well-established in others; - Sustainability: to be considered during the whole S3 implementation process at all levels. - Evaluation: monitoring ESIF implementation is always difficult due to the existence of different managing authorities, indicators, methodologies, data sources, etc. CONCLUSIONS: To increase cooperation between different public and private stakeholders building on some possible developments at EU level in the coming months: - New policy orientations - More synergies between tourism and CCIs to be defined using a bottom-up approach, - Support for innovation based on close cooperation between DG REGIO and DG GROW to integrate different approaches with thematic smart specialisation platforms and European strategic cluster partnerships (to be further developed through an Internal Task Force and an inter-service working group to identify synergies between the ESIF, COSME, H2020 programmes), - Reinforce cooperation between European networks involved in tourism (FARNET, ENRD, EEN, NECSTouR, ERRIN, EDEN), - Further investigate the role of clusters/inter-clustering in tourism and creative industries to support innovation in these sectors, in order to develop cross-border partnerships in the context of EU cluster policy. \u201cInnovative tourism, cultural and creative industries: building on regional best practices for an effective use of European structural and Investment Funds\u201d 13B16 13 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG GROW Chair/moderator: Alain Liberos , Policy Officer, European Commission, DG GROW Speakers: Herve Le Guyader , Chief Executive Officer of HLG Expertise; General Manager of Aquitaine Europe Communication on temporary leave-Aquitaine, France John Edwards , Project Officer (Smart Specialisation Platform) at the EC Joint Research Centre (JRC-IPTS), Seville, Spain Vincent Lepage , Director of Economic Policy Directorate, Member of the European Regions Research and Innovation Network-Wallonia, Belgium Asnate Ziemele , President of the Latvian Rural Tourism Association \u201cLauku Celotajs\u201d and Member of the European Network for Rural Development, Latvia Monica Veronesi Burch , Member of the Support Unit of the European Fisheries Areas Network, Belgium More information links: http://ec.europa.eu/growth/ sectors/tourism/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/growth/ sectors/fashion/index_en.htm http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa. eu/regions/FR61/tags/FR61 http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa. eu/home http://www.creativewallonia. be/projets/wallonia-european- creative-district/le-projet. htm?lng=en www.celotajs.lv/en https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/ fpfis/cms/farnet/ Livre OD2015.indb 59 08/01/2016 15:36 ",

The workshop focussed on mutual learning. Participants learned about implementing smart specialisation strategies through specific examples and good practices from regions participating in the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing. They received guidance on innovation for health investments and an overview of opportunities in the area of health and ageing offered by the 2014 - 2020 European Structural & Investment Funds. Small groups discussed their experiences and strategies and shared open questions with the audience. They received further guidance from speakers and other participants. Main messages and conclusions: Romana Smet\u00e1nkov\u00e1 provided an overview of investments in the EU during the 2014-2020 period. The main fields in terms of smart specialisation are: deinstitutionalisation and the development of community-based care, ICT solutions/eHealth and active, healthy ageing. Within the area of active, healthy ageing, major areas for investment in Operational Programmes include soft activities designed to help elderly people lead a healthy lifestyle (ESF) and eHealth investments in Telemedicine and mHealth technologies that allow for the provision of clinical health care services at a distance. These activities can also be supported as R&I investments, in accordance with national RIS3 strategies or medical R&D activities that aim to develop or improve existing methods. In many countries, transforming care services involves integrating health and social services. Activities are supported by both the ESF and ERDF (through investment in health and social infrastructure that contributes to the transition to community-based care). The first example was presented by Maria Aguirre Rueda, who outlined the implementation of the Basque Country\u2019s Smart Specialisation Strategy with a focus on integrated care. This strategy includes integrated management, coordination with social resources, as well as public health and citizen participation. The Basque Country adopts a stratified-population approach, which reflects a strategic shift from funding based on activities to value outcomes. The case showed how a smart specialisation can lead to new organisational models and pathways if combined with other opportunities and programmes such as the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, Research and Innovation Funding (FP7, Horizon 2020). In conclusion, Maria Aguirre illustrated that the value- based approach can be applied to various areas of active ageing beyond integrated care. The Northern Netherlands Healthy Ageing Network was introduced by Daan Bultje . It is an economic cluster that addresses social challenge of health and demographic change by adopting a \u201cpersonalised life course\u201d approach. Within the network, stakeholders work jointly to create improved care services that are pro-active and preventive. The regional network combines access to innovation, empowering people and a focus on applicability. The added value of these initiatives was appreciated by participants. They highlighted the substantial added value of networking across regions, in the area of health and ageing related smart specialisation. 13B17 13 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG SANTE / DG CONNECT Chair/moderator: Dr Andrea Pavlickova , European Service Development Manager, NHS24 / Scottish Centre for Telehealth and Telecare, Scotland Speakers: Romana Smet\u00e1nkov\u00e1 , PhD, Executive Director Advisory services, Ernst & Young, Czech Republic Maria Aguirre , PhD, MBA, MSc, Director of Healthcare Innovation and Research, Ministry for Health of the Basque Government, Spain Daan Bultje , Director, Healthy Ageing Network Northern Netherlands, The Netherlands More information links: www.esifforhealth.eu http://ec.europa.eu/research/ innovation-union/index_ en.cfm?section=active-healthy- ageing www.hannn.eu Livre OD2015.indb 60 08/01/2016 15:36 ",
        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 61 Outline This workshop presented the results of a comparative analysis (21 regions) carried out under the REGIONAL EU project on the formulation, implementation and funding of adult learning policies. Policymakers, practitioners and academics exchanged ideas on the links between adult learning and socio-economic development, from civic empowerment to economic competitiveness and SME development. Speakers presented the Policymaking Toolkit, a practical instrument designed to support local policymakers in shaping policies for effective adult learning in their local contexts. The toolkit combines country profiles, best practices and practical examples of effective policy measures. Main messages and conclusions: Adult learning is a key element of any socio-economic development strategy for territories and regions. Regions and local authorities are at the forefront of policy formulation and implementation for education and learning in Europe: they are the governance level closest to citizens and translate EU policies and strategies into action. The comparative analysis carried out under the REGIONAL project confirmed the findings of the European Commission\u2019s 2012 flagship report \u201cMind the Gap: Education Inequalities across EU Regions\u201d; the comparative analysis also highlighted general inconsistencies among various regions when developing adult learning policies. At the workshop, participants confirmed the unclear distinction between vocational education and training and adult learning, as well as the generalised bias towards the economic dimension of adult learning. The Q&A session was extremely useful and allowed participants and panellists to identify the key elements of policy-making in the domain of AL in: 1) stakeholder consultation: how to identify suitable stakeholders and at which point of the policy cycle to involve them in consultation; 2) policy planning: aligning policy response to socio-economic challenges of the region/territory; 3) aligning formulation to monitoring and evaluation: feeding lessons learned into the policy cycle. All of these elements were supported by the various tools included in the REGIONAL policy-making toolkit presented during the workshop.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 63 Outline The use of ICT and digital services for business development across different economic sectors is one of the priorities for regional growth. However, the ICT adoption rate by SMEs remains too slow. ICT Innovation Vouchers have enormous potential to boost business innovation and to increase competitiveness for microenterprises and SMEs, through investment in innovative digital business solutions. Providing SMEs with the opportunity to start using ICT enables them to apply digital innovation solutions and to absorb ICT knowledge, thus opening up new horizons to them. The workshop focused on presenting different experiences in setting up and implementing innovation vouchers. Participants had the opportunity to see the steps involved in implementing ICT innovation vouchers schemes for SMEs. Main messages and conclusions: Panel discussion: Antonio Romero presented his experience setting up a pilot scheme for ChequeTIC in the region of Murcia. The ICT innovation voucher is a powerful tool which needs to be carefully designed in accordance with regional needs. For the first time \u2013 for SMEs \u2013 using ICT innovation vouchers has become synonymous with changing behaviour and adopting innovation culture. Choosing the correct service provider is also important for SMEs. Providing a list of labelled service providers can help to identify and boost the services market both in the region and beyond. Service providers can be located in other regions. Yann Pennec presented the implementation of ICT innovation vouchers in the region of Aquitaine. He emphasised that the pilot scheme in Murcia had been a role model for him when he started setting up the scheme. They defined the two types of vouchers as: the \u201cch\u00e8queTIC\u201d and the ch\u00e8que \u201ctransfoNum\u00e9rique\u201d for digitalising SMEs. Based on an analysis of enterprises and providers in the region, they decided to leave the choice of ICT services up to the enterprises. The enterprises could then make the decision on the basis of their strategy and the areas in which they wish to innovate. Neoklis Stamkos gave a step-by-step overview of the implementation of a voucher programme, from the point of view of an intermediary management agency. He emphasised the advantage of carrying the process out entirely online, which provided an overview of ongoing projects, as well as creating transparency and facilitating the monitoring process. The online process also addressed the need to establish clear selection criteria and to ensure that the same information is given to all potential applicants in cases where processes are decentralised and involve several information points. Antonio Romero presented INNOVOUCHER, a project to develop a new model for innovation voucher programmes that support the transnational exchange of innovation services in Europe. The partners were interested in hearing about different experiences relating to innovation voucher schemes and invited participants to share their experience. Conclusions: Christine Simon highlighted the tips and recommendations given by the speakers on: the importance of good collaboration between different services during the development phase; the need to target the scheme effectively and define parameters that suit the region landscape if a real impact is to be made \u2013 more specifically, adjusting the size of the voucher effectively; keeping the programme speedy and easy for microenterprises and SMEs to use; strategic thinking in developing ICT innovation vouchers schemes as digital becomes pervasive Implementing ICT innovation vouchers to foster innovation and boost business development for SMEs 14B03 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG CONNECT Chair/moderator: Christine Simon , Policy Officer, Innovation, DG CONNECT, European Commission Speakers: Yann Pennec , Head of ERDF, ICT Unit in the Aquitaine Region ICT Delegation, France Antonio Romero Navarro , Head of Innovation Unit in the Regional Development Agency, Region of Murcia (INFO), Spain Neoklis Stamkos , Chief Financial Officer at the Business and Cultural Development Centre (KEPA), Greece More information links: bit.ly/ICTvouchers Livre OD2015.indb 63 08/01/2016 15:37 ",

Mr Heuwinkel presented the \u201cIntelligent Technical Systems Ostwestfalen Lippe\u201d cluster which interconnects different local actors. Mr Michel presented projects supporting start-ups such as NEST\u2019up. Ms Tutunaru talked about the competencies of local authorities. Mr V\u0161ete\u010dka explained regional support for start-ups and the regional smart specialisation strategy. Mr Usta talked about innovative urban transformation as a response to the increase in population and to ensure safe buildings in areas exposed to earthquakes. Mr Isiklar explained the initiatives for preserving agricultural areas and cooperation with universities. Main messages and conclusions: Several regions, districts and cities in and outside the European Union are striving to renovate abandoned areas caused either by the depopulation of rural zones or the abandonment of industrial zones (which in most cases are also polluted). The solution lies in the creation of competence centres or clusters to support new economic activities, create jobs and enhance innovation. Support for business development at regional and local level must be stepped up with input from local stakeholders, i.e. local authorities, the business community, universities and schools, in order to take into account the needs of local society and ensure that the projects produce the right results. Designing and implementing the projects is an on-going activity. To ensure the sustainability of a concrete project, support is needed from across political parties. Local authorities should work together on strategies taking into account local needs. Global issues such as immigration could shape local and regional strategies. Immigration could present an opportunity for local economies where the rate of unemployment is very low. Well-prepared strategies will help local authorities to face future challenges. Interconnection with innovation is also needed in traditional economic sectors such as agriculture. Cities that are exposed to natural disasters should adapt the structure of the city taking this into consideration. When undergoing urban transformation they should use the opportunity to apply innovative solutions, for instance, by using more environment-friendly materials. Cooperation between local partners is crucial for creating innovation opportunities for businesses. With the support of efficient local businesses, start-ups can become global. Cooperation between different EU and some non-EU local authorities on innovation can be supported by EU funding. Exchange of best practices is a good tool for supporting cooperation between local authorities from different countries. 14B05 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: Province of Liege Chair/moderator: Alena Mastantuono , Director of Czech Business Representation to the EU - CEBRE, Czech Republic Speakers: Katty Firquet , Vice-president, Province of Liege, Belgium Friedel Heuwinkel , President, District of Lippe, Germany Mathieu Michel , President, Walloon Brabant, Belgium Natalia Tutunaru , Executive Director, Union of County Councils of the Republic of Moldova, Moldova Daniel V\u0161ete\u010dka , Regional Innovation Strategy Manager, Centre for Investment, Development and Innovation (CIRI) Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Czech Republic Hasan Tahzin Usta , Mayor, Municipality Gaziosmanpasa, Turkey Ozcan Isiklar , Mayor, City of Silivri, Turkey Livre OD2015.indb 64 08/01/2016 15:37 ",

        "Workshops Regions open for business 66 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings How are local and regional authorities involved in the European Semester for economic governance? Outline During the workshop the main findings were presented of the CoR\u2019s 6th Monitoring Report on Europe 2020 and the European semester which provides an analytical background to the main issue on the agenda, namely the role of regions and cities in the European semester. As of 2015, the European Semester was streamlined to focus on key priorities and to involve stakeholders more closely in order to increase ownership. Despite mounting awareness of the need for EU policies to incorporate a territorial dimension, as shown in the main 2015 Semester documents, local and regional authorities are not yet fully involved. The workshop outlined the possible role of local and regional authorities in boosting growth and jobs while ensuring wider ownership of the strategy. Main messages and conclusions: Mr Delebarre stated that progress towards Europe 2020 targets is slow and uneven, especially regarding the employment poverty target. Low employment rates tend to be concentrated in the least economically developed regions. Social outlook can scarcely be improved without tackling regional disparities. Mr Ciaffi explained that the National Reform Programmes (NRPs) constitute a very complex process at both European and national level. Italy responded to the complexity of the NRP by enhancing internal complexity: regions that had clearly participated in the NRP have identified a technical structure responsible for the NRP. Mr B\u00f6hme concluded that regions would have to be closely involved in order to take ownership of Europe 2020. This implies cooperation and means involving regions in the decision-making process. It is necessary to include all relevant stakeholders beyond the public sector as civil society and NGOs play an important role in some Member States, particularly regarding the social dimension of Europe 2020. The European level should state more clearly the role of the regional level within the Europe semester. Mr Engels concluded that the streamlined European semester had led to better involvement of non- central governments but that there is a risk that the recommendations are felt as only relevant to the national context. In Belgium, the dialogue has definitely intensified. All relevant stakeholders regard the country report as a bigger opportunity than ever before to become involved in the process. However, regions do not feature prominently in the Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs). In the Belgian country report there are recommendations regarding the labour market inclusion of specific target groups which are differentiated according to region. However, the level of implementation of CSRs is still not satisfactory. Mr Hagelstam elaborated that public debate can increase peer pressure and peer support which, it is hoped, may in turn improve the efficiency of the European semester. Recently, cooperation with national parliaments has increased thanks to ad hoc inter-parliamentary meetings. The Econ report of October 2015 calls on Member States to involve national parliaments as well as local and regional authorities but also relevant national and European stakeholders such as representatives of civil society in the preparation and drafting of the NRPs. 14B07 14 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Committee of the Regions Chair/moderator: Michel Delebarre CoR Member, Member of Dunkirk Municipal Council, Political Coordinator of the Europe 2020 Monitoring Platform Speakers: Andrea Ciaffi , Conference of the Italian Regions Kai B\u00f6hme , Spatial Foresight Steven Engels, European Commission, European Semester Officer Kajus Hagelstam , European Parliament, Head of Unit, Economic Governance Support More information links: http://portal.cor.europa.eu/ europe2020/news/Pages/ opendays2015.aspx Livre OD2015.indb 66 08/01/2016 15:37 ",
        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 67 Outline The workshop presented the Investment Plan for Europe and explained how this could be implemented in order to maximize synergies and identify complementarities with the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). Following the opening remarks by the Chair, the presentations focused on the policy elements and legal framework of the Investment Plan, complementarities between ESIF and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), EFSI implementation and cooperation with national institutions as well as the case of Poland and its strategy and implementation mechanisms. Main messages and conclusions: The Investment Plan for Europe aims to revive investment activity in the EU and is focused on three major components: (i) A new implementation tool \u2013 The EFSI; (ii) An extended project pipeline \u2013 Strategic investments supported through enhanced technical assistance tools; (iii) A new regulatory environment \u2013 An enhanced set of rules better addressing the need to support jobs, innovation and growth across EU regions. In this context, the EFSI Regulation has been approved, the respective EIB-EC agreements are signed, the EFSI governance structure is finalised and a number of projects have already been approved by the EIB/EIF. The next steps in the implementation process primarily will concentrate on further project submissions to EIB/EIF for EFSI financing and establishing the EIAH and the EIPP (operational by early 2016). EFSI presents a great opportunity to enhance financing in the EU both for infrastructure and innovative projects but also for SMEs. It is an ambitious plan but has the potential to provide significant financial support and boost job creation. Its potential impact can only be truly maximised through cooperation with market players and the support and awareness of all stakeholders, including national promotional institutions and governments. Of course, ESIF and EFSI are stand-alone mechanisms with separate implementation frameworks but both allow for contributions to support each other\u2019s objectives (complementarity element). It is possible for them to be combined at project level, financial instrument level and through investment platforms but the implementation process has to respect all applicable rules (including legal frameworks, state aid rules etc.). Investments under EFSI should, among other things, be characterised as commercially sound, economically and technically viable, bring added value (additionality), boost employment and growth, be priced commensurately with the operation\u2019s risk profile and should typically have a higher risk profile than normal EIB operations. In conclusion, in order for the ESIF and EFSI to be successfully implemented they must act in a complementary manner, thus fostering synergies at all levels. ESIF resources can play a crucial role in optimising the impact of EFSI (and vice versa) as the joint use of EFSI and ESIF resources would allow for more sizeable interventions in projects and SME financing, which in turn would allow for the creation of more growth, jobs and innovation in Europe.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 68 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Open & Agile Smart Cities \u2013 Creating the European Smart City Market Outline The Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC) initiative aims to foster city-led open innovation by making urban systems interoperable in a manner that is effective, economical, non-exclusive and easy to adopt. This has the dual benefit of creating local jobs while also supporting demand-driven, flexible innovation. The workshop focused on policy-makers and smart city developers, and explained how OASC can help a city or region connect existing initiatives and become part of a global smart city market. The Open & Agile Smart Cities initiative, born global, driven by its national networks of cities\u2014through the OASC Task Force and Secretariat\u2014is related to the European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities and to DG CONNECT Net Futures at the European Commission. Main messages and conclusions: Since the Open & Agile Smart Cities announcement in January 2015, the OASC\u2019s 1st and 2nd waves rapidly welcomed 61 committed OASC cities from 12 countries, and more are due to sign in the 3rd wave. OASC is linking existing city networks and smart city initiatives in a very practical way. With its clear focus on adding value to current efforts, it is a natural part of the global smart city landscape. In light of the rapid growth of OASC, cities are supporting the development of a robust organisation in what has become known as an \u201cangel city investor\u201d approach. The organisational support comes from cities who decide to lead. The Finnish Six City Strategy, \u201c6Aika - Open & Smart Services\u201d, forms one of the original OASC networks. Based on the idea that \u201cone city is not a market\u201d, the six largest Finnish cities have joined forces nationally and globally in OASC, concentrating on open data and interfaces, open innovation platforms, and open participation. 6Aika has a budget of EUR 110 million for 2014-20, 50% funded by EU Integrated Sustainable Urban Development funding, 33% by the cities, and 17% at national level. Helsinki is also leading \u201cSELECT for Cities\u201d, a EU co-funded action on pre-commercial procurement, combining experimentation and procurement, together with OASC cities Antwerp and Copenhagen. In the Netherlands, at the time of the 2015 Open Days, 6 cities had joined OASC NL, with a 7th city in the pipeline. The Dutch OASC focus areas are: smart procurement, sharing Open Data Publishing portals, common APIs, collaborative fundraising, no vendor lock and access to the open source intelligence network. The anchor is located at the Amsterdam Start-Up Scene. In \u201cbuilding a multi-sided market\u201d, 4 key success factors can be seen such as: public interest, public engagement by citizens, business viability and market opportunities - to shift from a focus on cost reduction to a focus on innovation, how to work with commercial organisations to find better ways of structuring and delivering services. Data is the real asset that cities can provide to do this. For example, the discussion that followed touched on: the need for digital skills, ethics issues such as respect for privacy, the need for standards, how to get SME buy-in, who monetises data as this is typically not a city\u2019s job, how to get the right public service for everyone - not the same for all but mass customisation of services, smart cities as launchpads for digitalisation, and how to also reach smaller cities, which can be very flexible. 14B09 14 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG CONNECT Chair/moderator: M\u00e1rio Campolargo , Director, Net Futures, European Commission, DG CONNECT Speakers: Martin Brynskov , Chair, Open & Agile Smart Cities; Coordinator, Danish Smart City Network Jarmo Eskelinen , CEO, Forum Virium Helsinki, innovation company from the City of Helsinki Katalin Gallyas , Open Innovation Manager, City of Amsterdam, CTO Office Nuria de Lama , Research & Innovation ICT Program Manager, Atos More information links: http://connectedsmartcities.eu/ open-and-agile-smart-cities/ Livre OD2015.indb 68 08/01/2016 15:37 ",
        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 69 Outline How to turn Europe\u2019s demographic change into an opportunity is a key issue for policymakers, notably at local and regional level. In early March 2015, the European Commission organised a summit on innovation for active and healthy ageing to involve relevant stakeholders in setting up a new agenda for societal change and sustainable economic development. Building on the results of the summit, the debate focused on the key role played by local and regional authorities in the silver economy. These authorities are indeed on the front line and can support sustainable, innovative and inclusive solutions for active and healthy ageing, facilitate the development of local enterprises, create jobs and provide adequate products and services. Main messages and conclusions: Speakers mentioned that the silver economy is a key opportunity to reconcile changes in the way public services are provided and to regenerate some areas in Europe, for instance rural areas. Ilias Iakovidis (European Commission) presented his plans on how to support the silver economy and urged interested stakeholders to use the tools and support they offer in order to implement and scale up their initiatives. Both Ilias Iakovidis and Menno Hinkema (TNO) stressed the need to focus on impact, with sufficient good evidence of the benefits. Speakers also strongly emphasised the key role citizens are playing in the area of the silver economy. Joan Martin (Louth County, Ireland) presented the multi-stakeholder forum they have created to ensure dialogue between public authorities, the private sector, social protection agencies, care homes and older people. Elisa Tofoni (Miriade, Lower Normandy\u2019s Innovation Agency) pointed out the efforts companies need to make to adapt their offer and their communication strategy to older persons\u2019 expectations. She also presented the \u201cSilver Normandie Ecosystem\u201d they have created with SMEs, regional and local governments, chambers of commerce, national government, civil society organisations, to work on e-health, habitat, tourism, and mobility. Silver economy is not only about saving money and responding to demographic change but is also about improving living conditions and allowing older people to live at home, which is what they want, added Joan Martin . The example of the work developed by 3M to improve road safety, notably targeting older drivers, showed some of the concrete products the industry can deliver and demonstrated that these solutions are useful for all. David Sinclair (ILC-UK) explained that businesses are not targeting older consumers adequately and argued that inclusive design was very much needed to unlock the potential of the silver economy. The silver economy is a reality and is supported at the European level. Tools have been developed and are ready to be used by the local and regional levels. The missing ingredient at this stage is convincing local and regional governments that they can contribute to the take-off of the silver economy and that it could help relaunch the European economy.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 70 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Regions open for green business: environment legislation as the driving force Outline The workshop demonstrated how current EU environmental policy promotes green growth at regional and local level and looked at success stories from Bristol as the European Green Capital 2015, member regions and cities of the European Committee of the Regions and of the Environmental Conference of the Regions of Europe (ENCORE) which clearly show the contribution of European regions in fostering a greener economy that can be replicated in other regions. This workshop was the 6th meeting of the CoR/EC Technical Platform for Cooperation on the Environment, which seeks to contribute to improving the implementation of EU environmental law. Main messages and conclusions: Drawing on several local and regional best practices from across Europe, the workshop illustrated that proper implementation of EU environmental legislation provides significant potential for cities and regions to create new jobs in the circular economy and waste management, in water management, air quality, restoring and preserving biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation and the development of green infrastructure. It proved that investing in the green economy is more sustainable, with employment in green industries continuing to climb in Europe and in the cases presented throughout the recent times of recession. Attention was given to the need for better implementation of environmental acquis and policies, in view of the high environmental costs and economic costs of implementation gaps (>EUR 50 billion), the high number of infringements in this policy area, the lack of level playing-field for businesses due to inconsistent implementation, unnecessary administrative burdens creating barriers to investment, and the lack of credibility of the EU environmental acquis and policies. The European Commission\u2019s efforts in greening the European semester process were considered to be important. Yet so far they have only delivered moderate results by the Member States, with the EU\u2019s future circular economy package designed to provide additional support to this end. It was stressed that the new European Structural and Investment Funds, including their environmental conditionalities, and Horizon 2020, would provide substantial means that can be used by Member States and regions in their operational programmes to support local green businesses and jobs. The cases showed that green growth is unthinkable without the innovative power of regions and municipalities, particularly if they adopt strategic approaches to this as demonstrated in the case of the region of Catalonia and Bristol, European Green Capital 2015. Regional and local authorities play a pivotal role in facilitating the transition to a green economy. With their close proximity to entrepreneurs and other important stakeholders and their combined powers in legislation, planning, funding, education and training, regional and local authorities are in a position to adopt a cross-cutting approach which brings the efforts of EU environmental legislation and employment policies together in support of local green business clusters, innovation and job creation. 14B11 14 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: European Committee of the Regions, ENVE Commission, European Commission, DG Environment and Environmental Conference of the Regions of Europe (ENCORE) Chair/moderator: Satu Tietari , European Committee of the Regions rapporteur on Green action plans for SMEs and the Green Employment Initiative, Councillor of S\u00e4kyl\u00e4, Finland Moderator: Rolf Holub , Co-President of ENCORE, Minister for Environment, Water and Conservation of the Region of Carinthia, Austria Speakers: Francesco Pigliaru , Chair of the European Committee of the Regions Commission for Environment, Climate Change and Energy, President of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Italy Louis Meuleman , European Semester Coordinator, Unit for Enforcement, Cohesion Policy and European Semester - Cluster 2, DG Environment, European Commission Marta Subir\u00e0 , Director-General for Environmental Policies, Region of Catalonia, Spain Amy Robinson , Network Director Low Carbon South West, Bristol, UK Adam Struzik , Member of the European Committee of the Regions, President of Mazovia Region, Poland Marco Kwak , Project Development Manager at Attero waste processing company, Province of Drenthe, The Netherlands Teresa Dorfner , Unit for Resource Management, Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection of the Region of Bavaria, Germany Georges Kremlis , Head of Unit for Enforcement, Cohesion Policy and European Semester, Cluster 1, DG Environment, European Commission More information links: Technical Platform for Cooperation on the Environment (DG Environment and the European Committee of the Regions): http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ legal/platform_en.htm ENCORE: www.encore.bayern.de European Commission - Greening the European Semester: http://ec.europa.eu/ environment/integration/green_ semester/index_en.htm Livre OD2015.indb 70 08/01/2016 15:37 ",
        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 71 Smart Specialisation in Key Enabling Technologies (KETs): fostering cooperation between public and private actors Outline DG GROW \u2014 Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs organised an Open Days workshop bringing together European Commission services (GROW, COMP, REGIO, JRC) with innovative European regions committed to using the innovation potential of Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) for jobs and growth. The objective of the workshop was to present how regional authorities and stakeholders, including industry and SMEs, can successfully implement smart specialisation priorities in the field of KETs. It is worth highlighting that 60% of the European regions have identified key enabling technologies (KETs) as an investment priority for the next six years and that KETs are the second highest policy priority for R&I chosen by regions. Main messages and conclusions: DG GROW highlighted the importance of ensuring that these priorities are translated into concrete investments in close-to-market industrial activities. In this respect, the involvement of the business community will be crucial. DG GROW\u2019s KETs observatory clearly showed that although we hold the strongest position in Advanced Manufacturing Technology, Europe has lost ground in the other five KETs \u2013 mainly to East Asia. DG COMP voiced a clear message that KETs projects and pilot lines benefit from increased public support under the revised State Aid Rules (notably GBER and RDI) and underlined the importance of IPCEI for the implementation of the KETs strategy. It was also highlighted that state aid is now possible for first production under the IPCEI instrument and the Regional Aid Guidelines. Several regional stakeholders presented good examples of how cooperation between companies, research centres and regions can ensure the successful implementation of their smart specialisation strategies. - The Silesian Investors and Exporters Service Centre presented the Silesian smart specialisation strategy highlighting the importance of KETs in their development programme (nanotechnologies and nanomaterials, materials production and processing, machinery, etc.). An important element was the establishment of a network of Regional Specialised Observatories which monitors the deployment of KETs in the region and promotes its know-how at European level. - The Warwick Manufacturing Group of the University of Warwick provided a good model of how universities and businesses can work together successfully to improve their overall innovative capacity. - The Catalonian technology centre LEITAT presented concrete examples of how interregional cooperation has the potential to re-industrialise Europe, notably through Catalonia\u2019s participation in the Vanguard Initiative\u2019s 3D printing pilot. - In the French region of Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, KETs are helping to boost interregional cooperation as they are a strategic factor in innovation across an infinite range of products and processes. Toulouse White Biotechnology, a technology infrastructure facilitating joint projects between academic researchers and industrial partners, was presented as an example of best practice that could be replicated within a pan-European network of biotechnology infrastructures. 14B12 14 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission DG GROW Chair/moderator: Luigi Vitiello , Deputy Head of Unit F.3 KETs, Digital Manufacturing and Interoperability, European Commission, DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs Speakers: Paul Milne , SME Team leader and Knowledge Transfer Specialist - Warwick Manufacturing Group, University of Warwick, UK Vincent Jamier , International Projects Officer for Advanced Material and Process, Nanotechnology - LEITAT, Catalonia, Spain Jolanta Gacka , Silesian Investors and Exporters Service Centre - Department of Economy, Marshal Office of the Silesian Voivodeship, Poland Jean Tkaczuk , Chairman of the Research and Higher Education Committee of the Region Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, France Michael J.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 72 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs (EYE) is a simple but powerful concept which aims at stimulating innovative business practices, the creation of new companies, the development of new products and services and expansion into new markets. EYE is implemented at a regional level by 175 intermediary organisations - business support organisations - that act as local contact points for the programme across Europe and other participating countries. The session provided insights into how the programme functions and showcased its impact on business creation and growth through inspiring testimonials from alumni entrepreneurs and local contact points. The discussion was followed by a Q&A session. Main messages and conclusions: 125 participants had registered for this session representing 20 countries, gathering associations from a local, regional and European level as well as academics and stakeholders from private companies. The Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme was described in detail with supporting statistics and an explanation was given as to why entrepreneurship is important for the regions and for the creation of growth and jobs in Europe as a whole. The programme is facilitated by 175 intermediary organisations in 32 countries. To date, 6800 entrepreneurs have taken part in the programme generating an international entrepreneurial exchange. The session also highlighted the Eurochambres involvement in the programme as Support Office, its mission and the impact it has on businesses. Two entrepreneurs gave a testimonial regarding their own participation in the programme, their experience of the process, the results of the exchange and the positive impact the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs has had on their business.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 73 Ready for take-off? The smart participation of SMEs in regional innovation systems. Outline The EU budget provides a wide range of support for SMEs. It contains two new initiatives: the Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE) \u2013 which is part of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions \u2013 and the SME Instrument set out under the Horizon 2020 EU programme. Regional and national authorities are encouraged to support SMEs to become more innovative and international by incorporating research-orientated schemes and methods, as well as cross-border cooperation into their competiveness policies. A representative from the Swedish innovation agency, VINNOVA, explained how they complement and get the most out of EU SME support measures. The GreenBUBBLES project showcased how an international network of local authorities, researchers and SMEs can positively affect the socio-economic conditions in coastal areas. Main messages and conclusions: RISE and the SME instrument were found to have both similarities and differences. Both fund innovative pathways and ideas developed by SMEs, but at different stages of the innovation process. The RISE projects are expected to establish and expand research networks by facilitating the mobility of researchers to and from SMEs. RISE serves as a bridge between the academic and non-academic world by supporting research which directly responds to company needs. RISE also allows for international and inter- sectoral cooperation. The main selection criterion is research excellence. GreenBUBBLES has applied this concept to the area of scuba diving and related activities. It involves a broad range of partners such as scientific divers, insurance risk evaluators, equipment providers, tour operators, coastal managers, software developers and more. The project links society, environment and economy by promoting an approach to scuba diving which is sustainable, both from an ecological and economic perspective. The project provides a framework and incentives for cooperation between diverse partners. Benefits include access to research results, the sharing of experience and improving turnover by offering new products and services. The SME instrument aims to bring research results to the market and to bridge the \u201cdead valley\u201d between the initial innovative idea, product development and commercialisation. To be eligible for funding the SME should show that its innovative idea has a \u201ctechnological readiness level\u201d (TRL) of six or above. Unlike RISE, selection under the SME instrument requires a solid business case and prior identification of markets. The Swedish agency VINNOVA has adopted the SME instrument\u2019s approach. They provide coaching and national funding to Swedish SMEs which have obtained an EC evaluation score of 13/15 for their proposal. SMEs benefit from this \u201cRunner Up\u201d grant as it provides resources that enable them to prepare important business decisions properly. Authorities also appreciate it for its great leverage benefit to both Sweden and the EU. Similar support schemes have been set up in Italy (Lombardy region) and Spain, and more are under development. 14B14 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG Education and Culture Chair/moderator: Marek Przeor , Team leader, Competence Centre Smart and Sustainable Growth, European Commission, DG REGIO Speakers: Cerrano Carlo , Researcher and Project coordinator GreenBubblesm, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche (UNIVPM), Department of Life and Environmental Science (Di SVA), Italy Mario Roccaro , Policy Officer RISE, European Commission DG Education and Culture Karin Aase , National Contact Point for Horizon 2020, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Access to Risk Finance at VINNOVA Innovation Agency, Sweden Bertrand Wert , Project Advisor Horizon 2020 SME Instrument, Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME) More information links: www.greenbubbles.eu/ www.vinnova.se/en/ \u201cRunner Up\u201d http://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/ horizons-2020-sme-instrument http://ec.europa.eu/research/ mariecurieactions/about-msca/ actions/rise/index_en.htm \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to EU Funding\u201d on https://ec.europa.eu/budget/ funding/index_en Livre OD2015.indb 73 08/01/2016 15:37 ",
        "Workshops Regions open for business 74 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline New cohesion policy programmes envisage support for green growth \u2013 a transition to a green, low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. Moving towards green growth may be challenging for SMEs, due to their resource constraints. Nevertheless, many lessons have been learned within the cohesion policy. The workshop began with an overview of key drivers for SMEs moving towards a low-carbon and resource- efficient Europe. It was followed by good practices and reflections of the European Bio-plastics Association and the Ecoplus - The Business Agency of Lower Austria. The presentations were closed by the civil society speaker representing Bankwatch. They set the scene for a discussion on How to further strengthen cohesion policy support for SMEs in their quest towards green growth? Main messages and conclusions: SME competitiveness, low-carbon economy and resource efficiency are among the top priorities for the 2014- 2020 EU cohesion policy. The shift towards a low-carbon economy and a circular economy will offer significant opportunities for SMEs in terms of savings, competitiveness, jobs and innovative business models. MS have allocated significant funding to these topics within the 2014-2020 cohesion policy: - EUR 40 billion for the low-carbon economy (e.g. energy efficiency, renewable energy, multimodal urban transport); - EUR 35 billion for environmental protection and resource efficiency; - EUR 41 billion for research and innovation and EUR 33 billion for the competitiveness of SMEs, which will go into many areas including the low-carbon economy and resource efficiency. However, cohesion policy support goes beyond funding. It is a policy framework focused on integrated regional development. It ensures that the funds are well spent and achieve results by attaching preconditions to the funding. It also offers technical assistance and administrative capacity-building to help Member States and regions. In this way, cohesion policy will significantly contribute to the Energy Union and the circular economy on the ground. However, to support the move towards a low-carbon and circular economy, there is a need for a paradigm shift, including, among other things, a major scale-up of efforts (e.g. exploration of growth potential in the bioplastics sector featured at the workshop) and a change in mind-set among the public. We also have to be more ambitious and work in multi-sectoral ways to make it happen.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 75 Connecting digital innovation hubs in manufacturing across European regions Outline Advances in ICT are essential to support and reinforce the competitiveness of European industrial sectors. However, there are still disparities in how new ICT is adopted across companies in the different European regions and across manufacturing sectors. Member States and regions have recently launched regional/national initiatives to create digital innovation hubs with the aim of transferring innovative ICT, including knowledge and skills to SMEs and mid-caps. The workshop examined how those initiatives have been deployed in MSs/regions, e.g. UK, Portugal, the Netherlands and across regions through the Vanguard initiative, in terms of reaching out to manufacturing companies, pooling resources across programmes to ensure sustainability, etc. Main messages and conclusions: The EU\u2019s I4MS initiative and other similar initiatives aim at promoting jobs and growth in Europe by encouraging European manufacturing SMEs and mid-caps in all business sectors to adopt advanced ICT. These initiatives focus on technologies such as HPC cloud-based modelling and simulation services, robotics, laser-based solutions, CPS/IoT, considered as having the greatest potential for increasing the competitiveness of European manufacturing, but also on other application areas such as footwear, machine tooling, automotive, energy, etc. The role of the European Commission is to act as facilitator/connector of the different initiatives/actors in Member States and regions. This may be done through Coordination and Support Action (CSA) which can help create and maintain a network of relevant actors such as RTOs, innovation agencies, regional authorities, chambers of commerce, etc. The regional innovation hubs have a central role. They can be focused on one technology (HPC, robotics, laser solutions, etc.) or several technologies, e.g. Fraunhofer, CNR, etc. It is important that innovation hubs have/ develop demonstrators/pilots lines/pilot installations and provide wide access to them. They should look at different business models such as micro production lines, incubator services, connection to investors, developing the ecosystem, etc. in order to be commercially viable. In order to scale up pilot activities, there should be an alignment across innovation policies at EU, national and regional level in order to allow for the combination of available sources of funding including private investment. The European Commission can strengthen awareness of the existence of different policies (there is a need for an inventory of the actors and initiatives (from regional, national and EU level) relevant to I4MS and the related technologies) and provide an EU forum to facilitate their alignment. The main aim of engaging with SMEs and mid-caps can be achieved by focusing on the dissemination of best practices in the region and in other regions and not only on leading-edge innovation activities. The innovation hubs should include other actors who can act as mediators between technology suppliers and users. The open call for mentors and sponsorship for new innovation hubs to connect to I4MS Competence Centres Network is a step forward towards growing and reinforcing the existing network and providing access to advanced ICT to a wider number of manufacturing companies in Europe. 14B17 14 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG CONNECT Chair/moderator: Max Lemke , Head of Unit for Complex Systems and Advanced Computing (A3), Directorate General for Communication Networks, Content and Technology, European Commission and Cecile Huet, Deputy Head of Unit for Robotics (A2), Directorate-General for Communication Networks, Content and Technology, European Commission Speakers: Geoff Pegman , Managing Director, RU Robots Ltd, UK Wim De Kinderen , Project Manager, Brainport Development, The Netherlands Vera Pinto , Research Manager, Centro Tecnologico do Cal\u00e7ado (CTCP), Portugal Maurits Butter , Innovation Policy Officer, Nederlandse Organisatie voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek (TNO), The Netherlands Livre OD2015.indb 75 08/01/2016 15:37 ",
        "Workshops Regions open for business 76 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline The workshop addressed the importance of strengthening lasting cooperation between SMEs and larger enterprises in order to stimulate innovation. We zoomed in on the province of South Holland and in particular, the maritime region of Drechtsteden. A number of global players in the maritime sector currently operate from the Drechtsteden region including companies such as Boskalis, ICH, Heerema and Damen. These are anchored deeply in the region, with a strong, regionally organised cluster of suppliers and innovative SMEs. A powerful sector with a global market. A strong and innovative cooperation with regional and international partners seems to be the key to ensuring that our \u201cleader firms\u201d in this powerful maritime region will be world leaders twenty years from now. Main messages and conclusions: Why innovate? To face major changes in our economy. Major social issues have presented themselves. Technological changes such as \u201cthe internet of things\u201d, big data, robotisation and 3D printing will cause major changes in our economy and our society. \u201cGame changers\u201d such as AirBnB, Uber and Tesla will transform our economy and will change our view of the future. This is precisely why it is important to work continuously on innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity. How to innovate? Strong cooperation a precondition for innovation and growth The Drechtsteden region and even the Netherlands itself are too small to achieve all its ambitions within its borders. Innovation can also be launched together with European parties with a strong complementary character and quality. Stimulating collaboration and the proximity of SMEs and larger companies are important preconditions for innovation and economic growth. During the workshop we shared our knowledge, provided information on how we in a triple helix collaborate and why lasting cooperation is important in this regard - Collaboration between large companies and innovative SMEs at a cross-sector level and between companies, universities and government, in which each partner has a particular role and adds its own value in creating new solutions and new business models. The government of Drechtsteden is putting efforts into galvanising this strength and offering support by creating new and sustainable connections and guiding SMEs in their search for new funding. The government works closely together with companies, knowledge institutes, other governments and InnovationQuarter, the regional development company that was founded in order to accelerate the process of unlocking the region\u2019s innovative potential. The region has major innovation potential thanks to its three leading universities and many innovative companies working in R&D. However, compared to other European regions the Drechtsteden region is low-ranked when it comes to economic competitiveness. Therefore, the regional development company promotes highly innovative SMEs and supports them by not only providing risk-bearing capital but also by supporting their business development.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 77 How can regional Smart Specialisation Strategies support innovation ecosystems and value chains? Outline This high level debate will explore how the different actors from regions, industry and RTOs can work together to boost regional innovation. With industry, RTOs are key stakeholders supporting regions\u2019 innovation ecosystems. As such, RTOs, together with industry, should further support the development and implementation of RIS3 strategies by the regions and should support regions in identifying where and how to achieve synergies between H2020 and ESIF. The debate will aim to promote dialogue between the main actors involved in this process. A networking session will take place afterwards. Target audience: - EU, national, regional and local policy/decision-makers - Authorities managing and evaluating cohesion policy programmes and projects - Other stakeholders: private companies, financial institutions, Europe Main messages and conclusions: - A functioning Digital Single Market and smart specialisation could lead to new skills and knowledge, innovation and employment - Among CoR priorities 2015-2020: boost R&I capacity in regions, bridge the digital and innovation divide between them, create the right conditions for digital networks, stimulating interregional networks - Smart specialisation is a good framework for strategic thinking at regional level \u2013 especially if combined with a good entrepreneurial discovery process and an international perspective - Synergies of funds are important but depend on regional context and rules for participation - Regions should build a strong triple/quadruple helix structure in regions with well-developed governance structures (with regional buy-in) and monitoring of S3 implementation - RTOs are key to: - linking academia and industry - contributing to regions\u2019 entrepreneurial discovery process - connecting innovation actors both internally and to innovation value-chains and ecosystems - building capacities at regional level - contributing to technology transfer within value-chains - supporting regions in both policy-making and the implementation of regional programmes and supporting industries within regional clusters and value-chains - Regions should: - explore RTOs\u2019 expertise in creating and supporting competitive clusters (also using inter-regional collaboration) - consider how to best support RTO involvement through different funding models - I4MS initiative for the development of digital innovation hubs, in the framework of the Digitising European Industry strategy - Combining project funding from ESIF and H2020 should not be mandatory as it risks undermining all simplification measures adopted in H2020 and distorts the level playing field within the EU due to the uneven availability and complexity of ESIF.

Two network partners also gave good examples of where the activities and services provided by the network were well coordinated with regional SME and innovation policy. Finally, participants were asked to form small groups to discuss potential ways of better cooperation in regions. This led to a lively discussion. At the end of the session the groups shared their ideas and findings. Main messages and conclusions: Business and innovation support is very often provided at regional level in Europe. The Enterprise Europe Network, as the world\u2019s largest SME support structure, is well placed to complement and support existing regional SME development and innovation strategies, adding a European dimension.

        "Workshops Regions open for business 80 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Innovation and SMEs are at the centre of both the Atlantic Area 2020 Interreg Programme and the Atlantic Action Plan for a Maritime Strategy, aimed at contributing to the EU Innovation economic model. The workshop looked at how the two instruments combine and provided practical information to potential regional beneficiaries. Regional innovation actors (CINEW and ATLANTICBLUETECH projects) showcased their best practices for cooperation in the Atlantic and for the effective involvement of regional stakeholders and SMEs. Main messages and conclusions: The 2014-2014 period features a thematic focus on more efficiency to reach the key Europe 2020 objectives - Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth. A strong focus on measurable results applies across programmes. Both the Atlantic Strategy and the Atlantic Area Programme are relevant tools, promoting innovation and SMEs among their priorities. Though varied, they are coherent, the Strategy being the reference framework for all programmes in the Atlantic area. The EU Atlantic Strategy launched its action plan in 2013 with the aim of promoting growth, particularly blue growth, employment and sustainable development. It has 4 priorities dedicated to 1) promoting entrepreneurship and innovation, 2) protecting, securing and enhancing the marine and coastal environment, 3) improving accessibility and connectivity and 4) creating a sustainable and open regional development model. The strategy also encourages cooperation and contributes to Europe 2020. It is being implemented through the existing EU, regional and national programmes. Innovation is a priority of the AA Programme: Stimulating innovation and competitiveness: SO 1.1 Enhancing innovation capacity through cooperation to foster competitiveness, SO1.2 Strengthening the transfer of innovation results to facilitate the emergence of new products, services and processes. Priority 2: Fostering resource efficiency: SO2.1 Fostering renewable energies and energy efficiency SO2.2: Fostering green growth, eco-innovation and environmental efficiency. Priority 3: Strengthening the territory\u2019s resilience to risks of natural, climate-related and human origin: SO3.1: Strengthening risk management systems. Priority 4: Enhancing biodiversity and natural and cultural assets: SO4.1 Improving the protection of biodiversity and enhancing ecosystems\u2019 services, SO4.2: Enhancing natural and cultural assets to stimulate economic development. AtlanticBlueTech and CINEW showed the involvement of SMEs in the innovation process of breaking down barriers between economic actors, including at a local level, and generating exchanges with economic and research partners across the Atlantic and locally, where these would otherwise have remained isolated. Both projects have contributed to new products and new jobs in the two distinct fields of biomarine resources and creative small cities. The 2014-2020 programme will expand these opportunities for SMEs and innovation and the relevant regional actors are therefore encouraged to participate.

        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 81 The Adriatic-Ionian Macroregion for Jobs and Growth Outline The conference \u201cThe Adriatic-Ionian Macroregion for Jobs and Growth\u201d, hosted by the Emilia-Romagna EU Office in Brussels, focused on the European Union Strategy for the Adriatic-Ionian Region (EUSAIR) and the need to implement measures that will boost the economy and attract a major flow of investments, in order to increase the competitiveness of the countries in the area. One of the main reasons behind that is also the geopolitical relevance of the Western Balkans. In this context, the synergy between local, regional, and national authorities is extremely important in turning EUSAIR into a concrete strategy for the Adriatic-Ionian Region, in order that its outcomes prove beneficial for the people involved. Main messages and conclusions: High Representative, Federica Mogherini , underlined that in order to gain momentum, the strategy will have to develop along two main guidelines: the Adriatic-Ionian Region will have to improve its connection to the two other European macro-regions, namely the Baltic Sea Region and the Danube Region, and at the same time the projects should be implemented effectively. In this regard, the Italian Secretary of State, Sandro Gozi , stated that regions are to be considered key actors, since they will play a major role both in implementing the projects effectively and in promoting new forms of cooperation. In addition, compared to the national level, regional authorities have a closer relationship with their citizens and could therefore work to highlight the shared features and the existing links among the populations on both sides of the Adriatic- Ionian Sea, in order to prepare the ground for a future enlargement to the Western Balkans countries. Ambassador Stefano Sannino added that the idea of enlarging the European Union\u2019s borders towards the Balkans is gradually becoming more than just a vague long-term project. During the political session \u201cBoosting jobs and growth in the Adriatic-Ionian area through EUSAIR implementation\u201d the presidents from the partner regions were asked which long term prospects they envisaged for the strategy, which actions they considered urgent and how they thought the governance system could be improved so as to better involve all the various levels of government. The presidents identified two main priorities: in the short term, it will be crucial to strengthen intra-regional connections by developing a strong infrastructure system that will have to reach both the costal and the internal areas. In the long term, the primary objective will be to develop a strong sense of common identity, built around the Adriatic-Ionian Sea, which is shared by all of the partner regions. The presidents also agreed on the idea that the governance system could be improved by drawing on the Danube and the Baltic Sea region models, which grant the regions a primary role, while developing a strong cooperation with authorities at local, national and European level. The technical session \u201cRegional insights and experiences from the field: projects and proposals\u201d was devoted to practical actions and concrete contributions. 15B06 15 October 2015 09:00-13:00 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: Emilia-Romagna Region Chair/moderator: Andrea Mairate , Head of Unit for Macro-regions and European Territorial Co-operation - Transnational and Interregional Co-operation, DG REGIO, European Commission Lorenza Badiello, Head of the EU Office, Emilia-Romagna Region Speakers: Federica Mogherini , High Representative European Commission Ivan Jakov\u010di\u0107 , Member of the European Parliament Sandro Gozi , State Secretary, Italian Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Italy Stefano Sannino , Italian Permanent Representative Jan Mikolaj Dzieciolowski , Member of the Cabinet of the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Corina Cre\u0163u Stefano Bonaccini , President of the Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy Luca Ceriscioli , President of the Marche Region, Italy Nikola Dobroslavic , President of the Dubrovnik- Neretva Region, Croatia Debora Serracchiani , President of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Autonomous Region, Italy George Alexakis , Responsible for Maritime Issues and Regional Councillor of Crete in charge of European and International Affairs, Greece Luciano D\u2019Alfonso , President of the Abruzzo Region, Italy Michele Emiliano , President of the Puglia Region, Italy Aleksandar Stjepcevic , Mayor of the municipality of Kotor, Montenegro Janja Kreitmayer McKenzie , Ministry for the Environment and Spatial Planning, Slovenia Mico Stanojevic , Director of SME Development Agency of the Republic of Srpska, Bosnia Herzegovina Ivan Petkovic , Sector Manager for Infrastructure and Sustainable Development at Regional Development Agency South, Serbia Lucia Di Fatta , Manger Tourism Department, Sicily Region, Italy More information links: www.regione.emilia-romagna.it/ sede-di-bruxelles Livre OD2015.indb 81 08/01/2016 15:38 ",

In line with the third pillar of the European Commission\u2019s Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan and the priorities of the Small Business Act, several EER regions are developing and implementing measures to reach out to specific groups whose entrepreneurial potential has not yet been fully tapped, including women, migrants and the unemployed. The workshop showcases some of the EER regions\u2019 most successful practices in this area. It established a dialogue between political decision-makers and stakeholders and explored how EU regions and cities can move further ahead in promoting inclusive entrepreneurship. Main messages and conclusions: In his opening statement, Karsten Uno Petersen underlined the important role played by regions and cities in supporting entrepreneurs. He linked the theme of the workshop to the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan of the European Commission. Speakers representing the 2015 EER winners presented good practices implemented in their regions. Maria Jos\u00e9 Ortol\u00e1 introduced some of the initiatives implemented by the Region of Valencia to boost female entrepreneurship, such as grants to encourage self-employment and a network of information centres covering the entire region. Cristina Silva then gave some insights into Lisbon\u2019s DELI project, which supports inclusive policies targeted towards companies owned by migrants. As a result of this project, the municipality is looking at migrants from an economic angle for the first time. Ethna McNamee outlined Northern Ireland\u2019s actions promoting social entrepreneurship in areas of multiple deprivation within the framework of the Delivering Social Change initiative, which pursues the double objective of growing the economy and tackling disadvantage. She illustrated how the results of this initiative constitute a useful model for social and economic development and for the incubation of social innovation ideas. Moving from the EER regions\u2019 experience to a stakeholder perspective, Rosanna Kurrer explained how the Digital Leadership Institute aims to bridge the gender gap in entrepreneurship and innovation. Adem Kumcu pointed out that, as natural risk-takers, many migrants already have an entrepreneurial mind-set. He emphasised that long-term initiatives are needed in order to better integrate them into existing networks and support structures. Alain Coheur highlighted some of the success stories linked to the social economy. In the floor discussion, Michael Ralph from the European Commission\u2019s DG REGIO raised the question of the use of structural funds to support inclusive entrepreneurship. Katarzyna Ba\u0142ucka-D\u0119bska, DG GROW, underlined that the EER initiative constitutes a mine of good practices implemented on the ground and suggested that the Commission should help to interlink the EER region and spread their experience even further. Heike Fischbach, DG EAC, brought up the role of educational institutions. In closing the workshop, the chair encouraged participants to apply for the EER 2017 award, which will be opened at the SME assembly on 18 November. 15B08 15 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Committee of the Regions Chair/moderator: Karsten Uno Petersen , CoR Member, Member of the Regional Council of South Denmark (EER 2013), Denmark Speakers: Maria Jos\u00e9 Ortol\u00e1 , Deputy Director for Entrepreneurship and the Social Economy, Region of Valencia (EER 2015), Spain Cristina Silva , Coordinator of the DELI project, Municipal Council of Lisbon (EER 2015), Portugal Ethna McNamee , Project Manager Social Enterprise Hubs, Invest Northern Ireland (EER 2015), UK Rosanna Kurrer , Co-Founder and Member of the Board of Directors, Digital Leadership Institute, Belgium Adem Kumcu , President of the New European Business Confederation UNITEE, Belgium Alain Coheur , President, Social Economy Europe, Belgium More information links: cor.europa.eu/eer Livre OD2015.indb 82 08/01/2016 15:38 ",
        "Workshops Regions open for business OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 83 Outline The workshop was dedicated to illustrating the opportunities that Interreg Europe presents for managing authorities and intermediate bodies of the Investment for Growth and Jobs programmes. Interreg Europe\u2019s main aim is to improve the performance of the programmes through the exchange and transfer of policy experiences among European regions. Interreg Europe representatives explained the context and main features of the programme. Representatives of the Marche and Malopolska regions reflected on the benefits of interregional cooperation in the implementation of their Investment for Growth and Jobs programmes. Both actions of Interreg Europe are aimed at improving the performance of growth and jobs, the interregional cooperation projects and the policy learning platforms. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop brought together about 70 participants representing managing authorities of structural fund programmes, local and regional public authorities and other organisations involved in the management and implementation of structural funds and other regional development policies. The discussion developed around two main points: Firstly, the features of Interreg Europe and the rationale behind its new characteristics compared to past interregional cooperation programmes. Its focus on structural funds and the need to target managing authorities and intermediate bodies of Growth and Jobs programmes were highlighted. Information was also provided on the first call for proposals that closed last July 2015. Secondly, the experience \u201cfrom the ground\u201d provided by the speakers from the Marche and Malopolska regions made a very valid contribution to a better understanding of the benefits that Interreg Europe can provide to European regions. Interreg Europe\u2019s mission is centred on the exchange of experience with a view to enhancing capacity building and policy learning for the policy makers involved in defining and implementing regional development strategies. Both Marche and Malopolska have benefitted from the previous Interreg IVC programme through their participation in projects. Thanks to the lessons learnt and the good practices of other partners regions in Europe, they have managed to better define the priorities of their 2014-2020 operational programmes. Malopolska has drafted its Smart Specialisation Strategy taking inspiration from other S3 partners involved in Interreg IVC (SMART+). Its energy policy has also been positively affected by the work carried out in interregional projects (CLUE). Marche has worked on its ESF programme to improve its policies on social inclusion thanks to the lessons learnt in the PASE project. Interreg Europe will continue this work with an even greater focus on results, building on the success of the experiences of the regions that have benefitted from interregional cooperation in the past. Managing authorities are welcome to join the Interreg Europe community as it strives for excellence in managing structural fund programmes.

        "Places and spaces Workshops Workshops Regions open for business 84 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Creating a market place for smart cities and communities in Europe: achievements and lessons learnt through the EIP Smart Cities Outline The European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Smart Cities and Communities is Europe\u2019s key initiative for fostering the uptake of innovative smart city solutions. More than 3 000 public and private partners are engaged in action to establish a common market place. The partnership is now in its 2 nd year of implementation. In an interactive discussion, speakers and the assembly discussed achievements, opportunities and next steps for action, addressing questions such as: - how can cities, regions and companies benefit from the EIP\u2019s market place?; - what are priority initiatives and how can cities and companies set up joint activities \u2013 what support is needed?; how to best plan and roll out city-needs driven projects and achieve scale. Looking at leading commitments to collaborative action in key areas such as energy, transport, lighting or platforms, speakers shared insights and discussed, with practical examples, how collaboration at European level could help achieve implementation at scale. The session also looked at business models and opportunities for accessing funding and technical assistance at European level. Key points of presentations and discussions. Main messages/conclusions A key outcome of the discussion was the prime importance of leadership and finding the right governance and business models to create projects which address cities\u2019 and citizens\u2019 needs. Legislative legacies and lack of political willingness to change them are often key barriers. The importance of practical integration and of digitalisation of services and infrastructures is growing in cities. There is a need to better consider integrated solutions and their benefits \u2013 e.g. energy efficiency and smart buildings projects can increase acceptability by working together with firms that employ local unemployed people. Participants discussed the relevance of a European market place for smart cities as promoted by the European Innovation Partnership (EIP), to overcome market fragmentation and allow faster implementation of successful solutions. Implementation, funding mapping and creating appropriate, targeted, innovation platforms are important. Finding the right financing arrangements for innovative projects is a key challenge, but funding is not the greatest hurdle. Other important issues are establishing framework conditions, appropriate involvement of citizens, exchange of best practices, city cooperation. 15B10 15 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG MOVE Chair/moderator: Torsten Klimke , Deputy Head of Unit, DG MOVE, European Commission Kyriakos Baxevanidis , Deputy Head of Unit, DG CONNECT, European Commission Speakers: Milan Obradovic , Deputy Mayor, City of Malmo, Sweden Michael Olszewski , Deputy Mayor, City of Warsaw, Poland Eckhart Hertzsch , EIP strategic content coordinator, Germany Francesco Gargani , Associate Partner, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Italy Koen Schroeder , Partner Manager, Allego, The Netherlands More information links: https://eu-smartcities.eu/ Livre OD2015.indb 84 08/01/2016 15:38 ",

        "Workshops Places and spaces 86 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Over the past couple of years, the European Committee of the Regions has been actively promoting territorial impact assessment as an important tool in the EU policy-making process. At the same time, the CoR has been testing different approaches and methodologies to determine which would be the best and most efficient way to assess the impact of EU policies on cities and regions. The CoR recommends that Territorial Impact Assessments become standard practice in the EU policy-making process, as 70% of EU legislation is implemented at local and regional level. Early assessment of territorial impact can ensure that the local and regional levels are involved, that spatial development is practicable, relevant and territorially linked, and that funds are deployed effectively. Main messages and conclusions: Michael Schneider , rapporteur for the CoR opinion on \u201cAssessing Territorial Impact\u201d presented the work of the CoR over the last two years. Since the adoption of the TIA Strategy in 2014, the CoR has carried out five territorial impact assessments (TIA) in the ex-ante and ex-post phases. When selecting the initiatives for a TIA, the CoR looks into those initiatives that present a clear political interest for local and regional authorities, touch on their competences and have a potential territorial impact. Moreover, TIA in the CoR gives rapporteurs access to specific analysis and information, assisting them in the opinion-making process. The CoR has been an active advocate of territorial impact assessments as an integral part of the impact assessment procedure at the European Commission (EC). Thanks to the efforts of the CoR, the TIA has been listed as one of the tools in the Impact Assessment Guidelines of the EC and the territorial dimension is mentioned throughout the new Better Regulation Package published by the EC in May 2015. Mona Bjorklund presented the Better Regulation Package and developments with the Impact Assessments as of publication of the package. The Impact Assessment is a set of logical steps to help Commission departments prepare a proposal. It looks into all initiatives with a significant impact, from policy-defining proposals to implementing measures. The novelty in the package is the independent, centralised Regulatory Scrutiny Board replacing the Impact Assessment Board, which will feature two independent representatives. Martijn de Bruijn from DG REGIO presented a pilot project of peer-group cities on Urban Impact Assessment, which is being carried out in cooperation with DG REGIO, DG ENER, ESPON, EUROCITIES, CEMR and the CoR. The first workshop in the framework of this pilot project will assess the \u201cEnergy performance of buildings\u201d Directive on 11 November 2015. This Directive was selected as it has a distinct urban character and because the results of the Urban Impact Assessment workshop will directly feed into the overall evaluation of the Directive, currently being carried out by DG ENER. At the end of the conference, Peter Mehlbye presented the work of ESPON on TIA. ESPON has been the most important partner of the CoR in its TIA process and it will continue to develop current tools, such as the ESPON QUICK SCAN.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 87 State of Play of integrated Community-Led Local Development across four European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) Outline Community-Led Local Development is a new mechanism introduced by the Common Provisions Regulation. It aims at delegating decision-making on the use of CLLD funding to local partnerships that bring together the private sector, local authorities and civil society organisations. These local groups take decisions within the framework of a local strategy, developed in response to specific needs and opportunities identified locally. The session included the presentation of the way CLLD is applied in four specific national contexts. The presentations, by a panel of Managing Authorities from the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland and Spain and covering the four Funds, helped participants to understand the flexibility of CLLD and its capacity to adapt to specific contexts and objectives. Main messages and conclusions: Community-Led Local Development is a new mechanism introduced by the Common Provisions Regulation. It aims at delegating decision-making on the use of CLLD funding to local partnerships that bring together the private sector, local authorities and civil society organisations. We now have an overview of the up-take of this new possibility by the Member States. Please bear in mind that these figures are provisional since many programmes have not yet been adopted. 25 MS plan to apply CLLD to more than one fund. Of these, 14 plan to use it in three or four ESI Funds. For the EAFRD, LEADER is an obligatory instrument implemented in all 28 MS via 109 Rural Development Programmes. A total of 9.3 billion euros of public funding has been allocated to CLLD, which will allow over 2 400 local groups to be supported. CLLD is not compulsory in any other fund, but is picking up: under the ERDF, CLLD is programmed by 16 MS with a total allocation of 1.2 billion; a total of over 650 million euros will support around 300 groups under the EMFF, whilst 13 MS have decided to support CLLD under the ESF, through 28 programmes, with a total of 1 billion euros. The four presentations illustrated the way CLLD is currently applied in the four funds: \u2022 Ton Overmeire , Programme manager European Funds for the Municipality of The Hague in the Netherlands, told us how the town of Scheveningen intends to apply CLLD using mostly the ERDF, working on entrepreneurship and jobs for the local community. \u2022 Johan Magnusson , Head of the CLLD Unit in the Swedish Board of Agriculture, explained how Sweden has set up a management system allowing the integration of four funds at local level. He also explained how local groups have helped migrants to settle in rural areas. \u2022 Joanna Gierulska , Head of the territorial development unit in the Polish Ministry of Agriculture, explained how Poland is setting up a multi-fund approach and the issues that this raised. It was easy to agree on the basic features of coordination, but fine-tuning proved more difficult. \u2022 Jos\u00e9 Vicente Palmero Jorro , Head of sector in the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment presented the Spanish approach to CLLD in the EMFF, highlighting the specific issue of coordinating regional Intermediate Bodies with high autonomy. In the short discussion that followed, participants highlighted the role that CLLD could play for helping out refugees when reaching Europe and supporting their integration locally. 13C03 13 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG MARE Chair/moderator: Elisa Roller , Head of Unit A3, DG MARE, European Commission Speakers: Ton Overmeire , Programme manager of European Funds for the Municipality of The Hague, The Netherlands Johan Magnusson , Head of the CLLD Unit in the Swedish Board of Agriculture, Sweden Joanna Gierulska , Head of the territorial development unit in the Polish Ministry of Agriculture, Poland Jos\u00e9 Vicente Palmero Jorro , Head of sector in the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment, Spain More information links: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/ fpfis/cms/farnet/ Livre OD2015.indb 87 08/01/2016 15:38 ",

It is part of a joint project with Social Progress Imperative, Orkestra, Deloitte and the European Commission. The goal of this index is to measure social progress in a new way that is meaningful for policy makers at multiple levels. Its main results will be the publication of a Social Progress Index for 272 regions in 28 European countries to inform the next Cohesion Report in 2017, and the development of a network of European Regions sharing knowledge on social progress drivers and expertise on socially innovative policies. Main messages and conclusions: The Social Progress Index is a global, capability-based index using only social and environmental outcome indicators and so is designed to serve as a complement (and contrast) to GDP. The EU regional Social Progress Index is a joint three year project with Social Progress Imperative, Orkestra, Deloitte and the European Commission. The speakers presented the methodology of the project and some preliminary results from the Basque country in more depth. The main message is that SPI can offer harmonised data on social progress at regional level. However, SPI should not be used for total funding allocation. The chairperson/moderator concluded the workshop by leaving the floor to the audience. Reactions underlined the following aspects: \u2022 How can it influence our daily lives? \u2022 Can it contribute to the debate on Beyond GDP?

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 89 Open Days: Getting on track: accessible transport for older people Outline On Tuesday 13 October 2015, \u201cGetting on track: accessible transport for older people\u201d will unlock the social and economic potential of smart solutions for accessible transport for older people. Discover: - the importance of cycling and walking for the vitality, physical and mental health, and mobility of older people; - how government policy is shifting towards the most cost-efficient demand-oriented transport model; - how communities gain capacity and resilience by providing smart transport solutions for people diagnosed with dementia and; - the benefits for older people of training and of the benefits of providing smart bicycles for older people and people with disabilities. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop started with a presentation by Prof. Hopman explaining the effect of staying active on staying healthy. She summarised by saying that \u201cstaying active=staying healthy\u201d, which raises questions about how to activate sedentary people by making them bike/walk/take stairs, etc. We should all be looking into ways of creating mobility environments that invite people to adopt active ways of travelling. Those systems were now more difficult to achieve than ever, said Eric Sempels . This was partly because of the financial crisis: less money. He then went on to explain the way Flanders had made a new financial system, with prices frozen for Public Transport companies that move elderly/disabled people. Different prices for different groups (i.e. wheelchairs, elderly, otherwise disabled). Patricia Broster then went into the end-user. What could we do to make life easier for people who suffer from dementia? Training, training, training. Bus drivers, people working in shops, etc. should all know how to recognise and deal with demented people. In Liverpool they were now lobbying at national level for such training. The province of North Brabant already tried to influence behaviour in traffic, because they had found out that 90% of all accidents happened because of \u201cbad\u201d behaviour. They target different groups in a different way and have launched a campaign: \u201cHelp Brabant on its way to zero traffic accidents\u201d. They offer cycling courses for elderly people who are still able to cycle, and driver-license renewal obligations for people who can\u2019t cycle any longer. 13C08 13 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: Vlaams-Europees verbindingsagentschap (vleva) Chair/moderator: Ann-Sophie Parent , secretary general AGE Platform, Belgium Speakers: Prof. Maria Hopman , Full professor of clinical research, Radboud University, The Netherlands Eric Sempels , Head of Unit, Flemish department of Mobility and Public works, Belgium Patricia Broster , Deputy Chief Executive & Director of Life story Network and Tommy Dunne testimonial, Liverpool, UK Erik Staps , project-leader, Province of North-Brabant, The Netherlands More information links: https://en.vleva.eu/event/ opendays2015 Livre OD2015.indb 89 08/01/2016 15:38 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 90 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Starting from an overview of the 2030 Development Agenda, adopted in September by the UN General Assembly, this workshop considered the potential impact on local authorities of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and particularly SDG-11 on \u201cMaking Cities and Human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable\u201d. Special emphasis has been put on a set of indicators to assess cities\u2019 sustainability and to measure implementation of the targets. Speakers also debated the localisation of the Goals and some successful European and worldwide approaches and good practice to be used to achieve better urban planning. Main messages and conclusions: The 2030 Development Agenda was adopted on 25 Sept 2015 by Heads of State and Government. The agenda includes 17 goals and 169 targets, which are universal. This means that all countries, developed and developing, will have to implement them. 21% of the 169 targets can only be implemented with local players; 24% should be implemented by local players; a further 20% should be geared to local urban stakeholders. This means that 65% of the targets (110 targets) need the active involvement of local authorities. The SDG-11 on \u2018Making Cities and Human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable\u2019 will impact more on local authorities. This goal aims to promote integrated and innovative infrastructure design, service delivery, land-use planning and efficient spatial concentration, as well as ensuring resilience to climate change and disaster risk reduction. The SDGs should be localised to be implemented. The localisation of SDGs is not a disaggregation of national goals at subnational level, but the devising of a sub-set of goals, targets and indicators by local governments and for which they are responsible. Indicators are very important in order to assess cities\u2019 sustainability and to measure the progress made. In March 2016 the UN Statistical Commission is expected to agree on an indicator set for the SDGs. Some of the important indicators under discussion for the SDG 11 are: built-up areas per inhabitant, access to public transport, green urban areas and air quality. In order to help Mayors to implement the goals, DG REGIO is working on a European Urban Data Platform, which will be launched next year and will facilitate access to urban data and urban benchmarking. The Platform will include the data for European cities for indicators linked to the Urban SDG and the data used in the State of European Cities Report. Not only should the SDGs be localised, but also the spending. DG DEVCO supports LAs through thematic and geographic programmes, as well as bilateral support for decentralisation, local development and local governance, for approximately \u20ac 1.7 billion over the 2014-2020 period. Regional support is also available on each continent. The European Council of Spatial Planners is an umbrella association of 25 professional planning associations and institutes from 23 European countries. It engages in dialogue with local and national governments, and identifies and rewards good practice via the European Planning Awards.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 91 Building an Inclusive City Outline The title of the workshop was \u2018Building an inclusive city: local policies for mobile EU citizens to find their place in the host community\u2019. The workshop provided a good opportunity to exchange policy initiatives, facts and figures and to promote best practices related to the inclusion of mobile citizens. Both the policy aspect and the practical aspects of inclusion were highlighted. The Commission services presented policy initiatives and studies, while Eurocities addressed the more practical side of the cities involved. Two projects from Stockholm and Bordeaux showed the diversity of challenges and solutions in this area. The Commission invited everybody to participate in the public consultation on EU citizenship rights and values and in particular regarding the questions linked to inclusion. Main messages and conclusions: The benefits of EU free movement include: creating interaction between EU citizens, enhancing mutual understanding and contributing to more tolerant and inclusive societies. It also helps to generate growth and prosperity in the EU. At the same time, challenges exist in some cities and regions, especially when confronted with a large influx. The Commission is committed to sharing knowledge developed across Europe to better address social inclusion challenges. The Commission presented current approaches to inclusion, equal treatment and tolerance. It also presented a public consultation on EU citizenship, which all participants are warmly invited to take part in. The main reason for EU mobility is work; studies show that mobile EU citizens are younger and show lower rates of unemployment than the local population. DG Employment presented a study on the challenges and the opportunities faced by mobile EU workers, local workers and local communities in 4 European cities as a result of the socio-economic inclusion of mobile EU workers. This study contributes to and shows the importance of an informed debate on intra-EU labour mobility based on facts and figures rather than perceptions. Providing information to mobile workers can boost their inclusion in the host society and help to combat labour exploitation. Eurocities pointed to the fact that EU mobility at the level of the Member States may be perceived differently than in particular cities or regions where many mobile EU citizens come together and may pose specific challenges to the receiving cities. There is an urgent demand for direct funding opportunities for cities. There is no need to call the free movement of persons as such into question. Crossroads in Stockholm explained why the legal definitions of EU citizens, long-term residents or mobile workers are sometimes confusing, when in reality persons with different legal statuses require similar advice and support. Mobile EU citizens - largely men - come to seek work in Sweden. However, they may end up in poverty. The speaker from Bordeaux focused on e-inclusion or the disadvantages that people experience if they are not connected to the internet or are unable to use online services: in finding employment, accessing services or participating in society more generally. They become even more marginalised. He presented the way Bordeaux not only offers access to online services in public spaces but also actively reaches out to these individuals. 13C11 13 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG Justice & Consumers Chair/moderator: Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boulanger , Head of Unit, Union Citizenship Rights and Free Movement, DG Justice & Consumers, European Commission Speakers: Andrea Pontiroli , Policy Officer, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, European Commission Thomas J\u00e9z\u00e9quel , Policy Advisor, Eurocities, Brussels, Belgium Delphine Hob\u00e9, EU-Advisor, Crossroads Centre, Stockholm, Sweden Gilles Massini , Project Manager for Solidarit\u00e9 Num\u00e9rique, Municipality of Bordeaux, France More information links: www.yourvoiceineurope.eu Livre OD2015.indb 91 08/01/2016 15:38 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 92 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline The workshop hosted a debate on how to strengthen integrated urban policies with a view to a potential EU Urban Agenda. Best practice along three strands: \u201csmart\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cinclusive\u201d cities, were presented. Panellists also considered it very important that urban innovative actions should be promoted to face urban challenges. In addition, it was recommended that urban dimension be further taken into consideration at all levels of policy- making and governance. EU policies with an urban dimension should be effectively coordinated in future. There was a certain consensus among the panellists on the importance of developing a strong partnership involving multilevel governance cooperation among cities, Member States and EU institutions as an element of the future EU Urban Agenda. Main messages/conclusions Henriette van Eijl explained the main role played by the EIP on Smart cities and Communities. She also spoke about the EU Transport Policy which in itself has two urban related goals: to cut by half the use of conventional vehicles in cities by 2030 and move towards \u00b4zero emissions\u00b4 in major urban centres by 2030. Juan Escudero presented the reasons why Vitoria-Gasteiz was given the title of European Green Capital. The city is focusing on urban sustainability, especially in the transport sector where they have managed to decrease CO 2 emissions by 10% since 2010. It is expected that overall emissions could go down up to 82%. Eva Korban , Mayor of Municipality of Battonya (Hungary) presented their project on a \u201cNursery for disadvantaged families with children\u201d. She explained that thanks to the European Social Fund, Battonya is able to tackle the social inclusive challenge, promoting the social integration of those families and children who live in poverty. Alexandra Frangenheim from METIS GmbH presented the preliminary findings of their study \u201cThe growth potential of an integrated EU Urban Agenda\u201d which demonstrates the potential growth of the cities if better coordinated urban policies are implemented at European level. Kerstin Westphal , Member of the EP said that the Urban Agenda was essential, as urban areas were growing in importance and were the transport hubs of Europe. She also said that it was important for immigration to be closely monitored as it had a direct impact on urban areas. Nicolaas Beets , Dutch Urban Envoy, presented the plans of the Dutch presidency regarding the Urban Agenda. The Presidency will focus on jobs and skills, housing, inclusion of refugees and urban mobility. Bas Verkerk , mayor of Delft and rapporteur of a CoR Opinion entitled \u201cTowards an Integrated Urban Agenda for the EU\u201d, recommended that the urban dimension should be further taken into consideration at all levels of policy-making and governance. To him, EU policies with an urban dimension should be further effectively coordinated. Mikel Landabaso, Director for Inclusive Growth, Urban and Territorial Development and Northern Europe, DG REGIO, European Commission, briefed participants on the next call for proposals on urban innovative actions, which would be a sort of laboratory for facing urban challenges.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 93 Food sovereignty and urban-rural integration Outline The workshop focused on learning from a new wave of food initiatives that point the way towards local food sovereignty, lasting urban-rural links and a new generation of local development strategies. Specific cases covering territorial aspects of food initiatives (rural-urban integration through sustainable food systems) and community aspects (new links and alliances) were presented. This was followed by \u201cbuzz group\u201d discussions involving all workshop participants of whether and how such initiatives could be scaled up with EU/ Member State support. The workshop concluded with a panel discussion to which experts and practitioners contributed, bringing in different perspectives: local food systems, the social economy, cities in economic crisis and community-led local development. Main messages/conclusions The presentations showed the diversity of experience. Amersfoort, NL focused on food as part of a regional territorial strategy, building up rural-urban links (feed the city) and food as part of integrated solutions to social, economic, health and environmental issues. This contrasted with Suma Wholefoods, a membership- based cooperative UK, which emphasised democratic control of food supply chains; food in the gift economy (e.g., growing vegetables that can be used for free); cooperative distribution and buying networks; and some initiatives which were not commercially viable, but socially and politically important. Conclusions and recommendations: Up-scaling does not necessarily mean multiplication; it can mean making existing models viable and transferring knowledge. It can involve connecting to the mainstream to shorten food supply chains and increase the proportion of local food in supermarkets. The food agenda has come into focus with the economic crisis as mainstream systems (banking system) fall apart. New initiatives involving social-public-economic sectors and civil society have developed, including community kitchens; using food waste to feed vulnerable populations and; re-connecting the city with rural areas to develop food supply. The regulatory framework is an area for action. Proposals concern land management, for instance, whereby a minimum percentage of food-growing space could be specified (like parking); legalising community-owned land; and making the local population guardians of land surrounding large cities, defending them against property speculation; reducing the power of monopolies; prohibiting hypermarkets and positive discrimination in favour of local and regional small production. Initiatives that could be supported include: promoting direct sales from farms, farmers\u2019 markets with support from local self-government and not commercial firms, and farmers\u2019 box (or basket) schemes; focusing on higher value-added sectors (such as bakeries, catering) and not just direct sales of primary produce and; supporting social franchising food initiatives (with public support to codify the model to be franchised). With regard to cooperation between different players, democratic governance of producers, consumers and distributers of local food should be secured; promoting cross-sectoral local/regional cooperation and connecting with local farmers. Education and awareness-raising on the many aspects of food, starting with children in schools, was particularly important. 13C14 13 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: LDnet (Local Development Network - LDnet Association) Chair/moderator: Robert Lukesch , Consultant, LDnet / \u00d6AR, Austria Speakers: Marianne Karstens , Consultant, Walnut Food & Hospitality Management, The Netherlands Bob Cannell , Cooperative Member, Suma Wholefoods, UK Urszula Budzich-Tabor , Vice President LDnet, LDnet/ ENRD, Belgium Toby Johnson , Social Economy Expert, LDnet/AEIDL, Belgium Eleni Myrivili , Council Member, City of Athens, Greece Andr\u00e9 Vizinho , Researcher, Centre for Ecology Evolution and Environmental Changes (CE3C), University of Lisbon, Portugal Sandra Karner , Senior Researcher, IFZ \u2013 Inter-university Research Centre on Technology, Work and Culture, Alpen-Adria University, Austria Boba Ilia , Secretary General, SWG RRD, FYR Macedonia More information links: www.ldnet.eu Livre OD2015.indb 93 08/01/2016 15:38 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 94 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Disasters do not respect national borders. Joint prevention and emergency response are essential, in particular in border regions. This workshop covered disaster (risk) management at EU and regional and local levels, providing many practical examples of cross-border project design and implementation. It highlighted how regions and municipalities played a crucial role in disaster (risk) management across Europe and that further efforts could be made to foster cooperation - as well as to bring Europe closer to the regions. Regional and local players were encouraged to use the funding opportunities of EU Cohesion Policy (Interreg) and under the EU civil protection policy. Main messages/conclusions The chair introduced the discussions by referring to the disaster risk management landscape at European level, including EU financing instruments available. Following this, he explained the main lines of the EU Civil Protection legislation. Ian Clark focused his presentation on prevention action and the increasingly predominant notion of risk and risk culture in the EU. Improving risk knowledge, disaster loss data recording and supporting MS on risk assessments and risk management capability assessments were central issues. The recent launch of the Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre would provide added value. Europe had much to contribute, but still had work to do on risk culture and awareness of risk. Alexander Ferstl contextualised the discussion by highlighting the different nature of borders present in Europe and underlined the need for cross-border cooperation in risk management. Natural borders were particularly vulnerable areas with high risks. Cohesion policy would invest approx. \u20ac 7.1 billion in climate change adaptation and disaster prevention (2014-2020). Cross-border programmes (Interreg) covered disaster risk prevention actions (focus on green infrastructure), research and soft actions (e.g. language learning). In addition, DG REGIO had recently initiated work on an inventory of legal and administrative obstacles in border areas. Stefan Kreuzer introduced work by the Regional Government of Lower Austria and its long-standing cooperation with neighbouring regions in CZ, SK and HU \u2013 from bilateral work programmes over bilateral border river commissions to Interreg/ECHO projects. \u2018Self-made\u2019 routine cross-border cooperation remained in practice the most concrete example. Value of cross-border cooperation was knowledge transfer: example of Team Austria initiative to manage non-organised volunteers \u2013 similar initiative now in HU. Corina Marcian presented the \u2018RISK\u2019 project (Interreg) between Romania and Bulgaria.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 95 International cooperation in urban and regional development: the experience of the World Cities project Outline Seven city representatives from the EU, India, China, Japan and Canada participated in the World Cities project workshop held in Brussels on 13 October 2015. The project is an initiative of the European Union (EU), originating from the European Parliament and managed by DG REGIO. The workshop showcased selected experiences in the areas of regional economic cooperation and urban development, giving participants an insight into the actions of local and regional authorities towards supporting the internationalisation of their cities or regions. The experiences were commented on by UN HABITAT. The project aims to contribute to better urban policy for the improvement of quality of life in participating cities across the world. The specific cooperation agenda envisages identification of pilot regions and cities and the development of tangible initiatives for implementation in the short term, in areas including urban innovation (smart cities) and green technologies (energy efficiency, low carbon development). Initiatives are designed to increase what is known as \u201ctriple-helix cooperation\u201d between governments, research and business. World Cities will also strengthen market opportunities and job creation while pursuing the sustainable economic development of the cities involved, thus fostering win-win cooperation. In his opening remarks, Walter Deffaa drew attention to the global urbanisation challenge, saying that 95% of the rapid urban population growth would take place in emerging countries outside the EU. He said, \u201cThis new wave of urbanisation places additional pressure on policymakers at a global level to ensure that it is managed in a sustainable and inclusive way\u201d. Mr Deffaa emphasised the experience of European cities and regions in delivering rapid growth and balanced territorial development, a key issue in emerging countries. Fan Hengshan focused on the development of urban clusters in China and on the chances that this brings for promoting green and intelligent cities. He referred to successful pilot projects within World Cities and mentioned further opportunities within China\u2019s Silk Road Strategy and the New National Urbanisation Plan (2014-2022). Mr Fan also said that China would promote balanced territorial development by supporting urban-rural development and establishing innovation strategies at local and regional level. Mark Schneider said that the West Midlands region, which accounts for 8.9% of UK population, is supporting local authorities in their efforts in favour of international cooperation. Mr Schneider illustrated some successful pilot projects run in cooperation with the business community, universities and the public sector in China and the West Midlands. Uttama Fulzele y focused on the challenge of developing growth centres outside large urban concentrations in order to reduce congestion effects. She said that the EU has a valuable experience to contribute, especially regarding the role of multi-level-governance within metropolitan areas. Neelabh Singh spoke of the core areas identified for cooperation with Chandigarh, including projects to promote the conversion from waste to energy, non-motorised transportation and sewage treatment. He emphasised that pilot initiatives are developed through a self-sustained approach that ensures success beyond the World Cities project\u2019s life cycle. The \u201ctriple-helix\u201d approach was held to be crucial. Jun Nakamura spoke of the drive to find locally applicable solutions to shared challenges. The Deputy Mayor of Toyama explained how his municipality is learning from its partner city (Burgas, Bulgaria), for example, on developing strategies for keeping the elderly population active and healthy. Mark Boysen described the relationship between Saanich and Almada as one of mutual discovery. Prior to the project, the clear connection between the partner cities was that they were both situated on the coast and bordered on a political and economic centre. However, as cooperation developed, the majority of overlap - and the first signs of tangible outcomes - were related to low carbon development and green infrastructure. 13C16 13 October 2015 14:30-17:30 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG REGIO Chair/moderator: Dr Ronald Hall , Principal Adviser, DG REGIO, European Commission Speakers: Walter Deffaa , Director General, DG REGIO, European Commission Fan Hengshan , National Development and Reform Commission, China Mark Schneider , West Midlands, UK Uttama Fulzele , Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, India Neelabh Singh , CLEAN Cluster, DK Torben Heinemann , Leipzig, Germany Jun Nakamura , Deptuty Mayor, Toyama, Japan Mark Boysen , Saanich, Canada, Paulius Kulikaukas , Inter-Regional Advisor, UN Human Settlements Programme Livre OD2015.indb 95 08/01/2016 15:39 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 96 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Main messages/conclusions It was clear from the presentations that the participants in the World Cities project see a clear place in international cooperation for this kind of action. This was commented upon in the messages and conclusions presented by Paulius Kulikaukas from the UN, who said that in this respect he found that the project was somewhat unusual among international urban development actions. He said that there was consensus among participants on the added value of the World Cities, which was opening up very rich opportunities for cooperation between EU cities and regions and their counterparts in other countries. The project is challenging at the same time, given the diversity of experiences which it encompasses, for example: - the complexity and magnitude of urbanisation in China, and the accompanying challenge of narrowing the inequality gap between urban and rural dwellers; - the administrative complexity with which the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is faced; - the cultural differences between Copenhagen and Chandigarh, and the challenge of transforming personal relations into institutional relationships; - the exchange of ideas on public transport between Leipzig and Kumamoto; - the shared concern of improving quality of life in the cities of Toyama and Burgas; - the application of the triple-helix approach in the sub-metropolitan municipalities of Saanich and Almada. Mr Kulikaukas said that the EU World Cities initiative was very relevant and timely in a broader international context, as it was beginning at a time when \u201cTransforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d had just been approved by the United Nations General Assembly, while COP21 promised to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change policy. Also, the preparations for Habitat III were entering their final phase, shaping the implementation of these international goals and commitments. Among the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), Goal No. 11: \u201cMake cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\u201d appeared to be the most relevant for the EU World Cities project, although it was not the only one. The partners in the World Cities should be able to develop effective ways of achieving some of the SDG targets. Mr Kulikaukas called for maximum synergies between the two processes. He drew attention to the governance aspects of the SDG that aim to: ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels, which underpins the importance of subsidiarity and strengthens the role of the regions and cities in implementing the Agenda for Sustainable Development; and strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, which is in line with the means of implementation used in the EU World Cities project. In conclusion, he said that the presentations on World Cities had convinced him that the project had made a major contribution by: allowing open-ended collaboration between partners and sparking creativity among the partners, encouraging management of complex diversity. He said that international agendas should not be taken as instructions, but rather as inspiration for creative collaboration across the sectors, levels of governance, and international borders. Initiatives such as World Cities, which support international collaboration, are valuable a facilitation mechanism, and because they are limited in time and resources the collaboration developed under them should become self-sustaining.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 97 How could result-oriented transnational cooperation best be organised? Capitalising on past experiences to address present and future challenges Outline How can transnational cooperation be of added value to Europe\u2019s cities and rural areas? What is the state of play of transnational cooperation in Europe in ETC programmes, macro-regions and other contexts? For what types of action does transnational cooperation bring added value? How can we encourage local, regional and national authorities, NGOs, private companies and other actors to engage in transnational cooperation? These issues are relevant in the context of macro-regional regional strategies, which seek to mobilise local and regional actors around shared objectives. However, the workshop sought to encourage a wider discussion on the purpose and potential added value of transnational cooperation. The purpose of the workshop was to gather opinions from all participants. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop made it possible to identify the \u2018state of play\u2019 of transnational cooperation in Europe: Why is transnational cooperation considered useful? What benefits can we expect to draw from it? What types of cooperation instruments should we focus on? Some key challenges regarding the way transnational cooperation is currently operated were identified. The most important challenge at the European level is the lack of focus: too many objectives are being pursued. There is a need to concentrate efforts on issues for which cooperation brings clear added value. However, major challenges can also be identified at the local and regional levels. Despite 25 years of INTERREG cooperation, lack of trust remains a significant obstacle to cooperation. Targeted efforts are needed to change mind-sets, to demonstrate the added value of cooperation and to establish partnerships that can ensure that all relevant actors benefit from the results of cooperation. 13C17 13 October 2015 14:30-18:30 Organiser/leader: University of Geneva European Commission, DG REGIO INTERACT European Association of Elected Representatives from Mountain Areas (AEM) Chair/moderator: Dr Erik Gl\u00f8ersen , Researcher, University of Geneva, Department of Geography and Environment, Switzerland Prof. Bernard Debarbieux , Dean, University of Geneva, School of Social Sciences, Switzerland Speakers: Bresso Mercedes , MEP, European Parliament, Italy Livre OD2015.indb 97 08/01/2016 15:39 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 98 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline All over Europe there is a trend towards people leaving rural areas, heading for metropolitan areas. The workshop highlighted the fact that medium-sized cities play a key role in regulating this process, contributing to a sustainable urbanisation. These cities contribute to a balanced population density in the region by providing high quality local services. They offer good amenities, environment and business opportunities with strong economic, social and spatial policies and local government close to the general population. This position should be strengthened by continuing investment and cooperation in (international) networks. At EU-level there is a need to better integrate support for urban and rural areas, but medium-sized cities are the true link here. Main messages and conclusions: Serena Foracchia linked this workshop to the OD2014 workshop where Eurotowns showed how medium- sized cities can contribute to EU2020 goals. Reggio Emilia redefined the strength of the city with a strong link to the surrounding rural areas. Social well-being and standards of living are the most valuable qualities of medium-sized cities. Pietro Elisei stated that small and medium-sized cities were drivers for achieving an integrated territorial approach. The example of Kavala\u2019s strategic territorial agenda showed how knowledge and attitude meant that significant local assets could be valorised. Marta Madrenas Mir explained the Girona attitude towards the metropolis of Barcelona. They avoided competition and looked for contribution and cooperation. By developing your own strengths you can play a complementary role. Bernd V\u00f6hringer made a link with the Council of Europe. Sindelfingen was member of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities and stressed the importance of networks. Bas Verkerk stated that the future of Europe was built on cities and their inhabitants. Cities and towns were working increasingly together within the triple or even quadruple helix: businesses, science and government and the public (end users). In this setting, sustainable ways of urbanisation were being created. In order to support city governments in their crucial role of multi-level governance, we needed an enhanced role of local authorities in the decision-making processes at regional, national and European level. Cor Lamers concluded that the key message was that medium-sized cities should look to being a complement to metropolitan areas, not trying to compete. They should look to their own strengths, build their services and their image around this and stay close to the public. Medium-sized cities should not underestimate their role. They should provide the EU with examples as to how the EU could support the cities in developing their qualities. \u201cMedium-sized cities: large enough to cope, small enough to care!\u201d Sustainable urbanisation by investing in medium sized cities 14C01 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: City of Schiedam / EUROTOWNS Chair/moderator: Cor Lamers , Mayor of Schiedam, Member of the European Committee of the Regions, The Netherlands Speakers: Serena Foracchia , Deputy Mayor for Reggio Emilia on international and intercultural affairs, president of EUROTOWNS, Italy Pietro Elisei , Vice-president ISOCARP, Director URBASOFIA and URBACT expert, Italy/Romania Marta Madrenas , Mir, Deputy Mayor and Delegate Councillor for Urban Planning and Activities Girona, Spain Bernd V\u00f6hringer , Mayor of Sindelfingen, Member Council of Europe\u2019s Congress of Regional and Local Authorities, Germany Bas Verkerk , Mayor of Delft, European Committee of the Regions\u2019 rapporteur on Urban Agenda, The Netherlands More information links: Leonie Hulshof, let.hulshof@schiedam.nl and www.eurotowns.org Livre OD2015.indb 98 08/01/2016 15:39 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 99 Cross-border cooperation and regional integration: a worldwide approach Outline This workshop, gathering more than 250 participants, was organised by the Mission Op\u00e9rationnelle Transfrontali\u00e8re (MOT), a French public agency dealing with cross-border cooperation, in cooperation with the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). For 25 years, Interreg has funded cross-border cooperation programmes with many successful achievements. Organisations such as MOT or AEBR bring together local and regional authorities that have developed projects improving the daily life of people living in urban and rural cross-border territories in Europe. But cross- border cooperation is not limited to Europe. On other continents, national and local authorities and regional organisations are engaged in strengthening cross-border integration. This workshop presented different projects of cross-border cooperation in West Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia, vis-\u00e0-vis the European experience. In West Africa, UNCDF implements the LOBI project, whose aim is to experiment with multilevel governance of cross-border cooperation and the financing of concrete projects. In Latin America, cross-border cooperation is to be found in the political agendas of all MERCOSUR countries. In South-East Asia, ASEAN launched an initiative to improve cross-border trade and the construction of special border economic zones. The French Foreign Affairs Ministry promotes local cross-border cooperation as a component of decentralised cooperation. DG REGIO facilitates exchanges between experience in Europe and other continents. Main messages and conclusions: Jean Peyrony introduced the discussions by presenting the MOT\u2019s experience in Europe, which for several years has benefited other continents, for example in French Guiana and West Africa through the \u201cLOBI UNCDF\u201d project. Christel Alvergne presented the experience of the LOBI project in West Africa, which is an experiment in cross- border cooperation carried out using multi-level governance and the financing of practical projects, with the possibility of extending it to other parts of the world. For Christel Alvergne , \u201cborders are places of important socio-economic exchange that can contribute to local economic development and the preservation of peace\u201d. Rony Soerakoesoemah presented an initiative aimed at improving cross-border trade and the creation of border region special economic zones launched by ASEAN. The ultimate objective is to draw up a regional policy for cross-border cooperation that could be based on the LOBI project. German Granda Alva set out the issues relating to cross-border cooperation in Central and South America. In his view, \u201cit is necessary to create an EU-Latin America platform for dialogue on cross-border questions\u201d. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Julien talked about France\u2019s support for decentralised cooperation actions, particularly in cross-border territories in the countries of the South within the framework of the ACTS project (\u201cAppui \u00e0 la Coop\u00e9ration Transfrontali\u00e8re au Sahel\u201d). \u201cWe are convinced that the cross-border dimension is an important topic for the coming years.\u201d Ronald Hall explained the importance of the partnerships forged by DG REGIO with other countries in the world around the topic of regional integration, of which cross-border cooperation is a major aspect. 14C02 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: Mission Op\u00e9rationnelle Transfrontali\u00e8re (MOT) Chair/moderator: Jean Peyrony , Director General of the Mission Op\u00e9rationnelle Transfrontali\u00e8re (MOT), France Speakers: Christel Alvergne , Deputy Director, United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), United States of America Rony Soerakoesoemah , Regional Director, Economic Development Services Pty Ltd, Indonesia German Granda Alva , Senior Adviser for DG REGIO, European Commission H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Julien , Policy officer, DG Globalisation, Development and Partnerships, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, France Dr Ronald Hall , Principal Advisor, DG REGIO, European Commission More information links: www.espaces-transfrontaliers.eu www.uncdf.org/sites/default/files/ Documents/brochure-lobi-fr-web.pdf www.edsfirst.com www.aebr.eu/files/publications/ Final_Report_CBC_LA_EN_full_ version.pdf www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/ politique-etrangere-de-la-france/ defense-et-securite/cooperation- de-securite-et-de-defense/ actualites-liees-a-la-cooperation/ article/le-projet-appui-a-la- cooperation ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/ fr/information/publications/ reports/2015/europe-latin- america-and-the-caribbean- sharing-experiences-in-regional- development-policies Livre OD2015.indb 99 08/01/2016 15:39 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 100 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline INTERREG is one of the most highly-valued and visible elements of the European Union. It helps eliminate the internal borders of the Union; its founding slogan is \u201cEurope without Borders\u201d. After 25 years of promoting cross-border cooperation, the situation at the Spanish-Portuguese border has substantially changed in terms of socioeconomic and territorial cohesion. This workshop aimed to promote the debate about the future of cross-border cooperation in the post-2020 scenario, showing - with practical examples - the importance of ETC funds for achieving a true single market and for promoting economic growth, job creation and European citizenship in border regions. Main messages and conclusions: There still are some difficulties relating to ETC to be addressed in the near future. The role of existing cross- border associations should be clarified. It is necessary to improve the participation of local authorities in ETC programmes as well as to recognise the role of these public authorities in achieving the objectives and to promote proximity cooperation, which presents real benefit to the general public (sharing public resources, urban services, etc). In this scenario, it becomes clear that there is a need to coordinate local measures in all policies so as to create synergy between them and to meet the challenges of urban development more efficiently. Finally, it was clear that there were many messages that players in cooperation could send out so as to improve ETC programmes. In this sense, workshops organisers proposed to create an annual forum on ETC where local players in cooperation could provide feedback to the EC about their work and share good practice. 25 Years erasing borders: focus on the Iberian Peninsula 14C03 14 October 2015 09:00 -10:45 Organiser/leader: RIET \u2013 Iberian Network of Crossborder Entities Chair/moderator: Portuguese Eixo , Atl\u00e2ntico do Noroeste Peninsular President Portugal Braga Speakers: Andersson Pench Lena , Swedish European Commission Director of Territorial Co-operation, Macro-regions and North \u2013West Europe Belgium Brussels Fern\u00e1ndez Melle Fernando , Spanish Ministry of Economy and Public Administration, General Sub-Director of European Territorial Cooperation and Urban Development, Spain Soeiro Jose , Portuguese Agency for Development and Cohesion, Former President, Portugal Cunha Costa Jose , M\u00aa Portuguese Iberian Network of Cross-border Entities, President, Portugal More information links: www.eixoatlantico.com Livre OD2015.indb 100 08/01/2016 15:39 ",

In the second slot, the Centro region of Portugal, Lower Normandy and Achterhoek explained how they promote economic activity through innovation linked to the silver economy. This helps to respond to a growing demand for this kind of products and services and to keep young people in the regions. Main messages and conclusions: Territories can face demographic challenges in a positive way, not as a threat but as an opportunity. Demographic challenges push public authorities to be creative and innovative in providing public services (i.e. on demand transport, telemedicine, smart houses, autonomy programmes for those with chronic diseases, etc.). Demographic challenges are also seen as an opportunity to create new services and products, for instance those linked to the silver economy. Public authorities have a major role to play in gathering all the actors with a view to working together. 14C04 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: Castilla y Le\u00f3n Permanent Delegation to the EU Chair/moderator: Anne Sophie Parent , Secretary General, AGE Platform Europe, Belgium Speakers: Lutz Scherling , Head of Section of the Ministry of Agriculture, Environment and Consumer Protection, Germany Ida Wernered , Director of Business Development at Angered Hospital, Sweden Ignacio Rosell Aguilar , Policy Advisor at Castilla y Le\u00f3n Ministry of Health, Spain Carlos Neves , Vice President CCDR-N, Norte Region of Portugal Vanessa Lobo Casas , EU Policy Officer at Fundaci\u00f3n Galicia Europa, Spain Dr Osman Gurun , Mayor of Mugla Metropolitan Municipality, Turkey Elisa Tofoni , Advisor in charge of non-technological innovation, Miriade (Lower-Normandy Innovation Agency), France Jo\u00e3o Malva , Professor at Medical School of the University of Coimbra, Portugal Martin Stor , Director of the innovation centre ACT Achterhoek, The Netherlands More information links: Opportunities for demographic change- Open Days workshop 14/10/2015 www.eucyl.jcyl.es/web/jcyl/ Eucyl/es/Plantilla100 Detalle/1277999678552/_/ 1284488932159/Comunicacion Livre OD2015.indb 101 08/01/2016 15:39 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 102 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Europe is growing closer together \u2013 Scandinavian regions and cities are becoming more closely connected to the centre of European. New routes are needed and are becoming a reality \u2013 step by step. Two routes connecting Southern Norway through Denmark and Sweden to Northern Germany were presented: the Fehmarn-Belt-Axis and the Jutland-Axis. What are the challenges and opportunities faced by urban and rural regions along these two routes? And what does this development mean for a region at the heart of Europe, for example the Netherlands? Transport infrastructure is a prerequisite for development and economic growth along the two routes but the aim is to connect people across borders and between urban and rural areas and to offer new opportunities and a better quality of life. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop was opened by Stefan Seidler who stated that cooperation with its Scandinavian neighbours has always been a priority for the government of Schleswig-Holstein. This cooperation builds on many cross- border initiatives to increase economic growth, to create and maintain jobs and to improve the quality of life in the area. Schleswig-Holstein does that by focusing on common strengths along its main axes to the north \u2013 the Jutland Route and the Fehmarn Belt Route \u2013 by initiating cluster cooperation, planning infrastructure and R&D, enabling labour market mobility and supporting cultural or people-to-people events. The basic idea is closer cooperation with the neighbours in northern Europe. Peter Madsen presented the Quickstart initiative, which refers to the labour market, business development and educational efforts in the region of Zealand in Denmark. The idea of the initiative is to ensure the best possible economic and employment effects of the large-scale construction projects in the region, including the Fehmarn Belt tunnel, by upskilling the labour force. Rune Mortensen talked about city regions and strategic urban-rural development. European city regions are subject to increased attention and importance but need to act together in order to be competitive on a global scale. Collaborative efforts to strengthen city regions are often complex and involve many parties. A crucial ingredient for successful cooperation is reliable knowledge about internal and external dependencies, challenges and interactions. Per Henriksen presented the Hub North which is a northern Danish network, developed on the basis of an energy cluster, with targeted profiling in the area of wind energy. In order to exploit the North Sea\u2019s energy potential, Europe needs a coherent and developed transportation system from Hamburg to Stavanger, the Jutland Corridor. Emma Bengtsson presented the Sk\u00e5ne Roadmap for Biogas \u2013 a unique collaboration between 66 stakeholders in the region aimed at achieving a positive impact on the production, use and distribution of biogas. Mathias Bernander presented the Port of Kristiansand\u2019s work on strengthening and improving the Nordic Link on the Norwegian side through new transport and logistics solutions.

The concept of the workshop was to present the perspective of the Member States which had already started to implement the ITI solutions in the case studies of two Metropolitan Areas in Poland, i.e. Lodz Metropolitan Area and Ma\u0142opolska Metropolitan Area, and the City of Maastricht which has a different concept of implementing the integrated project in comparison to Croatian and Romanian measures encouraging integrated approaches and preparing for ITI. The last case study from Turkey presented the concept of ITI in the future from a candidate country. Main messages and conclusions: During the workshop, we intended to discuss the most innovative initiatives and strategies that local authorities are taking or planning to take under ITI and the types of project they are implementing in order to support the development of ITI. The aim of the workshop was to present a set of practical actions (best strategies) from different perspectives; as well as examples from the Member States implementing the ITI under EU structural funds, and the IPA approach to be implemented in candidate countries with an integrated, bottom- up approach for urban and rural areas. The multi-level discussion among regions, cities and their functional areas enabled participants to create new solutions. During the debate, speakers discussed, with the audience, the possibility of synergies through combining these actions.

These presentations succeeded in highlighting answers to important questions such as: What constitutes the success of genuine local development within the process of European integration? What can regions do to improve living standards and the economic development of local communities? How has the European Union contributed to the success of these initiatives? It also addressed other important topics related to EU-funded projects. Each of these questions and answers included several issues and challenges that regional authorities face when implementing urban and rural development. In order to achieve a satisfactory response to these issues and challenges, regional representatives may consider several possibilities, best practices, experiences but must put all of these into practice in a strategically optimal order, i.e. building from the bottom up! Main messages and conclusions: The main message and conclusion of the workshop represented the importance of collaboration between twinned counties and international cooperation among authorities from different EU countries in the process of implementing regional, local, urban and rural initiatives, especially through EU-funded projects and structural funds. These conclusions were reached on the basis of the presentations by representatives of the partnership set up for the workshop. These included presentations by the following: Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County Government on the support for SMEs in the county through EU-funded projects in the previous and the present programming period; B\u00e9k\u00e9s County Government on the role of its regional authority in supporting SMEs; Pest County Government on the project entitled Mlei Solanova; the presentation by Alin Nica , Mayor of Duse\u0219tii Noi on urban regeneration, as an example of sustainable development; the presentation by Csaba Borboly , president of Harghita County Council on how to think globally and act locally, and finally the presentation by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Cs\u00e1k , specialist on local development, entitled \u2018Place matters - Learning from local solutions: networks, benchmarks and innovation\u2019. Each of these presentations contributed to the general conclusion that it is necessary to act locally at each regional level represented by the partnership, as well as to involve several regional authorities from Europe in project initiatives that will lead to better support for local actors, SMEs, and rural and agricultural actors. The reason for this is that all actions launched from the bottom up will have their own impact globally, and will also have a positive impact on development at EU level, since better border-crossing opportunities can be a very useful tool in SME development. Furthermore, as highlighted by the MEPs participating in the workshop, Csaba S\u00f3gor and Iuliu Winkler, genuine sustainable development requires successful intergovernmental co-operation for optimal infrastructural development, the advantage of future admission to the Schengen area, and decentralisation from the point of view of funding for EU projects, since Romania has a great capacity to use these funds at local level. Both the Open Days event series and the workshop organised as part of the cooperation between the twinned regions offered a good opportunity for common thinking and to become familiar with each other\u2019s points of view and good practices. The workshop was followed by a networking session where participants had the chance to taste traditional local products from the regions in the partnership.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 105 The EGTCs implementing urban-rural strategies in border areas Outline Around 80% of the 55 European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs) established up to October 2015 are platforms of strategic development and integrate cross-border rural-urban areas. The participants discussed the possibilities of implementing Structural and Investment Funds using the different EU-funded programmes, including new instruments. Panel discussion: Raffaele Cattaneo gave an overview of the situation, with the vast majority of the EGTCs operating in rural areas, and stressed that it is important to explore how to make better use of EU funds. However, in view of the fact that there is a preference not to use new tools as the CLLD at cross-border level and that, in general, the European Commission (DG Agri) is not particularly involved in cross-border actions, Mr Cattaneo raised the questions of how to coordinate rural development initiatives at cross-border level and how to improve the initiatives of the EGTCs in the area of rural development. Jos\u00e9 Luis Pascual Criado gave an overview of the activities of the EGTC Duero-Douro, including a recent centralised purchase project which improved the energy efficiency of the small rural municipalities involved. In Mr Pascual\u2019s experience, the main problems were related to operating in two countries with the same legal personality and to participating effectively in the planning and programming of the EU funds, because Duero- Douro was geographically remote and far from the decision-making centres. J\u00e1n Feren\u010d\u00e1k presented the EGTC Tatry, which brings together 135 local and regional authorities and aims to have an impact on 1 500 000 citizens, 70% of whom are located in rural areas. The EGTC launched a 2014-2020 cross-border agenda that focuses on promoting cross-border partnerships, cross-border education, improving connectivity and promoting cultural and natural heritage. The EGTC works very closely with the cross-border programme PL-SK. Alena Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 presented the actions of the European LEADER Association for Rural Development, encouraging the EGTCs to participate in EU-wide platforms such as the European Network of Rural Development. As the Local Action Groups are linked to the municipalities, they frequently work together with the EGTCs in the areas where these structures exist. Conclusions: The conclusions of the workshop were drafted by the participants and the speakers together. The strongest points were the potential of the EGTCs to create partnerships and to elaborate joint strategic visions. The most promising fields of action seemed to be related to innovation, diversification, promotion of rural SMEs, energy, water, cross-border tourism and culture. The challenges were related to the legal obstacles to work at cross- border level, the lack of funding options, and the balance between rural and urban goals, along with a possible perception of \u201ccompetition\u201d among organisations. The visibility, participation and coordination with all the local authorities acting on the ground are essential to build cross-border partnerships and, in particular, the EGTCs have to work shoulder-to-shoulder with the Local Action Groups. 14C08 14 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Committee of the Regions \u2013 Platform of European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation Chair/moderator: Raffaele Cattaneo , Chair of the CoR COTER commission, President of the Regional Council of Lombardy, Italy Speakers: Jos\u00e9 Luis Pascual Criado , Director of the EGTC Duero-Douro, Spain and Portugal J\u00e1n Feren\u010d\u00e1k , alternate CoR member, Mayor of Ke\u017emarok, Chairman of the Region Zdru\u017eenie (Slovak Republic) and member of the EGTC TATRY Slovak Republic and Poland Peter Nagy , Director of the EGTC Ister-Granum, Hungary and Slovak Republic Alena Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 , policy officer at the European LEADER association for Rural Development More information links: www.cor.europa.eu/egtc www.duero-douro.com www.tatry.pl www.istergranum.hu \u201c30 of the 55 EGTCs registered by the CoR are completely rural, or operate in rural-urban areas.

        "Workshops Places and spaces 106 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline The workshop showcased how promotional banks and municipal funding agencies play an important role in ensuring and maintaining access to finance for investment in national, regional and municipal infrastructure projects across Europe. The Workshop presented the added value of the support provided by public local finance providers and promotional banks via financial instruments for local infrastructure finance, social services, etc., as well as the refinancing of local councils over the capital markets. Main messages and conclusions: From the start of the financial crisis in 2007 until today, national and regional promotional banks across Europe have demonstrated their capacity to respond swiftly to the sharply reduced access to finance. The important role of Promotional banks in helping re-launch the European Economy and jump-starting investment in national, regional and municipal infrastructure projects across Europe was highlighted in the workshop. The European Association of Public Banks and Funding Agencies brought together high-level representatives from four of its member organisations. The panel shared insight, provided an overview of their organisation`s activities and exchanged best practice. The workshop provided a platform for the Public Banks to present their different business models. Each one of these models reflected the distinctive needs of the different regions, municipalities, local markets and SMEs. A lively debate emerged on the need for tailored regulation that considers local features, refuting a one-size-fits-all approach. The Action Plan on Capital Markets Union was also discussed and widely accepted as a welcome initiative. The promotional banks underlined their intention to continue to envisage new areas for cooperation with the Institutions.

How can we stop the population drift towards the cities? How can we raise the value of local products? These are some of the questions we tried to answer, applying a multi-faceted approach which takes into account the diversity of challenges rural areas have to face. Policy-makers with direct experience in the field presented a variety of successful initiatives that have managed to support rural development and improve rural-urban integration. Main messages and conclusions: Kostantinos Bakoyannis : public and private collaboration in the food production chain (Agri-Food Partnership) can be successful in raising the demand for local products, while preserving the environment and the local rural heritage. Giuseppe Pan : thanks to \u201cRurbance\u201d project, a \u2018pact for rural tourism\u2019 has been signed between some municipalities of Verona and the Region, accompanied by an environmental valorisation linking cities and rural areas. Ricardo Rio: for the Municipality of Braga the policies trying to link rural and urban contests are of key importance. Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Luis : new technologies can be used for job creation, tackling the unemployment rate in rural, medium-sized cities. Patrizia Bosich : we need an integrated approach for the development of Istria strengthening the potential of the rural areas, overcoming the coast/inland imbalance. Wojciech Zagula : the Goose Culinary Trail preserves Polish traditions and is dedicated to goose and old- Polish cuisine, as well as to projects centred on goose consumption: gastronomic festivals, culinary maps, competitions and feasts. Tomasz Paluch : we can create the conditions to make living in the countryside more attractive. The inhabitants of villages have a treasure comprising knowledge, adventure, emotions and good fun, based on local resources. Nicoletta Cutolo : the Simbruini Mountains Park has put into effect a strategy for developing sustainable tourism by increasing tourist accommodation capacity, exploiting its nearness to Rome, and various local resources. Stuart Black : the use of social media, complemented by promotional events and its website, is an innovative, efficient and cost-effective model that addresses the difficulties involved in overcoming the scale and diversity of the Highland region. Heidi Ramsvik : Nordland has adopted a local development strategy, providing municipalities with the arguments needed when applying for the funding public area projects. Giovanni Oliva : the regional government ensures equal access to basic services for everyone, the revitalisation of economic activity and access to the external markets. Ben de Reu : local regional products can be important but \u201csouvenirs and traditions\u201d are not enough.

        "Workshops Places and spaces 108 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Following the recent launch of the 2014-2020 European structural and investment funds (ESIF) programmes and on the eve of the Dutch Presidency of the EU (1st semester 2016), which has announced that the Urban agenda will be one of its priorities, two main issues have been debated by regional practitioners and EU decision-makers gathered at the initiative of seven partners - Bjelovar-Bilogora County (HR), Brandenburg & FrankfurtRheinMain (DE), Ile-de-France & Nord-Pas de Calais Region (FR), Randstad Region (NL) and Surrey (UK) - with the active support of PURPLE (Peri-Urban Regions Platform Europe): 1) The ways in which urban-rural integration is happening on the ground and the relevance of EU Cohesion Policy and programmes for peri-urban areas. 2) How best to recognise and understand the importance of the peri- urban dimension in urban-rural links as crucial elements of any future EU Urban agenda. More than 100 attendees representing the public, private and third sectors took part in the event. Main messages and conclusions: The case studies confirmed that it is vital for the EU to pay more specific attention to peri-urban areas. It is not enough to put emphasis on urban-rural linkages. The Commission\u2019s working document on the Urban Agenda stresses \u201cthe role of cities for the development of their surrounding regions\u201d, but several speakers argued that the role of peri- urban areas is key for the development of cities. Many concluded that problems are too often examined from the point of view of urban centres and underplay the key role and contribution of peri-urban areas. The EP resolution on the urban dimension of EU policies stated that \u201csome of the main challenges which cities face can only be tackled through partnerships with their surrounding areas\u201d, but speakers argued that this awareness must be translated into the concrete implementation of EU programmes, stemming from Regional Policy. To involve the people of these regions in European dynamics, we must stop being blind to peri-urban reality.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 109 Outline Tomorrow\u2019s cities face many challenges. The global population is projected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050, citizens expect more from their political leaders and the digital revolution is shaking up traditional thinking. This was the starting point at the EU OPEN DAYS seminar entitled \u2018Cities of the Future: Smart, Connected and Open\u2019 and chaired by Michael Schneider , president of the EPP Group in the European Committee of the Regions. Following a debate on how to better connect Europe\u2019s cities and identify the necessary building blocks to make them sustainable, participants concluded that creativity, convergence and innovation will be essential in turning these challenges into opportunities. Main messages and conclusions: Investment support options for EU cities \u2018European cities face tightening budget constraints at a time of greater investment needs\u2019, Werner Schmidt explained before adding, \u2018The smart response is to develop more adaptive investment strategies, apply innovative technologies and take advantage of new financial instruments.\u2019 This was echoed by Colette Maloney who encouraged participants to make the most of the significant opportunities presented by the 2014-2020 cohesion policy. Changes are happening at an unprecedented speed Despite hearing many definitions of smart cities, one thing was apparent: the rapid changes brought about by digital technologies are forcing local and regional governments to transform the way they think and plan. \u2018What we are about to experience in the next 10 years will have an unprecedented impact on your job, your business and your life\u2019, Bas Boorsma stressed. \u2018We need to find affordable solutions for all cities \u2013 big and small\u2019. Fredrik Kekalainen added, \u2018Cities today are constantly required to cut costs, yet citizens and businesses are demanding better service - new disruptive technology is the key to facilitating this change\u2019. Citizens want to be well connected The contribution of sustainable, urban mobility and transport to city development was highlighted by Ram\u00f3n Luis Valc\u00e1rcel Siso MEP, and Spyros Spyridon . Oph\u00e9lie Durand underlined the importance of keeping citizens at the heart of urban policy development. \u2018A city cannot be smart if it is not people-friendly\u2019 she said. I\u00f1igo de la Serna Hern\u00e1iz also expressed the view that there is still a lot to be done. More work to be done In his closing remarks, Markku Markkula underlined that the debate has only just begun. \u2018To develop cities of the future, Europe needs to foster interaction between universities, civic society, local and international businesses as well as citizens. In the forthcoming Dutch presidency, the focus will be on the renewed Urban Agenda. In this context, a high level event is scheduled for the 30th May 2016 in Amsterdam focusing on smart cities and the integrated development of metropolitan areas in Europe\u2019. The event was followed by the launch of Lambert Van Nistelrooij \u2019s latest book \u2018Cities in the Spotlight\u2019 where he repeated his call for a \u2018Pact of Amsterdam\u2019 on urban policy under the Dutch EU presidency. \u2018After all the well-meaning statements, there is no more time to waste.\u2019 Cities of the future: smart, connected and open 14C12 14 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: European Committee of the Regions, EPP Group Chair/moderator: Dr Michael Schneider , President of the EPP/CoR, Germany Speakers: Werner Schmidt , Director, European Investment Bank, Germany Colette Maloney , Head of Unit, European Commission, Ireland Bas Boorsma , Director Internet of Everything North Europe, Cisco, The Netherlands Ram\u00f3n Luis Valc\u00e1rcel Siso , MEP, Spain Spyros Spyridon , Member of EPP/CoR, Greece Fredrik Kekalainen , CEO, Enevo, Finland Oph\u00e9lie Durand , Policy Officer, AGE Platform Europe, France I\u00f1igo de la Serna Hern\u00e1iz , President, Spanish Network of Smart Cities and EPP/CoR Member, Spain Markku Markkula , President of the European Committee of the Regions, Finland Lambert Van Nistelrooij , MEP, The Netherlands More information links: epp.cor.europa.eu Livre OD2015.indb 109 08/01/2016 15:39 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 110 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Modernisation of small and medium-sized European cities with smart and sustainable measures \u2013 the present challenges and future prospects Outline Two thirds of Europe\u2019s population live in urban areas. Small and medium- size cities can contribute to the economic development of the regions as they can mobilise innovation potential, generate technological development and also play an important role in the concentration of specialised economic activities. They are essential for avoiding rural depopulation, urban drift and promoting balanced territorial development. The event organised on 14 October 2015 at the European Committee of the Regions provided 150 local public authorities, academic institutions and private entities from all over Europe with the opportunity to assess experience related to the urban development policies, to focus on examples of EU cities\u2019 good practice and to collect new ideas for projects to be implemented in 2014-2020 programming period. Main messages and conclusions: Every day one million people move from rural area and small cities to large cities, thus creating new perspectives when addressing the development of small communities. For this reason, small and medium- sized cities require special attention as they must adopt small integrated strategies and come up with smart solutions based on their particular resources and context. Between 2007-2013, Member States had to allocate a minimum of 5% from ERDF to enhance city development. The analysis today reveals that almost 15% were used to address this important objective. For the period 2014-2020, EUR 80 billion have been allocated exclusively for integrated urban development and more than 500 cities are expected to become involved in these measures. Romania has aligned its public efforts and funding allocation with these strategic objectives. For example, for Objective 4 - Transition towards economy with reduced CO2 emissions, EUR 3.5 billion were allocated in Romania and small and medium-sized cities are expected to engage in projects related to energy efficiency, social inclusion or urban regeneration. In this respect, so far 6 553 cities (from 53 countries with 211 million inhabitants) have been involved in the preparation and implementation of 4 900 Sustainable Energy Action Plans. The EU Urban Agenda and the Integrated Covenant of Mayors for Climate Change and Energy represent the main starting points for urban public administrations in terms of the 2020 strategic objectives and targets for sustainable green and inclusive cities. Urban areas play an important role in a country\u2019s development. No country has developed without first having strong and vibrant urban centres. Investment through the Regional Operational Programme 2007- 2013 contributed to the increase in the attractiveness of towns and cities in Romania, enhanced the quality of life of citizens and created jobs. The amount of funding available for small and medium-sized cities at EU level for the 2014-2020 programing period is very generous. European Social Investment Funds will provide support to boost administrative competences in urban areas, enabling administrations to monitor the obligations included in the Partnership Agreements. A new type of thinking, a more inclusive decision-making process and integrated urban planning of resources are needed to achieve long-lasting change. 14C13 14 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: North-East Regional Development Agency Chair/moderator: Ercole Cauti , Director, METRON srl, Italy Speakers: Agnes Lindemans-Maes , Head of Unit Romania, DG REGIO, European Commission Stefan Alexandru Tinca , Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador, Embassy of Romania to the Kingdom of Belgium, Romania Cristian Badescu , Deputy Permanent Representative, Permanent Representation of Romania to the European Union, Romania Frederic Boyer , Head of the Covenant of Mayors, Energy Cities, Belgium Ionut Trinca , Head of the Planning Department, Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration, Romania Irris Flacco , Coordinator of Service, Energy Policy, Air Quality, Department for Public Works, Territorial Planning and Environmental Policy, Abruzzo Region, Italy Dan Florentin Dura , Head of Department for European Integration and Development Strategies, Suceava City Hall, Romania Esteban Pelayo Villarejo , CEO, EURADA - The European Association of Development Agencies, Brussels, Belgium Pietro Elisei , Doctor in Urbanism, Town and Regional Planner, Director of URBASOFIA Bucharest, Vice-President of ISOCARP (the Hague), Romania More information links: http://goo.gl/hEzHTn http://goo.gl/1oXoqL Livre OD2015.indb 110 08/01/2016 15:39 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 111 Models of Multi-Level Governance: the Process of Decentralisation in Countries of Latin America Outline This workshop was organised in the context of the growing cooperation between the European Union (through the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (REGIO) and the national governments of many Latin American countries. The four countries of Latin America represented at this workshop (Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Colombia) had each signed cooperation agreements with the Commission on regional policy. The cooperation involved conferences and seminars to exchange experience and best practice, studies on policy challenges, and exchange visits between Europe and the EU for key regional actors. The themes covered included regional innovation, decentralisation and multi-level governance, cross-border cooperation, urban development, implementation methodologies and capacity building. Following the introductory remarks by the Director-General for Regional and Urban Policy from the Commission, in this workshop a comprehensive picture of developments in each of the four countries was presented by each country in turn. Mexico referred to the challenges of developing a fourth level of government in the country, with new administrative boundaries being drawn. Budgetary resources were increasingly being geographically, as opposed to sectorally, targeted, requiring good inter sectoral coordination. Importantly for regional policy, resources would be multi-annual and targeted at innovation. In Colombia, decentralisation was a major theme with much effort focusing on the fiscal sustainability of regions and municipalities. It was emphasised that the major obstacles were not scarcity of resources, but administrative capacity constraints. In Chile, decentralisation was a priority of the current government, and new provisions were being introduced to underpin regional autonomy. Challenges existed owing to the absence of regional critical mass for efficiency, fragmentation of capacities and duplication of efforts in the multi-level governance system. In Brazil, the Federation\u2019s political and administrative organisation includes the Union, states, the Federal District and municipalities, all autonomous, under the Constitution. Attention was drawn to \u201cpublic consortiums\u201d, which are partnerships formed by two or more federal entities to achieve goals of mutual interest. Main messages and conclusions: The workshop touched on the key themes in the decentralisation process and its relationship with regional policy. Regionalisation: this is an important trend in a number of Latin American countries, one which we have also seen over a longer period in Europe with different forms of deconcentration, decentralisation and devolution. An important lesson from the European experience is that unless regionalisation is constitutionally secured, it may be subject to political reversal. Up until the crisis in Europe, there had been a process of increasing regionalisation over a 20-year period, at times promoted by European Union policies. With the onset of the crisis, however, some regional structures were negatively affected by cuts in public expenditure and different political positions on regionalisation: in the United Kingdom (in England), for instance, regional development agencies, regional government offices, regional strategies, etc. were all abolished; the regional level in economic development also disappeared in the Netherlands. Geographically-targeted policymaking: the references to \u2018new geographies\u2019 of governance and economic development in Latin America are interesting. The essence of the approach is that the boundaries and geographies of intervention should be determined by the nature of the problem and the optimal policy response, rather than by administrative boundaries. We can see some examples at local level in France and the United Kingdom (again in England), where governments have supported new geographical approaches to addressing local development challenges; city regions have been used for some regional policy initiatives in Finland and Sweden; and the EU is supporting integrated territorial development in urban areas. However, probably the most successful examples of new geographies are in the field of European territorial cooperation, where the EU is now in the fifth generation of \u201cInterreg\u201d cross-border and transnational cooperation programmes. 14C14 14 October 2015 14:30-17:30 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG REGIO Chair/moderator: Dr Ronald Hall Speakers: Walter Deffaa , Director General, DG REGIO, European Commission Luisa Bibiana Rubio Villamil , Financiera de Desarrollo Territorial S.A. \u2013 FINDETER, Colombia Alejandro Nieto Enr\u00edquez , Asesor de la Secretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Agrario, Territorial y Urbano, Mexico Claudio Maggi Campos , Gerente de Desarrollo Competitivo, CORFO, Chile Paula Ravanelli Losada , Assessora Especial, Brazil Discussant: Prof. John Bachtler , EPRC, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK Livre OD2015.indb 111 08/01/2016 15:39 ",

A range of institutional coordination mechanisms have been tried out in different European countries, with mixed success. It is interesting to note that, in contrast with so-called \u201chard coordination\u201d (such as legal obligations to get institutions to work together, new organisational structures, etc.), there have been some positive experiences with \u201csoft coordination\u201d mechanisms seeking to encourage collaboration and coordination by facilitating dialogue, exchange of experience and knowledge flows. Examples include the \u00d6ROK \u2013 Standing Conference on Spatial Development (Austria), regio- suisse (Switzerland) and knowledge platforms (Austria). Conditionalities: several speakers noted the difficulty of encouraging subnational levels of government to address national objectives for regional development. This is a classic problem in multi-level governance systems, which political scientists refer to as the \u201cprincipal-agent problem\u201d \u2013 how to ensure, in a national context, that the agent (subnational level) complies with the requirements of the principal (national level) in return for funding, and avoid \u201cagency drift\u201d or \u201cslippage\u201d. In an EU context, the key relationship is between the EU and national levels and has seen the EU introduce an increasing range of \u2018conditionalities\u2019 to encourage Member State compliance with EU policy priorities and implementation rules. However, the lesson from the development policy field in poorer countries is that conditionalities can be counterproductive, particularly where they are seen to be imposed and there is a lack of \u201cownership\u201d at lower levels. Capacity: there are reforms of local government underway in a number of Latin American countries. This is also happening in Europe, where we are experiencing the biggest wave of local government reform in over 50 years, mostly to rationalise the number of local authority units to improve capacity and ensure greater synergies, as well as to reduce public expenditure. The issue of capacity-building is particularly important, as research has shown how far effective economic development depends on the capacity (structures, skills, tools, etc.) of the organisations that are implementing interventions. Capacity-building is a major priority for the EU in the 2014-20 programmes, particularly in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, where the performance of cohesion policy is thought to have been weakened historically because of inadequacies in administrative capacity at different levels.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 113 Cross-border urban integration: European groupings of territorial cooperation in twin cities and cross-border agglomerations Outline The workshop focused on how EU regional programmes could promote more balanced territorial development in rural or rural-urban contexts. The special challenge posed by border cities and border rural hinterlands was addressed under this theme. Most of the EGTCs devised a development strategy for their territory. Examples of groupings working in the context of border cities were presented. Regional and cross-border programmes may be used to develop twin cities or urban-rural areas. DG Regio and Mission Op\u00e9rationnelle Transfrontali\u00e8re also presented tools available to border cities: the URBACT project \u2018Expertising governance in transfrontier conurbations\u2019 and tools for governing border cities and agglomerations. Main messages and conclusions: The research carried out by Mission Operationnelle Transfrontali\u00e8re shows that there are different kinds of cross- border urban areas, e.g. small or big twin cities, metropolitan areas, polycentric regions. Integrated territorial investment (ITI) has the potential to be one of tools for improving the development of urban areas, however, in practice it appears to be complicated in the case of cross-border areas (due to the complexity of the instrument, mistrust and challenges associated with internal communication between different managing authorities). It would appear that some Member States are afraid of cities and therefore limit the power that could be delegated to them. However, the more ITIs are established, the better the experience will be on the ground. According to the EC, most of ITIs planned so far at national or regional level are quite simple, combining the priority areas of one operational programme only. Likewise, the first cross-border ITI established by EGTC GO on the Slovenia-Italy border proves that such collaboration is possible, even among cities which were separated by history, and that a key factor here is trust. It would be very beneficial for urban areas to benefit from Interreg and also regional programmes in a given ITI. Such cooperation would not only demonstrate an integrated and sustainable approach to development but would also provide financial support for good strategies and required action. ITI and EGTC need successful stories to be shared, as this will help create more interest and develop the support of stakeholders and decision-makers. 14C15 14 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG REGIO Chair/moderator: Dirk Peters , Senior Expert/Senior Specialist, DG REGIO, European Commission Speakers: Martijn De Bruijn , Policy Officer, European Commission Jean Peyrony , Director General, Mission Op\u00e9rationnelle Transfrontali\u00e8re, France Sandra Sodini , Director, EGTC GO, Italy Peter Nagy , Director, Ister-Granum EGTC, Hungary S\u00f6ren Bollmann , Head of Frankfurt-Slubice Cooperation Center, City of Frankfurt (Oder), Germany Pablo Rivera B\u00faa , Director\u2019s Cabinet, Eurocidade Chaves-Ver\u00edn EGTC, Spain Livre OD2015.indb 113 08/01/2016 15:39 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 114 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline The workshop tried establish the state of play of cross-border statistical data across the EU in relation to cross- border cooperation programmes on the one hand, and knowledge of border regions on the other. The overview concluded that there were many gaps in cross-border data. For example, only a few countries kept data on cross-border workers, although this had a major impact on the border population (need for information on taxation or social security, price of real estate, etc). A pilot project run by the University of Paris Diderot showed the outline of a typology of border regions, Sweden and Denmark demonstrated their common statistical portal for the Oeresund region, and Dutch Statistics outlined a possible future project on shared data. Main messages and conclusions: The main conclusion is that there is a very big gap in terms of border data. Hardly any cross-border flows are measured by statistics offices (be it in terms of labour mobility or transport for instance). However, policy- making requires that border regions be better observed and that flows across borders be better measured. High labour mobility for instance leads to specific phenomena such as changes in prices in real estates, and the need for increased cross-border public transport. These cannot be taken into account by local decision- makers if they do not appear clearly. The typography of border regions project also highlighted the fact that opportunities for socio-economic development can be missed through lack of data. On some borders for instance, demographical trends show that there are opportunities for both sides of a border (e.g. an ageing population on one side and a young population on the other side, looking for employment opportunities). The existence of a common statistical portal between Denmark and Sweden over the Oeresund region has helped local politicians make informed decisions in terms of transport or social services. The national statistics office of the Netherlands has also concluded that it needs to develop stronger working relationships with neighbouring countries to be able to measure cross-border effects on Dutch regions and municipalities located close to borders. The audience confirmed all the findings and there were many calls for the European Commission to take a lead in this and to try to develop compatible standards for data collection and definitions for data sets.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 115 Addressing health inequalities to promote growth and social cohesion in deprived areas Outline DG SANTE\u2019s objective for this workshop was to discuss the role of reducing health inequalities in vulnerable urban and rural areas, especially those related to lifestyles and nutrition and physical activity, for the promotion of growth and the improvement of social cohesion. By investing in health and reducing inequalities in terms of lifestyle, health status and access to healthcare, regions may significantly contribute to their development and to enhancing social cohesion. In fact, targeted investment in health can contribute to sustainable regional development. Participants received an overview of how Member States have planned to tackle health inequalities using European Structural and Investment Funds and learned about a Slovak project establishing Centres of integrated healthcare. Main messages and conclusions: Mr Wismar highlighted that during the past two decades, socioeconomic inequalities in health have increasingly been recognised as an important public health issue throughout Europe. The results of a recent analysis show that the economic impact of socioeconomic inequalities in health is likely to be substantial. When looking at the health-related costs of socio-economic inequalities, the loss of productivity in the EU due to inequalities is 1.4% GDP (141 billion). Investing in the development of policies and plans in the health area is of utmost importance. He used the concept of \u201cwindow of opportunities\u201d, meaning making the use of existing possibilities to shape the policy-making process. Mr B\u00fccherl emphasis that targeted investment in health can contribute to sustainable regional development. The European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) can play a major role in reducing health inequalities. In 2014-2020, health investment as foreseen in the ESIF Operational Programmes are focused on a wide range of topics, including several which contribute to reducing health inequalities, such as: deinstitutionalisation and community-based care, improving access and quality of health care services, health promotion and disease prevention, education of medical staff or e-health. The assessment of the actual ESIF contribution to reducing health inequalities will be possible only during and after the implementation of concrete projects. An example of such a concrete ESIF project for health was presented by Mr Kr\u00e1lik from Slovakia. The project plans to establish up to 130 Integrated Care Centres. As expected outcome, they will guarantee the integration of healthcare, health promotion and social care. Moreover, they will foster a behavioural change, towards more proactivity, productivity, networking and cooperation in health and social services and will have an economic impact as well, creating more business for local SMEs. The steering role of the European Commission during the negotiation process and requirements imposed by ESIF regulations bring added value and allow the investment measures to be guided. Mr Seychell , who was chairing and moderating the session, concluded that considerable progress has been made in the field of health, yet Member States should continue to be active in looking for possibilities for further development and investment contributing to the reduction of health inequalities in Europe. 14C17 14 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG SANTE Chair/moderator: Martin Seychell , Deputy Director General for Health responsible for Directorates C and D, DG SANTE, European Commission Speakers: Matthias Wismar , Senior Health Policy Analyst, Health Systems Observatory, Belgium Wolfgang B\u00fccherl , Team Leader, DG SANTE D1 Unit, European Commission J\u00e1n Kr\u00e1lik , Slovak Ministry of Health, Institute of Health Policy, Slovak Republic More information links: www.esifforhealth.eu/ Livre OD2015.indb 115 08/01/2016 15:40 ",
        "Workshops Places and spaces 116 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline The workshop focused on social innovation in urban and rural communities, which face considerable challenges in the post-crash economy. These challenges are social, economic and environmental in nature. How can local economy stakeholders sustain and create jobs? What can \u201csmart\u201d solutions offer? How can we initiate progressive practices and sustain ecological lifestyles while acting locally? This workshop presented the context and two case studies that display social innovation undertaken in Europe. Main messages and conclusions: One of the main messages on which the workshop focused was the importance of Innovation. In the speakers\u2019 opinion, Innovation was essential for the construction and survival of rural and urban areas. To this end, another important factor was necessary: sufficient space. In general, the perfect place to facilitate innovation was in Green Spaces: in fact, they had an important role and great value in our society. Once enough space was found, specific spatial planning was needed to coordinate all the projects in the best way possible. Commitment from possible stakeholders was very important in this phase, because they needed to address planning responsibilities. All speakers highlighted how necessary cooperation was between national, local, political and civic levels for reaching pre-determined goals and for the common good. In conclusion, Innovation in rural and urban communities was extremely relevant because it could be create social, ecological and economic models.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 117 Partnership \u2013 the key to successful urban development Outline This workshop looked at the cases of Glasgow and Vilnius. Although the two cities have a very different socio-economic background, their major projects clearly demonstrate their commitment to innovative and sustainable urban development based on a broad partnership. The objective of the workshop was to examine the potential opportunities and challenges faced by the cities and how these are determined by their location. It also aimed to identify the various stakeholders and their roles, as well as how dialogue between them works and how it could be fostered in order to contribute to better urban development. Main messages and conclusions: On 15 October 2015, the ECO section of the EESC organised a workshop under the title \u2018Partnership \u2013 the key to successful urban development\u2019 in the course of the Open Days 2015. The workshop, chaired by Joost van Iersel , president of the ECO section, looked at the cases of Glasgow and Vilnius. The four guest speakers represented a wide variety of organisations involved in urban development. Daniela Patti , managing director of Eutropian GmbH, presented several local projects which run in multiple cities, from Berlin to Athens. She highlighted that community projects were very popular at times when municipalities face financial difficulties, as is the case today. It is however important to recognise the added value of communities, even in cases where municipalities have no difficulties providing services. Vyl\u016bn\u0117 Urbonien\u0117 , deputy chief executive director of the Vilnius City Municipality, introduced their complex socio-economic development programmes with a specific focus on private-public partnerships. Project manager Les Rice presented the mission of Urban Roots, a Scottish community-led organisation working together with locals for the environment and the health of the area they live in. In his presentation he stressed the importance of sustainability. Finally, Gintaras Valu\u0161is , director of the Center for Physical Sciences and Technology in Vilnius, gave an overview of how a new and highly developed research centre has the potential to turn Vilnius into one of the most innovative cities in Europe. This workshop proved once again how partnerships between cities, governments, academics and private actors, often across borders, have the potential to play an important role in urban development. It is therefore of the utmost importance to properly identify the stakeholders and their possible added value and to maintain on-going interaction. 15C02 15 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) Chair/moderator: Joost van Iersel , President of the ECO section, EESC Speakers: Daniela Patti , Managing Director, Eutropian GmbH, Austria Vyl\u016bn\u0117 Urbonien\u0117 , Deputy Chief Executive Director, Vilnius City Municipality, Lithuania Les Rice , Project Manager, Urban Roots, UK Gintaras Valu\u0161is , Director, Center for Physical Sciences and Technology, Lithuania More information links: www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal. en.events-and-activities-urban- development-partnership http://www.eesc.europa. eu/?i=portal.en.eco-section- activities-members.37309 Livre OD2015.indb 117 08/01/2016 15:40 ",

Different players and stakeholders showcased successful players and good practice in cross-border development with regards to multilevel governance, funding, and common development strategies. Main messages and conclusions: In her introduction, Marie-Jos\u00e9e Vidal outlined the common umbrella theme of small and medium-sized cities that the IT-LV-LU Trio Presidency adopted in the field of urban policy. The focus of the Luxembourgish Presidency was on small and medium-sized cities in cross-border polycentric regions and the challenge of \u2018critical mass\u2019. She explained the concept of cross-border polycentric regions and presented the proposals for targeted measures by the Luxembourgish Presidency. Dr. Antoine Decoville presented an overview of the recent LISER study on \u2018Opportunities for cross-border cooperation between small and medium cities in Europe\u2019, where he focused on the challenges of cross-border cooperation and the factors that can influence cross-border integration. These factors included belonging to a transnational space and a history of cooperation, spatial configurations of cities in the border regions, cross- border governance structure, and a feeling of sharing a common living area across borders. Petra Schelkman showcased the Greater Region as an example of a cross-border polycentric region. After illustrating the institutional setting and the multi-level governance structure, she outlined the institutional, functional, and structural approaches to cross-border cooperation from the perspective of the German State of Rhineland-Palatinate. S\u00f6ren Bollmann presented the case study of the European Twin City Frankfurt & S\u0142ubice with a focus on the cross-border governance structure, the goals and projects of the joint Frankfurt-S\u0142ubice Action Plan 2010-2020, and good practice regarding Interreg IV-A funding. He concluded by drawing attention to the obstacles that the Twin City was still facing and presented upcoming projects. Petri Suopanki presented the example of the Twin City Haparanda-Tornio and the governance structure of the Provincia Bothniensis. He explained how the historical and cultural context still shaped cross-border cooperation and gave an overview of concrete obstacles to cross-border integration. His conclusion focused on the need to be pro-active and the need for benchmarking as well as an exchange of experience among cross-border polycentric regions. The ensuing debate and interaction with the audience turned on the involvement of civil society to foster a common identity, the usefulness of tools such as Interreg and the EGTC, and the need for geographical flexibility.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 119 Copernicus and the Urban Atlas: Measuring cities and their qualities Outline The workshop was opened by Lewis Dijkstra who started by welcoming the participants. The workshop highlighted Copernicus\u2019 potential in providing handy tools to support spatial planning or public safety on a local, regional and European scale. Real-world applications from cities were shown on how the Urban Atlas was used to detect building footprints, land-use changes, urban sprawl, forest and urban green areas in decline, high urban densities, public transport and climate change in a pan-European comparable mode. Examples were presented on the use of the urban atlas to assist decision-makers in assessing access to public transport and green areas, allocate resources to ensure the greatest impact and understand the impact of a policy decision on different categories of population. Main messages and conclusions: The Copernicus land monitoring service provides information on land cover/land use, vegetation state and the water cycle. Its local component, the Urban Atlas, provides reliable, inter-comparable, high resolution land-use maps of over 800 European cities and their surroundings for the reference year 2012 (for a large number of these cities for 2006 as well). This allows us to compare land use between cities and over time. The Urban Atlas allows users to see precisely how the boundaries of urban areas are shifting, and to understand how the land use is changing. The main messages were: - The Urban Atlas is a suitable framework for Europe-wide cross-thematic analysis inside urban areas with a detailed and harmonised spatial resolution; - There are opportunities for linking Urban Atlas data with statistics collected at infra-urban scale (e.g. census tracts, output areas, etc.) and - Opportunities for combinations with other datasets to go beyond the land use / land cover themes; - The Urban Atlas supports the standardisation and homogenisation of scientific spatial products at local scale in cities; - Several applications related to urban dynamics and environmental quality have been supported, while other applications are under development (i.e. European urban albedo study); - The Urban Atlas has also the potential to support the monitoring and evaluation of the local level implementation of climate change mitigation technologies (i.e. green roofs, cool material); - It can also support the development of EO-based services. The chairperson/moderator concluded the workshop by leaving the floor to the audience. Reactions underlined the following aspects: - Some participants expressed the need to build up the capacity of National Statistic Institutes. - The majority of participants concluded that the programme and its outputs were very useful for their work as local consultants, decision-makers etc. 15C04 15 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG REGIO Chair/moderator: Lewis Dijkstra , Deputy Head of Unit, DG REGIO, European Commission Speakers: Catharina Bamps , Policy officer, DG Grow, European Commission Carlo Lavale , Scientific officer, JRC, European Commission Nektarios Chrissoulakis , Research Director, Foundation for Research and Technology (FORTH), Greece More information links: Copernicus - The European Earth Observation Programme http://copernicus.eu/main/ data-access http://land.copernicus.eu/local/ urban-atlas/view Mapping Human Settlements from Space www.youtube.com/ watch?v=1rPHJ6WZt8s www.eea.europa.eu/data-and- maps/explore-interactive-maps/ urban-atlas-for-europe http://land.copernicus.eu/pan- european/GHSL Livre OD2015.indb 119 08/01/2016 15:40 ",

The key-note speech demonstrated the usefulness of the Atlas for policy-makers at all administrative levels for understanding and defining the most efficient investment for regions, cities and/or larger territories and for pursuing tailor-made, place-based policies. The workshop also featured the latest Tools developed by ESPON, such as BSR-TeMo and Territorial Impact Assessments. Main messages and conclusions: Through the maps and main messages from the ESPON Atlas \u201cMapping European Territorial Structures and Dynamics\u201d, in his presentation Volker Schmidt-Seiwert gave a comprehensive overview of the multitude of themes that have been addressed by all applied research projects and targeted analyses conducted by the ESPON 2013 Programme. The main policy messages particularly useful for efficient investment in individual regions, cities and/or larger territories and for pursuing tailor-made, place-based policies can be summarised as follows: \u2022 Metropolitan areas are the heavyweights in national economies, but in some countries growth appears more spread out over several cities than in others; \u2022 Rural areas are not necessarily the losers in population development in all countries, in particular when located in the vicinity of cities; in some countries, second-tier metro regions and cities should have more attention; \u2022 Not only is the southern part of the continent lagging behind its former economic power, but also other regions in Europe are still seeking to attain their former economic strength; \u2022 In some countries, the crisis has led to obvious changes in the labour market. The decoupling of economic and employment development affects the industrial sector in particular; \u2022 A majority of land changes entail extensification related to agricultural and forest changes; \u2022 In general urban growth comes mostly at the expense of agricultural land, but in Eastern Europe many urban development is on land where previously there were forests. The audience appreciated the brief overview of the situation, trends and perspectives for Europe, as well as the opportunity that the Atlas offers for comparison with other regions and cities, and by doing so its contribution to an understanding of Europe\u2019s territorial diversity of potential and challenges. The presentation of the ESPON tool box proved to be of particular interest and generated a lively discussion. The ESPON Tool box was seen as a handy instrument for policy-makers and practitioners, enabling them to find and analyse pan-European data and indicators, and to draw maps. Within the ESPON 2020 Programme, the toolbox shall be further developed into an integrated, reliable and up- to-date tool box, coordinated with other institutions, such as ESTAT, EEA, JRC, EIB, and with direct user support in terms of technical queries and help with the practical use of tools.

        "Workshops Places and spaces OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 121 Innovative strategies for historical challenges: rural and urban integration policies, from theory to practice. Outline The Commission sees reinforcing urban-rural linkages as an important part of providing job opportunities and services to Europeans and of strengthening territorial cohesion. The purpose of the debate was to inspire regional authorities and stakeholders to reflect on the urban-rural potential in their area and to develop concrete project ideas that could be supported by the ESI funds. Institutional players involved in promoting urban-rural linkages, i.e. the Commission, European Parliament and OECD, discussed with European Regions how this had been done in practice. Main messages and conclusions: The OECD explained that data suggested that good urban-rural governance had many economic, social and environmental benefits. In OECD countries, on average, almost 80% of rural inhabitants lived close to an urban area and economic growth in the last decade was highest in rural regions close to cities. As part of the RURBAN preparatory action and based on case studies, the OECD had developed typologies for this type of governance. The Commission added that the current programming period demanded specific attention for urban-rural linkages and included territorial tools that were well suited to support such links. A recent survey of Commission desk officers learned that many Member States and regions indeed used these tools for the purpose of promoting urban-rural partnerships. However, some Member States did not appear to pay particular attention to this. Local authorities like the Province of Zeeland argued that a strict definition of city or rural no longer reflected reality and could actually hamper cooperation. It was more important to define common objectives that were achieved in partnership. Such partnerships needed: 1) an awareness of the interdependency of rural and urban areas in a given area; 2) a membership mix that included the relevant rural and urban representatives; 3) the development of initiatives aimed at yielding collective benefits to urban and rural partners; and 4) an organisational form suitable for facilitating the achievement of partnership objectives. One successful example of this was public and private cooperation in the food production chain (Agri-Food Partnership) in Sterea Ellada \u2013 Greece, which raised the demand for local products, while preserving the environment and local rural heritage. Another example was the \u201cRurbance\u201d project. Thanks to the project, a \u2018pact for rural tourism\u2019 had been signed between several municipalities in Verona and the Veneto Region - Italy, accompanied by an environmental valorisation linking cities and rural areas. Other innovative fields that could also be explored to facilitate those inter-linkages, using ESI funding, were digital health and health care delivery. This had been developed in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland out of the need for providing health care to rural and remote populations. An innovative and blooming health science cluster had developed around it, propelling the creation of structures of excellence in research and learning as part of the University of the Highlands and Islands. 15C06 15 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG REGIO / DG AGRI in collaboration with the partnership \u201cEurope of Traditions\u201d Chair/moderator: Olbrycht Jan , Member of the European Parliament, member of the Committee on Regional Development Speakers: Veneri Paolo , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, author of various publications on the theme of urban and regional development and contributor to the drafting of the RURBAN preparatory action Haapakka Merja , European Commission, DG REGIO Kostantinos Bakoyannis , President of the Sterea Ellada Region, Greece Giuseppe Pan , Regional Minister of Agriculture, Veneto Region, Italy Annemiek Jetten , Mayor of the city of Sluis, Province of Zeeland, The Netherlands MacRury Sandra , Professor of Clinical Diabetes, Department of Diabetes and Cardiovascular Science, University of the Highlands and Islands, Scotland, UK Livre OD2015.indb 121 08/01/2016 15:40 ",

In this regard, REGI and COTER members expressed their concerns that the involvement of local and regional authorities in drawing up the partnership agreements and operational programmes did not amount to full partnership in all Member States, as outlined in the European Code of Conduct on partnership, and called on the European Commission to closely monitor the application of the partnership principle in the implementation of the partnership agreements and operational programmes in Member States; \u2022 welcomed the establishment of the High Level Group of Independent Experts on Monitoring Simplification for Beneficiaries of the European Structural and Investment Funds by the European Commission and emphasised the need to further simplify rules and reduce the administrative burden on both beneficiaries and public authorities alongside the whole cohesion policy implementation process, in light of the increased complexity of cohesion policy implementation at local and regional level; \u2022 highlighted the major challenges that local and regional authorities face in view of the current refugee crisis. In this regard, REGI and COTER members underlined multi-level governance as the most appropriate means of generating the necessary mix of measures and initiatives and called for greater flexibility in the use of the European Structural and Investment Funds, in order to allow cities and regions to mobilise regional policy in dealing with the refugees crisis; \u2022 expressed their readiness to contribute to the political debate on measuring progress in territorial development using indicators other than GDP, by helping to define a method which also takes into account other indicators for well-being and sustainable development; \u2022 underlined the need to join forces and to work closely together towards the EU Urban Agenda and the envisaged Pact of Amsterdam, in order to accelerate the setting and implementation of an EU Urban Agenda, while reinforcing the role of the regions and cities in the EU legislative process. To this end, REGI and COTER members agreed to draw up a joint statement on REGI-COTER cooperation towards the Pact of Amsterdam. 13E03 13 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Committee of the Regions Chair/moderator: Raffaele Cattaneo , Chair of the COTER commission, European Committee of the Regions, and Iskra Mihaylova , Chair of the REGI committee, European Parliament Speakers: Corina Cre\u0163u , Commissioner for Regional Policy, European Commission More information links: http://cor.europa.eu Joint REGI-COTER meeting on \u2018Investing in partnership: how to best use the reformed Cohesion policy 2014-2020 for creating growth and jobs in Europe\u2019s regions\u2019 Livre OD2015.indb 124 08/01/2016 15:40 ",

In line with the widely discussed EU Urban Agenda and the CITIES Forum organised for the second time by the European Commission\u2019s Regional and Urban Policy DG in June 2015, it was the perfect occasion for urban stakeholders at local, national and European level to debate and network about future challenges for European cities. To get participants inspired, a series of events and interactive workshops were organised in various buildings in the Brussels \u201cCanal Area\u201d, a large urban renewal initiative. The Canal Area is the historical heart and former industrial zone of Brussels and is a strategic lever for development for the European capital. The industrial zone, which is undergoing transformation, offers many opportunities for investment, innovation and ambitious projects in all fields: housing, business, hotels and restaurants, shops, culture, etc. The Brussels authorities have increased investments to provide a favourable environment for residents, businesses and visitors, with the support of the European Structural and Investment Funds. Debating, exploring and learning through interac- tive workshops on urban issues and visits to key urban projects The OPEN Urban DAY was about debating and networking during the workshops held in three buildings \u2013 reports available on the following pages \u2013 as well as exploring, understanding and learning.Participants had the opportunity to visit the following projects, examples of good practices for tackling challenges faced by urban areas across Europe: Abattoir, a socio-economic project In 2009, ambitious plans were drawn up to revitalise market and commercial activities on the site of the Brussels Abattoir. In May 2015, this led to the opening of the FOODMET, a modern food hall. An urban aquaponic farm (a combination of fish farming and fruit and vegetable production) will be installed on the hall\u2019s roof. Participants had the opportunity for a guided tour of the food hall, as well as an in-depth presentation of the ERDF project, which also focuses on social integration in the neighbourhood. Future developments, which will receive 2014-2020 ERDF funds, were also discussed and debated. Recy K & the Vandenbranden eco-friendly building Participants were shown around one of the model buildings in Brussels built according to the passive house concept. They visited and received information about Recy K . This project, which is coordinated by the regional agency for cleanliness, will provide facilities for collecting and reusing certain types of waste such as computers and household appliances. Once the centre is operational, it will create between 45 and 77 jobs and provide training opportunities for job-seekers in Brussels. Livre OD2015.indb 126 08/01/2016 15:40 ",

AJJA offers social support to newcomers, while Atelier Groot Eiland is an association for social employment and training, targeting the low-skilled, long-term unemployed. In Belle-Vue, an energy efficient building, training sessions are organised in the hospitality and culinary arts as well as tourism, in a training hotel created for this purpose. Discovering the Canal Area by boat People taking the boat tour had the opportunity to become more familiar with the Canal Area and its port. After an introduction on the use of ERDF funds in this part of Brussels, a representative from the Brussels Agency for Territorial Development provided further information about the development of the Canal Area as well as the agency\u2019s activities, which are helping to improve the image of this part of town. European projects designed to stimulate the development of the Brussels port were also discussed. During the boat tour itself, information was provided about the Brussels port\u2019s activities, with further explanations about a number of development projects. The BEL, an eco-friendly building The new administrative headquarters of Brussels Environment on the Tour & Taxis site is also one of the largest office and activity buildings in Europe to meet the passive standard.

        "OPEN urban DAY 128 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Sustainable chemicals production as an example of the circular economy \u2013 a contribution to the reindustrialisation of EU regions and municipalities Outline Eric Liegeois welcomed the speakers and audience and outlined the content of the workshop: the circular economy is about environmental protection and sustainability, as well as creating opportunities and modernising industry. Sustainable chemicals production is the best example of how to enable the use of alternatives to fossil-based chemicals by promoting an efficient use of resources and facilitating business in the circular economy. However, it should be realised that the transition towards a circular economy calls for systemic changes. Local authorities play a key role by providing a favourable business environment and the necessary political acceptance of sustainable chemicals production. Building chemicals production on domestically available resources, such as municipal waste or biomass, offers new opportunities particularly for rural regions as well as for municipalities and regions in industrial decline. Investors and entrepreneurs are eager to create new businesses using domestic resources and experiences are flourishing in Europe in the field of sustainable chemicals. Financial support to private investments in water management facilities to recover phosphorous, produce biogas and fertilisers from manure and food waste, produce articles from plastic waste, and many other examples of the circular economy may be expected under the European Fund for Strategic Investment as established by the Commission communication An investment Plan for Europe. The experience of Micha Hes (Director of the Port of Amsterdam), Cristina Monge (Plastival cluster), Rob de Ruiter (EcoPhos) and Laura Piovesan (Director of the Innovation Division in the European Investment Bank) was presented, followed by a debate on how cooperation and public strategies can attract investment related to sustainable chemicals production. Eric Liegeois informed participants about the call for expressions of interest that DG GROW had launched. That call is addressed to regional organisations interested in developing ambitious strategies to support sustainable chemicals production in their area. More information is available on the DG GROW web site: http://ec.europa. eu/growth/sectors/chemicals/index_en.htm Main messages and conclusions: Micha Hes presented the experience of the Port of Amsterdam: the Port of Amsterdam has a vision to become an international hub with three main axes. Firstly, as an international hub for logistics and energy. Secondly, to be a base for maritime and tourism services and, thirdly, to attract industrial activities based on the circular economy. The Port of Amsterdam as an authority has the role of providing locations and conditions for business, facilitating transport and shipment and providing a grid network and infrastructure. At the same time, it provides clustering services for businesses, supplies steam, hydrogen and feedstocks and participates in the financing of investments in its facilities. Micha informed participants about two specific cases in the Port of Amsterdam. GreenMills delivers biodiesel, glycerol, electricity, biogas, steam, district heating, bio-NPK fertilisers, limonene and medium chain fatty acids after processing secondary raw materials such as used cooking oil, animal fat, organic waste and expired food. Also, the cooperation between AEB Amsterdam and Waternet, with the support of the port, has led to higher value products, including fertilisers made out of sewage sludge. The AEB/Waternet cluster delivers electricity, biogas, steam, district heating, struvite, proteins, metals and plastics after the treatment of sewage sludge and other municipal solid waste. 14URB01 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG GROW Chair/moderator: Eric Liegeois , Policy officer, DG GROW, European Commission Speakers: Micha Hes , Director of the Port of Amsterdam Cristina Monge , Plastival cluster Rob de Ruiter , Adviser, EcoPhos and Laura Piovesan , Director of the Innovation Division in the European Investment Bank Livre OD2015.indb 128 08/01/2016 15:40 ",
        "OPEN urban DAY OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 129 Micha Hes concluded by saying that the Port of Amsterdam is part of the TEN-T core network. Next to being a global hub, the port sees opportunities in becoming a more metropolitan port with recycling waste streams in the port where a circular process industry is already present. By creating clusters to further develop high value products from waste streams, integrating existing industries and giving room to start-up technologies, the Amsterdam port will be able to further develop as a circular hub. The port sees a vital new role, in addition to being a landlord and a matchmaker as the co-creator in creating clusters. For instance, by pre-investing in infrastructure and new technologies. The aim is to remain an important hub for energy and manufacturing. Cristina Monge presented her views on plastic recycling starting with the difficulties that exist in this activity such as a lack of knowledge about the recycling chain and the bad public image of plastic as a material, as well as the difficulties in communicating a kind of \u201cgreen-logic\u201d that makes sense to the man on the street. Recycling has a cost which sometimes is not competitive; marketing and a product differentiation strategy are essential; as recycling material quality varies, the best solution must be found for different applications; the selection process needs to be improved as it is the key to ensuring an efficient plastic recycling chain. Finally, she mentioned the need for awareness of bioplastics and multilayer products as regards mixing them with other plastics and its impact on the recycling chain. She elaborated on ideas as to how to promote plastic recycling, for instance preventing the disposal of waste products by establishing limitations through regulation, improving the selection and segregation processes as a public responsibility or pushing the use of recycling materials that create a business interest to use those materials. She also outlined ideas on how to create an eco-atmosphere that helps the producer to be market oriented to eco solutions, or to support great projects as examples in mind to make it real. As for the regional aspect, she felt that the Valencia Region could present opportunities for investment in plastic recycling given that Valencia is the main plastic recycling region in Spain; it is the main plastic convertor region with more than 20% of the national industry; the synergies between convertors and recyclers gathered in the same area make it the most profitable location to invest in and develop the plastic recycling industry; and the cost location and its excellent infrastructure (Mediterranean Corridor) create the appropriate conditions to further develop this industrial activity. She concluded with a number of suggestions to public (local or regional) authorities on promoting and facilitating the recycler and convertor industry, as well as to national and European authorities: support the regulation aimed at zero waste in landfill, promote the public purchase of products made from recycled materials, finance big projects to improve and install new sorting and selection plants, support and push the big projects oriented to recycled applications in massive products or long term ones and push a crucial and highly advantageous area as an example of excellence in the plastic recycling chain. Rob de Ruiter presented the Ecophos investment project in Dunkirk. Rob explained how phosphorus is essential for life. It is in our bones, in our DNA, in our energy cycle. Phosphorus is essential for growing crops and for animal feed, in other words, essential for the world\u2019s food supply. It is a one of the essential elements in fertilisers. A world without fertilisers can feed only 1 to 2 billion people. Phosphate rock of high quality, which is necessary for conventional processes to produce fertilisers is depleting and is found in North Africa, from Morocco to Syria. On the other hand, phosphorus is an element and will never disappear. Via today\u2019s linear value chain, phosphorus ends up in oceans and landfills, unavailable for recycling or upcycling! We have a phosphorus management problem; we throw away an element that is essential for life! From 2018 onwards, in their new Dunkirk plant, Ecophos will produce market known products out of sewage sludge ash from the Netherlands. The Ecophos products will be of the same quality as or better than their counterparts derived from primary sources (phosphate rock). The reason for that is the unique Ecophos process that has been developed \u201cin-house\u201d with Ecophos\u2019s own financial resources (around EUR 35 million). This enables the industrial production of fertilisers and animal feed out of low grade natural rock and/or P-containing waste like mono-incinerated sewage sludge ashes.

        "130 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Rob explained that companies that develop a process to serve the circular economy should not be punished with additional legislation, for example the additional obligation to prove that the product derived from this secondary raw material is not waste. A clear level playing field is needed. He also noted that natural phosphate rock contains, amongst other things, high cadmium and uranium levels. Rob underlined the importance of the design of almost every process to purify or modify raw materials in such a way that they are fit for their purpose, no matter if they are derived from phosphate rock (skeletons of marine organisms) or bone meal, sewage sludge or manure. The quality of the end product and the environmental impact of the total process are what counts. The output (products, by-products, emissions) and input (recycled or natural raw materials, energy use, etc.) should be governed by an LCA approach. He also explained that the market has to decide for itself, and also here a level playing field is necessary. Some processes, based on a wrong design, lead to a P-containing product or slag which is unknown in the market. The next steps are then to prove that the product is right or that the P is plant-available (or not). Legislation should not allow more contaminants in products because they are simply derived from secondary materials. If that is the case the technology is the wrong one. He also added that it would help circular-economy based processes a lot if obstacles to the transport of secondary raw materials across borders could be minimised. Laura Piovesan presented the European Investment Bank and its role as a provider of finance and expertise to sound and sustainable investment projects as well as a lead developer of risk financing for innovative SMEs. The EIB has been a natural financing partner for the EU institutions since 1958. It helps to catalyse investments. In order to do so, it offers loans, guarantees, equity participation and blending and advising measures. She then explained the partnership between the European Commission and the EIB that has established the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI). Overall, the Fund is expected to facilitate additional investments to the tune of EUR 315 billion within Europe. There is a wide eligibility criterion for sectors which are candidates for the supporting measures by the EIB and which need to be verified by the EIB. One special objective is the development and modernisation of the energy sector, renewable energy, security of energy supply and resource efficiency. Generally speaking, a project may be given support if it is considered sound and sustainable. In order to assess its suitability, a project appraisal is conducted wherein all relevant factors, i.e. financial, economic, social, environmental, technical, are examined. A debate was held on all these issues and it was concluded that the experiences presented could be replicated in other EU regions and municipalities taking into account local conditions. Finally, the meeting was closed by Eric Liegeois reiterating his thanks to the audience and speakers.

        "Outline Territorial cohesion relies upon economic effectiveness, social cohesion and ecological balance. Green Infrastructure is a tool that delivers on all three fronts: it strengthens ecological balance, boosts our economy and enhances social cohesion. The workshop showcased these multiple benefits at the local and regional level, in particular through the example of ecological revitalization of an ex-industrial area in the Ruhr region. The participants discussed the lessons learnt from this as well as from other local examples on the implementation of Green Infrastructure, ways to enhance the delivery of multiple benefits on the ground as well as the way forward to better integrate Green Infrastructure into decision-making processes. Opportunities for Green Infrastructure under Cohesion Policy financial instruments as well as opportunities for the business sector formed particularly important aspects of the debate. Main messages and conclusions: An integrated approach to urban development is the key and nature and nature-based solutions delivered through Green Infrastructure play an indispensable role therein. However, it is paramount to further raise its profile in the short term, in particular by increasing understanding of and promoting the cost-effectiveness of nature-based solutions in tackling multiple socio-economic and environmental challenges. Although only associated with sustainable growth, Green Infrastructure has all the necessary predispositions to form an integral part of smart specialization and smart growth strategies as well; high quality projects with broad stakeholder engagement will further strengthen its case in those areas. Nature operates on a long-term schedule which can be constrained by the short term political context. Thus it is necessary to develop robust participatory processes that will produce a long-term vision and a framework to operate within through short- term actions.

It is essential that regions and cities ensure that these development trends benefit all and contribute to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth across Europe. The workshop brought together the experience and knowhow of the four pan-European ETC programmes, INTERREG EUROPE, INTERACT, URBACT and ESPON offering the audience a cross-cutting insight in practical regional and urban projects and good practices, government issues, as well as trends and dynamics related to fostering new urban economies. Main messages and conclusions: There is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 solution for promoting new economies in urban development \u2013 each city must develop its own course based on endogenous factors and intelligent use of new opportunities. Key factors in sustaining economic growth and modernising the urban economy include: \u2022 Growing and retaining skills \u2013 from school age through to retention of graduates. \u2022 Developing strong leadership with vision for an integrated urban development \u2022 Stronger analysis of options for economic development and learning from others experience. \u2022 Using a model of \u2018co-creation\u2019 between sectors to collectively drive the city\u2019s development. Collaboration is key to the growth of cities, and this should occur at three spatial levels: \u2022 Within the city \u2013 between public, private, academic and civic organisations \u2022 With neighbouring cities, to find economies of scale, complementarities for economic development and areas of common concern, both for smaller cities in situations dominated by mega urban areas and in areas far from major urban agglomerations. \u2022 At international level, to understand the increasingly important wider territorial context, learn from and use good practice from elsewhere and capture the opportunities and changes that the globalisation brings for urban economies.

The workshop presented case studies of how cities and their various bodies could benefit from modern and innovative solutions in order to optimise their transport and energy areas. The main intention was to help them better understand their position, identify their needs and give ideas for future projects which might be co-financed by the European Structural and Investment Funds 2014-2020. Hosted by the city of Pecs, a panel was complemented by speakers from other cities, DG CONNECT and industry. The speakers covered aspects such as smart solutions for energy and transportand their interoperability by giving specific examples. Main messages and conclusions: The event was attended by more than 35 stakeholders from across Europe. Among the participants were representatives from the European Commission, national, regional and local policy/decision makers and national associations. Jan Droege from Schuman Associates welcomed all of the speakers and participants, giving a brief overview of the smart cities idea.

Main messages and conclusions: How can we best support financing and access to financing for start-ups? It is important to understand well the different phases in the development of start-ups: idea / pre-seed, seed, start, growth. Then for each phase, it is necessary to offer the relevant support: - Hosting, including all facilities (Wi-Fi, reception, catering,\u2026). - Training and coaching. - Networking. - Financing possibilities. It is the role of a green incubator to put all these elements in place, taking into account 2 specific features of sustainable businesses: - The return on investment can be long as the \u201cmonetisation\u201d of projects in some sustainable domains is yet to be confirmed. - The sustainable economy is still not well known by most financing operators (business angels, banks, VC, etc.) Public authorities have a role to play here in exchanging information and increasing the knowledge levels of the various players. 14URB06 14 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: Greenbizz Chair/moderator: Jean-Marc Bryskere , CEO, Greenbizz, Belgium Speakers: Patricia Foscolo , Manager, Impulse Greentech, Belgium Nicolas Casula , Investment manager, Eebic, Belgium More information links: www.greenbizz.be OPEN urban DAY Livre OD2015.indb 134 08/01/2016 15:41 ",
        "OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 135 OPEN urban DAY Outline The session, chaired by Lars Andersson , focused on the future of financial instruments for cities, as well as challenges and opportunities in setting up and implementing these instruments. Financial instruments offer a more sustainable model for funding urban development projects in the future. The financial instruments are those established under the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 ESIF programming periods but also other kind of instruments facilitating loans, equity or guarantees that support urban development projects. While the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the European Association of Public Banks clarified their role with regard to financial instruments for cities, the session also included perspectives from a panel of municipalities, Manchester, The Hague and the Metropole of Lille - all involved in the CSI EUROPE network (URBACT). Main messages and conclusions: The European financial instruments for urban areas were presented through a short animation developed by the CSI EUROPE network. Financial instruments are indeed already working across Europe. They can play an important role in efficiently planning, progressing and administering urban development priorities, particularly in the context of the current economic and financial crisis. The long term advantage to using FIs instead of grants is that the investments will be repaid and the money will be available for reinvestment in further projects in the future. In terms of implementation, the key aspect is governance, to ensure professionally-led investment decisions within an investment strategy reflecting the local context. The three municipalities also highlighted another main challenge: the importance of the partnership and a constructive dialogue between Managing Authorities and cities. The city of The Hague highlighted the fact that financial instruments can be seen as difficult but then so are grants. They are about projects that make our cities better and more sustainable, in line with the Europe 2020 goals, and not about making a profit for the city. The European Commission talked about the legislative and policy framework for 2014-2020 that encourages further expansion and strengthening of the use of financial instruments. Financial instruments are a more efficient and sustainable alternative to complement traditional grant-based financing. Fi-Compass is a technical assistance platform to facilitate the use of FIs in ESI Funds. Fi-compass is provided by the European Commission in partnership with the European Investment bank. Under this platform, which is a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d, fi-compass provides methodological guidance and capacity building services. The European Association of Public Banks demonstrated the public banks\u2019 capacity of swiftly responding to the sharply-reduced access to finance. The important role of public banks in helping re-launch the European economy and jump-starting investments in national, regional and municipal infrastructure projects across Europe was highlighted.

Valerie Lapenne gave an overview of French national policy aimed at integrated regeneration of the most deprived urban areas all across the country. Main messages and conclusions: Deprived areas are very different across European cities, thus their regeneration requires different approaches. In the case of P\u00e9cs, the 5 segregated areas (previous mining villages) lack basic infrastructure, such as running water and toilets, and their 3 500 residents are extremely poor, needing jobs, basic healthcare and other services. Under such conditions the sequencing of interventions is very important: starting with investments into the people (individualised help in health, community development, social care, job training) and only later into the infrastructure. On the other hand, South Rotterdam, with an acceptable level of physical infrastructure, suffers from the concentration of households with a migrant background: the 200 000 residents have a much lower employment and educational level than in other areas of the city. In this case, the priority is joined-up educational and job measures. \u201cWith our neighbourhood teams, we support families directly at home.\u201d The aim is that by 2020 half of the students should be in technical or health care education. Transnational exchange under ROMA-Net has helped cities (e.g. Bologna and Glasgow) to create a more advanced local policy framework for Roma inclusion, which has ensured active involvement of the community, fostered a greater understanding of the need for integrated actions and helped cities to deliver different types of interventions to achieve long lasting results. The URBACT methodology (local support groups, local action plans) has provided a good basis for that. A proper national framework is needed for successful local measures. The new French law of 2014 applies priority geography (focussing on low income areas, selected on the basis of a single index), develops single contracts for urban cohesion with the inter-municipal networks and requires citizen participation in the form of citizen councils to be formed in each assigned neighbourhood. The strong national framework includes the main priorities for the local contracts, from which local versions have to be developed and linked up with the ERDF and the ESF at the regional level. The regeneration of deprived areas and the improvement of their residents\u2019 living conditions will be among the priority themes of the new Urban Agenda. The cases discussed in the workshop proved the importance of an integrated approach, based on a proper national policy framework and transnational knowledge exchange and learning mechanisms. 14URB08 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG REGIO Chair/moderator: Iv\u00e1n Tosics , director, Metropolitan Research Institute, Budapest, Hungary (URBACT Thematic Pole Manager) Speakers: Marko Pastors , Programme manager, Municipality of Rotterdam, The Netherlands Valerie Lapenne , General commission for territorial Equality, France Katalin Kov\u00e1cs , Programme manager, Municipality of P\u00e9cs, Hungary Ann Morton Hyde , Inclusion (Roma) Specialist, Think-Inclusion Ltd, Glasgow, UK OPEN urban DAY Livre OD2015.indb 136 08/01/2016 15:41 ",

Business, innovation and administration are changing rapidly in urban areas. Economic opportunities are huge, and cities are the test-bed for these new business models. There is a need to better connect innovators, investors and clients (cities) and intermediaries (eg. Innovation agencies, special accelerators/incubators)? This session will focus on two areas that could be provide both challenges and opportunities: 1. How to create speed and scale in \u2018smartness\u2019 in urban, collaborative ecosystems? 2. Rapid urban transformation \u2013 how to get it right? Main messages and conclusions: This session (organised by DG MOVE) brought together six panellists from different backgrounds, representing cities, start-up accelerators, public transport and management consultancy to discuss how to better scale innovation for urban transformation and get past pilot/demonstrator projects. Key points of a lively discussion: \u2022 The past few years have seen a rush towards innovation incubators/accelerators \u2013 cities are competing for new ideas and companies. The last five years have seen more changes than many of the previous years. \u2022 No shortage of ideas, but considerable difficulties for companies to successfully grow. Many business models in the sharing economy lack profitability and ability to scale. Companies break even, some grow, but only a few really scale. Next years will see a consolidation of the market. \u2022 Discussion about cities and transport in Europe lacks boldness, several participants claimed. Innovation in new technologies and services is still largely confined to niche markets. \u2022 Will we see/want mobility service providers providing services in different cities \u2013 will there be a European market? Will cities collaborate to push conventional mobility out? Will Europe agree to standardised urban platforms, data sharing and integration? There is too much fragmentation in the debate. \u2022 Opening up data (public and private) creates market certainty, fosters innovation and creates much more economic value for the city than keeping a closed lid, according to Helsinki and Copenhagen. \u2022 Scaling demand is a key challenge. Collaborative innovation platforms are needed, both at national and European level, that go beyond pilots and demonstration. Need to utilise the potential of digital matchmaking between cities and companies. Do we have the tools? Europe lacks equity investment for small companies. How to set up new types of cooperation to transform European urban areas and make our cities smarter? 14URB09 14 October 2015 09:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG MOVE Chair/moderator: Axel Volkery , Policy officer, DG MOVE, European Commission Speakers: Mette Hoe , Programme Manager, Copenhagen Electric, responsible for e-mobility Alex Wrottesley , Geovation Hub London, responsible for large tech spatial data incubator Ronan Breen , EBN / responsible for FIWare Frontiercities incubator Sylvain Hoan , UITP, Director of Communication Francois-Joseph Van Audenhoven , Arthur D Little, Partner, Director Urban Mobility Lab Jarmo Eskelinen , Chair Forum Virium Helsinki and President Network of Urban Living Labs Jon Worth , techpolitics/ prominent blogger, moderator Livre OD2015.indb 137 08/01/2016 15:41 ",

The workshop will introduce the EU policy framework and the tools offered to help improve local policy- making in the fields of energy efficiency and sustainable urban mobility. It will explore how these tools can contribute to developing integrated strategies for sustainable urban development, providing the framework for future investments. The workshop will also present inspiring examples of cities accomplishing a step change in their approach to carbon neutral development and sustainable urban mobility. Main messages and conclusions: Mr Matko set the scene for the presentations by introducing the cohesion policy framework for promoting sustainable urban development as well as describing the size and composition of the financial envelope for sustainable urban development in the Member States. He pointed out that the extent of change brought about with the help of the funds will depend very much on the commitment and capacities at local level to deliver a transition to a low-carbon approach. Ms Rosca provided an overview of the EU policy and tools targeting sustainable urban mobility including the key elements of the urban mobility package and the funding programmes (Civitas, Horizon 2020). Mr Klinkenberg\u2019s presentation covered the energy efficiency-related aspects of a transition to a low-carbon economy in an urban context. He provided a number of excellent examples for innovative solutions to reduce urban carbon emissions. Mr Vit\u00e9zy shared his hands-on experience as key driver of a major reorganisation of the urban mobility system in Budapest, Hungary. He provided a much-appreciated insight into the introduction of a user- oriented approach in the organisation of public transport system, adapting the Transport for London model to Budapest (integrated transport authority contracting service providers). Apart from explaining how an integrated transport authority can facilitate the overall process of improving the modal share of sustainable transport modes (public transport, cycling, walking) his presentation offered a set of practical examples on how to increase the \u201cuser experience\u201d of public transport, including: - introducing a legal framework allowing for the faster improvement of the rolling stock in times of budget constraints, - improving the image of public transport via small-scale investments into corporate image and extending the choice of sales channels and payment modes, extensive use of social media - optimising the transport network and providing real-time passenger information. 14URB11 14 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG REGIO Chair/moderator: Marton Matko , Policy officer, European Commission, DG REGIO Speakers: Daniela Rosca , Head of Unit, European Commission, DG MOVE Michael Klinkenberg , Policy advisor, Eurocities D\u00e1vid Vit\u00e9zy , urban mobility expert, independent, Hungary OPEN urban DAY Livre OD2015.indb 138 08/01/2016 15:41 ",
        "OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 139 OPEN urban DAY Outline For over ten years, the URBACT programme has been a European Territorial Cooperation programme that aims to foster sustainable, integrated urban development in cities. In that time it has established a strong track record in supporting urban transformation through its networks, capacity building and knowledge capital. The programme\u2019s flagship workshop during the first Open Urban Day in Brussels 2015 provided participants with an overview of what URBACT offers for urban practitioners and policy-makers (at local, regional, national and European levels). It also featured stories from cities that had participated in a new type of transfer network piloted in 2014-2015. Representatives from Syracuse, Rome, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje and Mollet Del Vall\u00e8s explained how participation in URBACT networks (TUTUR, DIET FOR GREEN PLANET, and OPEN GENIUS) had been the catalyst for innovative policy change. They also described how knowledge transfer is a dynamic two-way process, not a one-way street, and how the process of transferring practice had been an important opportunity for both giving and receiving cities to continue to develop and spread concepts, as well as to reflect on and evolve policy relating to different urban challenges. Main messages and conclusions: Speakers gave examples of policy change resulting from the transnational transfer process in very different urban policies: food, open innovation and temporary use. In each case the URBACT method had supported the adaptation of practice, and each partner city had engaged with the process in their own way according to the context, for instance within different local procurement and consultation frameworks. Crucial to success was the bottom-up, multi-stakeholder approach, and the ability to persuade key actors to get on board, to take on and run with the new ideas. Resistance to change in both civil servants and local communities had to be overcome, and new attitudes and skills encouraged. Positive results included a dramatic reduction in the gap between politicians and residents in a disadvantaged neighbourhood of Syracuse, and imaginative strategies for better use of urban space in Rome, Bremen and Alba Iulia. In the \u2018Diet for a Green Planet\u2019 network city managers, kitchen staff and families learnt from each other how to create healthier, locally-sourced, more sustainable menus. Building on these pilot experiences the URBACT programme will launch a call for Good Practices and Transfer Networks in 2016.

        "140 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Child poverty: how to develop integrated strategies and actions? Outline The workshop was focused on local integrated strategies for combating child poverty in a participatory way. Presentation of \u201cChildren first: local consultation platforms for the prevention and identification of child poverty\u201d, an innovative pilot project launched in 2014 by the Belgian government. In 57 different cities / municipalities, these local consultation platforms have been established. The platforms were designed to bring different local players together who work with children in poverty, to get to know each other better, share expertise and experiences and stimulate collaboration. We asked three cities to present their platform and its composition, and the working methods and initiatives arising out of them: Ghent (big), Kortrijk (medium sized) and Gembloux (small). Main messages and conclusions: The target group of the consultation platforms are children aged between 0 and 12 years, in poverty or at risk of poverty. Their parents and family are part of the target group too. The starting point of the platforms is that different stakeholders working with children (schools, youth services, child care workers\u2026) do not always know each other well and the services they offer. The consultation platforms must initiate cooperation where it does not yet exist, or if it exists, reinforce it according local needs. Connections must constantly be sought with the existing policies and dynamics in the city. The following recommendations have been formulated: - platforms should be anchored within the local context and beyond (regional, national, European..) - they must imply a user perspective - they need to bring together both institutional and associative partners - they should have a multi-disciplinary, integral and city-wide approach towards a poverty plan - the partnership should be extensive, with the usual and unusual suspects: co-decision (determination of priorities), co-creation (development of the plan), co-production on the actions - a stronger link between the platforms and (local) policy level(s) should be developed - a systematic follow-up of the agreed actions and proposed policy measures: identification and application of generally accepted outcome measures, process indicators, complementary to the different policy levels (from local to European). At the presentations, but also from the audience during the final debate, some inspiring examples of actions targeted at children in poverty were presented (inter alia): - the exchange of material and equipment for children aged 0-3 years (baby clothes, feeding- bathing- bedding- and travel equipment; - parent coaching by carefully selected volunteers; - a first line service that directs people in a disadvantaged situation to the right services; - actions to promote the participation of children in poverty in cultural, sports and leisure associations free of charge or at reduced prices; - after school activities for the guidance of children in poverty with learning difficulties; - the involvement of schools in community-oriented activities with children in problem areas. 14URB18 14 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: Federal Public Planning Service for Social Integration, Belgium Chair/moderator: Rik Baeten , PPS Social Integration, Head of unit Urban Policy, Belgium Speakers: Sandra Verhauwert , team manager \u201cfamily guidance\u201d Public Centre of Social Welfare Ghent, Belgium Lara de Jacquier de Ros\u00e9e , Social Sector Director at CPAS (Public Centre of Social Welfare) city of Gembloux, Belgium Hanne Denoo , Project manager for the Public Centre of Social Welfare in the city of Kortrijk, Belgium OPEN urban DAY Livre OD2015.indb 140 08/01/2016 15:41 ",

The workshop aimed to meet the urgent need to examine the claims associated with big data and to work collaboratively with a variety of academic, private sector and policy partners to move towards a big data agenda that can actually deliver tangible improvements in the way we live, work and plan across the regions of Europe. The workshop critically examined the potential of \u201cbig data\u201d in the context of EU regional development in relation to collaboration between the private sector, universities, institutions and policymakers. Main messages/conclusions : Big data creates a unique opportunity to better understand ongoing processes and improve public services to be delivered at each level of governance. In spite of technical problems of collecting, presenting and visualising the data which are still unsolved, there is no doubt that it is a new and powerful tool for policymakers in addressing societal challenges. As the use of big data is increasing, questions of privacy are believed to be one of the main challenges ahead. Others include the reuse of public-sector information and open data. Size and quantity are not seen as enough. The data needs to be of good quality. There is therefore the question of the credibility of the institutions collecting the data. Finally, there is a very important connection between big data and economic development (growing ICT sector). Due to unexpected health problems, Dr Aladair Rae , was not able to chair the session as planned, but he did coordinate all the speakers and their presentations before the workshop.

        "OPEN DAYS University OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 145 Dynamics of job creation and role of micro-enterprises Outline The Regional Studies Association (RSA) presented this session, which was chaired by Professor Mark Hart, Deputy Director of the UK\u2019s national Enterprise Research Centre (ERC). The session focussed on the role of micro-enterprise in stimulating job creation and innovation at local, regional and national levels. This facilitated session was designed to summarise the latest research and policy developments in an accessible manner and involved key contributions from the OECD. It also included perspectives from a panel of micro-entrepreneurs as well as those involved in supporting micro-businesses and the research community. Main messages and conclusions: The OECD presented evidence from their DYNEMP project on cross-country evidence on the growth dynamics of start-ups, although this was extremely limited: where are jobs created?; how are new jobs created?; what has the impact of the crisis been on jobs?; how does my area fare relative to other areas in my country and in Europe?; what has been the impact of European/national regional policies? Evidence from the UK emphasises the range of capabilities necessary for new-to-the-market innovation in micro-enterprises. Resource coordination and partnering skills are as important as more technological competencies. Barriers to innovation mentioned were pretty standard (e.g. excessive economic risk and availability of finance). Thus, resources remain an issue. Can partnering help here, too? Overall, policies shape the environment in which start-ups experiment, innovate, and grow. They include the regulatory framework, market conditions, access to finance, knowledge creation and dissemination and entrepreneurial capabilities and culture. The two micro-entrepreneurs stressed the importance of regulations as a major constraint which, although they have now been overcome, was initially a brake on development of their businesses. Moving into international markets to expand more rapidly requires greater cultural awareness of the target countries and regional variations within them. 13UNIV02 13 October 2015 9:00-13:00 Organiser/leader: Regional Studies Association Chair/moderator: Professor Mark Hart , Professor of Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Enterprise Research Centre, Aston Business School, UK Speakers: Chiara Criscuolo , Centre for Economic Performance, LSE, UK Anita Richter , OECD, France Stephen Roper , Enterprise Research Centre, UK Emma Heathcote-James , Micro-entrepreneur, UK Morten Weber , Micro- entrepreneur, Denmark More information links: www.regionalstudies.org www.enterpriseresearch.ac.uk Livre OD2015.indb 145 08/01/2016 15:41 ",
        "146 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline Nowadays, knowledge dynamics and institutional factors are key elements in shaping the growth trajectory of regional economies. On the one hand, the ability of firms and especially of SMEs to access knowledge, recombine it and innovate is necessary for regions to move up the technological ladder. On the other hand, governments and institutions are essential for ensuring a suitable regulatory framework for innovation and for fostering cooperation among different actors. We argue that a better understanding of the relationship linking knowledge and institutions to innovation and, eventually, to growth, are of critical importance for the successful implementation of cohesion policy. Main messages and conclusions: Andr\u00e9s Rodriguez-Pose focussed on the significant gap between core and periphery in R&D spending in Europe. He started by saying that there is an attempt to reduce the gap between core and periphery in terms of R&D expenditure and that there was a significant increase in the R&D effort from the mid-1990s on. Although the periphery did recently catch up, the crisis has affected the expenditure and the gap between periphery and core remains. Despite positive developments in the fields of growth, employment and patenting remain moderate and, despite higher investment, the conversion of research into investment has not yet succeeded properly in the periphery. This is firstly due to human capital deficits such as a lack of quality and university degrees. Secondly, brain drain has been observed and top people are often moving away from their country of origin. Thirdly, limited size and capacity in the private sector are constraining it, resulting in weak economic fabrics. Fourthly, limited internationalisation is due to the fact that companies are often as yet unable to work at an international level. Finally, poor institutional set-ups and low quality of government create major bottlenecks. We can see from this that institutions do matter and the link between few patent applications and poor quality of government is obvious. Therefore, in order to move up the technological ladder the following principles should be taken into consideration: spatially-targeted intervention with approaches geared to different regions and countries; focus on innovation and strengthening of innovative capacity; coordinating education and training with innovation policies of other countries as well; addressing the institutional bottlenecks mentioned above and promoting pipelines. In a nutshell, the recent reforms of EU territorial and innovation policies are a step in the right direction, but they need to go further, generating smarter investment, addressing structural impediments and seeking coordination and synergies with other European, national and regional policies. Nicola Cortinovis explained the knowledge diversity in the EU with the concept of agglomeration economies and concluded by saying that ideas for reform cannot simply be copied from one region to another. Peter Berkowitz concluded by presenting strategies for economic transformation tailored to the local level, such as rejuvenating traditional sectors and modernising with new technologies. \u201cHow to move up the technological ladder: knowledge, innovation and institutions in European regions\u201d 13UNIV03 13 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: College of Europe Chair/moderator: Rebecca Christie , Brussels correspondent, Bloomberg, Belgium Speakers: Andr\u00e9s Rodriguez-Pose , College of Europe Visiting Professor, London School of Economics, UK Nicola Cortinovis , Former College of Europe student and PhD Candidate at Utrecht University, The Netherlands Peter Berkowitz , Head of Unit, DG REGIO, European Commission More information links: www.coleurope.eu/events/ college-europe-organizes- workshop-framework-years- open-days OPEN DAYS University Livre OD2015.indb 146 08/01/2016 15:42 ",
        "OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 147 Creating Links between Academia and Policy at the National and Regional Level Outline The aim of the workshop was to reflect on the potential for academic-policy engagement in the implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-20. It drew on the academic-policy conference in Riga (Challenges for the New Cohesion Policy in 2014-2020, organised by DG Regio, the RSA, Latvian Presidency and University of Latvia), specifically the lessons of research for the contribution of cohesion policy to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It discussed the conditions for effective academic-policy engagement, drawing on practices and experience from different countries and regions. Key themes were how academics engage with policy research, influence policy agendas and contribute to practice, and how policy-makers use academic expertise in cohesion policy. Main messages and conclusions: There is increasing demand from regional development policy-makers for knowledge and \u201cevidence\u201d that can contribute in a timely and relevant way to policy design and implementation. Cohesion policy has been an important driver of this through the requirements for monitoring and evaluation. However, policy-makers suffer from data overload and the fragmentation of knowledge. Universities in some countries are encouraging more policy-relevant research, driven partly by the aim of making a more tangible contribution to national, regional and local development, and also by government funding incentives (e.g. the UK Research Excellence Framework) that reward the societal impact of research. \u2022 Capacity-building \u2013 effective systems of knowledge exchange between academia and policy are an important part of administrative capacity-building. \u2022 Different priorities and values - there are dangers of distorting the priorities of universities and barriers, especially the different cultures, norms and values of universities and their staff compared to their partners in government, business and society. \u2022 Timescales \u2013 good evidence takes time to collect and analyse, but policy-makers are often working under short-term time pressure. \u2022 Utilisation \u2013 much of the knowledge generated by academics on regional development is not used. Policy- commissioned evaluations are sometimes not even read, let alone acted on. \u2022 Intermediation \u2013 there is a need for knowledge brokers or intermediaries who can distil and provide the knowledge generated by academia in the right form at the right time. \u2022 Audiences for knowledge \u2013 national/regional policy-makers are not the only audiences for knowledge; the implementation of regional and local development also involves a hierarchy of other government and non- government bodies, including socio-economic partners. \u2022 Realism \u2013 expectations are often excessive on both sides of the academic-policy relationship. More frequent engagement and interaction can help to develop mutual understanding of the respective norms, values and priorities. \u2022 Trust \u2013 is the most important factor in determining how well cooperation works, which is particularly dependent on the judgement of academics regarding the political and policy context on which they are working and the willingness of policy-makers to be open to external evaluation and critical comment. 14UNIV01 14 October 2015 9:00-10:45 Organiser/leader: Regional Studies Association, European Commission, DG REGIO Chair/moderator: Professor John Bachtler , Professor of European Policy Studies, University of Strathclyde/ European Policies Research Centre, UK Speakers: Professor Kevin Morgan , Professor of Governance and Development, School of Planning, Cardiff University, UK Professor Karol Olejniczak , Assistant Professor, EUROREG, University of Warsaw, Poland Tomasz Kot , Head of National Evaluation Unit, Department for Coordination of Development Strategies and Policies, Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, Poland More information links: https://scic.ec.europa.eu/ streaming/regio-open-days- 2015-2a-14-10 www.regionalstudies.org/ www.eprc.strath.ac.uk/eprc/ default.php OPEN DAYS University Livre OD2015.indb 147 08/01/2016 15:42 ",

The purpose of this workshop was to build on the results of driving European initiatives in the field of urban research and innovation, such as JPI Urban Europe, and explore how can smart cities boost European jobs, growth and investment and the wellbeing of our citizens; what the right mix is between social and technological innovation and how to strike a balance between the two; does the public sector require new policies and instruments to support smart city development? Main messages/conclusions): The workshop provided insights into the urban innovation ecosystems and the right research/policy mix of smart cities and technological and social innovation that is much needed in order to achieve a transition to sustainable urban futures. The ecosystem metaphor encompasses the capabilities to widen the boundaries of knowledge transfers. This requires systematic work on socio-technical entanglement, via \u201csmart\u201d, i.e. cross- disciplinary, co-creative and transformative processes, which associate knowledge/R&I governance/economic infrastructures in the service of everyday life. Innovation cannot avoid being socio-technical, addressing the opportunities, controversies and risks intrinsic in all innovation processes in their distinctive de facto inseparability. Jonas Bylund: \u201cOur urban ecosystems need to be reprogrammed. Cities are \u2018subversive, creative and innovative\u2019 urban ecosystems in their own right, and urban planning should further enable them to be so. Being smart in the socio-technical jumble means trying out many things at once; some will fail, but this is part of the learning process.

        "OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 149 The role model of the Covenant of Mayors in Multi-level Governance: Views from academia and local and regional actors Outline From 2008 onwards, more than 6 000 local authorities have joined the Covenant of Mayors, the mainstream European movement involving local and regional authorities, voluntarily committing to increasing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources on their territories. While the \u201cNew Integrated Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy\u201d is being officially launched to support implementation of the new 2030 EU targets, multi-level governance appears as a key instrument for success. The many examples of horizontal and vertical governance, including citizen participation and/or the private sector and coordination of mitigation and adaptation measures demonstrate that municipalities, whatever their size, can reach ambitious targets by implementing innovative cooperation schemes. Main messages and conclusions: Kata T\u00fctt\u0151, Member of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) and rapporteur on the future of the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), first emphasised the need to commit to ambitious targets, namely 50% reduction of CO 2 emissions by 2030 and carbon free cities by 2050. The CoR also supports the integration of climate adaptation within the CoM, the strengthening of the initiative (particularly in Eastern Europe) and the development of a global dimension to share the experience of the CoM worldwide. Experts pointed out that climate policies require coordination of different levels of government. Kristine Kern explained that vertical (bottom-up and top-down) and horizontal (across cities) governance has developed over recent years, owing to the Europeanisation of cities, where EU legislation is implemented. She recommended the development of differentiated approaches to handling the diverse membership of the CoM, along with further commitment from the regional and, particularly, national levels. Focusing on energy performance of buildings, Leila Kebir demonstrated that multi-level governance schemes require fostering of cooperation with innovative SMEs and support and secure exchange of knowledge. Based on the analysis of case studies across Europe, the study on Multi-level governance and partnership practices in development and implementation of Sustainable Energy Action Plans identified \u201cthe right mix\u201d for implementing multi-level governance: external coordination, broad partnership, collaboration with peers and thinking outside of the box. Many success factors were identified, such as long-term planning and vision, a clear and stable regulatory framework (in particular on the national level), qualitative data. In the framework of the CoM, provinces and regions provide technical, strategic and sometimes financial assistance to signatories to prepare or implement their action plans, in particular municipalities up to 50 000 inhabitants. Giulia Melica reported that many initiatives developed in Spain, Italy and Belgium, such as Covenant Clubs, involving a broad range of stakeholders; development of specific tools to draw up action plans or collect data; guidance for ELENA funding, etc. The workshop was organised in the framework of the new Academia Corner of the CoM, which aims to provide an exchange platform to bring researchers and scientists closer to the signatory cities and to share research results more effectively. 14UNIV03 14 October 2015 14:30-17:00 Organiser/leader: Covenant of Mayors Office/ European Committee of the Regions Chair/moderator: Kata T\u00fctt\u0151 , Member of the European Committee of the Regions, Hungary (first session) Prof. Paul Fleming , De Montfort University, UK (second session) Speakers: Dr Ana Rita Neves , Covenant of Mayors Office, Belgium Prof. Dr Kristine Kern , Leibniz Institute for Regional Development & University of Potsdam, Germany Dr Leila Kebir , Regional development, EIVP-Lab\u2019Urba, University of Paris-Est, France Giorgia Rambelli , Ecologic/ICLEI, Germany Albert Vendrell Roca , Province of Barcelona, Spain Attilio Raimondi , Region of Emilia Romagna, Italy Giulia Melica , European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Italy Andreea Strachinescu , European Commission, DG ENERGY More information links: http://www.covenantofmayors. eu/about/academia_en.html OPEN DAYS University Livre OD2015.indb 149 08/01/2016 15:42 ",
        "150 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline This Open Days University \u2018policy forum\u2019 session brought together key emerging themes around distributed manufacturing, reshoring/offshoring, global value chains, open innovation, and the most recent developments in industrial policy thinking. It builds on the earlier Open Days University sessions on smart specialisation and industrial policy but critically moved the discussion on in the context of recent developments in advanced and \u2018distributed\u2019 manufacturing and the opportunities these may yield for regional \u2018rebalancing\u2019 and manufacturing renaissance. Main messages and conclusions: This session presented an insight into the \u2018Manufacturing Renaissance\u2019 and the role for Industrial Policy from a UK and US perspective and the role of regions. The presenters identified key issues such as the role of innovation in driving the sector where smaller firms can often innovate more quickly and more cheaply than the major firms. Also of importance is interaction across technologies which go up and down the supply chain as well as between large and small firms (enormous breadth of technologies). The speakers explained that there are possibilities for a manufacturing renaissance and that reshoring in UK/ EU manufacturing is happening, but currently only on a modest scale. Some recent success stories such as the automotive industry in the UK were highlighted from which wider lessons can perhaps be drawn. However, it was concluded that there is a need for longer term, proactive and holistic pro-manufacturing industrial policy. In the case of the UK, there appears to be great opportunities to rebuild some of the UK\u2019s fractured manufacturing supply chains such as the automotive industry in the West Midlands. The key message raised is that such developments are not going to continue on a significant scale without a major policy effort.

        "OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 151 Multilevel governance systems and their role in policies for balanced urban development Outline Taking the recent CoR Charter for Multilevel Governance (MLG) as inspiration, the workshop discussed different aspects of this increasingly popular governance concept, with specific focus on the strong mutual relationship with territorial development and planning: - the reality (as opposed to ideals) of implementing MLG in practice - MLG as a tool to enable urban systems to face the mega-challenges of sustainability and resilience to change - the emergence of newer transnational governance levels as opposed to the usual national/regional/local levels - the mutually-supportive relationship between MLG and strategic planning. Two case-studies from Gdynia and the Scottish Borders then looked at how MLG was developing in practice. Main messages and conclusions: Even in a democracy, government/governance is the exertion of power to achieve political goals within one\u2019s own territory. MLG means a far greater degree of sharing power and policy competence with \u201coutsiders\u201d. That is not only infinitely more complex but, for many politicians, difficult to accept. In addition, cities have to be resilient to external shocks and sudden changes (natural disasters, refugees, economic crises, new technologies). So does MLG lead to greater territorial and policy integration and help improve that resilience by \u201csharing problems and solutions\u201d, or do its inherent complexities reduce the clarity of policies, destabilise (the hierarchy of) decision-making and result in fuzzy \u201cfragmegration\u201d? Although not the magic solution to all governance problems, MLG is a useful tool for mind-set change. Despite the increasingly stronger identification of citizens with their city and/or region, the role of the nation state is still overpowering and is again increasing, even when solutions have to be found at local/regional levels. The refugee problem is an excellent example: policy formulation/control and paperwork at national level; practical problems and solutions (education, housing, jobs, neighbourhood cohesion, etc.) at local level. Do we need radical solutions? A federal system in all larger, more populated Member States? The European Committee of the Regions as a second chamber to the EP? Historically-determined administrative territorial units are seldom functional in terms of spatial-economic interaction. As \u201cspace and place\u201d policies have to be territorially consistent and functional, they must therefore cross administrative borders. This makes MLG indispensable and has led to a rescaling of policy responses to non-administrative levels, such as metropolitan and city-regions and cross-border, river-basin and other transnational, spatially-cohesive entities. Such \u201csoft\u201d territorial units need to be part of MLG. MLG is an almost continuous negotiation/deliberation process and is therefore longer-term orientated. Strategic planning is inherently holistic, cross-border, future-orientated, flexible and visionary, yet action-orientated. The two are \u201cnatural partners\u201d. But we have to bridge the gap between strategic planning and short-term, more binding planning at local level, just as we have to bridge the gap between the cooperation and integration qualities of MLG and the need for clear policies and decision-making. 15UNIV01 15 October 2015 9:00-13:00 Organiser/leader: Association of European Schools of Planning (AESOP) and European Committee of the Regions Chair/moderator: Prof. Anna Geppert , Paris Sorbonne University (Paris IV) and AESOP (president), France Speakers: Prof. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Fern\u00e1ndez G\u00fcell , Technical University of Madrid (UPM) and AESOP, Spain Prof. Karsten Zimmermann , Dortmund University of Technology and AESOP, Germany, Prof. Stefanie D\u00fchr , Radboud University Nijmegen, and AESOP, The Netherlands Prof. Maro\u0161 Finka , Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava/Central European Research and Training Centre in Spatial Planning - EU Centre of Excellence and AESOP, Slovak Republic OPEN DAYS University Livre OD2015.indb 151 08/01/2016 15:42 ",
        "152 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline This workshop questioned the future of European rural areas in light of the new H2020 policy. The EU growth strategy for 2020 aims to become \u201ca smart, sustainable and inclusive economy\u201d. Does this new focus on smart specialization apply to rural areas, which account for most of the EU at the moment and millions of people? Or is it just for the cities and their suburbs in the most urbanised world area, with urban population expected to increase? Main messages and conclusions: Prof. Andr\u00e9 Torre assessed the major changes faced by rural areas as well as their rapid development, especially in Europe, with different types of activities and modes of governance. Dr Jose Enrique Garcilazo said that major challenges are faced nowadays by rural regions, especially in the European situation; it is crucial to say that major changes are occurring, and that the OECD is taking them into account by multiplying experiments on the topic in different regions of the world. The idea of smart development of these regions is crucial and new, in order to define a shared and bright future. Prof Andr\u00e9 Torre followed with a presentation on the main concepts of smartness, related to EU policies. Smart Specialization Strategy is a response to the difficulty in choosing specialisations. Each region should specialise in activities with a competitive advantage based on differentiation. In practical terms, each region must determine intervention priorities out of a limited number of sectors or technologies. He asked the question: is this strategy compatible with rural areas? Based on a statistical analysis, Prof Hans Westlund assessed that the (smart) determinants of firms\u2019 growth are to a large extent similar for most urban and rural areas, but urban areas have the advantage that they are denser and more diversified. Can policy compensate for this? On the other hand, amenities, both natural and cultural, seem to have an impact on rural entrepreneurship. Can policy get better at exploiting this rural growth potential? Prof. Michael Steiner based his results on a study of two Austrian regions. He said that rural areas reveal differences, especially the different strengths and limitations of a regional labour market, no single key target sector (as before agriculture), ability to be very competitive in niche markets, high export intensity, highly innovative activities but not based on formal knowledge or R&D. He recommended deepening cooperation with educational institutions, increasing \u201clearning-by-doing\u201c by employing skilled and educated workers, increasing in size, and building production networks with firms. Dr Stefano Corsi spoke about the persistent and specific role of agriculture in rural areas and called for the role played by smart agriculture, an interesting concept expanding and deepening sustainability, including and highlighting landscape and technologies.

        "OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 153 The added value of an integrated versus sectoral approach to territorial development. Outline Territorial cohesion enhances the ability of place-based strategies to improve policy implementation, whilst acknowledging the differences between regions. An integrated approach can potentially increase the efficiency and effectiveness of outcomes in specific regions and also increase the involvement of partners. However such approaches also have to face challenges such as operational complexity, limitations to governance arrangements, and the limited potential to adapt sector policy in cases where less than optimal outcomes might be achieved. This workshop provided insights into place-based strategies and the practices that have been developed to make the most of the potential added-value to be gained from using this approach. Main messages and conclusions: Over the years there have been many complaints that government departments do not communicate, or that policy actions are contradictory. It has also become increasingly obvious that skills and resources from a variety of sectors must be combined in order to achieve successful regional development. Without proper coordination or integration sectoral domains are inefficient, or in other words, they produce competing and contradictory objectives and duplicate their efforts. They are also ineffective, in that they ignore the complexity of interactions between different areas of public policy. Contradictions occur when policies obstruct or undo each other\u2019s work, in terms of both implementation and results. The term policy integration indicates the degree to which consistencies are actively being encouraged and contradictions actively being removed by policy-makers. There are three different forms of policy integration: sectoral integration involving cross-sectoral integration between different policy areas or inter-agency integration between public, private and voluntary sector agencies; territorial integration that creates policy coherence across different geographical areas (countries, states, regions etc.) and between neighbouring authorities (countries, states, regions etc.) and organisational integration, where the territory is the unit for policy making and analysis, promoted by organisational measures. The session concluded that many of the processes and problems tackled by urban and regional development are inherently complex. An integrated approach requires techniques and practices that can address such complexity. It can provide parameters to evaluate the impact of policies and programmes that enable multiple outcomes to be measured. It can also provide a better basis upon which to identify the unwanted impacts of policies, some of which might be hidden or not identified when a sectoral approach is used. Moreover, and integrated approach can be used to identify spatial interactions, as it is within the multiple spatial scales that multi-outcomes might be identified and achieved. The transparency of policy and its implementation can be increased. An integrated approach seems to be an ongoing learning process, and as a result it is important to continuously develop and utilise a knowledge base of regionally relevant information. 15UNIV03 15 October 2015 11:15-13:00 Organiser/leader: European Commission, DG REGIO / Regional Studies Association Chair/moderator: Professor Gordon Dabinett , Professor for Regional Studies, University of Sheffield, UK Speakers: Professor Andreas Faludi , Emeritus Professor Spatial Policy Systems in Europa, University of Delft, The Netherlands Dr Marjan Van Herwijnen , Project Expert, EPSON Coordination Unit, Luxembourg Professor Silvia Vignetti , Director of Development and Evaluation Studies, Csil Centre for Industrial Studies, Italy Professor Richard Dawson , Director of Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research, University of Newcastle, UK Dr David Evers , Senior Research Spatial Planning, PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, The Netherlands More information links: www.espon.eu/main/Menu_ ToolsandMaps/TIA/ http://www. espon.eu/main/Menu_Projects/ Menu_TargetedAnalyses/EATIA. html www.espon.eu/main/ Menu_Projects/Menu_ TargetedAnalyses/rise. html http://www.espon.eu/ main/Menu_Projects/Menu_ TargetedAnalyses/TPM.html www.pbl.nl/en/publications www.ncl.ac.uk/ceser/ www.csilmilano.com/ OPEN DAYS University Livre OD2015.indb 153 08/01/2016 15:42 ",
        "Master Class 154 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Outline This workshop addressed the challenges and opportunities faced by cities and regions with regard to the energy and climate change issues. Energy efficiency objectives and risk mitigation strategies affect many aspects of everyday life and economic activity (planning, transport, agriculture, housing, production, etc.). The workshop aimed to promote understanding of how energy issues challenge existing regional, urban and development models. It also questioned the way these issues may help to reduce costs and promote more geographically- balanced development. Main messages and conclusions: Youssef Diab opened the discussion by explaining how the energy transition could be an opportunity for urban development. Different planning approaches have been developed, from a functional to a morphological approach, to present systemic, multi-level-governed approaches. Far from the basic model (one controller, one main investor, clear, unchanging programme), today\u2019s planning is developing in a more complex and changing setting (multiple stakeholders, multi-level governance, evolving needs). Tackling energy issues could bring innovative thinking (integrated and transectoral thinking, experimentation, etc.). Provided, however, the objectives are properly defined in order to determine the optimal scale(s) for action. Cheryl de Boer followed, presenting a research project focusing on decentralised energy implementation. In many EU regions efforts are made to increase the amount of solar, wind and biomass energy. But these projects often raise land use and landscape issues. Ms de Boer showed, using the case of Overijssel (NL) as an example, the importance of considering the local social, economic and physical context when developing such a project. She also showed how map tables and scenarios can help local players to better estimate the trade-off between land use requirements and renewable energy output. Stefan Greiving ended the session by addressing the territorial dimension of climate change as a multi-level governance challenge for Europe. Territorial development is often seen as a corner stone for reducing regional vulnerability and climate mitigation and adaptation. Mr Greiving explained how countries\u2019/regions\u2019 responses are determined by the complex policy architecture of horizontal and vertical institutional interplay, by legal and administrative systems and cultural traditions. He concluded by explaining that good practices come mainly from those countries that are less affected by climate change. Countries facing economic and social crises do not have the ability or willingness to respond properly to climate change. The discussion with the floor, led by Yann Fran\u00e7oise , stressed: the importance of the human aspects and the citizens; the performance scale for action, which is not clear-cut (regional for provision; local for awareness- raising?); the need to quantify and reuse the lost energy in cities.

        "The OPEN DAYS Master Class 2015 From 12 to 15 October 2015, the OPEN DAYS event was accompanied for the third time by a Master Class aiming to improve the understanding of EU Cohesion Policy and its research potential. Organised by the European Commission\u2019s DG for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO), the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) and the Regional Studies Association (RSA), together with the European Regional Science Association (ERSA) and the Association of European Schools of Planning (AESOP), the Master Class focused on PhD students and early-career researchers from all over Europe. Its aim was to: \u2022 present recent research on European regional and urban development and EU Cohesion Policy; \u2022 enable PhD students and early-career researchers to exchange views with EU politicians, officials and senior academics; \u2022 facilitate networking among participants from different countries and with the wider EU policy and academic communities; and \u2022 raise awareness and understanding of the research potential in the field of EU Cohesion Policy. Based on a call for paper proposals, 24 participants from universities in 15 EU Member States and three non-EU countries attended the Master Class and discussed three themes in particular: \u2022 EU Cohesion Policy and the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth; \u2022 Institutional relations, governance and EU Cohesion Policy; \u2022 Places and spaces: the contribution of EU Cohesion Policy to integrated urban, rural and territorial development. 30 speakers and moderators from the partnering institutions were involved and the selected participants attended the various modules of the Master Class: lectures and networking sessions, OPEN DAYS opening session, events in the European Commission, interactive debates, world caf\u00e9 session and social events. This report presents short accounts of these sessions in chronological order, together with the results of a feedback exercise and an online evaluation. The Master Class started on the morning of Monday, 12 October 2015, with a two-hour city walk, guiding by Stefan De Corte, academic coordinator of the Master\u2019s Programme on \u00abUrban and spatial planning\u00bb and associate director of Cosmopolis, the Centre for Urban research \u2013 Free University of Brussels. Participants were given the opportunity to walk around and view some of the main sights in the centre of Brussels and to understand them from a spatial and urban development perspective, taking the city\u2019s history into account. It was followed by the first session on the presentation of students\u2019 research projects, during which selected papers were discussed. In the afternoon, the participants attended the OPEN DAYS Opening Session. On Tuesday, 13 October 2015, the Master Class continued in the morning with presentations on the state of play of EU Cohesion Policy 2014-2020. The challenges for research and cohesion policy were also debated with Walter Deffaa , the Director-General for Regional and Urban Policy. The afternoon was given over to a series of presentations of students\u2019 papers and a discussion with the audience and three experts. 156 OPEN DAYS 2014 - 12 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Master Class 156 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Livre OD2015.indb 156 08/01/2016 15:42 ",
        "A roundtable discussion included senior researchers from the Sorbonne University, Cardiff University, the University of Birmingham and the College of Europe. In the evening, Master Class participants and lecturers, together with about 1,500 OPEN DAYS participants, were invited to attend the official reception at BOZAR, Brussels\u2019 Centre for Fine Arts. The RegioStars Awards 2015 ceremony for Europe\u2019s most innovative regional projects was followed by a buffet. Participants were also able to visit the adjacent \u201cANATOLIA\u201c exhibition. On Wednesday, 14 October 2015, Master Class participants were free to attend OPEN DAYS workshops and seminars or to organise specific meetings. An open event initiated by Cosmopolis was then held at the Atelier Vlaams Bouwmeester, during which the theme \u201csmart (city) governance\u201d was debated. During the evening, an informal conversation about the reform of cohesion policy with politicians and officials of the EU institutions allowed the students to gain insights into the negotiations on EU Cohesion Policy and the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014-2020. Following a welcome by European Committee of the Regions\u2019 Secretary-General, Ji\u0159\u00ed Buri\u00e1nek, and an introduction by Professor John Bachtler, the fourth and final module was presented in the form of a World Caf\u00e9 session focusing on research in the field of EU Cohesion Policy and regional and urban development. During a session of approximately four hours, the participants were divided into six groups, focusing on one of the three thematic strands: 1) EU Cohesion Policy and the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth; 2) Institutional relations, governance and EU Cohesion Policy; 3) Places and spaces: the contribution of EU Cohesion Policy to integrated urban, rural and territorial development. Colleagues from the European Commission, the European Committee of the Regions, the European Parliament and academics introduced and moderated discussions, while the participants were able to move between tables and topics. The morning concluded with a feedback session on all the elements of the Master Class and its concept in general. Participants highlighted the quality of the debates, appreciated the possibility of contacts with representatives of the EU institutions and suggested allowing more time for networking and discussions on own research in the future. After the Master Class, participants and lecturers were invited to take part in an online evaluation in which 15 of the 24 participants participated. As was the case last year, the main expectation of the participants was to learn about new trends in regional and urban development research and to meet representatives of EU institutions and network with other researchers. The World Caf\u00e9 session, the informal discussion at the Brussels University Club and the session about current and future research on EU Cohesion Policy were the modules most appreciated, with 73.33% rating them \u2018excellent\u2019. The academic programme was perceived as \u2018excellent\u2019 by 66.67% (compared to 38.5% last year) and \u2018good\u2019 by 33.33%. With the exception of the website, communication tools received a mixed feedback, especially in the case of social media and networking tools, meaning that their use for the Master Class programme should be rethought.

        "2015 RegioStars Awards Ceremony This was the 8 th edition of the competition and a professional panel of judges chose 17 finalists from a total of 143 entries. The 17 innovative and inspiring EU-funded projects were selected from the following categories: Smart Growth, Sustainable Growth, Inclusive Growth, and CityStar. Finalists came from regions and cities in 15 Member States, namely: Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Their work ranged from supporting small and medium-sized businesses through ICT innovation, to energy efficiency measures, promoting social inclusion and urban planning initiatives. The RegioStars finalists and winners exemplify the creative skills and commitment possessed by Europeans and show what can be accomplished with the help of EU funding. The four projects who took home a trophy were: Category 1: Smart Growth: unleashing SME growth potential for a digital economy \u2018Scandinavian Game Developers\u2019 \u2013 Midtjylland (Denmark) and V\u00e4stsverige (Sweden) This project offers advice and training to young entrepreneurs in the Scandinavian digital gaming industry and helps them establish viable companies in a highly competitive business environment. The business incubator in Gren\u00e5 (Denmark) uses a business model developed by the Swedish partner university, the University of Sk\u00f6vde. It has seen the creation of 22 new small companies and currently employs 67 people. Category 2: Sustainable Growth: mobilising investments in energy efficiency for the benefit of citizens and society \u2018PICSA\u2019 \u2013 Andaluc\u00eda (Spain) The Sustainable Construction Programme in Andaluc\u00eda has invested in renovating buildings to improve energy efficiency and regenerating urban areas, by boosting the competitiveness of the construction sector and creating skilled employment. Not only has it made the region\u2019s construction sector greener and helped to create jobs, one of its main goals is also to educate the public on the importance of energy efficient and sustainable construction. The project has achieved energy savings of 26 000 tonnes/year, has avoided the emission of 62 000 tonnes of CO 2 and is expected to create thousands of jobs in the coming years. Category 3: Inclusive Growth: integrating those at risk of social exclusion into society \u2018Diritti a scuola\u2019 \u2013 Puglia (Italy) This project adopted a mixed approach involving both education and social care and has significantly reduced early school leaving in the region. It provided counselling, educational guidance and intercultural mediation, which benefited both students and their families. The percentage of 15-year-old students with limited reading capacities was reduced to 16.7 % in 2012, which is below the national target of 20 %. Similarly, the early school leaving rate decreased from 30.3 % in 2003, to 19.9 % in 2013. In total over 50 000 students and 10 000 families benefitted from the programme, which gave them a new chance at a bright future. Category 4: CityStar: transforming cities for future challenges \u2018Eurocity of Chaves- Ver\u00edn\u2019 \u2013 Galicia (Spain) and North Portugal (Portugal) The cities of Chaves and Ver\u00edn joined forces to create a \u2018Eurocity,\u2019 which shared public services and facilities. This included holding joint cultural events, commerce, sports, leisure and tourism activities and activities to promote entrepreneurship. The project demonstrates that the institutional, economic, social and cultural integration of two cross-border cities is possible and that it can bring real benefits in terms of saving costs, increasing efficiency and diversifying the public services offered to citizens.

A number of Networking Meeting Points were set up at the Centre Borschette and the European Committee of the Regions. The Meeting Place at the European Committee of the Regions also provided participants, journalists and organisers with a network hub for making contacts and exchanging information and ideas.

        "Interactive networking with Interreg Europe The Interreg Europe programme, co-financed by European Regional Development Fund, held two interactive networking sessions: on the low-carbon economy, the environment and resource efficiency, and on research and innovation and the competitiveness of SMEs. In a specially designed networking area in the Atrium on the 5 th and 6 th floors of the European Committee of the Regions, a professional moderator helped OPEN DAYS participants find people with the same interests and exchange information and contacts. The result was some enthusiastic pooling of information about best practices and about challenges in the regions.

        "Evaluation Evaluation of OPEN DAYS 2015 OPEN DAYS 2015 was attended by 5 924 people, from 70 countries. The 10 countries with the most delegates were Belgium, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany, UK, Greece and Sweden. After every OPEN DAYS event the organisers ask for feedback from participants, event partners, speakers and chairpersons, as well as journalists. The online survey available on the event website and a number of interviews carried out at the European Committee of the Regions provide an overview of the level of satisfaction and of suggestions for improvement. At the closing date for responding to the feedback survey, in mid-November, 568 replies had been received (overall response rate of about 10%). The results from the online survey can be summarised as follows: \u2022 the participants, most of whom represented regional or local administrations (47%) and had travelled to Brussels for the event (75%), appreciated the high quality of the OPEN DAYS workshops and sessions, which 33% rated as excellent and 61% as good. 89% of participants evaluated the quality of presentations as good or excellent, and were satisfied with the quality of debate with the audience (78% excellent or good). The majority of the respondents (65%) had attended at least 4 workshops. Those who had taken part in the Meeting Place networking activities at the European Committee of the Regions were satisfied (43% excellent or good), and the sessions organised by the European Commission were rated as excellent (22%) or good (41%). 26% of respondents had attended a local event organised in the Member States. Finally, 82% of the participants who filled in the survey said that they would take part again in the OPEN DAYS \u2013 European Week of Cities and Regions; \u2022 the OPEN DAYS event is well known among media representatives, the majority of which knew about the event before coming, and represented in increasing numbers online media (64%) and the Press (45%), with the main audience being the general public (55%). The media programme proposed was highly appreciated, rated as \u00abvery interesting or interesting\u00bb by 82% of respondents; \u2022 the new OPEN Urban DAY event, with a focus on urban issues, was warmly welcomed. 95% of those who attended the OPEN Urban DAY rated it excellent or good. However, its location away from the European district proved to be a logistical challenge for both participants and organisers; \u2022 the OPEN DAYS University workshops presented new research on regional and urban development. The 11 workshops were, in general, very highly appreciated (91% excellent or good); \u2022 the OPEN DAYS University Masterclass was highly valued by its participants. 80% of the participants felt that their expectations with regard to learning about new trends in regional and urban development research was met, and that the meetings with EU representatives and networking with students with similar interests were very useful. Moreover, 67% rated the organisation of the academic programme and its delivery as excellent; \u2022 the event partners, such as regional partnerships, were, in general, very satisfied with the event\u2019s organisation and outcomes, and the majority of them were in fact returning as partner organisers to the event; \u2022 suggestions for improving the event included: adding more time for debate and exchange between the panel and the audience; including more tangible cases of good practice and reducing general presentations; grouping topics more closely around selected themes; using new and innovative conferencing methods in addition to traditional panel discussion format; more event promotion via social media (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook); and, in the case of certain workshops, providing prior information on topics (to allow for better preparation beforehand, especially when the topic was broad). In addition to the online feedback survey, a number of one-to- one interviews were carried out at the European Committee of the Regions. These reveal that participants\u2019 expectations are highest when it comes to \u201cbeing inspired and learning about best practices and specific topics in EU cohesion policy\u201c, followed by expecting to \u201cnetwork and find potential business partners\u201c and \u00abattend interactive workshops and discussions. OPEN DAYS is also seen as a good platform for raising the profile of their organisations and gaining a better understanding of the role of the European Committee of the Regions among the EU institutions. 172 OPEN DAYS 2014 - 12 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 172 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Livre OD2015.indb 172 08/01/2016 15:44 ",

        "Media analysis A media programme was specifically developed for journalists. It lasted 2.5 days and included on the first day a briefing on the OPEN DAYS event and EU regional policy, a press roundtable with the European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cre\u021bu and President of the European Committee of the Regions, Markku Markkula, and a press point run jointly by the European Commissioners, Corina Cre\u021bu and Carlos Moedas on the \u2018Seal of Excellence\u2019 initiative. The second day the programme offered a meeting with experts from the European Commission on EU Cohesion Policy and fund implementation. Other sessions on \u2018Finding and Understanding the Regional Data\u2019 and \u2018How Cohesion Policy contributes to the Juncker Investment Plan\u2019, as well as a presentation of the RegioStars Award winners and \u2018EU in my Region\u2019 photo competition winners were held prior to the highlight of the day, i.e. the RegioStars Awards Ceremony organised in the evening. Media attending OPEN DAYS had also the opportunity to get outside of the European quarter and visit two ERDF-funded urban development projects: Abattoir and Paepsem Business Park located in the Brussels Canal Zone. KEY FINDINGS Thanks to the participation of nearly 180 journalists from 32 countries, the 13th edition of OPEN DAYS generated the coverage of at least 347 reports published across European media. This constitutes an increase as compared to the previous year (315 pieces of coverage). Journalists working for print press with online editions formed the biggest group (39 %), whereas journalists working for news agencies (10 %) and radio stations (8 %) were in the minority. This distribution across different types of media also found its reflection in the coverage, with 72 % of the collected reports published in print (21 %) and online (51 %) outlets of pan-European, national and regional media. The significant drop in the number of articles published in print as compared to last year (30 %) is in line with the general trend of reporting moving towards the digital sphere. Reports on radio and TV accounted approximately for 7 % and 14 % of total coverage. The event was also well covered by national press agencies such as ANSA (IT), EFE (ES) or PAP (PL). Based on the collected coverage, OPEN DAYS 2015 was most widely covered in Italy with 61 reports, followed by Poland (51 reports), Spain (39 reports) and Portugal (26 reports). Similarly to last year, well over half of the media coverage was disseminated by regional media outlets, which reflects the aim of the organisers to communicate Cohesion Policy more closely to the people and communities involved. Among this year\u2019s OPEN DAYS themes, the second thematic priority, \u2018Regions open for business: SME development, innovation and job creation\u2019, seemed to grab media attention most often. However, issues linked to the urban and rural development were also well covered. Well over half of the coverage gathered mentioned the European Structural and Investment Funds. As in the previous editions of OPEN DAYS, journalists were often looking for local angles, focused on what concerns the regions they come from and referred to the workshops and sessions in which the representatives from their regions or cities participated. In 2015, one of the flagship initiatives of the European Commission, the RegioStars Awards ceremony, was for the first time included in the framework of OPEN DAYS. The most inspiring and innovating projects supported by Cohesion Policy funds were presented and awarded during the special ceremony on the second day of the event. The topic was taken up most often, but not exclusively, in the countries of two winners, i.e. Portugal and Italy. As regards the number of reports referring to RegioStars, although not among winners, Poland took the third place. The finalist project from the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Region that also got a special mention during the ceremony was covered in nearly 20 % of reports gathered from Polish media. 176 OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings Livre OD2015.indb 176 08/01/2016 15:44 ",

As regards the geographical distribution of journalists, OPEN DAYS 2015 was attended by journalists from 27 EU Member States and two candidate/potential candidate countries. Out of the EU28, Luxembourg was not represented. The largest group of journalists came from Italy (20 journalists) and Poland (18 journalists), whereas several countries, e.g. Malta and Lithuania were represented only by one media representative. Customarily, the event enjoyed the biggest interest among journalists coming from the countries receiving the biggest allocations from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds), i.e. Poland, Italy, Spain and Romania.

        "Media analysis Journalists working for print press with online editions formed the biggest group (39 %) of participating media. 16 % were journalists covering only for online outlets such as for instance Energetika.net (SI) or Euractiv (IT and EL) or Contexte (FR). TV stations accounted for 21 % of journalists attending, radio stations for 8 %. National press agencies were very well covered this year (19 journalists), especially taking into account that with some exceptions, there is usually only one major press agency in most of the countries. MEDIA COVERAGE 347 reports from journalists attending OPEN DAYS 2015 were collected, which constitutes a visible, nearly 9 % increase as compared to the previous edition of the event. Most coverage was collected in Italy and Poland, which goes hand-in- hand with the high numbers of journalists attending the event from these countries. Based on the collected clippings, all journalists who covered OPEN DAYS 2015 produced 1.9 reports on average. Similarly to last year, the biggest share of collected reports was published online (51 % in 2015, 56 % in 2014). It is significant to stress that this figure includes online clippings coming from: digital editions of print media, online platforms of TV channels and radio stations as well purely online media. Numerous journalists succeeded in releasing their reports via more than one outlet, for instance in print and online, like in Corriere del Mezzogiorno (IT), Gazeta Wyborcza Torun (PL) and Kommunal (AT), in TV and online, like in RAI 3 (IT), RTVE (ES) and TVP Wroc\u0142aw (PL), and on the radio and online, like in FM99 (LT). The second most prominent media outlet was print (21 % in 2015, 30 % in 2014), followed by TV (14 % in 2015, 6 % in 2014) and radio (7 % in 2015, 8 % in 2014). Reports by press agencies constituted nearly 7 % of the whole coverage, which considering the diffusion potential of the agencies can be considered a major success. Based on their scope, media outlets covering OPEN DAYS 2015 could be divided into national and regional ones. Most of the reports collected were produced by media outlets of regional reach (58 % in 2015, compared to 61 % in 2014).

        "Media analysis QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF MEDIA COVERAGE On a general note, the tone of the media coverage showed most articles adopting a neutral informative way of reporting (89.6 %), with more clearly positive articles (8.9 %), most of them coming from Italy and Finland, than negative ones (1.4 %). When looking at the amount of coverage mentioning the OPEN DAYS event and its themes, out of the 347 reports collected, the European Commission was mentioned in approximately 68% of articles while the European Committee of the Regions was mentioned in 48 % of the articles. 37 % of all articles mentioned both institutions. This demonstrates a high recognition of both institutions hosting the event. The analysis of the gathered coverage shows that out of the three main OPEN DAYS themes, the second one, i.e. \u2018Regions open for business\u2019 was most frequently referred to by the media. Nearly 40 % of the articles elaborated on regional development mentioning SME development, innovation and job creation. A third of the articles focused on urban and rural development, whereas only a few articles reported on the regions in the Energy Union and the Single Digital Market and Juncker Plan. The RegioStars Awards, which were handed out for the first time within the framework of OPEN DAYS, also gathered some visible media attention which shows a strong interest for this special event. More than a third of the gathered reports (38 %) included statements from European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cre\u021bu (27 %), the President of the European Committee of the Regions, Markku Markkula (11.5 %) and the European Commissioner Carlos Moedas (7.5 %). On the whole, 60 % of articles quoted other personalities, mainly Members of the European Committee of the Regions, Members of the European Parliament, Presidents of Political Groups at the European Parliament and Commissioners whose portfolios are related to some of the structural funds projects such as Commissioner Phil Hogan, Commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger, Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete, Commisioner Kristalina Georgieva or Commissioner Marianne Thyssen. Some of them participated in the CoR plenary session taking place during OPEN DAYS. To a lesser extent, other representatives of EU liaison regional offices, mayors, presidents or ministers of regions were also referred to. This reflects journalists\u2019 own interests to set regional issues in the wider context as well as looking for their national angle of interest into this event, some of them demonstrating through their articles that they have taken advantage of this unique opportunity to report on the participation of their region\u2019s representatives in OPEN DAYS 2015. SOCIAL MEDIA 7.098 mentions of relevant hashtags ( #EUOpenDays 6.544, #opendata 538, #regiostars 472, #urban 82 ) were recorded on social media during the four days. This is an excellent result with an increase of 61.9%, compared to 2014 with 4.400 mentions for #euopendays. People took the opportunity of the #euopendays to use several other hashtags which brought attention to the whole event, the various workshops and benefitted to all topics. It widened the impact of the OPEN DAYS, by ensuring that the event was referenced in online questions about other issues, such as open data, urban issues, cooperation, cities, innovation, etc\u2026 EU OPEN DAYS 2015 #urban: 82 (1.1%) #euopendays: 6544 (85.7%) #regiostars: 472 (6.2%) #opendata: 538 (7%) OPEN DAYS 2015 - 13 th European Week of Regions and Cities - Proceedings 179 Livre OD2015.indb 179 08/01/2016 15:44 ",

        "OPEN DAYS 2016 The European Week of Regions and Cities 2016: Regions and cities for sustainable and inclusive growth In 2016, the European Week of Regions and cities will continue to be the platform connecting regions and cities from all over Europe and beyond. It will strive to be the meeting place for exchange of knowledge and good practices for thousands of local, regional, national and European decision-makers and experts to discuss on regional and local development. Moreover it will offer its participants an excellent opportunity to showcase their capacity for creating growth and jobs and implementing European Union cohesion policy, alongside other policies with a territorial impact, and to demonstrate the importance of the local level for good European governance. The themes of the 14th European Week of Regions Cities will be timed according to the EU cohesion policy cycle and implementation of its programmes and be aligned with the European Commission\u2019s and the European Committee of the Regions\u2019 political priorities for 2016. Discussions will highlight the importance of EU cohesion policy in the context of the mid-term review of the EU budget for 2014-2020 and include early reflections on the preparation for the post-2020 period. The European Week of Regions and Cities taking place on 10-13 October 2016 will feature a programme of around 120 workshops and debates - completed with networking activities - around the working themes of Sustained and sustainable economic growth, Inclusive economic growth and Making ESI Funds simple. In addition to the Brussels-based sessions, we shall once again involve our local partners in the + 200 local events, organised between September and November 2016 across Europe. Last but not least: beginning in 2016, the OPEN DAYS will be re-branded and called the \u00abEuropean Week of Regions and Cities\u00bb to avoid confusion with all other \u2018open days\u2019 organised by universities and other institutions. The name will change but the engagement and enthusiasm will remain.
