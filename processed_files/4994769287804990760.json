        "Fighting Malaria: EU Research and Innovation role Malaria is an old infectious disease that still kills nearly one million people every year, mostly children and women in developing countries. While in certain geographical areas malaria control has been remarkable, thanks to insecticide-treated bed nets and effective treatment; the development of resistances to insecticides, to medicines and the quality of the health systems in these regions are threats that demand increased research efforts. Europe has been traditionally strong in malaria research. More recently, targeted and sustained support for malaria research at EU level, through the 6th and 7th Framework Programmes for research and technological development (FP6 (2002-2006) and FP7 (2007-2013)), has contributed to better structure the malaria research, under complementary research projects and networks, around few key areas: fundamental research on the malaria parasite, development of new drugs, research and development of a vaccine, research to control the malaria-transmitting mosquito vector, research for better diagnostic tests and operational research for better control intervention tools and strategies. Considerable efforts are being undertaken to ensure adequate participation of research groups from endemic countries, in particular from Africa, aiming at strenghten research capacities in these countries.

Malaria is a severe febrile, vector-borne disease caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium which is transmitted to humans through the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. The most lethal of the malaria parasites that infect humans is Plasmodium falciparum, which is especially common in Sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is also present in tropical and subtropical areas of Central and South America, Asia and the Middle East, there, however, often with another predominant species, P. vivax. The knowledge gaps and research needs are multiple, especially when the ultimate goal is the complete eradication of malaria, where therefore the efficacy and efficiency of prevention, treatment and diagnostic tools need to be raised significantly. Significant research investments are also needed to most efficiently deploy implementation schemes in the context of the poor health- system conditions. Preventing Malaria can be prevented by different means, e.g. by fighting the mosquito using physical or chemical barriers (e.g. insecticide treated bed nets, repellents) to prevent infected mosquitoes from biting and infecting humans, by killing or debilitating the mosquitoes (spraying insecticides, biological pest control), or by preventing their proliferation (e.g. sterile insects technology). In addition other new tools directed at blocking the transmission of parasites are under investigation, such as a transmission blocking vaccine. One of the world\u2019s most important public health concerns The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the parasite infected around 225 million and killed nearly 800 000 people worldwide in 2009, mostly among children under 5 years old and pregnant women. Africa is the most affected continent. Malaria versus development According to the World Bank, it is estimated that malaria reduces GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth globally by approximately 1 full percentage point per year. The lower rates of economic growth shown by malaria- endemic countries (Fig. 1) hamper their development. The reduction of the malaria burden is clearly targeted in the United Nation\u2019s Millennium Development Goals and many initiatives have recently been taken to try to eradicate the disease. Among them is the Global Malaria Action Plan (GMAP), the roadmap for malaria control and elimination worldwide which has been developed by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, the World Bank, the Bill & Melissa Gates Foundation and many other partners). The parasite causing malaria is a sophisticated organism with a complex life cycle (Fig.2). It is present in human liver and blood cells for much of this cycle and hence well-adapted to outsmart the human immune system and, equally so, medical prevention and treatment devices. Sexual proliferation of the parasite requires passing through a mosquito-borne life stage, to which the parasite is equally well adapted. While in certain geographical areas progress in malaria control has been remarkable due to the use of insecticide- treated bed nets and the availability of effective treatment, potential threats demand increased attention: the development of resistance to insecticides and to antimalarial medicines, as well as precarious health systems characteristic of many of the most vulnerable regions of the world.

Protecting from malaria through use of an efficacious and efficient vaccine, would probably be the most powerful prevention tool. Such a vaccine does not exist yet, but a promising vaccine candidate product (RTS\u2019S, developed by GSK Biologicals) is presentlyin phase 3 trials ongoing at several sites in Africa (http:// www.malariavaccine.org). If an anti-infection vaccine becomes available in the near future, it will need to be highly effective since natural immunity to the disease may be lowered in vaccinated populations in endemic regions. Research into developing a highly efficacious vaccine would be facilitated if the mechanisms of naturally acquired immunity of exposed populations were better understood, and a broadly efficacious malaria vaccine will probably need to integrate multiple antigens into a multi- component vaccine. Prevention in risk groups is also possible through intermittent preventive drug treatment (IPT), e.g. for pregnant women and small children, with some possible safety issues concerning giving certain antimalarial drugs in early pregnancy, and the issue of potential development of drug resistance due to large- scale application. Treating Treatment of malaria patients with drugs requires continuous research and development efforts to generate new anti-malaria drugs, and preferably acting on new biological targets, since expanded use of drugs triggers the rapid development of resistance. Research is also needed to reveal the mechanisms of such resistance development, and how these can be circumvented. The large molecule libraries now being available from industry and from collections of traditional remedies represent resources that deserve to be tapped into on a larger scale. Diagnostics Efficient treatment in malaria-endemic regions requires differentiating febrile diseases with tools for rapid diagnosis which are not only sensitive and specific, but also affordable, reliable and robust, since the traditional microscopic analysis of blood films is not always feasible and accurate, especially in resource-poor settings. In addition, high-throughput molecular tools are needed as surveillance tools, e.g. for monitoring drug resistance markers. And large scale diagnostics of asymptomatic carriers will be a particular challenge for elimination and eradication efforts. 6 7 The European Commission, since 2002 and up to 2010, has supported malaria research through its successive Framework Programmes for Research and Development FP6 and FP7 (~ \u20ac 180 million). Under the EU\u2019s previous Framework Programme for Research (FP6, 2002-2006), a total of 18 cooperative malaria research projects were supported to the tune of about \u20ac 100 million (Fig.3). These include three large projects which have helped greatly to structure the European Research Area (ERA) in the field of malaria research (Fig.4): (1) a strong malaria basic research network (BioMalPar), (2) an Integrated Project to develop new anti- malarial drugs (ANTIMAL) and (3) the European Malaria Vaccine Development Association (EMVDA), the latter coordinated by EMVI (European Malaria Vaccine Initiative, now EVI). EU malaria research support is also given through the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP), a programme which supports phase 2 and 3 trials as well as capacity building related to malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis research in Africa. Under FP7 (2007-2013), European research, in the field of malaria, is being consolidated and reinforced with continuity of funding of basic research in malaria (Fig.5). The EU has also tackled identified gaps in certain sub-areas of malaria research, for example, malaria in pregnancy, was covered by a specific topic under FP7\u2019s first call for proposals, in addition a major project on controlling the malaria mosquito vector is going to be financed, half way through the FP7. 3.

        "Fighting Malaria: EU Research and Innovation role Malaria is an old infectious disease that still kills nearly one million people every year, mostly children and women in developing countries. While in certain geographical areas malaria control has been remarkable, thanks to insecticide-treated bed nets and effective treatment; the development of resistances to insecticides, to medicines and the quality of the health systems in these regions are threats that demand increased research efforts. Europe has been traditionally strong in malaria research. More recently, targeted and sustained support for malaria research at EU level, through the 6th and 7th Framework Programmes for research and technological development (FP6 (2002-2006) and FP7 (2007-2013)), has contributed to better structure the malaria research, under complementary research projects and networks, around few key areas: fundamental research on the malaria parasite, development of new drugs, research and development of a vaccine, research to control the malaria-transmitting mosquito vector, research for better diagnostic tests and operational research for better control intervention tools and strategies. Considerable efforts are being undertaken to ensure adequate participation of research groups from endemic countries, in particular from Africa, aiming at strenghten research capacities in these countries.
