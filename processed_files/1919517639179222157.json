        "An evolving EU rural development policy Over the years, the objectives of the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have retained a stable core based on the treaties of the EU but have been interpreted in ways which have evolved to reflect the changing context and societal needs. Moreover, successive reforms have led to changes in the instruments used. Originally, elements of rural development policy were embedded in the CAP. A separate and specific EU rural development policy became operational in 2000 when the CAP was reorganised into two pillars. The CAP\u2019s first pillar covers direct payments and market measures and the second CAP pillar covers multi-annual rural development measures. The CAP\u2019s two pillars are complementary and EU rural development policy oper- ates within this context. Rural development policy\u2019s evolution since its inception has helped the policy grow and adapt to reflect key EU priori- ties. Its emphasis on investment for success has enabled many farmers to learn new techniques, upgrade facilities and carry out essential restructuring, thus sharpening their competitive edge. In addition, very substantial provisions for the good of the environment are helping to turn the tide with regard to challenges of biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, soil and water quality, and landscape preservation. Rural development policy has also embraced the need to support different types of job creation plus the provision of basic services in our countryside. These help to promote quality of life, which is acknowledged as an important factor for sustaining thriving rural communities. These positive policy contributions are making a real difference in Europe\u2019s countryside yet considerable development challenges do remain. Such concerns must be firmly addressed if rural Europe is to fully share in the \u2018smart\u2019, \u2018sustainable\u2019 and \u2018inclusive\u2019 growth advocated by the EU\u2019s Europe 2020 1 strategy. One of the main challenges relates to the EU farm sector, which is still under immense pressure. For instance, issues linked to threats such as price volatility need ro- bust responses to help EU agriculture hold its ground in competitive global markets and remain one of the central props of the EU\u2019s long-term food security. At the same time, although the advance of environmental threats has in many cases been slowed, it has for the most part not yet been reversed. Hence, considerable resources are still needed to help give economic gains in rural areas a sound environmental dimension. We need to care even better for our natural heritage and to combat the develop- ment and impact of climate change. Finally, the progress already made in laying down the es- sential conditions for successful living in the countryside must be sustained. Rolling out broadband internet access and setting up basic social services are just two examples of the many tasks to be addressed so that priority groups like young people, families and businesses can have a viable and attractive alternative to living in towns and cities. Rural development policy\u2019s broad reach creates a variety of socio-economic and environmental benefits.

        "New p olic y prop osals In light of the needs, challenges and opportunities that still exist throughout Member States\u2019 rural areas, the European Commission has developed proposals for the operation of rural development policy from 2014 to 2020. The process of developing this new EU rural development policy has been supported by a major public debate on the future of the CAP. In its Communication on \u2018 The CAP towards 2020\u2019 , the European Commission presented three broad policy options for the future of the CAP. A number of parallel analyses were conducted on the options to inform the policy development process. This was followed up by a consultation with stakeholders and other institutions. New proposals for reforming the CAP after 2013 were then released in October 2011. The proposals included a draft regulation 2 covering support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). This new EAFRD proposal builds on rural development policy\u2019s CAP foundations and is closely aligned to the Europe 2020 strategy for growth. In order to focus on the Europe 2020 objectives, greater integration is foreseen between EU policies in rural areas. New agreements will coordinate rural development policy\u2019s role alongside other EU fund- ing instruments in order to achieve efficiencies and synergies across the EU policy framework. Figure 1 illustrates the linkages between the CAP pillars and other EU funds. Further information about the new legislative framework is presented in the following section and an annex to this publica- tion presents a summary of the new legal proposals that apply to the EAFRD\u2019s 2014-2020 period. Detail from the EU\u2019s multiannual financial framework 3 for 2014-2020 notes that funding for rural de- velopment policy should be maintained at current levels, namely \u20ac14.6 billion per annum for the full 2014-2020 programming period. Future funding will ensure that rural development policy continues to go about its business with an evolving approach to match the changes taking place around it. Rural Europe has considerable potential as an attractive and enjoyable place to live, work, and visit.

        "Getting our priorities right In order to deliver good value for money for the EU tax- payer, rural development policy must have a clear mission. This mission concords with the objectives of the CAP as a whole and also to the Europe 2020 strategy, which explains why and how future economic growth in the EU should be smart (based on knowledge and innovation), sustainable (in line with the long-term needs of the planet) and inclusive (beneficial to all society). Europe 2020 also re-affirms targets to which the EU has already committed itself, such as a goal to cut total greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % from their 1990 level by the year 2020. In line with Europe 2020 and the overall CAP objectives, the main mission of EU rural development policy from 2014 to 2020 can be stated in terms of three long-term strategic objectives, which are to contribute to: \u2022 the competitiveness of agriculture; \u2022 the sustainable management of natural resources, and climate action; \u2022 a balanced territorial development of rural areas. These ambitions are similar to those which currently shape rural development policy. For the purposes of managing the use of rural development policy through rural develop- ment programmes (RDPs) after 2013, the broad long-term objectives outlined above will be referred to as the RDP \u2019priorities\u2018. RDP priorities will have corresponding \u2019areas of intervention\u2018. RDP priorities and areas of intervention will provide the basis for rolling out EAFRD support to EU rural areas. They shall also be used to set quantified RDP targets that will be agreed by the Commission and each RDP managing authority. Importantly, the themes of: \u2018fostering innovation\u2019; \u2018contrib- uting to climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019; and \u2018caring for the environment\u2019 are considered to be common goals for all RDP priorities and areas of intervention. This means that even though these cross-cutting themes may have particularly strong links to certain RDP priorities, all of them must be adequately addressed in every aspect of the 2014-2020 RDPs. Table 1 presents a summary of the proposed new priorities for rural development policy and associated areas of intervention. A brief rationale is also provided to highlight the reasons why the different policy aspects are relevant. All of these proposed EAFRD priori- ties and areas of intervention will be carefully coordinated with other EU funds supporting rural areas. European agriculture needs to be a driver of the Europe 2020 strategy in our countryside. Innovative technological developments can help rural businesses compete and tackle environmental challenges. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 4 ",
        "RDP priority: Fostering knowledge transfer in agriculture, forestry and rural areas. Areas of Intervention: \u2022 Fostering innovation and the knowledge base in rural areas. \u2022 Strengthening research and innovation links in agriculture and forestry. \u2022 Fostering lifelong learning and vocational training in agriculture and forestry sectors. Why? Knowledge, skills and innovation are the indispensable foundation of sustainable development. Rural areas often need help in this respect (for example, only 20 % of EU farmers have received a formal agricultural train- ing) and gaps need to be narrowed between researchers and farmers or foresters. RDP priority: Enhancing the competitiveness of all types of agriculture and enhancing farm viability. Areas of Intervention: \u2022 Facilitating restructuring of farms facing major structural problems (notably farms with a low degree of market participation, or market-orientated farms active in particular sectors, or farms in need of agricultural diversification). \u2022 Facilitating a balanced age structure in the agricultural sector. Why? Various forces pose threats to farmers\u2019 incomes, and therefore farmers working within a variety of farming models should aim to continue to become more competitive. In some cases further restructuring is needed. Given that only six percent of farm managers are aged below 35, more young people must be encouraged to bring their energy and ideas to the farm sector. Prop osed RDP priorities and areas of inter vention for 2014 -2020 \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 5 ",
        "RDP priority: Promoting food chain organisation and risk management in agriculture. Areas of Intervention: \u2022 Better integrating primary producers into the food chain through quality schemes, promotion in local markets and short-supply chains, producer groups and \u2018inter-branch\u2019 organisations. \u2022 Supporting risk management on farms. Why? Farmers\u2019 position in the food supply chain can be relatively weak and they can benefit from organising themselves better to improve revenue opportunities. One route to doing so lies in local markets and short-supply chains. Risk management tools are needed to help farmers cope better with the uncertainty created by problems of weather, animal disease and market volatility. RDP priority: Restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems dependent on agriculture and forestry. Areas of Intervention: \u2022 Restoring and preserving biodiversity (including in Natura 2000 areas and areas of high nature value farming) and the state of European landscapes. \u2022 Improving water management. \u2022 Improving soil manage ment. Why? Pressures on the environment are still very prevalent. For example, only 17 % of EU habitats and 11 % of eco- systems are considered to be in a \u2019favourable\u2018 state, nutrient surpluses persist in some water bodies (despite progress in others), and 45 % of EU soils suffer from problems of quality. These challenges need to be remedied and the positive environmental contributions of farming and forestry should be strengthened. \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 6 ",
        "RDP priority: Promoting resource efficiency and supporting the shift towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy in the agriculture, food and forestry sectors. Areas of Intervention: \u2022 Increasing efficiency in water use by agriculture. \u2022 Increasing efficiency in energy use in agriculture and food processing. \u2022 Facilitating the supply and use of renewable sources of energy, by-products, wastes, residues and other non-food raw materials for the bio-economy. \u2022 Reducing nitrous oxide and methane emissions from agriculture. \u2022 Fostering carbon sequestration in agriculture and forestry. Why? In all economic sectors, \u2019smart\u2018 and \u2019sustainable\u2018 growth must look after scarce resources. Agriculture must use energy and water more efficiently (farms account for about 24 % of total EU water abstractions) while cutting its emissions of greenhouse gases and sequestering carbon. Farming and other rural sectors can supply essential raw materials for use in the bio-economy. RDP priority: Promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas. Areas of Intervention: \u2022 Facilitating diversification, creation of new small enterprises and job creation. \u2022 Promoting local development in rural areas. \u2022 Enhancing accessibility to, and use and quality of information and communication technologies (ICT) in rural areas. Why? Some 14 % of the population in the EU\u2019s predominantly rural regions suffers from employment rates of less than half the EU average, and there are areas of low per-capita GDP. Much can be done to help create a wider variety of better quality jobs and an improved level of overall local development, including through ICT. \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 7 ",
        "Several EU funds provide support for rural areas. Namely the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). It makes sense to identify the common characteristics of these funds and legislate for these together in one legal document, harmonising and simplifying rules where pos- sible and appropriate. This type of common regulation will be a cornerstone for the other contractual tools designed to improve co-ordination between policies (see below). Nevertheless, rural development policy will keep its distinc- tive identity. Specific aspects of the policy\u2019s operation will Delivering on priorities: the overall approach Figure 2: Rural development policy in a new framework Getting the priorities right gives a good starting point, but no more than that. In order to deliver on promises made and provide good value for money, the structure and basic approach of rural development policy must be stronger than ever before. Part of the recipe for effective delivery concerns coordination with other EU policies. Thus, rural devel- opment policy must stand shoulder to shoulder with other policies if the EU is to meet its Europe 2020 objec- tives. A new legal mechanism, referred to as a \u2018Common Strategic Framework\u2019 (CSF), is proposed to ensure this coordination. Polic y co - ordination at EU level 8 ",
        "be covered by a regulation applying only to rural devel- opment policy and common financial and management provisions by another regulation applying to the entire CAP. An essential tool for helping EU funding instruments to work together after 2013 will be the CSF. This is to cover the EAFRD, ERDF, ESF, CF and EMFF. The CSF\u2019s main role will be to help the different funds involved to complement each other. In particular, it will clarify how they can work together in the service of the Europe 2020 priorities of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as translated into more detailed thematic objectives and priorities. CSF systems will also strengthen provision for \u2019territorial\u2018 (cross-sectoral) co-operation between funds. This will be useful for development topics such as reinforcing rural- urban links. Very importantly, the CSF will be sufficiently detailed to provide genuine improvements in co-ordination between funds, but suffi- ciently flexible to allow each policy covered to fulfil its own mission. It will replace the EU Strategic Guidelines which currently apply to rural development policy. Partnership contracts will formalise co-or- dination approaches between policies at national level. The partnership contracts will be the next section of the bridge be- tween challenges at EU level on the one hand and those at national, regional and local level on the other hand. In the case of rural develop- ment policy, these partnership contracts will replace the current National Strategy Plans. Partnership contracts will be agreed for each Member State and cover the same EU funds as the CSF. Contract content will set out how the Member State will use and coordinate CSF funds together to serve the Europe 2020 objectives (in co-ordination with a Member State\u2019s National Reform Programme). Partnership contracts will therefore provide a useful bird\u2019s- eye view in any given Member State of the main features of all the EU programmes for that Member State which are covered by the CSF, including indicative financial indica- tions for each EU fund and the main results expected for each fund. Nevertheless, partnership contracts will leave a number of important processes at the level of individual programmes (e.g. the setting of binding quantified targets as noted below). Urban areas are important markets and service centres for rural businesses and Europe\u2019s countryside is popular among urban populations. The new CSF approach represents a significant step forward in coordinating EU funds in rural areas \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 9 ",
        "RDPs have been beneficial in the past and comparable programmes will still remain the focal point for imple- menting rural development policy. RDP content will be influenced by the CSF and by partnership contracts. As in the current period, some RDPs will cover entire countries, whereas others will cover a given region. The most important elements of drawing up RDPs will be: \u2022 Conducting an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) related to the area to be covered by the programme; \u2022 Setting quantified targets against the new RDP priorities and associated areas of intervention, using consistent target indicators from the Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF). RDP indicators must take account of the lessons learnt from experiences with implementing pillar 2 of the CAP. The indicators and baseline data needs to be accurate and broad enough to say something meaningful with regard to rural development, but also specific enough to clearly measure what difference RDP actions are making in relation to the influence of a host of external factors; \u2022 Explaining how, for each priority, the cross-cutting themes of innovation, environment and climate change mitigation and adaptation will be properly taken into account; and \u2022 Choosing combinations of measures to address the priorities and cross-cutting themes and to meet the targets. RDP implementation prop osals RDP measures As previously, the measures involved in implementing RDPs are set out in EU legislation. It should be emphasised that the new RDP measures are defined mainly according to types of support and beneficiary rather than according to priorities (e.g. investment support or area-based pay- ment support, farmer beneficiaries or other business beneficiaries etc). Commission proposals for rural development policy meas- ures for after 2013 are a judicious blend of old and new. They take measures which have proved their worth in the current period and update them. The result aims to make these modernised measures work more efficiently, and to make them better reflect the priorities of rural development policy as well as the cross-cutting themes of innovation, climate change and environmental care. Some brand-new measures are also appearing in the menu. The number of measures presented for the 2014-2020 RDPs is less than the current menu of 2007-2013 measures. But this should not be mistaken for lack of content. In many cases, individual measures from the present period are being rolled together so that Member States can choose an implementation adapted to their needs . This new menu provides a very solid range of tools for meeting the various challenges faced by rural areas. Figure 3 shows the proposed measures of rural develop- ment policy. An indication is provided concerning which measures are particularly relevant for each of the Union pri- orities for rural development. However, it must be strongly emphasized that no measure is \u201cpriority-specific\u201d. It will be up to Member States/Regions to decide which measures to use to serve a given priority. Some measures in particular are clearly relevant for several Union priorities. Descriptions of proposed new EAFRD measures can be found on the ENRD website at http://enrd.ec.europa.eu/en/home-page_en.cfm 10 ",
        "There will be a much firmer emphasis on the use of these new measures in combination. It is clear that many or even most priorities and targets cannot be met through the use of one measure alone. Therefore, Member States and regions should in the future set out a clear intervention logic illus- trating how measures will work together. The programming system will take account of the fact that a given measure can contribute to more than one priority at a time. Other innovations for the next gen- eration of RDPs include the possibility to set up \u2018sub- programmes\u2019 to address particular groups, areas or objectives (see page 15 for more information about the sub programme proposals). Figure 3: Indicative list of measures showing their relevance to the priorities of rural development policy Combinations of EAFRD measures can be used to promote more and better rural products, like organic food, for EU citizens. \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 11 ",
        "Rewarding good p er formance Overall targets for each RDP will express objectives for that programme during its lifetime. It also makes sense to set milestones along the way (intermediate targets) to check that everything is moving in the right direction at the right speed. Therefore, within a new performance framework, formal milestones will be agreed for all RDPs in relation to some of the overall targets agreed between the Commission and the Member State. If the milestones are not reached, the Commission will make recommendations to correct the situation. For milestones that have been achieved, further EAFRD allocations may be released at a later stage from a Member State\u2019s rural development \u2018performance reserve\u2019 budget (containing five percent of its total EAFRD budget). These performance reserve funds will be available to support additional rural development actions within priorities for which the milestones have been reached. 12 ",
        "E x ante conditionalities New draft rules that will govern the implementation of rural development policy include an explicit recognition that RDPs function best if certain prior conditions have been met. These are referred to as \u2018ex ante conditionalities\u2019. Many ex ante conditionalities are a matter of common sense. For example, Member States and regions should make sure that they have sufficient staff and IT systems of adequate quality to put their programmes into action. They must also have accredited paying agencies to ensure that funding absorption targets are achievable. Where such important conditions are not fulfilled by a certain date, the Commission will agree steps to be taken with the Member State or region in question. Sterner action could follow later if necessary. RDP managing authorities must have competence to implement all rules governing EAFRD operations. Rewarding good p er formance Overall targets for each RDP will express objectives for that programme during its lifetime. It also makes sense to set milestones along the way (intermediate targets) to check that everything is moving in the right direction at the right speed. Therefore, within a new performance framework, formal milestones will be agreed for all RDPs in relation to some of the overall targets agreed between the Commission and the Member State. If the milestones are not reached, the Commission will make recommendations to correct the situation.

        "Flexibility will continue to be an essential feature for all RDPs. This will ensure that EU rural development policy retains its capacity for meeting the varied needs of rural areas from one corner of the EU to another. In addition to the standard programme-based structure, Member States and regions will also now be given the op- portunity to offer special support to certain groups, areas or objectives, if they wish. The new draft EAFRD regulation notes that particular attention is needed for: \u2022 Young farmers are the guarantors of the future of agriculture, and they bring essential new energy and ideas to the sector. However, they face various difficulties, especially in terms of access to land and credit. The attractions of lifestyles in towns and cities can also deter young people from entering into rural- based career paths. Only six percent of EU farmers are aged below 35, and the figure is falling. \u2022 Small farms often have a particular contribution to make to product diversity, habitat conservation (e.g. because of a high number of field boundaries) and social focus for rural communities. However, in some areas of the EU they face somewhat different challenges from those faced by larger farms. \u2022 Mountain areas in many cases offer distinctive products and essential and attractive ecosystems. Yet, they may often face their own quite particular challenges related to climate and distance from centres of population. \u2022 Short-supply chains can bring economic, environmental and social benefits (by securing a greater share of added value for farmers, by reducing the carbon footprint of food distribution, and by enabling face-to-face contact between producers and buyers). It can be helpful to cut the distance from the farm gate to the dinner plate, however, considerable effort is sometimes needed to start up viable alternatives to well-established longer supply chains. \u2022 Finally, in some parts of the EU there are particular agricultural sectors in need of restructuring which have a substantial impact on a specific rural area. Special attention to special cases EAFRD support can be tailored to properly reflect the special development needs of certain target groups, like mountain farms. \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 14 ",
        "Small farms will be one of the categories of beneficiaries which can be targeted by specific RDP sub-programmes and/or higher rates of RDP funding. Sub -programmes and higher aid intensities Member States and regions will have the opportunity to draw up rural development sub-programmes that pay particular attention to the needs of any of the themes noted in the draft regulation. Sub-programmes will operate within the main RDP structure. Each sub-programme will contain: \u2022 A specific analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) related to the theme in question; and \u2022 Specific targets to be achieved and a relevant selection of measures. Within sub-programmes, investment measures used in favour of small farms and short-supply chains will attract a higher maximum rate of public spending in relation to total spending on the measures (in techni- cal language: an extra 10 percentage points of aid intensity). Under the measure supporting investments in physical assets, in the case of young farmers and mountain areas higher maximum rates of aid intensity will be on offer . \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 15 ",
        "Over the years, the Leader approach has proved itself as an effective tool for handing power to \u2019people on the ground\u2018 to examine the challenges and opportunities which they face, come up with their ideas in response and turn these into reality. Valuable lessons yielded from the current 2007- 2013 period will be applied to bring out the proper flavour of Leader more fully after 2013 while also further raising participation. A number of adjustments will be made to keep Leader true to its traditions and clear away certain organisational problems. Examples include: \u2022 Clarification that Leader must serve the objectives of rural development policy in a spirit of innovation, and not be bound by the rules of predefined measures. \u2022 A limit of 49 % on the voting rights of the public sector and any single interest group in the decision-making process of a local development strategy (LDS). Boos ting capacit y In order to fulfil its mission, the Leader approach must be as accessible as possible to anyone with the required level of commitment and innovative spirit. But to use Leader effectively, expertise is needed and some potential groups may have less of this than others. Therefore, after 2013 there will be a stronger and more explicit emphasis on building the necessary capacity to maximise Leader\u2019s positive impact. EAFRD will be available to cover a preparatory phase, during which time Local Action Groups (LAGs) can build up their base of knowledge and skills for the subsequent implementation of a LDS. As a special provision for potential LAGs which were not involved in Leader during the 2007-2013 period, a new \u2019Leader start-up kit\u2018 will be introduced, to be adapted to the particular needs of a given territory. Potential LAGs that make use of the kit will receive support for building capacity and will also be able to experiment with small pilot projects. If local partnerships use the start-up kit to try out Leader methods for a time and decide it is not for them, they will be under no obligation to implement a LDS. Stay in the Lead Leader methodologies have a productive track record and support a wide spectrum of rural society \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 16 ",
        "The Leader approach has attracted interest from stake- holders in the ERDF and the ESF. The EMFF already supports its own types of LDS methodology. There is considerable scope for ensuring that local partnerships are free to use these EU funds in a co-ordinated way. After 2013, when the selection committee for an LDS decides that it will need to use more than one EU fund, it will be free to designate a \u2019lead fund\u2018 if it so wishes. In this case, the strategy\u2019s running costs, \u2019animation\u2018 and networking activities will be financed from the lead fund only. All other finance will be drawn from the respective fund concerned in each case.

        "Net work ing Launched in 2008, the European Network for Rural Development (ENRD) and the Member States\u2019 National Rural Networks (NRNs) have made important contribu- tions to the delivery of rural development policy. Working in liaison, they have demonstrated their po- tential to play a series of useful roles in adding value to, and enriching the quality of, RDP delivery. They have helped to improve the consistency in programming and led to regular exchanges of in- formation and practices be- tween RDP stakeholders. They have also been instrumental in essential capacity building work supporting Leader ap- proaches and their existence has assisted joint analyses which provide advantageous perspectives at EU and na- tional levels. Positive networking experi- ences have also been shown from the operations of the European Evaluation Network. Particular progress has been made here in enhancing the effectiveness of RDP evalua- tion practices through the CMEF and the relevance of such work is to be reinforced for the 2014-2020 period. Networking approaches will therefore continue to play a key role for the development of rural areas. Networking approaches will be built on in the future to extend the engagement of stakeholders in the governance of rural development policy, and the sharing of expertise, plus of course for spreading innovation. Innovation Innovation of various kinds can be an engine of progress. Objectives in the EU\u2019s Europe 2020 growth strategy under- score the importance for all parts of Europe (rural and urban) to harness this innovation en- gine equally. New products, services, technologies, pro- cesses and forms of organi- sation (among other things) can lift the profits of a farm or other rural business, deliver better care for the environ- ment and strengthen the so- cial fabric of the countryside. In the current period of 2007-2013, various rural de- velopment measures can be used in the service of in- novation. This provision will be even stronger after 2013 and measures addressing knowledge transfer, advisory services, investments in physical assets or co-operation will be especially relevant (so will the Leader approach). Above and beyond these possibilities within individual measures and Leader, rural development policy will be a tool for helping to fan the flames of creative thinking in new ways. Enhancing networking and nurturing innovation Through networking, information exchange, and capacity building actions, the ENRD and NRNs are helping to connect rural Europe. Improvements in the quality of EU food is a typical example of the benefits that innovative rural development ideas can produce. \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 18 ",
        "Europ ean Innovation Par tnership A \u2018European Innovation Partnership (EIP) for Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability\u2019 is being cur- rently developed that aims to interlink existing policies and to foster co-operation among partners in view of exploiting the potential for innovative breakthroughs. For achieving this, the EIP needs to build bridges between cutting-edge research and technology and practitioners, and to raise awareness on the need for investing in innovation. In this way, the EIP will help facilitate a resource-efficient, productive and low-emission farm sector which works in harmony with the natural resources on which it depends. Within this EIP, operational groups (consisting of farmers, researchers, advisors, businesses and NGO in the agri-food sector) will draw on rural development funding measures to organise themselves and to run innovative projects, of which the results will be published. Drawing on the ENRD experiences, an EIP Network will be set up that works as a mediator enhancing communication between science and practice and fostering cooperation. It will support the work of operational groups through seminars, data bases, and help desk functions; it will stimulate discussion among interested parties by reporting on relevant research, promoting good practice in terms of innova- tive projects, and organising conferences and workshops. Small rural businesses will continue to be a priority for EAFRD support throughout the 27 Member States As part of its encouragement for innovative thinking, rural development policy will offer a limited number of annual cash prizes to projects exemplifying innovative local co- operation involving partners from at least two Member States. The prizes may be of particular interest to people or businesses that are not drawing funding from a RDP, though candidates may also be involved in such a programme. A final category of innovation to be mentioned is the crea- tive use of financial tools, such as guarantee funds, loan funds and venture capital funds. All of these have a place alongside traditional direct grants in helping to provide the capital which farms and other rural businesses need to thrive, especially small businesses. Clearer rules will be drawn up to help direct and demon- strate how rural development policy after 2013 can support the use of such tools. The new rules will be designed to clear away many long-standing obstacles to their popularity. Innovation incentives \u00a9 T i m H u d s o n 19 ",
