Using a scale from 1 (full inequality) to 100 (full equality), it measures the differences between women and men in key domains of the EU policy framework (work, money, knowledge, time, power and health). The Index also measures violence against women and intersecting inequalities. These are satellite domains and are part of the framework of the Gender Equality Index, but do not have an impact on the overall score. Intersecting inequalities show how gender intersects with age, education, family composition, country of birth and disability. The Gender Equality Index provides results for each domain and sub-domain for the EU and its 28 Member States (1). (1) The Gender Equality Index 2017 is based on the data of Eurostat (Education statistics, EU Labour Force Survey, European Health Interview Survey, EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, Structure of Earnings Survey), of Eurofound (European Quality of Life Survey, European Working Conditions Survey), of EIGE\u2019s Gender Statistics Database (Women and Men in Decision-Making) and of the Fundamental Rights Agency\u2019s Violence Against Women survey. The year of reference is 2015 (2014 for data on intersecting inequalities). The age of the reference population for the indicators is either 15+, 16+ or 18+, depending on the source. Progress in gender equality in Slovakia, 2005-2015 In the Gender Equality Index 2017, Slovakia achieved a score of 52.4 out of 100 , which is the same score as in 2005. This score is roughly 14 points below the EU-28 average. Slovakia is one of the three EU Member States that has not progressed in terms of gender equality from 2005 to 2015. Slovakia is ranked 26th in the EU, and it has lost seven positions. The gender equality score in the domain of health is the highest in Slovakia. It ranks 19th in the EU. The situation is relatively better in terms of access to medical and dental services, for which Slova- kia ranks 16th in the European Union. The biggest improvement has taken place in the domain of money , due mostly to an increase in gender equality in earnings and income. Slovakia records the 2nd highest score of the EU-28 in the sub-domain of economic situation, which deals with the risk of poverty and the distribution of wealth in the population. The score in the domain of knowledge has also progressed. The situation regarding segregation is much more gender equal than in attainment and participation (7th and 25th ranks, respectively). The domain of work has stalled. There is much room for improve- ment, especially in the sub-domain of segregation and quality of work, where the score is the lowest of the EU-28. The greatest challenges are in time and power : they represent the lowest scores of Slovakia and gender equality in their domains has regressed. Regarding time, the situation has particularly de- teriorated in the allocation of time for care activities. In power, the decrease is due to the sub-domain of economic power, and, more precisely, to the disappearance of women among the board mem- bers of the central bank.

        "2 Explore the Gender Equality Index at: eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/gender-equality-index Work Gender equality in the domain of work has stalled. Segregation remains a major challenge. The employment rate (20-64) is 60 % for women versus 75 % for men. The total employment rate is 68 % and Slovakia has not yet reached its national Europe 2020 strategy (EU2020) target (72 %). The gender gap in the employment rate is the same when the number of hours worked is taken into account. The full-time equivalent (FTE) employ- ment rate of women is around 44 %, compared to 60 % for men. Among women and men in a couple with children, the FTE employment rate for women is 59 % compared to 89 % for men. This gender gap is much higher than that of couples without children (30 percentage points (p.p.) for couples without children and 2 p.p. for couples with children). The FTE employment rate increases and the relative gender gaps decrease as education levels rise. The gender gap in employment is higher among people born abroad than among those born in Slovakia. 8 % of women work part-time, compared to 4 % of men. On average, women work 39 hours per week, compared to 41 hours for men. 9 % of working-age women versus 0.3 % of working-age men are either outside the labour market or work part-time due to care responsibilities. Gender segregation in the labour market is a reality for both women and men. 27 % of women compared to nearly 5 % of men work in education, human health and social work activities (EHW). About five times more men (37 %) than women (7 %) work in science, technology, engineering and math- ematics (STEM) occupations. Money Slovakia\u2019s score in the domain of money has increased. Gender equality has improved in both sub-domains, but the main progress is in earnings and income. Mean monthly earnings of women and men have increased and the gender gap has narrowed. Women earn around 21 % less than men per month. The gender gap in earnings is higher among women and men in a couple with children and among people with middle and high levels of education, always to the detriment of women. The population of women and men at risk of poverty has decreased. The risk affects women and men with the same intensity: approximately 10 %. 28 % of lone mothers are at risk of poverty. Inequalities in income distribution have decreased for both women and men, but the gender gap has slightly increased. The gender pay gap is 20 % to the detriment of women. In 2012, women had lower pensions than men and the gender gap was 8 %. The EU-28 averages are 16 % and 38 %, respectively.

        "3 Explore the Gender Equality Index at: eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/gender-equality-index Knowledge Slovakia\u2019s score in the domain of knowledge has increased. Gender equality has improved regarding both segregation and attainment and participation. The number of tertiary graduates has increased significantly, mostly among women. 19 % of women and 16 % of men have a tertiary degree. The gap, which was to the detriment of women, has been reversed. Up to the age of 49, there are more women than men who have completed tertiary education. Only 12 % of women with disabilities have attained tertiary education, com- pared to 27 % of women without disabilities. For men these shares are 14 % and 20 %, respectively. Slovakia has not met its national EU2020 target to have 40 % of people aged 30-34 obtain tertiary education. The current rate is 28 %. Women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation in lifelong learning has decreased. In Slovakia gender segregation in knowledge is less of a challenge than in many other EU Member States. Nonetheless, gender gaps remain high. 48 % of women students are concentrated in the fields of education, health and welfare, humanities and arts, compared to only 25 % of men. Time In the domain of time, the score has decreased. The situation has become more gender unequal, especially in the sub-domain of care activities. Women take on more responsibilities than men for caring for their family. 35 % of women care for and educate their family members for at least 1 hour per day, compared to 19 % of men. This gender gap has increased. Among women and men in a couple with children, women are much more involved in daily care activities (77 %) than men (47 %). 60 % of women do cooking and housework every day for at least 1 hour, compared to only 16 % of men. This gender gap has increased. Moreover, the gap is larger among women and men in a couple with children, with 85 % of women and 18 % of men doing cooking and housework daily. Inequality in time-sharing at home also extends to social activities. Men are more likely than women to participate in sporting, cultural, and leisure activ- ities outside the home (20 % versus 11 %). Participation in voluntary or charit- able activities, however, is slightly higher for women than for men (9 % and 6 %, respectively). 1 % of children under the age of three and 68 % of children between the age of three and school age are enrolled in childcare. Slovakia has not met either of the two \u2018Barcelona targets\u2019, which are to have at least 33 % of chil- dren below the age of three and 90 % of children between the age of three and school age in childcare.

        "4 Explore the Gender Equality Index at: eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/gender-equality-index Power The score in the domain of power has decreased, due to a decrease in the representation of women in decision-making positions regarding economic power. The sub-domain of political power has stalled. 10 % of ministers are women, compared to 12 % in 2005. Conversely, gender equality has improved in par- liament, where women hold 20 % of seats, up from 18 % in 2005. The representation of women in publicly listed companies has increased. Women represent 15 % of corporate boards of publicly listed companies, an increase from 10 % in 2005. At the same time, women have disappeared from the decision-making positions in the central bank, whereas in 2005 they rep- resented 20 % of the seats. 17 % of the members of the boards of research funding organisations are women. Women make up approximately 19 % of board members of publicly owned broadcasting organisations. In sport, women comprise just 10 % of members of the highest decision-making bodies of national Olympic sport organisations. Health The scores in the sub-domains of status and access have increased slightly, while the score in the sub-domain of behaviour has stalled. The sub-domain of status measures perceived health, life expectancy and healthy life years. Life expectancy has increased for both women and men. Women on average live nearly 7 years longer than men. When it comes to healthy life years, however, the gender gap disappears. 62 % of women and 70 % of men assess their health as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018very good\u2019. The level of satisfaction regarding health increases with the level of education; moreover, the gender gap is bigger among people with a low level of educa- tion than those with medium and high levels of education. The score of the sub-domain of access has improved due to a decrease in unmet medical and dental needs among women and men. The gender gap in this area has also decreased slightly. 47 % of men smoke or drink excessively, compared to around 24 % of women. At the same time, more men than women (40 % and 33 %, respectively) engage in healthy behaviour (physical activities and/or consuming fruit and vegetables).

        "5 Explore the Gender Equality Index at: eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/gender-equality-index Violence Violence against women is included in the Gender Equality Index as a satellite domain. This means that the scores of the domain of violence do not have an impact on the final score of the Gender Equality Index. From a statistical perspective, the domain of violence does not measure gaps between women and men as core domains do. Rather, it measures and analyses women\u2019s experiences of violence. Unlike other domains, the overall objective is not to reduce the gaps of violence between women and men, but to eradicate violence completely. A high score in the Gender Equality Index means a country is close to achieving a gender-equal soci- ety. However, in the domain of violence, the higher the score, the more serious the phenomenon of violence against women in the country is. On a scale of 1 to 100, 1 represents a situation where violence is non-existent and 100 represents a situ- ation where violence against women is extremely common, highly severe and not disclosed. The best-performing country is therefore the one with the lowest score. Slovakia\u2019s score for the domain of violence is 30.0, which is slightly above the EU average of 27.5. In Slovakia, 34 % of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence at least once since the age of 15. 18 % of women who have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by any perpetrator in the past 12 months have not told anyone. This rate is higher than the EU average of 13 %. At the societal level, violence against women costs Slovakia an estimated EUR 2.4 billion per year through lost economic output, service utilisation and personal costs (2). The domain of violence is made up of three sub-domains: prevalence , which measures how often violence against women occurs; severity , which meas- ures the health consequences of violence; and disclosure , which measures the reporting of violence. (2) This is an exercise done at EU level to estimate the costs of the three major dimensions: services, lost economic output and pain and suffering of the victims. The estimates were extrapolated to the EU from a United Kingdom case study, based on population size.

In order to reach full gender equality, a more targeted and holistic approach to gender equality is needed.
