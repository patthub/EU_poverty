The impact of social transfers in reducing poverty is lower than EU average, while the adequacy, coverage and take-up of social assistance and access to social services remain limited. Income inequality (based on indicators S80/S20 - S80/S50) are substantially above EU average. 2.

The declines in summer months of the following years were induced mainly by the impact of traditional element \u2013 seasonal works. On the other hand, increased numbers at the turn of years have been connected rather with layoffs at the end of the year. Since June 2011, the numbers of beneficiaries have been nearly similar to those ones in before-crisis years. Annual decrease in 2012 was partly caused by relevant legislative changes. The number of jobseekers with an unemployment benefit entitlement mainly affects newly arrived persons in the register, whose number was still high even when the unemployment dropped. Another factor which affects the number of jobseekers with an unemployment benefit entitlement is the age structure of job seekers. Jobseekers aged 50+ have a longer support period (11 month). Their number decreased, but the decline was slower than other job-seekers. The proportion of jobseekers with unemployment benefits in the total number of jobseekers is increasing. The year- on-year decline in the average number of job-seekers with entitlement for unemployment benefit was 10.3 thousand to 76.8 thousand in 2018. The average share of total registered unemployment for the whole year was 31.7% (versus 27.4% in 2017). In 2019, in contrast to previous years, the average number of job seekers with unemployment benefits increased slightly by 0.5 thousand to 77.3 thousands. The average share of total registered unemployment for the whole of 2019 was 36.4%.

Generally, the development of number of \u201esocial assistance beneficiaries\u201c reflects situation on labour market and income situation of households as well as relevant legal adjustment. ",
        "18 Disability benefit definition Number of pensioners (disability benefits 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree) unit thousands of persons source MoLSA comment From the beginning of 2010 the new types of disability were implemented to the social system. Currently three levels of disability are differentiated (the 1st, 2nd , 3rd ) instead of the former two levels (full disability, partial disability). The 3rd level is equal to the full disability while the partial disability was split in the current 1st and 2nd level. From January 2010 all receivers of disability pension older than 65 years of age are no more implicated in the number of disability pensioners. They are implicated in the number of old age pensioners. This change is displayed in the drop of number of disability pensioners in January 2010. According to these changes, new data (starting January 2010) are being presented separately. ",

With this reform people under the age of 30 can no longer receive cash benefit but will receive education benefit (social assistance) at the level of the student grant.

On the other hand data of 2006, 2007 were also modified because we have found significant differences between this number of HU jobseekers allowance, assistance receivers and number of recipients of jobseekers allowance, assistance (were registered by PES). Social assistance benefit definition Recipients of benefit for people in active age (Former name of the benefit was regular social assistance) unit thousands of recipients source Hungarian Treasury definition Benefit for people in active age is an income supplement provision in the form of cash, provided by county offices. Its aim to guarantee a minimal standard of living for those who have no income. comment From the 1 July 2006 the conditions of the provision and the way of calculation of the amount of support changed. Before that the local government awarded regular social assistance to a person who was over 18 years of age, was of active age, and had lost at least 67 per cent of his or her working ability or received blind persons\u2019 benefit, or to a person who was of active age but not in employment, in the case that their subsistence was not provided by other means. By the new terms for the support is entitled only one person in a family. The assessing of the entitlement is based on the income projected to the consumer unit instead of the previous income per capita. The consumer unit is the rate which shows the structure of consumption within a family. The first major member of the family and the disabled child\u2019s rate is 1,0 while the ratio of the companion (spouse) and a child is lower (0,9-0,7). The amount of support is variable and supplements the family\u2019s effective total income to the limit of the entitlement. The regular social assistance from 1 January 2009 was changed to benefit for people in active age. In 2018 the benefit for people in active age consists of two types of allowances: ",
        "107 a) a benefit provided of those who are incapable for work: 'benefit for people with health impairment or taking care of children'(previous name was regular social assistance until 2015 ). Recipients are those people who are health impaired, as well as persons who bring up a child under 14, and the attendance of the child at an institution providing daily care is not ensured. (Before 2015 those who had less than five years to the retirement age, or those who fulfilled the criteria set up by municipialities connected to the family circumstances, health or mental status of the claimant, were also defined as incapable of performing work,thus entitled to regular social assistance.) The calculation of the benefit determined on the grounds of the composition and income of the family. The monthly amount of the benefit is the difference between the amount of the family income limit and the actual monthly income of the family of the entitled person. b) a benefit for those who are capable to work: 'employment substituting benefit'. Persons who belong to this group are obliged to cooperate with the Public Employment Service and to take part in public work. The benefit is paid when the person is not involved in public work. The amount of the benefit is fixed, it is equal to 80 % of the minimum old-age pension. The name of the benefit for those who are capable of work was changed to employment substituting benefit from 1st September 2011 . From 1st March 2015 the system of benefits for people in active age was changed. The benefit is provided by the district offices instead of the local governments. Those persons who are not capable of performing work - because of health impairment or taking care of a child - receive \"benefit for people with health impairment or taking care of children\" instead of regular social assistance. Other previous entitlements of regular social assistance ceased (age, conditions set up by municipalities). Those people who received regular social assistance upon these criteria could be entitled to employment substituting benefit if they accepted to cooperate with the Public Employment Service. Only one person in a family can be eligible to the benefit for persons in active age, except for the case when two claimants are entitled to different cash benefits (one person is entitled to employment substituting benefit, the other to regular social assistance.

This robust economic growth is primarily attributed to strong domestic demand, while there was a negative contribution from net exports. The domestic demand was the main driver for growth, contributing 4.3 percentage points towards real GDP. Underpinning this positive performance was the consistent growth in government consumption and investment. Buoyant Government consumption in 2019 mainly reflected higher expenditure on intermediate consumption and higher compensation of employees. In the meantime, the growth in investment activity was due to increases in both public and private investment. An increase in private consumption was also registered, supported by strong employment growth and increases in disposable income. From an external standpoint, both export and import activity in real terms and their respective prices moderated due to weaker external demand conditions. The COVID- 19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented stresses in the global economy. In Malta, while the outbreak of the pandemic exerted adverse effects on the broad economy, the sectors most severely hit by the partial-lockdown measures are the tourism industry, the wholesale and retail trade sector, transportation and storage and the accommodation and food services sector. Against this background, the Maltese economy is expected to contract by 5.4 per cent in real terms during 2020. Given the high degree of openness of the Maltese economy, international developments are projected to weigh heavily on Malta\u2019s net export performance. Indeed, the main contributor to the decline in real GDP for 2020 is a negative net exports balance of 7.2 percentage points. The domestic component of the economy is expected to contribute 1.8 percentage points to growth in 2020, as public expenditure is expected to compensate for the negative contributions of private consumption and gross fixed capital formation. In spite of Government\u2019s policy efforts to ease cash flows challenges faced by local businesses, some negative consequences on the labour market are expected to materialize in the short-term. Employment is expected to decline by 3.3 per cent in 2020, with a concomitant rise in the unemployment rate (based on the Harmonised definition) to 5.9 per cent. The inflation rate is expected to decline to 1.0 per cent in 2020. Underlying the deceleration in inflation is the unprecedented drop in oil prices as a result of the COVID-19 developments together ",

Claims for transfer payments can only be made by those who have made employment insurance contributions for an appropriate period. For example, those who have interrupted their working careers for a long period of time (in particular returners) and school leavers receive no unemployment insurance benefit. In order to receive benefit a person must be registered with the AMS. To be entitled to claim unemployment benefit, a person must be able and willing to work, available for work but unemployed and have been in insured employment for the appropriate qualifying period. Unemployment assistance, which is payable on expiry of entitlement to unemployment benefit, combines the principles of social insurance and welfare. Firstly, the rate of the income support is calculated on the basis of the unemployment benefit previously received. Secondly, applicants must be in serious need of financial support, after taking exemption limits into account.

Before September 2010, provincial legislation on social assistance had not been harmonised to a large extent. Quarterly figures of recipients of Social Assistance Benefits (see table 1) include between six and nine Federal Provinces; the data of the cities with municipal departments is missing in one of them. The provinces had registered very diverse trends. - In order to realize the objective of combating poverty in all relevant fields of policy, a means-tested minimum income had been introduced as a reform of the social assistance scheme in 2010. The federal government and the provincial governments had agreed on common salient points of a nationwide means-tested minimum income scheme which had been subsequently implemented in the corresponding national and provincial legislation (\u201cagreement between the Federation and the Federal Provinces about the means- tested-minimum-income scheme (BMS) pursuant to Article 15a of the Austrian federal constitution\u201d). On the 1st of September 2010 the laws for the means-tested minimum income were introduced in in 7 of 9 federal provinces. The remaining two provinces had introduced the minimum income scheme until October 2011. - Due to the nationwide introduction of the means-tested minimum income scheme, the comparison was started anew in 2012 (see table 2). At the end of 2016, the agreement between the Federation and the Federal Provinces about the means-tested-minimum-income scheme has expired. By January 2017, minimum income has been solely legislated and administered by the Federal Provinces again. As a result, regulations concerning entitlement and the level of benefits can differ across Federal Provinces. In March 2019, Austria passed a government bill to reform the means-tested minimum income scheme. Since 1st of June 2019 the Principle law for social assistance is in force. The law does not only contain binding requirements, which have to be implemented by the Federal Provinces, but also a number of \"optional provisions\". Since then 2 of 9 provinces have implemented the reform. ",

This is voluntary, you have to pay an annual fee. In the case of unemployment the allowance is related to your salary. Basic unemployment allowance is like earnings- related allowance, but the difference is that you are not a member of an unemployment fund or do not qualify for the earnings-related allowance for some other reason. The basic allowance is flat rate and low. Starting from 2010, basic and earnings-related unemployment allowances are payable not only during unemployment but also during participation in a measure of active labour market policy. Labour market support is flat rate benefit (and low) for those who do not qualify for the elibility rules of the benefits mentioned above. In practice they are young people and those who have received the allowances mentioned above for the maximum period (from 2017 on 300, 400 or 500 days). Unlike with the unemployment allowance, a demonstrated need of financial assistance is also required. Although in most cases labour market support and basic unemployment allowance are the same rate. A total of 328,200 persons received unemployment benefits at year-end 2019. Of them, 64% were in receipt of a basic unemployment benefit.

        "170 comment Disability pensions in the earnings-related pension system consist of full and partial pensions and they may be awarded until further notice or for a specific period of time. The proportion of partial pensions of all pensions has risen and are 17 percent of all disability pensions at the moment. Rehabilitation allowance is a benefit paid during active rehabilitation measures awarded to a person who is still in working life and would face a risk of disability in the near future without rehabilitation. The amount of this allowance is 1.33 times the disability pension and it is paid by the pension system, but it is not regarded or classified as a pension. The number of recipients of these allowances has over doubled in 10 years. The total number of people receiving disability pensions has been decreasing for over 10 years. There are several possible reasons for this. First, the incidence of new disability pensions has decreased in the most important diagnosis groups. They are applied less than before perhaps because of the ability to work has ameliorated, possibly because of increased rehabilitation measures. However, in 2018, the incidence of new disability pensions turned into increase, because of increasing number of disability pensions due to mental disorders. Furthermore, the Activation model for Unemployment Security that was in effect 2018-2019 likely increased the number of disability pension applicants and the incidence of new disability pensions temporarily. However, the number of disability pensions recipients has still decreased, due to higher number of ending disability pensions than new starting ones. The proportion of disability pensions granted for a specific period of time has increased, which can be one reason for the larger number of ending pensions. The demographic factor also counts. The amount of people in age groups where the incidence of new disability pensions is highest (55 to 63) has decreased. From 2017, the lowest old age retirement age is rising 3 months each year, which will lead to increased number of disability pensioners in older age groups in the future. In the 2017 reform, also a new form of disability pension was legislated, which gives right to pension at 63 (for those whose retirement age is higher) if the person has faced hard work conditions for at least 38 years and has some kind of disability. This is not a pension for the masses. A total of 55 pensions have been granted since 2018, but only 12 pensions are in payment at the end of March 2020. ",
