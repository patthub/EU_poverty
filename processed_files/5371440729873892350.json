        "I (Legislative acts) REGULATIONS COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 12/2010 of 22 December 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 temporarily suspending the autonomous common customs tariff duties on certain industrial, agricultural and fishery products THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Whereas: (1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 ( 1 ) partially or totally suspends the autonomous common customs tariff duties for a number of products during certain periods. It is in the interest of the Union to insert 87 new products in the list of suspensions set out in the Annex to that Regulation. (2) A limited number of products listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 should be withdrawn from the list because it is no longer in the interest of the Union to maintain the suspension of autonomous common customs tariff duties for those products. (3) For some products listed in that Annex the description needs to be modified in order to take account of technical product developments and economic trends on the market. For 110 other products, the CN and TARIC codes should be adapted as a consequence of changes introduced in the Combined Nomenclature, applicable as from 1 January 2010. The entries for those products should be considered as withdrawn from the list and should be reinserted as new products. (4) For ease of comprehension, in view of the large number of amendments coming into force on 1 January 2010, the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 should be replaced by a completely new version which has effect from the same date. In the interest of clarity the new and amended entries should be marked with an asterisk in the first column of the Annex. (5) Experience has shown the need to provide for an expiry date for the suspensions listed in Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 to ensure that account is taken of technological and economic changes. This should not exclude the premature termination of certain measures or their continuation beyond the suspension period, if economic reasons are submitted, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Commission Communi\u00ad cation of 25 April 1998 concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas. (6) Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 should therefore be amended accordingly. (7) Since the suspensions laid down in this Regulation have to take effect from 1 January 2010, this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 is hereby replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.

They shall expire on the dates listed in that Annex. Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .

        "DECISIONS COUNCIL DECISION of 20 November 2009 on the granting of a State aid by the authorities of the Republic of Poland for the purchase of agricultural land between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013 (2010/10/EC) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 88(2), third subparagraph, thereof, Having regard to the request made by the Government of the Republic of Poland on 28 September 2009, Whereas: (1) On 28 September 2009, Poland presented to the Council a request for a decision in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 88(2) of the Treaty, declaring that the plan of the Republic of Poland to grant national aid to Polish farmers for the purchase of agri\u00ad cultural land is compatible with the common market. (2) The unfavourable area structure of Polish agricultural holdings, the low level of direct payments that Poland receives following a phasing-in mechanism provided for in the 2003 Act of Accession and the disproportionately high agricultural labour inputs compared with the returns result in low agricultural incomes, which further dropped in 2008 due to the fall in the value of payments to farmers following the 10 % decrease in the euro exchange rate. (3) In 2009, the deepening recession in the world economy caused by the global crisis has adversely affected Polish agricultural holdings both due to the lack of demand and plummeting purchase prices: wheat prices are approximately 45 % and rye prices approximately 60 % down on March 2008 levels, whereas in July 2009, the price of milk was 9,5 % lower than in July 2008. (4) The prices of agricultural inputs such as fertilisers, pesticides, feed and fuel have continued to rise in 2009, which has had a catastrophic impact on farmers\u2019 living standards. It is likely that conditions will continue to worsen for many Polish farms, with a consequent increase in the number of farming families at risk of poverty. (5) The income situation of farmers in Poland has been further aggravated in 2009 by losses, estimated to reach some PLN 240 million, on 130 000 hectares of agricultural land through flooding in 11 voivodships (out of a total of 16 voivodships). (6) In the first quarter of 2009, rural unemployment rose compared to last year and there is a risk that it will rise still further. National aid should help the unemployed switch to farming by allowing them to buy agricultural land. It should also give the opportunity to semi- subsistence farmers no longer working as employees in sectors other than agriculture to improve the area structure of their holding with the aim of securing an income that will guarantee them a basic standard of living off the land. It should also facilitate selling of agricultural land owned by the unemployed who need capital to switch to self-employed status. (7) Agricultural land prices in Poland have been rising significantly and continuously since 2007. (8) In view of farmers\u2019 lack of capital, the high interest rates on commercial loans for the purchase of real estate, including agricultural land and building plots, and the tightening up of the banks\u2019 criteria for granting farmers loans in the current crisis, farmers, especially those with small holdings, have little prospect of taking out commercial loans for investments such as the purchase of agricultural land. In August 2009 rates for commercial credit lines for the purchase of real estate ranged from 6,26 % to 8,17 % per annum. EN 8.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union L 4/89 ",
        "(9) The State aid to be granted amounts to PLN 400 million and should enable 600 000 hectares of agricultural land to be sold, during the period from 2010 to 2013, for the purposes of setting up or extending agricultural holdings which meet the criteria for family-run holdings, i.e. up to 300 hectares. The scheme should allow for setting up around 24 000 agricultural holdings with an area of not less than the average in the relevant voivodship. The average amount of aid per one holding should be around EUR 4 500. The price of the eligible land should not exceed the average market price in the relevant voivodship. As regards the land owned by the Agri\u00ad cultural Property Stock of the State Treasury, a tender procedure should apply. (10) The aid will take the form of subsidising interest payments on loans, i.e. paying the difference between the annual interest rate applied by the bank which is 1,5 times the rediscount rate on bills of exchange redis\u00ad counted by the National Bank of Poland and the actual interest rate paid by the borrower which is 2 % as a minimum. (11) The Commission has not at this stage initiated any procedure nor taken a position on the nature and compatibility of the aid. (12) Exceptional circumstances therefore exist, making it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to limit the extent of rural poverty in Poland, to be compatible with the common market, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Exceptional aid by the Polish authorities for loans for the purchase of agricultural land, amounting to a maximum of PLN 400 million and granted between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013, shall be considered to be compatible with the common market.

        "COMMISSION DECISION of 7 January 2010 on the safety requirements to be met by European standards for consumer-mounted childproof locking devices for windows and balcony doors pursuant to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (notified under document C(2009) 10298) (Text with EEA relevance) (2010/11/EU) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety ( 1 ), and in particular Article 4(1)(a) thereof, Whereas: (1) Directive 2001/95/EC provides for European standards to be established by European standardisation bodies. Such standards should ensure that products satisfy the general safety requirements of the Directive. (2) Under Directive 2001/95/EC a product is presumed safe, as far as the risks and risk categories covered by national standards are concerned, when it conforms to voluntary national standards transposing European standards. (3) Accidental falls from heights, such as windows or balconies, are a leading cause of death or permanent brain or skeletal damage in children below 5 years. They are a major problem in urban areas with a strong concentration of multi-storey blocks of flats, and peak in spring and summer, when windows are left open for longer periods. In the \u00cele-de-France region, between May and September 2005, 67 accidental falls of children were registered, totalling almost 14 cases per month. In Denmark and Sweden, between 20 and 60 cases are registered every year. In the years between 1996 and 2003, the number of falls involving children averaged 79 per year in Greece, 130 per year in the Netherlands and 25 per year in the United Kingdom. (4) To reduce or prevent accidental falls, there are requirements on the size of windows, and on the presence and features of window rails and window guards. However, these requirements are generally laid down in national construction codes, which vary from one Member State to another. (5) On the market there are also products designed to limit or block the opening of windows and balcony doors. Such products are fitted by the consumer directly onto the window or balcony door. (6) There are no European safety standards for these products. At present, the main references for economic operators and market surveillance authorities are contained in some national and international standards and test methods. (7) Between 2005 and 2007, Austria, Denmark and Norway jointly carried out a project to evaluate the safety of consumer-mounted locking devices for windows and balcony doors available on the market and assess the suitability of existing national and international test methods. In addition, participants took into account the requirements developed by ANEC ( 2 ) in a study on child-protective devices published in 2004 ( 3 ), as well as some requirements from the EN-71:1 standard on the safety of toys. (8) The project results showed that several of the models of locks tested could be disengaged by children, despite the childproof claim; other models collapsed, broke or did not withstand the ageing test and all models tested lacked some of the required basic instructions.

        "(9) Therefore it is necessary to set specific requirements pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 2001/95/EC and, on the basis of such requirements, subsequently mandate the drafting of European safety standards to ensure these devises are child resistant, retain structural integrity throughout their expected lifetime, are resistant to ageing and exposure to weather conditions and provide clear instructions and information to users. These standards should be developed in line with Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services ( 1 ). The reference of the standard adopted should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union , in accordance with Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC. (10) The locking devices covered by this Decision should be only those fitted by consumers on windows or balcony doors. Locking devices that are integrated in the window or balcony door frame are covered by technical specifi\u00ad cations laid down in Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regu\u00ad lations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products ( 2 ). (11) Once the relevant standards are available, and provided that the Commission decides to publish their reference in the Official Journal, according to the procedure laid down in Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC, childproof consumer-mounted locking devices for windows and balcony doors should be presumed to conform to the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC, as far as the safety requirements covered by the standards are concerned. (12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up pursuant to Article 15 of Directive 2001/95/EC, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Definitions For the purposes of this Decision: \u2014 \u2018consumer-mounted locking device\u2019 means a device that either blocks or limits to a predetermined position the opening of a window or balcony door. Such device is designed to be retrofitted by the consumer to windows or balcony doors, \u2014 \u2018childproof\u2019, or \u2018child resistant\u2019, shall mean that the device cannot be disengaged by a child younger than 51 months. Article 2 Requirements The specific safety requirements for the consumer-mounted childproof locking devices to be met by European standards pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2001/95/EC shall be set out in the Annex to this Decision. Article 3 Publication This Decision shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . Done at Brussels, 7 January 2010.

        "ANNEX Specific safety requirements and test methods for childproof, consumer-mounted locking devices for windows and balcony doors Physical and mechanical properties Window and balcony doors locking devices must be built to withstand wear by repeated opening and closing, both loaded and unloaded, as well ageing and exposure to all weather conditions, such as sunshine, rain, snow, ice, moisture, high and low temperatures, wind and remain child protective. The devices must be able to withstand accidental impacts during their lifetime without breaking. To fulfil their intended purpose, the devices must limit the opening distance between the frame and the casement to a maximum distance to effectively prevent the passage of a young child, bearing in mind, in particular, the developmental abilities and anthropometric measurements of children at different ages. Small parts To prevent choking hazards, detached or detachable small parts must be of such dimensions as to prevent their being swallowed and/or inhaled. Sharp edges and projecting parts To prevent punctures, cuts, shearing, scissoring or other physical injury, accessible edges must be rounded or chamfered and there must be no points or protruding surfaces. Entrapment of fingers The devices must not have accessible openings, bearing in mind the anthropometric measurement of children and their abilities at different ages. Testing Ageing against UV radiation and increased temperature, wear and tear, mechanical stability and childproof function must be subject to specific testing methods. Products with flexible parts, such as chains, wires and ropes, must also be tested with a stamping method. The devices must not break and must be fully functional after the test. The testing methods must be adapted, as appropriate, to test the performance of the locking devices for all types of windows (e.g. \u2018French\u2019 or \u2018casement windows\u2019, sash windows and sliding windows). Forces in the tests shall be applied in the most onerous directions and must be measured with an uncertainty of measurement not exceeding \u00b1 1 %, and displacements with an uncertainty of measurement not exceeding \u00b1 1 mm. Child test panel The child protective function must be verified. Requirements in EN ISO 8317 on child resistant packaging must be used as a reference. The failure criteria laid down in that standard must be met. Product information Product information must be provided to reduce the risk of potential foreseeable hazards connected with the use of the product. Information concerning the safe use of the product must be provided. These instructions must include at least the following: \u2014 The name or trade mark of the manufacturer, importer or organisation responsible for its sale. \u2014 The instruction: \u2018Read this instruction carefully before mounting and using the device. The child protective function of the device may be affected if you do not follow the instructions. Keep the instructions for future reference.\u2019 \u2014 Information on the type of windows for which the product is designed. \u2014 Instructions on how and where to mount the devise correctly. Different instructions may be needed for different types of windows and different materials, such as wood, metal, plastic etc.) Since assembling the device is vital for it to be child protective, the instructions must be precise and in some cases a special assembly tool may need to be provided. \u2014 Any other information for safe use.
