        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services PREFACE With an estimated cost of \u20ac 600 billion, the deve lopment of the Trans-European Network is one of the biggest investment challenges the European community is facing. So far, the pace of implementation has not met its expectation. Recent years the European Commission and the European Investment Bank have instigated numerous instruments to support and facilitate the development of the envisaged Trans-European Transport network (TEN-T), particularly aimed at enhancing the use of private capital. The private sector is indeed gearing up for this investment challenge as illustrated among others by the establishment of multi-billion infrastructure funds in the past years. Also the international finance institutions such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are using their resources among others to support the development. This study as commissioned by the European parliament aims to design a financial framework that meets the requirements for developing such a huge investment program. It identifies the key financial instruments that can be used for funding the investments and assesses their usefulness and relevance. It concludes in general terms that the availability of capital is not the problem. The amount of private capital available for infrastructure is growing and growing driven by the need from predominantly institutional investors for more investment opportunities preferably low risk and long term oriented to match the future financial obligations of the ageing population. The key issue however is the lack of well prepared projects with a bankable risk profile. ECORYS recommends that the European Commission addresses this market imperfection in two ways. Firstly the European Commission is to focus even more than it is today on preparing well structured projects that are suitable for private financing. It is becoming apparent that in particular the new member states do not have the capacity within their respective public administration to handle this responsibility. A well staffed and centrally positioned Task Force with the mandate to prepare and implement a mutually agreed upon list of TEN-T projects as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) is considered to be more effective and efficient than the mostly less experienced staffed local authorities as it will enable an element of standardization in the project approach. Secondly it is recommended to the extent required to use the instrument of guarantees to enhance the bankability of these projects. In case of PPPs whereby the demand risk is transferred to the private sector (e.g. toll roads) already a guarantee instrument has been designed known as the Loan Guarantee Scheme. However it is recommended to design such a guarantee instrument also for those projects whereby the performance risk is transferred to the private sector, known as unitary payment based PPPs. It is recommended anyhow to minimise the transfer of demand risk to the private sector. The appetite for these projects from private capital providers is less than for PPPs based on unitary payments. This does not imply that the European Commission should not pursue its policy of charging users the real costs of the infrastructure provision, though implies merely that the uncertainty on its possible revenues should not be allocated to the private sector. Only in cases where the uncertainty on future demand is bankable at a reasonable cost it can be considered to transfer this risk (e.g. as toll road concessions). PE 379.207 iii ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Introduction 1. The objective of this study is to analyse various types of additional innovative financing instruments available for the Trans-European Transport Network, which could complement current EU grant financing of the TEN-T network and to recommend on the most suitable financial framework. 2. According to the European Commission the total costs of completing the 30 priority axes by 2020 was estimated in 2004 at \u20ac 225 billion, including \u20ac 112 billion to complete the 14 original projects. The latest information available from Member States at the beginning of 2005 indicates that the total remaining investment required has increased to \u20ac 252 billion. 3. The Member States have the responsibility to implement TEN-T projects. They are also expected to provide the majority of the funding. Complimentary funding is to come from other sources predominantly the European Commission budget and the European Investment Bank. 4. The Commission has responded to the lagging implementation through initiating a range of facilities aimed at enhancing private financing and enhancing the implementation capacity at the Member States. This study presents and overview of these facilities and assesses its adequacy taking into account the full range of financial instruments available. The assessment is based on review of relevant documentation, consultation of key financing institutions and the Consultant\u2019s experience. Commission\u2019s instruments 5. The Commission has initiated several instruments to co-finance the TEN-T investments and to enhance the use of private capital for the TEN-T. These instruments can be categorised as: a. Financial instruments; b. Facilitating instruments. 6. The Commission\u2019s financial instruments for the period 2007 - 2013 include: a. TEN-T Budget, a \u20ac 8 billion facility that can be used for the following purposes: i. Co-financing of studies (up to 50% of the costs of the study); ii. Direct grants for investment in duly justified cases; iii. Risk capital (up to 1% of the budget) effected in a Risk Capital Facility as managed by the EIB; iv. Loan Guarantee Scheme (managed by the EIB); v. Interest subsidies on loans granted by the European Investment Bank or other public or private financial bodies (instrument has not been effected to date). b. Cohesion Fund, grant facility with a proposed budget of \u20ac 63 billion for the period 2007 \u2013 2013 eligible for member states with a capita GDP less than 90% of the community average to support investments in transport networks, sustainable transport, environment and renewable energy; c. European Regional Development Fund, a grant facility that can be used for TEN- T albeit not specifically designed for TEN-T. PE 379.207 iv ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services 7. The Commission\u2019s facilitating instruments include: a. Joint Assistance to support projects in European regions (Jaspers); a major joint policy initiative of the EIB, European Commission (Regional Policy Directorate-General - DG Regio) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to assist beneficiary countries (principally the new Member States and acceding countries of the EU) in preparing major infrastructure projects which will be assisted by the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds over the next budgetary planning period 2007-2013. b. Trans-European Network Executive Agency (TEN-TEA), created by the Commission\u2019s Decision C(2006)5034 of 26 October 2006, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 58/2003. The Agency will manage the Community funds available for the promotion of the trans-European Transport network (established with the Decision on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network) in close collaboration with Directorate-General Energy and Transport of the European Commission. Starting from 2007 the Agency will be managing an annual budget of approximately \u20ac 1 billion focussed on mana gement of the Commission\u2019s TEN-T Budget. 8. These facilities are to address the difficulties experienced by particularly the new Member States to absorb the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These difficulties are for the most part related to the quality and quantity of the administrative capacity available to prepare and implement projects. Member States 9. The Member States are expected to be the driving force behind the development of the TEN- T network. The larger part of the investment requirement has to be provided by from Member State budgets. 10. The guidelines of development of the TEN-T network are drawn at EU level, whereas the decisions about investment in the network are made on a national level. Whilst Member States have launched many local projects, which coincide with their national priorities, they have been more hesitant in respect of projects, in particular cross border links, which are outside their national plans. 11. Member States are constrained in their investment policy under the rules of the budgetary discipline within the EU Stability and Growth Pact (Amsterdam 1997). To avoid excessive government deficits, their ratio of planned or actual government deficit to GDP (Gross Domestic Product) should be no more than 3%, and their ratio of government debt to GDP should be no more than 60%. 12. Especially in view of the severe budgetary constraints on the New Member States combined with a substantial local need for new infrastructure, fully public funding of TEN-T infrastructure in the medium term appears increasingly over-ambitious. 13. Many TEN-T priority projects are situated in the new Member States. These states lack the required public financing resources as well as the technical resources to design and manage the construction of large infrastructure projects and are looking for professional management. Therefore, the concept of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) has been introduced to those states as mean to attract private capital for the purpose of infrastructure investments. PE 379.207 v ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services 14. Consequently, legal and institutional frameworks for PPP are currently being set up in those states, though it has been noted that the pace of development in most countries is slower than expected. Private finance/PPP 15. Although PPP comes in many forms, it normally includes a long-term contractual arrangement between the public sector and a private entity whereby the private entity is responsible for Design, Build, Finance, Maintain (commonly referred to as DBFM) and in some occasion also Operate (in such a case referred to as DBFMO or concession) of an infrastructure asset. Operate means that the private entity charges the user a fee for the use of the asset (e.g. toll roads). In case of a DBFM the private entity charges the public contracting authority a fee based on the performance of the private entity (e.g. the level of availability of a road). DBFM\u2019s are also known as unitary or availability payment based PPPs, whereas DBFMO\u2019s are known as concessions or user charge based PPPs. 16. The key benefits of PPP as presented in the EU 2003 Guidelines to Successful PPP are; a. Acceleration of infrastructure provision; b. Faster implementation; c. Reduced whole life costs; d. Better risk allocation; e. Better incentives to perform; f. Improved quality of services; g. Generation of additional revenues; h. Enhanced public management 17. With the exception of the UK, private capital has not been used extensively for infrastructure investments in Europe. The main reason for this is the relatively slow development of PPP in Europe, which is expressed in lack of projects, a long lead time to financial close, difficult risk structuring and project structuring. 18. The key success factors to PPP are political commitment and a clear policy, a legislative framework enabling PPP, a competent administration and transparent institutional framework, availability of public and private capital. Especially in new Member States, these key success factors appear to be difficult to implement. 19. Attempts have been made to catalyse the development of PPP, supported among others by the European Commission. Most relevant is the Eurostat regulation as released in 2004 stating that a PPP is defined as a long term contractual agreement whereby the construction risk and the availability risk (in case of DBFM) or the demand risk (in case of a DBFMO) is transferred to the public sector. Any contingent liability arising from such an agreement are to accounted for off-balance, in other words do not account as public debt. This regulation is to give Member States an incentive to use PPP rather than conventional procurement supported by public debt since the level of public debt is constrained by the Maastricht Treaty. 20. It is to be noted that despite the opportunity of off-balance financing availability or unitary payment based PPPs, the public contracting authority does have a contingent liability to pay the respective.

        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services 21. The last decade has shown a significant growth in the availability of private capital for infrastructure investments, particularly through the establishment of so-called infrastructure funds. This growth is driven by the public promise of using more private finance for infrastructure investments. These funds are funded predominantly by institutional investors that are anxious to invest in public infrastructure through PPP because of its long-term perspective and the public sector involvement. It has been estimated that the total amount of equity allocated to infrastructure investments globally via funds at November 2006 is US$ 150 billion implying a required transaction value of US$ 600 billion. This amount of equity is expected to grow further in the coming years in particular when sufficient investment opportunities are offered to the private sector. 22. Next to these infrastructure funds, private finance is furthermore originated through equity contributions from contractors or operators, or through commercial loans or the issuance of bonds. 23. As a consequence of the slow development of PPP in Europe, private investors are shifting their attention to other markets of which at the moment the USA appears to be the most promising one. This market is characterised by investment opportunities in so called brown- field projects that have already demonstrated sustainable revenue streams as well as high value green-field projects. European Investment Bank 24. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is playing a crucial role in the development of the TEN-T by offering the following various instruments, most notably: a. Loans; b. Risk capital; c. Guarantees; d. Facilitating instruments. 25. The loan facilities offered by the EIB for the purpose of TEN-T projects include: a. The recently institutionalised TENs Investment Facility (TIF) to invest \u20ac 75 billion until 2013. Investment grade TEN-T projects are eligible for this facility. b. The Structured Finance Facility, which was launched to finance Special Purpose Vehicles on a risk sharing basis. This facility allows the EIB to take on more risk and invest in high-risk projects. Total reserves of \u20ac 750 million have been set aside under this heading over the a three year period for the purpose of generating operations amounting to between \u20ac 1.5 and \u20ac 2.5 billion, providi ng a broad mix of financial products. 26. The Risk Capital Facility (RCF) as being managed by the EIB has a budget of \u20ac 46 million which has been made available from Commission\u2019s TEN-T budget. RCF is intended to support the development of private infrastructure funds that are aimed at investing in TEN-T projects. The EIB is participating in these funds with the aim of injecting equity into TEN PPP projects. To date the EIB has signed commitments to the following private infrastructure funds: a. Dexia Southern EU Infrastructure Fund; b. Dutch Infrastructure Fund and; c. Galaxy Fund. 27. As for guarantees, the EIB recently designed the loan guarantee scheme which is expected to help attract additional private capital. The instrument is financed by the EU TEN Budget (\u20ac PE 379.207 vii ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services 500 million) and the EIB (\u20ac 500 million). The fund of \u20ac 1 billion can provide a total amount of \u20ac 5 billion worth of guarantees, based on a capital provision of 20%. The guarantee facility underpins the senior debt facility as debt providers have the confidence that subordinated debt will remain in the project. This reduces the risk profile of the project considerably and will attract more senior debt providers. This means that the leverage has high potential to increase further due to this support for bankability. It can be expected that the leverage is 20 to 30 times the original contribution of the Commission. 28. With regard to facilitating instruments, the EIB has been also assigned the management of the aforementioned Jaspers facility. Other international finance institutions 29. Next to the EIB, also the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank are relevant in the development of the TEN-T. The EBRD most notably though its focus on the pre-accession countries and the neighbouring countries and its offering of debt facility and donor funded technical assistance. The World Bank though the facilities offered by its International Finance Corporation and its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Also relevant is the role of the World Bank\u2019s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). MIGA promotes foreign investment by bringing together the stakeholders. Besides, MIGA provides investment guarantees against certain non-commercial risks. Cross border investments as well as multi-country projects are eligible for coverage. Policy options 30. The following high-level policy options have been defined in terms of financing the TEN-T: a. Continue focus on a mix of public and private financing This policy implies a continuation of the existing policy whereby the funding is to come from the member states and the private sector complemented by the Commission\u2019s funds and instruments. b. Shift focus to public financing This policy implies that the funding is to come primarily from member states supported by community funding. It implies further that projects are implemented by the respective Member States in a traditional manner using conventional procurement procedures and contract structures. The budgetary constraints as agreed upon in the Maastricht Treaty in terms of maximum debt requirements are to be reconsidered to enable acceleration of public investments. c. Shift focus to private financing This policy implies that the majority of the funding is to come from the private sector. It assumes in order to maximise the availability of private capital that the risk transfer to the private sector is minimal by structuring the projects as unitary payment based PPPs and by including to the extent necessary sovereign or community guarantees. The unitary payments imply a contingent liability for member states which is to be covered by the proceeds from road user charges or other forms of road usage related taxation. 31. By reviewing the pros and cons of the defined policy options, it is concluded that a shift of focus to private financing is most likely to ensure an effective and efficient realisation of the TEN-T program, for the following reasons: PE 379.207 viii ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services a. It captures the opportunities of the growing level of private capital hence reducing the burden on public budget (including the Commission\u2019s budget); b. It reduces the administrative burden on member states for absorbing the Commission\u2019s funds (albeit that on the other hand member states will need to build an enabling environment for PPP); c. It enhances the likelihood of cost-effective delivery of projects as PPP has proven to provide Value for Money provided projects are well structured and risks are adequately allocated. 32. This recommendation is in line with the recent OECD analysis \u201cInfrastructure to 2030\u201d which concludes that governments will need to turn to alternatives such as private financing as well as tools to manage demand for infrastructure. The new approaches to financing infrastructure could include public private partnerships and greater recourse to pension funds and other large institutional investors. 33. A critical success factor for implementing the option of private financing is the competence level of the public administration. However the competence level of the public administration, in specific the necessary PPP units is constrained by salary regulations that hinder recruitment of experienced and competent staff and political will to have a critical mass at a PPP unit. Normally these units have understaffed and lack political support. The commission\u2019s policy to date in enhancing the competence level of the respective member states is based on providing technical assistance, recently structured in the Jaspers facility and the TEN-TEA and by providing guidelines (e.g. Guidelines for Successful Public Partnerships) and by developing directives (e.g. Green Book on procurement of PPPs). It is strongly recommended to further develop facilitating instruments to support the Member States e.g. through the establishment of a TEN PPP Task Force. Conclusions 34. The financial instruments available can be sub-divided into financing instruments and facilitating instruments. The facilitating instruments are designed to increase the bankability of the projects involved. The next figures show the financial instruments related to the phases of the project life cycle. It should be noted that Structural and Cohesion funds can not be applied for projects that receive financing from the TEN-Budget. Legally is should be possible to combine Structural and Cohesion funds with the Loan Guarantee Fund, which is partly filled with TEN-budget, but which is not used for financing but for facilitating.

The availability of private capital has grown significantly in the past years through the emergence of infrastructure funds largely funded by pension funds and other institutional investors. It has been stated that these funds could leverage a total value of transactions of \u20ac 500 billion and it is expected th at this will grown significantly in the coming years. As such it can fund a large part (if not all) of the TEN-T network albeit that the TEN-T will have to compete with other markets such as USA and India and other sectors such as healthcare, education and utilities which are increasingly using PPP as a mean to deliver projects. PE 379.207 x ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services 36. The Commission\u2019s instruments could further leverage the available private capital. Most notably the EIB\u2019s Loan Guarantee Scheme is considered an effective instrument in arranging private capital as it will improve the credit rating of a project to investment grade. 37. It can furthermore be concluded that despite the growing amount of private capital, the development of PPP as a mean to absorb this private capital, in particular in the new member states, is hampering. Although most countries have established some level of an enabling environment through legislation and or a PPP unit, the deal flow is in most countries limited. The apparent reason for this is the lack of political will to apply PPP, possible instigated by reluctance to transfer responsibilities for public service delivery to the private sector and or the temptation of \u2018free\u2019 grant funding from the Commission. Recommendations 38. Recommendation 1: Shift focus to private finance Focussing more on private finance for the realisation of the TEN-T network implies optimizing the use of the growing availability of private capital and the benefits of PPP in terms of more efficient and effective delivery of projects, commonly known as value for money. 39. Recommendation 2: Focus the Commission\u2019s financial instruments on guarantees Focussing more on community guarantees, hence reducing the risk profile will make projects more attractive to private investors which is considered a necessity in a market where projects have to compete with other projects to attract private capital (e.g. competition from other markets like USA and India and other sectors like health care, education and utilities). With regard to guarantees more specifically it is recommended to establish an Availability Guarantee Scheme next to the already designed Loan Guarantee Scheme. The Availability Guarantee Scheme is to address specifically the country risk in case of availability based PPPs whereas the Loan Guarantee Scheme will address the demand risk in user charge based PPPs. 40. Recommendation 3: Increase focus on facilitating instruments To date the main focus of the Commission with regard to TEN-T has been on building absorption capacity in relation to the European grants. Some attempts have been made to support also the development of a PPP enabling environment (e.g. PPP legislation and or PPP units) though it has not yet resulted in any significant pipeline of projects in the new member states. It is consequently recommended to enhance the efforts to develop PPP preferably by a coordinated approach with other multilateral institutions like EBRD and World Bank. This could be materialised by a proposed TEN PPP Task Force, which is envisaged as a central coordinating and supporting team of PPP experts that could even take upon an implementing responsibility for cross-border projects. 41. Recommendation 4: promote use of availability based PPPs It has been noted that the preferred PPP model if any, in particular in the new member states (with the exception of Hungary), appears to be a user charge based PPP. This model implies the transfer of demand risk along with the construction risk to the private sector. There is less appetite from private investors for this risk profile, even when it is supported by a Loan Guarantee Scheme. In short, the supply of user charge based PPPs (or DBFMO) is large whereas the demand for these projects is limited (to a certain extent), contrary to unitary payment based PPPs (or DBFM) where supply is limited (mainly Hungary, Netherlands, PE 379.207 xi ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services Belgium and in sectors other than transport infrastructure) and demand is large (risk profile matches investment strategy of pension funds). It is consequently recommended to enhance the use of availability based payments and even further enhance its attractiveness for private investors through the use of the already mentioned Availability Guarantee Scheme. The consequent liability for the public contracting authority could be met by the proceeds from nationwide road user charges (e.g. a vignet scheme) as such allocating the demand risk to the sovereign level. 42. Recommendation 5: Enhance political commitment to TEN-T The final recommendation is to enhance political commitment in Member States. The Member States have an important role with regards to the development of the TENs. However, particularly new Member States deal with budgetary constraints and therefore lack the commitment to invest in projects that do not necessarily support their national objectives. One of the main barriers is national budgeting, which is also closely linked to political commitment to TEN-T projects in the relevant Member States. This has to be addressed and options should be studied. In consultation with the respective Member State the different TEN-T projects are being classified as PPP or non-PPP. 43. Based on these recommendations the following finance framework is recommended including the necessary facilitating instruments.

OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY The main objective of this study is to analyse new financial instruments for European Transport infrastructure and services. This includes TEN-Budget, loans, loan guarantee fund and Public Private Partnerships (PPP); and how they shall be applied and combined to achieve an optimal result. In order to answer this question a number of sub-questions were formulated: \u2022 The central question to be answered is: What are the most promising financial instruments and how shall they be applied and combined to achieve an optimal result regarding the successful realisation of the trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) as initially scheduled? \u2022 Which financial instruments should be preferably used to attract private capital? \u2022 What kind of legal, financial and economic conditions are needed for successful PPP projects regarding transport infrastructure? \u2022 What are the most important obstacles for private capital to participate in TEN-T projects? \u2022 Are there other promising financial instruments or sources for the TEN-T which have not been discussed substantially on the European Union (EU) level yet? 1.2. BACKGROUND History of TEN-T The TEN-T program was initiated in the 90\u2019s and is constantly evolving as illustrated in the table below. Table 1.1.

        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services The TEN-T Program to date To date the TEN-T program consists of 30 priority projects as defined by the High Level Group on TEN-T chaired by Karel van Miert. The priority projects for the construction of the TEN-T as defined by the High Level Group in 2003 are expected to need funding of over \u20ac 235 billion between 2003 and 2020, the largest part of which falls in the period 2007-2013. The total cost of completing the complete TEN-T network which, next to the priority projects also includes additional measures to enable a modern transport network in the enlarged Europe, amounts to over \u20ac 600 billion. Realising the TEN-T network is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. The development of TENs is supported by various financial instruments as developed by the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB), which will be further addressed in this study. The figure below provides insight in the expected financial structure of the projects. Figure 1.1.

Implementation of TEN-T priority projects In 2003 it was concluded by the High Level Group that the implementation was constrained by financial limitations of the Member States, stressing the need for additional funding. Barely one third of the network had been built. Only three of the 14 specific projects endorsed by the European Council at Essen in 1994 had been completed. Nevertheless, the level of investment in transport infrastructure has fallen in most Member States, now amounting to less than 1% of GDP. As the major TEN-T projects are only truly viable if they are designed, financed and implemented in a European framework, it is unlikely that Member States, acting individually, could implement the major priority projects. Since the introduction of the Community guidelines, specific emphasis has been put on cross- border sections, which have been defined to be priority sections of the network. It is however, PE 379.207 2 ",
        "New Financial instruments for European Transport Infrastructure and Services increasingly recognised that these cross-border sections are often the key missing links in the network. In particular, cross-border connections are facing major difficulties since they receive less priority at the national level and require greater coordination efforts. 1.3. STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT This report presents the main observations and outcome of the analysis with regard to the possibly available financial instruments for the implementation of the TEN-T. These financial instruments have been reviewed within the context of the lifecycle of a project. The next figure shows the different phases of the project life cycle. Figure 1.2. Project life cycle Development/ Pre-Feasibility Contract/ Finance Exploitation/ Maintenance Construction Time line Tendering Financial close Rescheduling Source: ECORYS 2007 In order to answer the questions raised in section 1.1, this report firstly addresses the various sources that provide funding for or facilitate the trans-European Transport Network as indicated in figure 1.1. \u2022 Chapter 2 introduces the role of the European Commission (EC) and the financial instruments available for TEN-T on EC level. The subsequent chapters provide an overview of additional (innovative) financing instruments available which could complement this current EU grant financing of the TEN-T. This study does not include the introduction of a European Electronic Toll Service; \u2022 Chapter 3 describes the role and the financial instruments of the Member States as well as the absorption capacity for EU funds and Private Capital; \u2022 Chapter 4 elaborates the financial instruments the private sector offers. This chapter also addresses the legal, financial and economic conditions needed for successful Public-Private- Partnership (PPP) projects; \u2022 Chapter 5 addresses the role of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the EIB financial instruments; \u2022 Chapter 6 introduces financial instruments that have been available or are still available from other sources; \u2022 Chapter 7 provides an overview of the main findings of the report and provides an answer to the research questions. It also provides an overview of pros and cons of the different financial instruments that might act as a catalyst for attracting private finance and additional recommendations. Throughout this report, the financial instruments and constraints are mapped using the project life cycle as introduced in figure 1.2. PE317.527 3 ",

THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION Although the European Commission initialized the development of the TEN-T, it is the responsibility of the Member States to realise the TEN-T. The Commission is primarily facilitating and co-financier. This chapter highlights the instruments that are available from the European Commission. 2.2. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 2.2.1. European Commission budget for TEN-T The European Commission\u2019s Directorate General for Energy and Transport (DG TREN) has a budget available of \u20ac 8 billion for the TEN-T for the period from 2007-2013. The TEN-T budget is only available to projects that do not receive grants from the Cohesion fund or the Structural Funds. As many of the new member states and accession countries are eligible for Structural and Cohesion funds, most of the TEN-T budget goes to old member states. Furthermore, 85% of the budget is allocated to the priority projects. Community assistance may be combined. However, regardless of the form of intervention chosen, the total amount of Community aid may not exceed 20% of the total investment cost. The TEN Financial Regulation 1 provides that the TEN budget can be used for the following purposes: \u2022 Co-financing of studies (up to 50% of the costs of the study); \u2022 Direct grants for investment in duly justified cases; \u2022 Risk capital facility; \u2022 EIB Guarantee Scheme; \u2022 Interest subsidies on loans granted by the European Investment Bank or other public or private financial bodies. Of these instruments, only the newly designed guarantees scheme is expected to help attract private capital. The figure below shows the use of the EU TEN-T budget related to the life cycle of a project. 1 Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1655/1995 of 19 July 1999, Regulation (EC) No 788/2004 of 21 April 2004 and Regulation (EC) No 807/2004 of 21 April 2004.

Grants are normally issued by governments of benefactor countries to developing countries, and are distributed through intermediation with the local government. Risk Capital Facility (RCF) The RCF has been initiated by the European Commission as a facility to provide risk capital to TEN projects that are (partly) privately financed through the concept of Public Private Partnerships (PPP). The European Commission has made available \u20ac 46 million, under the management of the EIB, for this facility. To date \u20ac 25 million has been allocated for the purpose of co-investments alongside with a private infrastructure investment fund known as Galaxy Fund (GF) of which to date \u20ac 3 million has been disbursed to provide mezzanine debt to ALIS, a project company that holds a concession for the A28 Rouen - Alencon tolled motorway. The funds allocated by the EC to the GF can only be used for TEN network according to pre-set selection criteria. It has been noted that EIB has made further risk capital commitments to the Dutch Infrastructure Fund and the Dexia Southern EU Infrastructure Fund. At the time of conceptualizing and initiating the Risk Capital Facility, the facility was needed because the outlook for the financial market was one where the investor market was characterized by the shortage of equity. The purpose of the Risk Capital Facility was to provide for risk-capital participation in Community aid for projects with the overall aim to help facilitate the implementation of TEN projects. The Regulation was published in the Official Journal C 188 on 4 July 2001 and it entered into force hereafter. The aim of the Regulation is, hence, to encourage a larger involvement of investments from the private sector in the future. Until now financing has mainly come from public sector investment and EU budgetary sources in the form of grants and loans from the EIF and the EIB. The evaluation of the TEN Risk Capital Facility of June 2006 concluded that it is questionable whether the same need exists today. The Risk Capital facility has indeed not been well conceived from the start. Reason was that the project eligibility was very narrowly defined, which made the concept difficult. All in all the Risk Capital Facility did not act as a catalyst for attracting the high quality investors that were required for the projects. PE 379.207 6 ",
        "New Financial instruments for European Transport Infrastructure and Services Loan Guarantee Scheme The Loan Guarantee Scheme is planned to be implemented in 2007 based on market research by the EIB showing that: \u2022 Private parties do not accept traffic risk; \u2022 The European Commission does not accept traffic risk either; \u2022 Financial simulations showed that the traffic risk is reduced by a financial instrument which guarantees payment of debt service in the ramp-up period. The instrument is intended to provide support for specific types of PPPs. The aim is to stimulate private sector investment in priority TEN-T projects by providing credit assistance. The Loan Guarantee Scheme is therefore designed to provide a cushion for unexpected shortfalls in the cash flow available for debt service. It is an EC commitment backing a subordinated debt facility of a TEN project during the ramp-up period, which is from the end of the construction to the stabilization of the cash-flows. One of the main benefits of the instrument is that it attracts private capital and that the money in the guarantee fund can be used flexibly and for more than one project, whereas in case of a grant the money can only be spent once. A project is eligible for the guarantee if it is rated within a specific band (BB- to BBB) of project credit ratings. The higher the credit rating (AAA rating being higher than for instance B rating), the higher the bankablitiy of a project. The key driver for the bankability of a project is the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR). This ratio indicates the extent in which income from operational cash flows can meet the debt service requirements. Relevant Standard & Poors (S&P) credit ratings are summarized in the table below, the highlighted rows indicate the range of ratings of projects eligible for the EIB Guarantee Scheme. Table 2.1 DSCR and long term credit rating Long term credit rating DSCR A 3.0 BBB 1.5 BB 1.2 B 1.0 Source: EIB, Evaluation of cross-border TEN projects, 2006. Above a BBB credit rating, the project is investment grade and does not need the guarantee. In such a case a guarantee will only make the cost of capital more expensive because of the risk margin. Projects below a certain credit rating cannot be supported by the guarantee. It is important to note that the guarantee is not an instrument that finances the investment, but that supports the bankability of a project. In this sense, the Loan Guarantee Fund is currently the only part of the EU TEN budget that can be combined with the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Leverage effect The potential leverage effect of this instrument is high. The Commission allocated \u20ac 500 million, and in addition the EIB provided an additional \u20ac 500 million which means that the budget was set at \u20ac 1 billion. Under the guarantee f acility the provisions for capital allocation, depending on the risk profile of the various projects, can be estimated at a high 20% of the amount guaranteed (i.e. for each \u20ac 100 million of guarantees provided, a provision of \u20ac 20 PE317.527 7 ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services million should be reserved). This means that under the guarantee facility the total amount of guarantees issued increases to \u20ac 5 billion, which represents 10 times the initial contribution of the Commission. The guarantee facility underpins the senior debt facility as debt providers have the confidence that subordinated debt will remain in the project. This reduces the risk profile of the project considerably and will attract more senior debt providers. This means that the leverage has high potential to increase further due to this support for bankability. It is can be expected that the leverage is 20 to 30 times the original contribution of the Commission. Interest subsidies Interest subsidies have not been used so far. 2.2.2. Cohesion Fund The Cohesion Fund (CF) finances projects designed to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in Member States of whom the per capita GNP is below 90% of the Community average and who are following a program of economic convergence are eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund. Public or private bidders, responsible for the implementation of a project, can apply. Projects that are co-financed by the EU budget, are not eligible. Funds are mainly allocated to projects that are within the fields of transport and environment. Lisbon Vasco da Gamma bridge \u2013 Portugal The Vasco da Gamma bridge in Portugal concerns a 33 year Design Build Finance Operate (DBFO) contract including the operations and maintenance of the 25 April bridge (parallel to the Vasco da Gamma Bridge). This contract has been awarded to Lusoponte. Although the project was procured based on a DBFO contract, many of the main risks are contractually allocated to the government. The total investment cost of this bridge was \u20ac 900 million. The bridge is funded by a 20-year EIB loan (33%), the Cohesion Fund (35%), government grants (26%) and private shareholders (6%). The private capital and EIB repayment are based on toll revenues. Source: Infranews and ECORYS PPP database 2007 2.2.3. European Regional Development Fund The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is one of the European Structural Funds. It was established in 1975 with the intention to stimulate economic development in the EU\u2019s least developed regions. Two types of regions are eligible for ERDF funding: \u2022 Objective 1 regions: regions where GDP is below 75% of EU average \u2022 Objective 2 regions: regions that are facing structural economic difficulties. The ERDF does not contribute more that 50% of the eligible costs, which can be increased to 75% in objective 1 regions. In case of investment in infrastructure generating substantial net revenue, the contribution cannot exceed 40% of eligible costs in Objective 1 regions. To be eligible for ERDF assistance projects must meet the following criteria: \u2022 The project objectives must correspond with one or more priorities for support in a regional programming document agreed with the EC; \u2022 The project must have clear and attainable targets and offer additional and sustainable advantages to the economic development of the area; \u2022 The project would not be able to proceed without ERDF support. So far, the ERDF has not been used to fund TEN-T projects. PE 379.207 8 ",

The Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency (TEN-TEA) The Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency (TEN-TEA) was created on 26 October 2006. The Agency manages the Community TEN-T budget available for the promotion of the Trans-European Transport network in close collaboration with DG TREN of the European Commission. Starting from 2007 the Agency manages an annual budget of approximately \u20ac 1 billion. The main tasks of the Agency will be: \u2022 To ensure the technical and financial management of projects co-financed under the TEN-T networks\u2019 budget; \u2022 To collect, analyse and transmit to the Commission of all information required for the implementation of the TEN-T network as well as assisting the Commission with programming for the TEN-T network; \u2022 To check the conformity of projects co-financed by the Community with the transport policy rules and principles applicable to TEN-T network infrastructures; \u2022 To provide technical support to project promoters and to the financial institutions which will be responsible for managing the loan guarantee instrument for TEN-T network projects. \u2022 To provide any technical and administrative support requested by the Commission. 2.3.2. Jaspers The Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions (Jaspers) initiative is essentially based around the two main financial instruments of Europe\u2019s cohesion policy. Jaspers aims to help Member States to accelerate the preparation of major infrastructure projects to be co-financed by the Cohesion Fund and the ERDF. Via the Jaspers programme in particular, the EC wants to ensure that Community funds are put to better use by the Member States. Under the Jaspers programme, assistance with the preparation of projects comprises in particular (i) advice on specific aspects of project preparation, (ii) the examination of documents, such as feasibility studies, environmental impact evaluations, technical design and tender dossiers, etc. (iii) advice on the conceptual development of projects. (iv) advice relating to compliance with the law, (v) assistance in examining and preparing applications for financing under the Cohesion Fund or the ERDF, (vi) exceptionally, Jaspers may also provide assistance with project implementation (e.g. concerning procurement) once the Commission has decided to grant assistance. The following figure provides an overview of the instruments of the CF and ERDF and Jaspers in relation to the project life cycle. PE317.527 9 ",

European Coordinators To improve coordination of investments, the revised guidelines allow the Commission to nominate European coordinators for individual cross-border sections, for groups of projects located on the same priority axis, or for a whole axis. These European coordinators, acting for the Commission, will mainly deal with projects which need a strong, often political, push in order to overcome difficulties in the planning and construction phases and will encourage cooperation with users and operators, promote the projects to private investors and financial institutions, including in the EU, and keep the Commission informed of progress.

THE ROLE OF MEMBER STATES Member States are the driving force behind the development of the TEN-T network. The largest part of the financing needed in the period 2007-2013 has to be provided by Member States and other sources (refer to figure 1.1). Decisions about investments in TEN infrastructure projects are taken at national level and financing from national budgets accounts for the majority of TEN investments. The guidelines for the development of TENs are however drawn at the EU level, while infrastructure planning and measures to implement individual projects are the responsibility of the Member States concerned. Within the Member States and depending on the size and importance of the projects, the responsibility for Energy and Transport projects is often delegated to a more local level. Whilst governments have launched many projects, which coincide with their national priorities, they have been more hesitant in respect of projects, particularly cross-border links, outside their national plans. Member States can be involved in financing the project implementation from the (pre-) feasibility phase to the financial close. Furthermore, it is the Member State that is responsible for the institutional and regulatory environment in which the project is to be implemented. This environment can play an important role in the ability of a project to attract the funding required. During the exploitation and maintenance, the Member States can also have a role, however, this is outside the scope of this study. The following figure provides a schematic overview of Member State funding in the project life-cycle. Figure 3.1 Member State involvement in project implementation Development/ Pre-Feasibility Contract/ Finance Exploitation/ Maintenance Construction Time line Tendering Financial close Rescheduling Member State involvement in institutional and regulatory framework Member State Funding Member State Funding Source: ECORYS 2007 Member States normally provide funding through sovereign grants. Occasionally, funding is provided as equity or debt. In fact, the role of public funding of the member states in the TEN-T project is that of Lender of the Last Resort (e.g. the only party that can provide funds when no one else will) since the other sources are locked in by institutional limitations such as limited TEN Budget and maximum involvement such as maximum 50% EIB funding, maximum 10% funding out of TEN budget, and the fact that involving the TEN budget implies no involvement of the Structural and Cohesion Funds (also refer to chapter 2 and chapter 4 for more information). This can explain why Member States have been hesitant to incorporate the TEN-T funding a priori in their National Budget. Second reason is that they are hesitant to be forced into a TEN T project were they see only a limited benefit for their country. PE317.527 11 ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services 3.2. FINANCE CAPACITY National budgets As indicated before, Member States should be the driving force behind the development of the TEN-T. An important question is, however, whether or not the Member States have the ability to fulfil that role, since the projects have been selected at EU level with EU criteria and to some extend based on political choices rather than project feasibility. For instance, the ability of the Member States involved to raise sufficient public funds, as well as the local environment for PPP do not seem to have been major criteria for project selection. In view of the severe budgetary constraints on the new Member States combined with a substantial local need for new infrastructure, fully public funding of TEN-T infrastructure in the medium term appears increasingly over-ambitious. Member States are constrained in their investment policy under the rules of the budgetary discipline within the EU Stability and Growth Pact (Amsterdam 1997). To avoid excessive government deficits, their ratio of planned or actual government deficit to GDP (Gross Domestic Product) should be no more than 3%, and their ratio of government debt to GDP should be no more than 60%. Annex B provides an overview of the public balance and general government debt of the Member States. It shows that most Member States do not exceed the limits to public debt and government deficit are not exceeded in the majority of countries. Therefore, these limitations do not seem to be the driving force behind the budgetary constraints, albeit that they are perceived to constrain public investments. Accounting Standards for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) In order to facilitate off-balance financing by Member States through the use of PPP, the European Accounting Standards have recently redefined the criteria for off-balance financing in case of a PPP. In a PPP contract the government agrees to buy services from a non-government unit (private party) over a long period of time. In the case that the asset is constructed by the private party in order to deliver public services, the assets can in some cases be considered as non-government assets and as such be financed off-balance sheet. The constraint to this arrangement is, that there must be strong evidence that the private partner bears the construction risk and the availability or the demand risk of the project. In chapter 4 these models of PPP are further explained. 3.3. IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY A large part of the TEN priority projects are located in new Member States. These new Member States are perceived to lack the required public financing resources, the technical resources to design and manage the construction and are looking for professional management. Therefore, PPP has been introduced to those states. Consequently, legal and institutional frameworks for PPP are currently being or have recently been set up in many of those states (refer to annex A), following the success of PPP in old Member States. However, successful PPP projects have not been realised in those areas so far. Annex A shows that, the Member States that already have PPP legislation or an institutional framework in place for a some years are the countries that have been able to build a successful practise. It is therefore important to support the new Member States to set up a well established institutional framework. Chapter 4 provides an insight in the key drivers for success for PPP. A large number of new Member States will need support in order to realise the set goals and to organize the institutional and regulatory framework accordingly. PE 379.207 12 ",
        "New Financial instruments for European Transport Infrastructure and Services 4. PRIVATE CAPITAL 4.1. THE ROLE OF PRIVATE CAPITAL Private capital is a key component of a public private partnership arrangement. In such an arrangement a private entity, normally a special purpose vehicle as being a special legal entity setup specifically for the purpose of executing the contract, is responsible for the design, build, finance, maintain and operate of an infrastructure asset. Costs incurred by the entity as being capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX), including cost of capital, can be recovered in three ways: \u2022 Direct payments such as tolls on roads and bridges . The revenue risk of using toll charging schemes is that revenue depends on the level of available traffic and the willingness to pay which is beyond the control of the infrastructure provider. Examples of such PPP schemes (also referred to as concessions or Design Build Finance Maintain and Operate or DBFM) are: \u2022 France: toll roads \u2022 Spain: toll roads \u2022 Italy: toll roads \u2022 UK: M6 Birmingham \u2022 Indirect payments, such as shadow tolls on roads. The revenue risk in case of indirect payment is that the payment to the provider depends on traffic volumes, however, fee structures can be designed to minimise the risk to the provider and at the same time limiting profits from large traffic increases. Examples of such PPP schemes are: \u2022 Portugal: SCUT Program \u2022 Poland: A1 Gdansk - Torun \u2022 Unitary payments for transport infrastructure . Payments are from a public contracting authority to the private entity based on the availability for use of the infrastructure asset or other performance indicators as agreed upon. The revenue risk in this case is that unitary payments are based on the asset being available for use, with penalties in case of failure to perform. Examples of such PPP schemes (also referred to as Design Build Finance Maintain contracts or DBFM) are: \u2022 Netherlands: A59 Rosmalen \u2013 Geffen \u2022 Netherlands: N31 Leeuwarden \u2013 Drachten \u2022 Netherlands: High Speed Line Infraprovider \u2022 Netherlands: Coentunne (in tender)l \u2022 Belgium: Oosterweel link at Antwerp (in tender) \u2022 Belgium: Liefkenshoek tunnel (in tender) \u2022 Hungary: M5 \u2022 Hungary: M6 (in tender) PE317.527 13 ",

It was also made clear that an availability-based remuneration system would be more accessible from the private sector\u2019s point of view, but again, this was left-out of the tender documents\u201d. Source: www.infranews.com It is also to be noted that a unitary payment based PPP implies that the public contracting authority in the end still pays for the infrastructure though the annual fees. The public contracting authority can recover these costs through implementing road user charges or a vignette. Antwerp Mobility Plan The municipal government of Antwerp has prepared an innovative PPP scheme to enhance its infrastructure and improve mobility. Several availability payment based schemes have been defined included the construction of the Oosterweel link and the Liefkenshoek tunnel. The contingent liability of availability payments is to be recovered through a yet to be designed road user charging scheme.

        "New Financial instruments for European Transport Infrastructure and Services within budget in comparison with publicly finance projects. It is generally acknowledged that provided a project is structured adequately, a PPP will provide Value for Money. \u2022 Acceleration of infrastructure provision The use of private capital will ease the burden on the public budget in a given year and will enable consequently the development of more projects. It is to be noted however that the advantage is merely acceleration and does not imply that over a long-term perspective more projects can be generated. Privately financed projects as do publicly financed projects will imply a long-term cost to the society and the key requirement for any project is that the total cost to the society should not exceed the total benefits to the society. \u2022 Reduced risk to public sector By allocating risks to the part best able to bear them, the risk to the public sector will be reduced. A PPP normally implies that the construction and the performance and or demand risk is transferred to the private sector. In particular the construction and performance risks are risks that can be better handled by the private sector as they will have the resources and the competences to manage. Demand risks should only be transferred in case the private sector has the ability to manage the demand or when the demand is high enough. Even if Member States funding of TEN-T would increase significantly, there is still a funding gap to be filled. The European Commission estimates the private sector can contribute a maximum of 30% of the required funds for certain projects 2 . Figure 4.2.

        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services 4.2. INSTRUMENTS Infrastructure projects frequently present relatively complex financial structures and arrangements. The financing package is likely to draw on several sources of funds in order to tailor it to the particular needs of the project and the investors. In response to this, an array of financing techniques has been developed to mobilize capital resources. A project can be funded through issuing different combinations of debt, equity and hybrid instruments. Lenders will always seek comfortable level of equity from shareholders to ensure that the project sponsors are seriously committed to the project and have vested interest in seeing the project succeed. Thus projects with strong cash flows and low risk can be structured with low levels of equity, whereas higher risk weak projects require higher equity levels. Debt The critical element in project finance is the provision of debt to finance a project. Financing with debt brings liabilities to the project company. These are obligation that require a payout of principal and interests within a stipulated time, and are frequently associated with a fixed cash burden. There is an extensive market for long-term debt financing for transport infrastructure projects, and markets have become increasingly receptive to project debt issues that are properly structured. Debt financing is often provided through private placements (that is, negotiations between the sponsor and specified individual lenders). Alternatively, this financing can in certain circumstances be raised through capital markets (e.g. via public bond issue). Equity Equity represents an ownership claim on the earnings and assets of a project. That is, after holder of debt claims are paid, the management of the company can either pay out the remaining earnings to equity holders (project sponsors) in the form of dividends, or reinvest the earnings back into the project. For infrastructure projects sponsors can be both public and private. The willingness of governments to allow investors to get the high returns they require is an important factor in the ability of infrastructure projects to attract equity from private sources. Guarantees and insurance Guarantees and insurance are used to optimize the bankablity of the project and to minimize the risk for the equity providers to lose their money in case the project does not turn out to be successful. Project sponsors are able to insure the project against various risks, such as casualties and political risk. Under the traditional insurance structure, the investors purchase insurance against certain risks from an insurer, and payment are made in the form of premiums. 4.3. SOURCES OF PRIVATE CAPITAL The main private investors in infrastructure are the banks. More recently, available capital has been structured in infrastructure funds. Infrastructure funds are set up in order to allow investors to invest in a portfolio of long term assets rather than just one project. This allows risk diversification and makes infrastructure projects more available as investment opportunities for instance for institutional investors. PE 379.207 16 ",

In the United States, the sale of existing infrastructure projects was driving the PPP market in 2006 7 , which is interesting for equity investors as cash flows of these projects are already known, and there are no major legal issues that cause delay.

Consequently, it can be concluded that the European capital market has an excess of liquidity which is currently flowing away to less complicated markets. High transaction costs and long lead time Private parties consulted indicated that one of the main reasons for them to direct their attention towards markets outside Europe due to the European procurement procedures, which cause very long project preparation phases. Therefore it is becoming more and more cost efficient to invest outside of Europe. Furthermore, due to the European procurement procedures the lead time before projects in Europe reach their financial close is relatively long. In this lead time, private capital providers invest quite some time and effort in the project preparation, without the certainty of any financial gains. Excessive risk transfer Before deciding on whether to invest in a project, potential investors and lenders evaluate the project using both quantitative and qualitative measures. The investors require certain basic legal, regulatory and economic conditions throughout the life of the project, in order to reduce project risks. The eligibility for private finance is defined primarily by the credit rate of the project, which is the ratio measuring whether or not a project is investment grade. Credit rates are based on the expected Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), in other words the ability of a project to pay back its financial obligations. The following table provides an overview of some credit rates as 7 P3 Americas, Global Infrastructure Report 2006-2007 Part Three \u2013 North America, 2007. PE 379.207 18 ",

Table 4.3 DSCR AND LONG TERM CREDIT RATING Long term credit rating DSCR A 3.0 BBB 1.5 BB 1.2 B 1.0 Source: Standards & Poors 2007 Projects with a credit rating from A upwards are investment grade. The DSCR is for a large extend influenced by the project risk. The figure below shows the projects risks and in which project phase they occur. Figure 4.3. Main project risks Development/ Feasibility Contract/ Finance Exploitation/ Maintenance Construction Ramp-up period Time line Rescheduling Tendering Financial close Funding risk Risk of delay & cost overruns Revenue risk Political risk Risk profile reduced Risk profile reduced Source: ECORYS 2007 The division of the risks is very important in the process of attracting private finance. Banks will put constraints to the project companies they are lending to, with regards to their risk profile. For a project company that is bearing risks which it is not able to manage, it will be difficult to attract private finance. Each project faces the risks indicated in the figure above. However, especially revenue risk and political risk are very project specific. Revenue risk Revenue risk is particularly eminent in user charge based PPP. Income from user charges is based on the number of users and a rate. But how many users will use a new road in say 15 years from now. How many cars will there be. What will be the economic and social dynamics? How will they react to a charge? What are their alternatives? In short, many uncertainties and it is not uncommon that projects with too many uncertainties fail (e.g. Eurotunnel). M5 Hungary In 1992 the Hungarian government invited an international tender for renovation, modernization and further construction of motorway M5. A French-Austrian-Hungarian consortium won the concession; construction companies Bouygues SA, Bau Holding AG and toll-road operator Maygar Intertoll Rt became equity-holders in a designated DFBO(M) SPV called \u2018AKA Rt\u2019. AKA Rt was to develop the M5 as a tolled motorway . The project was 22% equity-financed by the consortium partners, and 78% debt-financed through EBRD A/B loans. The Hungarian government provided a stand-by subordinated debt facility in case toll revenues would not materialize as forecasted. Toll revenues PE317.527 19 ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services were to finance maintenance, operations and interest payments. In 2003, AKA Rt debt was refinanced. From 1996, project implementation took place in three phases. Phase 1 comprised upgrading existing sections of the M5 motorway and a first extension of 90 km. Phases 2 and 3 (the latter completed in March 2006) provided for additional extensions of the M5 motorway up to the Hungarian-Serbian border. Unexpectedly, toll operations led to traffic fleeing to parallel roads and consequent legal action by local residents, leaving toll revenues below forecasts . Inter alia, the Hungarian government covered AKA Rt\u2019s losses through the standby facility. As the construction phases progressed, traffic and thus toll revenues after all did not materialize as forecasted. In response, the Hungarian government altered the basic financing concept. In March 2004, 100% state-owned enterprise \u00c1AK Rt (State Motorway Management Company) purchased 40% of AKA Rt shares. \u00c1AK Rt started to collect payments for vignettes granting motorists access to all roads including the M5 motorway. From January 2006, the government pays an annual 92,5 MEUR to AKA Rt under an availability payment scheme . From this sum, capped deductions are made if AKA Rt does not fulfil its contractual obligations (e.g. in cases of motorway unavailability, safety issues, failure to meet operational requirements). \u00c1AK Rt has an option until 2009 to purchase the remaining 60% of AKA Rt shares. Source: Infranews and ECORYS PPP database 2007 Country or political risk Country risk or political risk involves the possibility that political authorities in the host country might interfere with the development of the project. These may include expropriation, nationalisation, war, and restrictions on the repatriation of funds. Private funding will be possible only if investor is sure that the policies will not change and if he is able to estimate future effective demand with some accuracy. E.g. in Poland one of the key reasons why PPP has not yet taken off despite the Commission\u2019s support, was the political instability the past years and the consequent indecisiveness on the use of PPP, albeit that last year finally the PPP Law has been approved. This risk is within the infrastructure provider\u2019s control and should be carried by the provider. It is the government that pays the unitary payments, therefore a certain political risk is attached to this system. In a consultation of EIB with relevant stakeholders, an idea raised was the implementation of an unitary payment guarantee fund, in order to eliminate this political risk. 4.5. KEY REQUIREMENTS TO ENABLE PPP The likelihood of successful PPP is, besides the financial viability of the project, also driven by the country specific development of an enabling environment consisting of the following critical success factors. PE 379.207 20 ",
        "New Financial instruments for European Transport Infrastructure and Services Figure 4.4. The critical success factors of PPP Successful Successful PPP PPP LEGISLATION To enable private sector participation in an efficient and effective manner INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK Public competence to ensure efficient and effective preparation and implementation of transactions ACCESS TO CAPITAL Availability of private Capital to ensure private investments POLITICAL WILL AND TRANSPARENT POLICY A PPP \u2018Champ\u2019 with the power to make it happen Source: ECORYS 2007 Political commitment and a clear policy The experience in successful PPP countries illustrate the importance of political will to implement PPP. In the UK the ambition the implement PPP was conceived by the Thatcher regime and then developed further by the Blair government with success. In the Netherlands it was the former Minister of Finance, Gerrit Zalm who continuously was convincing his fellow ministers to use PPP with the result that to date PPP has been applied in the Netherlands in several sectors, including roads, rail, schools, urban development, and government accommodation. Various other sectors are in the process of preparing PPP\u2019s. A legislative framework to enable PPP In relation to the political will it is of the utmost importance that the legislative framework is suited to the requirements of PPP. Annex A provides an overview of the countries in which a PPP law was implemented in 2004. In many countries the legislative system was not supporting the concept of PPP, (e.g. the transfer of the responsibility to have a private entity provide a public, and the suitability of procurement legislation for PPPs). Recent research by the EIB illustrates that availability of PPP legislation is strongly related to successful PPP implementation (Ireland, Spain, Portugal are very successful PPP countries and all had a specific PPP legislation in place by 2004 \u2013 see Annex A). A recent EBRD study illustrates that concession legislation in several countries, in particular in the new member states, has low to medium compliance with international standards. As well as enabling legislation for public authorities to enter into PPPs, it may also be necessary to ensure that investors can take security over project revenues, and address potential distortions caused by tax law. A good PPP law is sufficiently high level, delegates down to sub rules and regulations, establishes a clear focus, set of guidelines and legally approved remit for the PPP Unit in operation or to be created and most importantly of all is not in conflict with existing laws, and brings up to date other laws required to be improved, repealed or transformed as the new PPP law comes into operation. The Law needs to be both a communication and a marketing tool, as well as an accurate reflection of the laws it wishes to be enforced. PE317.527 21 ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services A competent public administration and transparent institutional framework Political will and a legislative framework are not sufficient. It is the public administration that is responsible for preparing and implementing PPP projects. To ensure efficient and effective transactions it is crucial that the public administration is well trained, that PPP activities are coordinated and that guidance to PPP is provided to all stakeholders. For these purposes mainly many governments have initiated the development of central PPP units following the practice in the UK with the PFI Task Force. These central units may sometimes be embedded within spending departments, or at arms length of government with structures such as Partnerships UK and the Strategic Investment Board in Northern Ireland, or both. The advantage of an arms length body is that it is able to make direct investments in certain types of project, or to recover its costs only on successful completion of a project. It can also bring commercial disciplines and accountability to its own management and to the projects with which it is involved. The units in Central and Eastern Europe have been mostly supported by international consultants through grants from the European Commission or IFI\u2019s. It is worrisome to note that the PPP units in Poland and Hungary appear to have ceased to exist or at the least do not show any activity. It gives hope that other countries have set up such units and are the process of enhancing their competence level like in Romania and Bulgaria. Availability of both public and private capital and willingness to invest by the private sector In general there currently is a large amount of private capital available for infrastructure projects, mainly from international banks. All in all it should be noted that a lot of private capital is available for investment in infrastructure projects in Europe and beyond, as long as the projects are interesting, the national government is supportive showing its commitment to the project by investing in it, as well and the environment in a country enables PPP. 4.6. COMBINING PPP WITH COMMUNITY FUNDING Public Private Partnerships have proven to be able to be combined with EIB loan funding. Considerable uncertainty has however been expressed as to whether and how EU grant funding or even can be used to co-finance PPP projects. Furthermore, the combination of Member State funding and PPP is a very complicated one. There are however obvious benefits for both the EU and the Governments of the Member States if mutually acceptable approaches to combination of EU grants and TEN-T budget and PPP models can be identified in theory. This will enable more projects to be implemented faster and hence faster realization of the TEN-T. Challenges A number of fundamental challenges linked to combining public financing and PPP can be summarized: \u2022 Procurement based on EU grants or State budget is typically focusing on input specifications whereas procurement of PPP projects is based on output specifications; \u2022 Procurement based on EU grants or State budget is focuses on an investment (with the national or local authorities having the responsibility for subsequent operations and maintenance), whereas procurement of PPP projects is typically based on combined procurement of all works and services for the full project life cycle in one tender and one contract; \u2022 The negotiated procurement procedure used in most PPP projects (where the number of bidders is being reduced gradually during negotiations and only 2-3 bidders prepare detailed designs and submit final bids) is difficult to combine with the focus on equal treatment under procurement of EU financed projects; PE 379.207 22 ",
        "New Financial instruments for European Transport Infrastructure and Services \u2022 At the same time there is a fundamental difference in the basics for attracting private capital and EU grant or state budget funding: \u2022 Private capital requires that the project (including possible budget and donor subsidy elements) is financially viable so that the private sector can get an acceptable financial return given the risks of the project. On the other hand private capital is not concerned with the socio-economic benefits of a given projects (unless it has a potential impact on their risk or return); \u2022 EU grant funding and State budgets are allocated based on the projects socio-economic benefits. Combining PPP and Public finance: PATHE and Via Egnatia in Greece The Greek motorway PATHE and Via Egnatia is the backbone of the Greek road system and connects the country to all of its neighbors. The road is part of the TEN-T network. The project consists of two axis: (i) PATHE- the North-South axis: Rio-Antirio, Patras-Promahon (ii) VIA EGNATIA \u2013 the east-west axis The project included construction of 800 km on the PATHE axis and 780 km on the Via Egnatia axis. In order to use private capital as well as community funding, the project was split according to several sections, for some of the sections PPP was applied, such as the Rio-Antirio Bridge, the Athens ring road and the Malaikos fixed link.

THE ROLE OF THE EIB TEN financing was always an important operational priority for the EIB. The Bank was actively involved in the preparation of the European Action for Growth (AGI) initiative (2003), which has induced changes in its organisational structure and defined TENs as one of the five main Commercial Operating Plan (COP) lending priorities. The EIB is a leading source of bank finance for the Trans-European Networks in the Union and Accession Countries. From the inception of the policy in 1993 to December 2005, loans amounting to \u20ac 69.3 billion for transport TENs a nd \u20ac 9.1 billion for energy TENs were signed. Figure 5.1.

FINANCING INSTRUMENTS Closer collaboration between EIB and the Commission and other important stakeholders has been set up. The EIB is acting as an advisor to the Commission, Member States and Public Authorities on TEN, PPP financing and other institutional issues. In 2005, the EIB signed a Memorandum of Understanding with DG TREN to formalise the existing cooperation between the Bank and the Commission in support of Energy and Transport TEN projects. This agreement concerns policy definition and formulation as well as specific project financing. The EIB does not finance the total investment cost of a project, the objective being to capitalise on the Bank\u2019s first-rate lending terms to attract other viable sources of financing. The EIB contribution does not normally exceed 50% of the total investment cost, although for trans- European transport schemes funding may amount to as much as 75% in exceptional cases. Restricting EIB financing to 50% enables the borrower to establish a dynamic and diversified finance plan in partnership with other financial institutions and banks. EIB loans can be additional to local and national budgetary assistance, as well as to EU grants such as Structural Funds, depending on the scope and nature of the individual project. No territorial restrictions apply to EIB loans. They are granted on the basis of banking criteria. These include the financial (ability to repay), technical and environmental feasibility of the project. PE317.527 25 ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services In general terms, the EIB has four main financing facilities for TENs: \u2022 Individual loans for capital expenditure programmes or projects; \u2022 TEN Risk Capital Facility established with the support of Community budget to directly assist projects or via specialised venture capital companies; \u2022 Structured finance facility; \u2022 EIB Guarantee scheme. 5.2.1. Loan facilities EIB provides individual loans for capital expenditure programmes or projects with capital requirements of more than \u20ac 25 million, which ar e relevant in the context of large-scale infrastructure projects such as TENs. A number of facilities can be used for the TEN-T. TEN Investment Facility In order to attract more private capital for TENs, the EIB has improved financial instruments, introduced additional risk taking and increased EIB resources with a new TENs Investment Facility (TIF) designed to invest \u20ac 75 billion until 2013. The Bank\u2019s financial operations cover traditional long-term lending products from own resources (senior loans, PPP loans, securitised loans etc.) with long maturities and grace periods. In exceptional cases, the EIB can, under this Facility for investment grade projects, provide long maturities of up to 35 years and finance, in exceptional cases (specific cross-border projects), up to 75 % of project costs. Structured finance facility In order to match the types of funding to the requirements of projects with a high-risk profile and to pursue its equity financing and guarantee operations in favor of large-scale infrastructure schemes, the EIB has established a Structured Finance Facility (SFF). Under this facility, the EIB can assume a greater degree of credit risk in the financing of projects than it normally would. Total reserves of \u20ac 750 million have been set aside under this heading over the a three year period for the purpose of generating operations amounting to between \u20ac 1.5 and \u20ac 2.5 billion, providing a broad mix of financial products: \u2022 Senior loans and guarantees incorporating pre-completion and early operational risk; \u2022 Subordinated loans and guarantees ranking ahead of shareholder subordinated debt; \u2022 Mezzanine finance, including high-yield debt for industrial companies in transition from SME scale or in the course of restructuring; \u2022 Project-related derivatives. The aim of the SFF is to furnish value added for priority projects by complementing the commercial banks and capital markets. These operations will be undertaken chiefly in the countries of the European Union, but also in non-member countries. High-speed rail in Spain In 2002 the EIB approved a loan in the region of EUR 2.5 billion for the construction of the high- speed rail infrastructure between Madrid-Barcelona-Figueres. The new line, totaling 855 km in length, includes a number of bypasses, tunnels and other links. The project not only provides an environmentally attractive alternative to the air and road modes which currently link Spain\u2019s two largest cities, but also represents a critical step towards interconnecting the Spanish and French highspeed rail networks. The Madrid-Barcelona-Perpignan-Montpellier (TGV Sud) project was identified by the Essen European Council in 1994 as one of the 14 priority TENs. Within this context, this project remains a key component of Spain\u2019s plans for the improvement of the national rail infrastructure and forms part of the trans-European railway network planned for 2010.

Risk capital facility EIB is managing the Commission\u2019s Risk Capital Facility (RCF), this RCF is intended to support the development of private infrastructure funds that are aimed at investing in TEN-T projects. The RCF is invested in a series of infrastructure equity funds. The EIB is participating in these funds with the aim of injecting equity into TEN PPP projects. The first funds that have been signed by the EIB are Galaxy Fund; the Dexia Southern EU Infrastructure Fund; and the Dutch Infrastructure Fund. 5.3. FACILITATING INSTRUMENTS 5.3.1. Guarantee schemes The Bank is actively contributing to the setting up of the Loan Guarantee for TENs Transport (LGTT) to provide additional support for projects\u2019 post-construction risks. The instrument is intended to provide support for specific types of PPPs. The aim is to stimulate private sector investment in priority TEN-T projects by providing credit assistance. The Loan Guarantee Scheme is therefore designed to provide a cushion for unexpected shortfalls in the cash flow available for debt service. It is an EC commitment backing a subordinated debt facility of a TEN project during the ramp-up period, which is from the end of the construction to the stabilization of the cash-flows.

EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT The EBRD currently has almost 70 on-going projects in the EU Member States and Accession countries with an overall budget envelope of \u20ac 2,284 million. 57% of the investments are in road, 21% in rail and 13% in waterborne transport. The EBRD has financed projects aimed at reducing bottlenecks and/or border crossing times (e.g. Brest-Minsk highway in Belarus) but has also supported institutional development of \u201csoft measure\u201d by securing funding through technical cooperation funds. The EBRD has actively been, or is actively involved in financing specific projects along the main trans national axes in Belarus, Ukraine and in Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and in Albania. The EBRD insists on high quality projects, and selects feasible projects according to their transition impact and ability to bring additional value to them. The Bank must constantly ensure its projects have a \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d, such as demonstrating additional benefits to the local economy, mobilising co-financing or relieving infrastructure bottlenecks. Example of EBRD involvement: Ukraine, Kiev-Chop M06 Highway The M06 project will support the completion of the rehabilitation effort of the M06 Kiev-Chop Highway to European standards, which was started with the first and second EBRD road projects in Ukraine. This third project will finance rehabilitation of the remaining sections of the M06 road, from Kiev to the city of Brody, Lviv region (km 14 \u2013 km 441). The M06 road forms part of Trans-European Corridor III (Kiev-Lviv-Krakow-Berlin) and Corridor V (Lviv-Chop-Budapest) and links Ukraine with Western Europe. The project includes a Technical Assistance component, which will aim to develop appropriate PPP legislation in accordance with the international best practice, identify a small number of potential PPP projects and carry out detailed due diligence for one pilot project which potentially could be developed in co-operation with the EBRD. The EBRD loan is planned to be supplemented by additional estimated \u20ac 200 million to be provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB). The total project costs are estimated at \u20ac 486 million. \u20ac 350,000 was provided under EU IPF 2003 facility for technical assistance in the development of legislation and a PPP Strategy for the road sector.

WORLD BANK World Bank\u2019s main vehicle for making strategic choices about its program and resource allocations for individual countries is the Country Assistance Strategy, which is based on extensive analysis of the economic and social situation of the country concerned. Lending limits are determined e.g. by the creditworthiness of the country in terms of its fiscal space or debt position and individual projects are subjected to an extensive and rigorous assessment of their micro-economic viability, and their macro-economic fit, given the often constrained public finances in these countries.

PEP-SE Technical assistance with regards to infrastructure projects in the European region is implemented through Private Enterprise Partnership for Southeast Europe (PEP-SE). One of the main objectives of PEP-SE is to offer advisory services for the structuring and implementation of PPP in infrastructure. It does this through the PEP-SE Infrastructure Facility based in Sofia, Bulgaria. The facility helps develop, promote, and execute infrastructure projects with private participation through project preparation, structuring, transparent bidding processes, and mobilization of financing with a special focus on the water, sanitation, energy, and transport sub-sectors. Since its start of operation in Sofia in October 2005, PEP-SE Infrastructure has been appointed by the government of Serbia to serve as lead advisor in the restructuring of Serbia\u2019s national carrier, Jat Airways. It recently also signed an agreement to assist the government of Albania in the development of PPP structures in the country. 6.2.3. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency MIGA\u2019s mission is to promote foreign direct investment into developing countries. MIGA promotes foreign investment by bringing together foreign investors, host governments, and project sponsors. MIGA provides investment guarantees against certain non-commercial risks to eligible foreign investors for qualified investments in developing member countries.

All EU-27 countries are eligible for MIGA support. 6.2.4. New World bank instruments The World Bank recognized the problems that Governments in new EU countries are facing regarding the attraction of private capital for infrastructure projects. Therefore, World Bank developed a new PPP framework including new instruments in the market for financing of infrastructure. The purpose is to facilitate the realization of PPP projects in new EU countries or EU accession countries. The framework exists of four instruments: \u2022 Local Infrastructure Investment Trust (LIIT) To attract first-round private equity funds to invest in local infrastructure transactions, a new class of second-round local infrastructure investment trusts would need to be developed in order to open up exit opportunities for the first-round investors facing narrow and shallow domestic capital markets. First-round private equity funds would be the prime motor for the identification of PPP transactions and the development of the project pipeline, and are expected to exit the projects over a four- to five-year period. Subsequently, second round Local Infrastructure Investment Trusts (LIIT) would buy equity stakes from the first-round funds and would hold their stake for the long-term. LIITs could be mixed funds investing in listed securities in a particular country or in the region and in unlisted securities of local infrastructure companies purchased from the first-round funds. LIITs would be funded by selling shares and issuing bonds to domestic and international institutional investors including pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds (fund-of-funds). \u2022 Sub-sovereign breach-of-contract insurance or guarantee facilities To alleviate (sub-sovereign) political risks faced by first and second-round funds, a second instrument of the proposed PPP framework would consist of sub-sovereign breach-of- contract insurance or guarantee facilities. Depending on the policy risk profile of various categories of local authorities, such facilities could be structured without sovereign counter- guarantee (medium policy risk) or with sovereign counter guarantee (high policy risk). Access to these facilities would be governed by detailed criteria established under an accreditation system. \u2022 Output-based subsidy schemes (OBSS) As contract negotiations take place between funds and local authorities, fund managers will have a keen interest in ensuring the socioeconomic feasibility and sustainability of the required transition to cost-recovery tariff schedules. Even though the efficiency gains achieved from the PPP approach of the project by involving the first round funds, will result PE 379.207 32 ",
        "New Financial instruments for European Transport Infrastructure and Services in a downward pressure on required tariff increases over time, the prevalence of tariffs at well-below-cost levels in many countries in Europe means that the transition to the cost recovery tariffs will often require steep tariff increases up front, leading to access and affordability problems for low-income households. This problem would be alleviated through a third instrument/component of the proposed PPP framework, i.e. output-based subsidy schemes (OBSS) that would be designed to smooth the impact of the transition to cost-recovery tariffs for targeted categories of households. \u2022 Contract transparency and monitoring system (COTAM) Finally, to ensure transparency and sustainability of contracts between the first- and the second-round funds and local authorities, the proposed PPP framework would be supported by a fourth instrument, that is, a contract transparency and monitoring system (COTAM).Under such a system, a neutral third party would participate in contract negotiations between the fund the local authority. This third party would not be a signatory to the contract, but its objective would be to maximize contract transparency by bringing issues to the negotiating table based on international best practice and by eliminating issues that would otherwise be dealt with informally, such as essential contract elements that the parties might choose to ignore or abnormally low penalties for non-performance by either party. The Local Infrastructure Investment Trust (LIIT) could be supported by IFC through equity, quasi-equity and/or debt. MIGA could establish a policy risk insurance (PRI) facility covering sub-sovereign breach of contract risk. In the case of sub-sovereigns with middle policy risk. IBRD could provide a partial risk guarantee (PRG) facility to cover sub-sovereign breach of contract risk in the case of sub-sovereigns with high policy risk. The output-based subsidy (OBS) scheme could be financed through an IBRD budget loan on a declining basis. Finally, the implementation of the contract transparency and monitoring system (COTAM) could be supported through a technical assistance loan from IBRD. The feasibility of this approach still has to be tested and it would worthwhile to see if some of these instruments also can be used for TEN projects 8 . Figure 6.2.

POLICY OPTIONS The following policy options have been defined in terms of source of finance: \u2022 Continue with a mix of public and private financing: This policy implies a continuation of the existing policy whereby the funding is the come from the member states and the private sector complemented by the Commission\u2019s funds and instruments. \u2022 Shift focus to public financing: This policy implies that the funding is to come solely from member states supported by community funding. It implies further that projects are implemented by the respective Member States in a traditional manner using conventional procurement procedures and contract structures. The budgetary constraints as agreed upon in the Maastricht Treaty in terms of maximum debt requirements are reconsidered to enable acceleration of public investments. \u2022 Shift focus to private financing: This policy implies that the majority of the funding is to come from the private sector. It assumes in order to maximise the availability of private capital that the risk transfer to the private sector is minimal by structuring the projects as unitary payment based PPPs and by including to the extent necessary sovereign or community guarantees. The unitary payments imply a contingent liability for member states which is to be covered by the proceeds from road user charges or other forms of road usage related taxation (in other words, the demand risk is allocated to the respective member states and the performance and construction risk is transferred to the private sector).

The commission\u2019s policy to date in enhancing the competence level of the respective member states is based on providing technical assistance, recently structured in the Jaspers facility and the TEN-TEA and by providing guidelines (e.g. Guidelines for Successful Public Partnerships) and by developing directives (e.g. Green Book on procurement of PPPs). As these instruments have been introduced only recently their effectiveness cannot be evaluated yet.

It implies that the responsibility for preparing and implementing TEN-T is transferred to a central entity (e.g. like the Federal Highway Agency in the US) to be referred to as TEN-T PPP Task Force.

PROPOSED POLICY It is proposed to further discuss the defined policy options. However based on the pros and cons it is recommended to sincerely consider the option of focusing much more on private financing with the demand risk allocated to the public sector and whereby the country risk is mitigated through community guarantee instruments.

CONCLUSIONS The main objective of this study is to elaborate the new financial instruments for European Transport infrastructure and services and how they shall be applied and combined to achieve an optimal result. Overall it can be concluded that there is in principle no lack of private funding for TEN-T infrastructure projects. Whether or not the funding becomes available for the projects depends on the quality of the underlying project. The creation of the EIB Guarantee Facility has a positive effect on improvement of investment grade of TEN-T projects. Sub-questions are answered below: \u2022 The most promising financial instruments The realisation of the TEN-T network is highly depending on the Member States, as the EU budget and grant financing only account for only a marginal part of the total investment required. The Member States often lack the financial resources and are facing a challenge regarding financing the TEN-T network. Therefore, action is being undertaken to attract private capital. In principle, there are currently sufficient private funds waiting for good qualitative projects to invest in. However, the priority projects defined by the EC, are defined based on the principles of socio-economic benefits, whereas a project is only interesting for private financing if it is a financially feasible project. This means that the project should generate sufficient income in relation to the project risks. It is therefore a challenge to structure the priority projects in such a way that the projects are eligible for private finance in other words, to make the projects investment grade. The EC/EIB Loan Guarantee scheme addresses this challenge by backing the subordinated debt. This reduces the risk profile of the project in order to make it investment grade. This is an important improvement to attract private financing. Furthermore, the possibilities of an Unitary payment Fund could be examined. Such a fund would be available for TEN-T priority projects in the roads sector for which no toll is charged. The Availability Payment Fund could be used for projects in which the political risk is high. In case the Member State for some reason is unable to meet its financial obligations towards the private investor in terms of unitary payments, this fund would step in, in order to make sure the private operator/investor is paid for its services according to the contract. This instrument will enhance the financial feasibility of projects in New Member States. The downside of such a fund is that it does not provide incentives for the Member States to improve their own credibility as a partner in PPP. Both instruments will contribute to improve the investment grade of TEN T projects. \u2022 Which financial instruments should be preferably used to attract private capital ? The total financial package for a project in relation to its risk profile is crucial for attracting private capital. The quality of a project as such is the most important element. Guarantee instruments can be used to attract private capital. These instruments reduce the risk profile of a project and can make a project investment grade. PE317.527 39 ",
        "New financial instruments for European transport infrastructure and services \u2022 Legal, financial and economic conditions needed for successful Public-Private- Partnership (PPP) projects regarding transport infrastructure. Key success factors for successful PPP are: \u2022 Political commitment and a clear policy; \u2022 A legislative framework to enable PPP; \u2022 A competent public administration and transparent institutional framework; \u2022 Availability of both public and private capital and willingness to invest by the private sector. In view of the slow pace of PPP development in some of the new member states particularly caused by the lack of experience in the respective public administrations it is recommended to establish a central TEN PPP Task Force with the mandate to prepare and implement TEN PPP projects. \u2022 The most important obstacles for private capital to participate in TEN-T projects? The most important obstacles for attracting private capital can be listed as follows: 1. Lack of projects; 2. High transaction costs and long lead time to financial close; 3. Excessive risk transfer to private sector; 4. Inadequate project structures. \u2022 Other promising financial instruments or sources for the TEN-T which have not been discussed substantially on the EU level yet In order to address political risk, it is worth considering the option of setting up an unitary payment fund as a financial instrument that helps attract private capital specifically for unitary payment based PPPs. \u2022 Combination of financial instruments In view of the complexity and the consequent burden on the administrative capacity of member states and the risk of inadequate project structures and risk allocation it is not recommended to mix too many financial instruments. E.g. integrating structural funds with PPP although it has been done and it is certainly a key objective of many policy makers, it adds a severe risk component to the project. It is difficult enough to structure a PPP, let alone a PPP that is to be supported by a European grant. PE 379.207 40 ",

RECOMMENDATIONS \u2022 Enhance bankability of projects through guarantee schemes In order to overcome the main obstacles for mobilising private capital, it is recommended to evaluate the options for setting up an Unitary payment Fund. \u2022 Enhance implementation capacity of Member States through Technical Assistance It is very important that Member States organise their institutional and legislative framework in such a way that the investment climate in the Member States increases for private investors. It is therefore worth evaluating the possibility of expanding Jaspers services to institutional development or to implement another instrument to provide the relevant Technical Assistance. \u2022 Increase political commitment in Member States The Member States have an important role with regards to the development of the TENs. However, particularly new Member States deal with budgetary constraints and therefore lack the commitment to invest in projects that do not necessarily support their national objectives. One of the main barriers is national budgeting, which is also closely linked to political commitment to TEN-T projects in the relevant Member States. This has to be addressed and options should be studied. PE 379.207 42 ",
