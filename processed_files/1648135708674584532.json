The results allow the identification of countries and family types that face little financial incentive to increase work effort or to take up a job. Recent reforms to \u201cmake work pay\u201d and to reduce the tax burden on labour, especially for low wage earners, have contributed to lower marginal (effective) tax rates. This has diminished the risk of potential low-wage and unemployment traps at certain income levels. Yet, despite such efforts there are still fundamental trade-offs in the ability of low income support programmes to be effective in relieving poverty and to have well-targeted benefits while maintaining the necessary work incentives. We have seen that the risk of negative effects on work incentives remains particularly high in some member states. The search for a suitable solution to the \u201cchallenging triangle\u201d of welfare, - that is, designing a satisfactory income-support scheme for low-income families, whilst minimising disincentives to work and avoiding excessive budgetary cost - remains the key issue in the agenda for the reform of tax-benefit systems in many European countries.

        "- 5 - I. INTRODUCTION This paper presents the results of an ongoing joint European Commission / OECD project 1 aimed at monitoring the direct influence of tax and benefit instruments on household incomes. The project uses and extends OECD tax-benefit models to compute a range of work incentive indicators such as marginal effective tax rates on earned income. Given widespread concern about possible adverse effects of taxes and benefits on unemployment levels, it has become increasingly important to regularly assess both the financial incentives to work and the degree of protection from unemployment related poverty risks. Indicators of financial work incentives are needed to identify any undesired influences of taxes and social transfers on people\u2019s work decisions. At the same time, a central part of many recent tax and welfare reform strategies has been to reduce reliance on welfare by \u201cmaking work pay\u201d, that is, to make work an economically attractive option relative to welfare. It is therefore desirable to monitor the effects of such policies as well as the potential for further reform. It is important in this context to distinguish between \u201cincentives\u201d and \u201cincentive effects\u201d. While measuring financial work incentives is an integral part of any tax- benefit policy evaluation exercise, employment levels, unemployment rates and total hours worked are of course not determined exclusively by the size of benefits and the taxes needed to finance them. First, a lack of suitable jobs can give rise to involuntary unemployment which will persist to the extent that the legal and institutional framework prevents wage adjustment mechanisms from aligning supply and demand. Secondly, numerous non-financial considerations will play a role in the decision of whether and how many hours to work. In addition, any change in labour supply as a result of tax-benefit policy differs across population groups so that small changes in total labour supply may mask important changes for certain groups of individuals. Given these factors and the different roles they are likely to play across countries, it is perhaps not surprising that empirical results of the effects of taxes and benefits on total unemployment differ considerably across studies. 2 The evidence is somewhat clearer when one restricts the analysis to one side of the labour market. Microeconometric studies of the sensitivity of labour supply with respect to changes in net income (and, thus, taxes and benefits) generally find small elasticities for men, and frequently also for the population as a whole. Estimates of elasticities are, however, much larger for certain groups of people such as secondary earners (mainly married women) or single parents. 3 It is clear, therefore, that looking at how tax-benefit policy might influence the opportunity set of a single \u201caverage person\u201d will not generally suffice. Instead, it is desirable to analyse how taxes and 1 Within the European Commission services, the project is financed jointly by DGs ECFIN, EMPL and TAXUD and co-ordinated by EUROSTAT. 2 Influential studies include Daveri, F. and G. Tabellini, (2000) and Nickell, S., (1997). 3 An overview of earlier studies is provided by Pencavel, J., (1986). See also Atkinson, A.B. and G.V. Mogensen, (eds.), (1993); Smith, N., S. Dex, J.D.

        "- 6 - benefits affect people living in different household circumstances and with a range of different earnings levels. To obtain a fuller picture of the financial consequences of work and unemployment this paper will therefore compare the effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes for different family types and earnings levels. By comparing net incomes at different wage levels and working hours, one can use these results to show the net impact of individual labour supply decisions on disposable income. While this in itself does not tell us how changes in tax-benefit policy will actually influence labour supply or unemployment levels, it contributes to a thorough understanding of the mechanics of tax-benefit systems. This understanding of how different tax-benefit instruments interact with each other as well as with people\u2019s individual labour market situation is an essential pre-requisite for identifying tax-benefit reform priorities. Such priorities may include increasing the financial reward for work by reducing in-work taxes and/or out-of-work benefits. They may also include reducing risks of financial poverty as a result of job loss by ensuring adequacy of out-of-work benefits or extending their coverage. Given the numerous elements of tax-benefit systems and the often complex interactions between them, summary indicators should be comprehensive in scope. They should take into account all relevant tax-and transfer instruments in order to allow comparisons across countries with very different tax-benefit typologies. So- called e ffective tax rates satisfy this requirement by showing relative tax burdens resulting from the combined operation of taxes, social security contributions (SSCs) and benefit payments. Marginal effective tax rates (METRs) show what part of a change in earnings is \u201ctaxed away\u201d by the combined operation of taxes, SSCs and any withdrawal of earnings related social benefits. They are thus important policy indicators for determining how financially desirable it is for an employee to increase working hours or for an unemployed person to take up employment in the first place. Their magnitude may affect structural unemployment, labour market attachment and working hours, especially for those persons at the low end of the productivity scale whose labour market opportunities may not be sufficient to induce work given the low wages they attract. The results reported in this paper take a first step towards a more detailed look at the effects of taxes and benefits on labour market behaviour, especially of the poor. We discuss relevant concepts and limitations of these models and present results for the year 2001. Similar results for later years will become available during the course of the current project as models are updated each year. Three different types of METRs are evaluated in this paper (and are explained in more detail below). The first one looks at the effects of a small earnings increase and can thus be used to assess the financial consequences of increased working hours. This indicator is relevant for analysing, for instance, \u201clow-wage trap\u201d issues where low- paid workers may be locked into benefit receipt: they find their benefits strongly reduced if they attempt to supplement their income with additional earnings. In addition to computing METRs for a small earnings increase, one may wish to assess what part of potential in-work earnings are \u201ctaxed away\u201d for a person making a transition into work. The second type of METR can be related to the so-called \u201cunemployment trap\u201d where unemployed persons with low earnings potential and/or receiving relatively generous unemployment benefits face a situation where taking up ",
        "- 7 - employment may lead to small (or no) increase in disposable income as a result of the combined effects of benefit withdrawal and higher tax burdens on in-work earnings. A third, and similar, type of METR can be computed for out-of-work individuals not eligible to unemployment benefits (they might instead receive minimum income benefits, if applicable). The resulting marginal effective tax rate can be interpreted as describing the work incentive situation for \u201cinactive\u201d people who are not part of the labour force. However, the same METR will also be relevant for evaluating work incentives for unemployed people who are actively seeking work but who do not (or no longer) qualify for receipt of unemployment benefits. The paper is divided into five sections. In Section II the main methodological aspects of the calculation are presented, including a more detailed explanation of the different types of METRs as well as a brief discussion of the method\u2019s main limitations. Section III then provides a detailed set of results showing the three different types of METRs. Section IV highlights some of the limitations and caveats to be borne in mind when interpreting results. Finally, Section V draws together a summary of the main results of the analysis and some implications for further policy reform in this area. ",
        "- 8 - BOX 1 \u2013 \u201cUnemployment trap\u201d, \u201cinactivity trap\u201d and \u201clow-wage trap\u201d 4 The shape of the budget constraint facing low-income workers does not depend on taxation alone. Indeed, due to the presence of income-tested benefits such as in-work benefits and housing benefits as well as discontinuities in SSC schedules, low-paid workers face non-linear budget constraints with one or more \u201ckink\u201d points. As a result, marginal effective tax rates vary in a complex way that reflects the intricacies of tax and SSC rules as well as provisions of the transfer system. For example, even though statutory tax rates are low for levels of taxable income, METRs faced by low-income individuals can be very high because of the withdrawal of various benefits as well as certain provisions built into SSC systems. Targeting a particular benefit or tax advantage (allowance, deduction or tax credit) toward low income is usually done by phasing\u2013out (more or less gradually) the scheme at higher levels of income. This of course reduces its budgetary costs. Yet, at the same time, it increases METRs because in the phase-out range, any additional unit of earnings causes a reduction in the benefit/tax advantage, reducing the net gain resulting from increased earnings. 5 Depending on an individual\u2019s labour market situation, the progressivity of tax systems combined with benefit phase-outs can affect financial work incentives in several ways. The term \u201cunemployment trap\u201d is frequently used to refer to a situation where benefits paid to the unemployed and their families are high relative to potential net earnings such that work \u201cdoes not pay\u201d. While the judgement whether work \u201cpays\u201d is an individual decision that will depend on many factors, tax-benefit systems will play an important role. Unemployment benefit systems provide income security during unemployment and contribute to a more equitable income distribution. By providing income support to liquidity constrained persons during unemployment, they also contribute to a more efficient match between workers and jobs. Yet, at the same time, out-of-work benefits can discourage job search and put upward pressure on wage levels. In theoretical models of imperfect labour markets, unemployment benefits are deemed to increase the equilibrium unemployment rate. The mechanisms depend on the type of model. In the search model, for instance, higher unemployment benefits increase the reservation wage so that unemployed individuals receive fewer job offers with wage levels above the reservation wage. As a result, the outflow from unemployment is reduced. Under certain conditions, standard search theory models predict that an increase in the amount and duration of unemployment benefits leads to longer unemployment spells. 6 A second type of model explains changes in unemployment 4 The discussion in this box draws on Carone G, and A. Salomaki (2001). That paper also presents an overview of the theoretical aspects of the impact of tax-benefit systems on labour supply and demand. 5 A benefit payment is equivalent to a negative tax. As such, the income effect on work effort or working hours is negative as long as leisure is a normal good. To the extent that social transfers fall with earnings a negative substitution effect will add to the negative income effect, leading to an unambiguous decrease of work effort or working hours. 6 When unemployment benefits are paid for a limited period (or benefits decline over time), the reservation wage will tend to fall with the duration of the unemployment spell. After the expiration period, there will be a sharp fall in the reservation wage and search intensity will rise, thereby significantly increasing the probability of leaving unemployment (the so called exit rate or hazard rate ). See Atkinson and Micklewright (1991), Bover et al. (1996) and Layard et al. (1991). It is important to note the limitations of these models. As Atkinson and Micklewright (1991) point out, the representation of unemployment benefits in most standard search models is rather unrealistic. For instance, results of these models can change drastically if one takes into account that benefits depend on contribution histories, that they may not be payable at all if unemployment is judged to be voluntary and that refusals of job offers can cause benefit withdrawal. ",
        "- 9 - levels through a link with the bargaining power of trade unions and, in particular, an influence of unemployment benefits on negotiated wage levels. 7 Essentially, unions face a trade-off between wage increases and employment levels. More generous unemployment benefits make unemployment \u201cless painful\u201d and can therefore change the balance of this trade-off by increasing a union\u2019s target wage. The \u201cinactivity trap\u201d is a situation similar to the unemployment trap except that it applies to people not receiving any unemployment benefits, including those not considered part of the labour force or \u201cinactive\u201d as far as paid employment is concerned. For these individuals, a situation where employment is judged not to \u201cpay\u201d may be brought about by minimum income or other income related benefits which would be lost upon taking up paid work. 8 However, the tax system may also have an important deterrent effect, which can be particularly relevant for partners or spouses of working individuals: if their incomes are taxed jointly than any potential earnings of the currently \u201cinactive\u201d partner may be taxed at relatively high rates and may thus reduce the net gain from work. Together, benefits and taxes can effectively create a wage floor below which a transition into employment does not bring any financial gain in the short term. The \u201clow-wage trap\u201d (or \u201cpoverty trap\u201d) is related not to a transition into work but to the financial consequences of increasing working hours (or work effort) for those already in (low- paid) work. As before, the \u201ctrap\u201d refers to a situation where an increase in gross in-work earnings fails to translate into a net income increase that is felt by the individual to be a sufficient return for the additional effort (e.g., OECD, 1997). Again, both taxes and benefits can result in large parts of any additional gross earnings being effectively \u201ctaxed away\u201d. The influence of taxes will be more relevant for earners of higher wages (and low-wage earners with high-wage spouses in joint tax systems). However, due to the withdrawal of income tested benefits and the operation of SSC earnings thresholds above which contributions are sometimes payable on earnings as a whole, the part of an additional working hour that is taxed away at low earnings is often much higher than at middle and high income levels. Indeed, typical in-work benefit schemes, while reducing the likelihood of \u201cunemployment\u201d or \u201cinactivity traps\u201d, generally increase marginal tax rates at relatively low earnings levels as in-work benefit amounts are phased out. In turn, this may increase the probability of \u201clow-wage traps\u201d. In terms of their potential effect on labour-supply, these instruments therefore trade off higher participation against lower working hours. Given this trade-off it is therefore essential to monitor both the financial incentives of taking up employment as well as the incentives to change working hours for those already in work. 7 Union wage bargaining models have for instance been formalised by Blanchard and Wolfers (1999), and Layard, Nickell and Jackman (1991). 8 While minimum income or social assistance benefits will generally be lower than unemployment benefits, they can, depending on the family structure, be of a similar magnitude or even exceed unemployment benefits. In the case of earnings related unemployment benefits this is particularly likely for people with low previous wages (in several countries, low unemployment benefits may also be \u201ctopped up\u201d by social assistance payments). In addition, social assistance benefits will generally be available for longer periods than unemployment benefits and may be subject to less stringent job search requirements. ",
        "- 10 - II. METHODOLOGY 9 An indicator that can be used to measure the extent to which taxes and benefits reduce the financial gain from work is the METR (Marginal effective tax rate). These measures tell us what part of any additional earnings is taxed away through the combined effects of all relevant tax-benefit instruments. Depending on the size of the \u201cadditional earnings\u201d, the METR can be related to all three types of \u201ctrap\u201d discussed in Box 1. For unemployed people the additional earnings would simply be the total earnings they could attract when moving into work. The resulting METR quantifies to what extent the tax-benefit system contributes to an unemployment/inactivity trap in cases where the out-of-work person does/does not receive unemployment benefits (we will denote these measures METR ut and METR it respectively). 10 For those in work, the \u201cadditional earnings\u201d would be a small earnings increase and the part of that earnings change that is \u201ctaxed away\u201d would relate to the individual\u2019s decision of whether to increase or reduce work effort or working hours (this type of METR will be denoted METR lw ). Formally, we have METR = 1 \u2013 ( \u2206 y net ) / ( \u2206 y gross ) (1a) Where \u2206 y gross are the \u201cadditional earnings\u201d referred to above and \u2206 y net is the change in net income obtained after taxes and benefits so that the change in gross earnings between labour market states A and B is \u2206 y gross = y grossB \u2013 y grossA (1b) and the net earnings change is \u2206 y net = y netB \u2013 y netA = ( y grossB \u2013 t B + b B ) \u2013 ( y grossA \u2013 t A + b A ) (1c) where t denotes total taxes and b denotes total benefits. 11 It is clear therefore that, formally, all types of METR are the same with the only difference being the 9 A more detailed description of the methodology, the main assumptions and limitations of the tax- benefit model can be found in the OECD (2002a, b). Detailed country information on tax-benefit systems is available through www.oecd.org/els/social/workincentives. 10 METR ut and METR it can be seen as a \u201cparticipation tax rate\u201d, i.e., the amount of additional taxes plus lost benefits relative to gross earnings when moving into work. Elsewhere (e.g., OECD, 2002a), this has been referred to as an \u201cAverage Effective Tax Rate\u201d or AETR. However, in public finance literature an average tax rate usually refers to the ratio of tax revenues divided by tax base without any relation to a transition between different labour market states. 11 Another measure frequently used to characterise the income consequences of labour market transitions is the net replacement rate (NRR) usually defined as the ratio of net income while out of work divided by net income while in work (2001 NRRs across countries are reported in section III, Table 8. For European evidence based on household micro-data see also Immervoll, H. and C. O\u2019Donoghue (2003). If labour market state B represents \u201cin work\u201d and A represents \u201cout of work\u201d then NRR = y netA / y netB or, after combining with (1a) and rearranging, NRR = 1 \u2013 \u2206 y gross (1 \u2013 METR ut ) / y netB for a person entitled to unemployment benefits and NRR = 1 \u2013 \u2206 y gross (1 \u2013 METR it ) / ",
        "- 11 - interpretation of states A and B (unemployment and employment in the case of METR ut ; inactivity and employment in the case of METR it ; and, e.g., employment with 30 and 31 hours of work per week in the case of METR lw ). 12 We use the OECD tax/benefit model to calculate gross and net incomes for a set of different \u201chypothetical\u201d family types (described in more detail below). For each of these family types, we vary gross in-work earnings for the main earner in order to compute the above METR measures for different earnings levels. To provide a conceptually consistent way of scaling results in relation to observed earnings levels across countries we use a range of 0-200% of Average Production Worker (APW) earnings as shown in Table 1. 13 By computing taxes and benefits for each of these earnings levels, we can draw so-called \u201cbudget constraints\u201d showing resulting net income at each point along the (gross) earnings scale.

Note :Purchasing power parities (PPP) and relative price level indices for the ESA95 aggregates. Final consumption expenditure (SNA approach) (PPP are provisional values) MINIMUM WAGE When computing budget constraints, a decision needs to be made about what is assumed to drive the change in earnings. First, one can assume that hourly wages are constant while working hours change. This is necessary for calculating METRs for part-time workers. It is also more appropriate for very low wages since, as a result of (statutory or factual) minimum wages, full-time workers will normally not have earnings below a certain minimum. From Table 1 we can see that, in the majority of Member States with a statutory minimum wage, the minimum wage level is in the range of 50-60% of APW with the highest levels found in France and Greece (60 and 62% APW) and the lowest in Spain (at 33% APW). A second possibility is to assume y netB for a person not entitled to unemployment benefits. For a transition into work the term \u2206 y gross (1 \u2013 METR ) is the part of in-work earnings that are not \u201ctaxed away\u201d (and is thus equal to \u2206 y net ). 12 The formulation of METRs above considers discrete gross income changes \u2206 y gross . It is of course the case that each \u201cdiscrete METR\u201d is an average of METRs resulting from infinitesimal gross income changes within the \u2206 y gross interval. 13 Methodological details on the computation of Average Production Worker earnings amounts are provided in OECD (2002b). ",
        "- 12 - that hourly wages are changing, while working hours remain constant. This is for instance necessary for evaluating net incomes and METRs of low-wage full-time workers. We provide results under both assumptions. 14 II. 1 Model scope, income concepts and unit of analysis The budget constraint shows current net income defined as current gross earnings plus total cash benefits minus total taxes. Total taxes include \u2022 National and local income tax 15 , and \u2022 Own SSC paid by employees and benefit recipients excluding voluntary contributions made to either private or public insurance institutions, while cash benefits include \u2022 family benefits (including employment-conditional \u201cin-work\u201d benefits where they are family related), \u2022 minimum income (or social assistance) benefits generally excluding any strictly housing related parts, \u2022 housing benefits generally including any strictly housing related parts of minimum income programs, and \u2022 unemployment benefits. Disability benefits, private-, occupational- or state old-age pension payments as well as any income from capital are not considered. Benefit incomes are often taxed or subject to SSC and this is taken into account when computing net incomes for benefit recipients. 16 We are measuring current incomes and therefore do not take into account any longer- term effects of today\u2019s labour market status on future earnings, pension entitlements, (re-)qualification for unemployment insurance benefits etc. To the extent that individuals are aware of these future income implications and take them into account 14 For most countries the two approaches (fixed hours and fixed hourly wages) yield the exact same result. But for some countries, notably, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, results differ due to tax-benefit rules such as the entitlement to partial unemployment benefits for part-time workers returning to work, or minimum/maximum working hours requirements built into tax concessions or benefits (such as employment-conditional benefits). 15 Only standard tax relief is included when calculating tax payments. These are tax concessions unrelated to actual expenditures incurred by the taxpayer and are automatically available to taxpayers who satisfy relevant eligibility rules. Typical standard reliefs include the basic relief available to all taxpayers, wage earners or benefit recipients, irrespective of family status; relief available to taxpayers depending on their marital status; relief granted to families with children; and the relief for work-related expenses. See OECD (2002b) for further details. 16 A detailed descriptions of countries\u2019 tax-benefit rules can be found in OECD (2002a, b). ",
        "- 13 - when considering their labour market status, it would clearly be desirable to allow for them. Unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of our static modelling framework. However, current incomes will be the more immediate concern particularly for low- income households who frequently face liquidity constraints and who are the main focus of the present analysis. Social security contributions paid by employers are substantial in many countries. In addition, the extent to which pensions, healthcare or unemployment benefits are financed by contributions or taxes differs enormously across countries (see OECD, 2002b). It is therefore useful to consider how employers\u2019 SSC might affect our results. A first consideration is whether the insurance value or any future benefits bought by SSC should be taken into account in the calculations. As explained above, while taking into account future income streams may be desirable our static framework considers current incomes only. A second, and separate, issue concerns the incidence of SSC (see OECD, 1990, chapter 6). To the extent to which employers\u2019 SSC reduce employees\u2019 net wages they might usefully be considered a tax on employees. Similarly, any part of employees\u2019 SSC that are incident on the employer may not be considered as reducing employees\u2019 take-home pay. However, any \u201cforward\u201d or \u201cbackward\u201d shifting of SSC will take place via adjustments to contractual wages. If APW values are measured in an equilibrium situation where these adjustments have taken place then any wage adjustments will already be reflected in the average wage figures used in our calculations. Given our concern with current cash incomes (and, in particular, take-home pay in the case of employed persons) it is therefore appropriate to fully deduct employees\u2019 SSC while not deducting any parts of employers\u2019 SSC that may be incident on employees since these will already be reflected in lower APW values. 17,18 17 For instance, to the extent that employers\u2019 SSC are incident on employees through lower wages, lower employers\u2019 SSC will, other things being equal, result in higher contractual wages. What does this mean in terms of financial work incentives as measured using our net income concept? If employers\u2019 SSC are raised from zero to X and a fraction of 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1 of X is shifted to employees then average wages w will decrease by sX . Once this adjustment process is complete, the NRR for a single person earning the average wage might be B /((1- t )( w - sX )), where B is the net unemployment benefit and t is the individual\u2019s average tax rate while in work. This is of course the same NRR we would obtain if, instead of raising X through employers\u2019 SSC, employees would pay contributions of X in the case where a fraction of 1- s would be shifted to employers. It is clear, therefore, that in the framework of our modelling exercise, the above net income concept results in conceptually consistent NRR (and, of course, METR) measures regardless of whether SSC are paid by employees or employers. 18 In order to provide a more comprehensive view of the impact of the tax system, results of additional computations taking also into account the impact of employers\u2019 SSC are provided in annex B and compared to the results in the main text. When employers\u2019 SSC are considered, METRs need to be interpreted as marginal effective tax rates on labour costs. To compute these, employers\u2019 SSC will of course enter both the numerator and the denominator of equation (1a). Given that employers\u2019 SSC vary substantially between countries (see Table B1 in annex B: they are relatively high in Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Sweden, but very small in Denmark) this can of course change any METR ranking of countries. Yet, in some cases the patterns are not very different, especially at low wage levels (see Table B2-B5 in annex B). In any case, and as argued above, for considering the impact of labour market changes on people\u2019s current net income, the METR definition needs to exclude employers\u2019 SSC. ",
        "- 14 - A final definitional issue to be considered when computing net incomes and measures such as METRs and NRRs is whom to compute them for. In multi-person households income situations will depend on the earnings, taxes and benefits of a number of people. For instance, one spouse\u2019s earnings may reduce the other spouse\u2019s unemployment benefits. Similarly, one household member\u2019s income tax liability will usually depend on other household member\u2019s characteristics even for tax systems that are not explicitly \u201cjoint\u201d. In order to capture all relevant interactions we compute all income measures at the household level. It is important to note that, for the purpose of evaluating financial work incentives, this implies the assumption that work decisions are taken at the household level. II. 2 Family types The stylised family types considered throughout the analysis are: 1. Single adult persons, without children (earnings of adult 0-200% APW). 2. Single adult parents, with two children (earnings of adult 0-200% APW). 3. One-earner adult couples (earnings of first spouse 0-200% APW; 2 nd spouse inactive). 4. As in 3 but with two children. 5. Two-earner adult couple (earnings of first spouse fixed at 67% APW; 2 nd spouse earning 0-200% APW). 6. As in 5 but with two children. Adult employees are assumed to have an uninterrupted employment record of 22 years to ensure people qualify for unemployment benefits. Given this assumption, the assumed age for all adults is 40 years. In the case of families with children, the assumed ages are 4 and 6 meaning that their parents will not be entitled to maternity benefits. Similarly, child-care benefits are not considered in the present analysis (but will be in a later stage of the current project). All accommodation is assumed to be rented with rent constant at 20% of APW. Since the focus of this analysis is on labour market transitions we assume that people whose earnings are changing have just made a transition from unemployment into employment. As a result, people shown with limited working hours will often still be entitled to unemployment benefits since, in many countries, a transition from unemployment into part-time work is encouraged through the possibility of part-time unemployment benefits. The combination of these six household typologies with the wide range of earnings and the three types of labour market status (employed, unemployed, inactive) implies that tax and benefit rules applied to a considerable part of countries\u2019 actual populations are covered in the calculations. Table 2 provides a summary picture of the relevance of the chosen household types in EU Member States and Candidate Countries. ",

Yet, given the numerous dimensions that characterise real households (and will influence tax-benefit calculations) it is important not to try to extrapolate results to household types not covered here (or to the population as a whole, which would only be possible using a tax-benefit model in conjunction with representative household micro-data). 19 19 For a microdata based method to assess effective tax rates in the EU, based on EUROMOD, an EU- wide tax-benefit microsimulation model, see H. Immervoll (2002). ",
        "- 16 - III. RESULTS The change in net income from equation (1a) can be described as the sum of the change in gross earnings plus the contributions of each tax-benefit instrument to the total METR so that: METR = ( \u2206 IT + \u2206 SSC - \u2206 HB - \u2206 FB - \u2206 SA ) / \u2206 Y gross (2a) where IT , SSC , HB , FB and SA denote income tax, own social security contributions, housing benefits, family benefits and minimum income/social assistance benefits. The impact of each component on the METR can be expressed as follows (taking social assistance as an example): gross gros gross gross Y Y YSA SA SA YSA s \u2206 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u2206 = \u2206\u2206 (2b) The contribution to the METR of a particular tax-benefit instrument is determined by its percentage change following a change in gross income as well as its size relative to gross income. In the case of tax, the second term on the right-hand side is the average tax rate while the first and third term combined are the elasticity of the tax liability with respect to the tax base, which is one of the measures of tax progressivity commonly used in literature (e.g., Jacobsson, 1976). III.1 Marginal effective tax rate relating to the \u201clow-wage trap\u201d Definition: The marginal effective tax rate for an employed person ( METR lw ) is an indicator of the so-called low-wage trap (or poverty trap). It is aimed to measure the financial incentives to improve a household\u2019s income situation by increasing earnings, and it is defined as the rate at which taxes are increased and benefits reduced as a person increases his or her earnings by a small amount. To identify the possible earnings range over which different tax-benefit components can have an impact on METRs we first consider the earnings levels at which different transfers are completely phased out (Table3). The general impression is that in almost all countries, METRs on individual and household incomes in excess of 67% APW are entirely determined by income tax and SSC while benefit withdrawals tend to only play a role below 67% APW. There are few exceptions to this general pattern. As regards social assistance (upper panel of Table 3), relevant exceptions are Denmark, France, Portugal and Sweden, where transfers are still in place for single earner couples with children up to 75-80% of the APW wage level. Housing benefit entitlements (Table3, lower panel) extend up to earnings levels of almost 110% APW for some Swedish household types and to around 80-90% APW for families with children in Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland and the United Kingdom. In Belgium, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal there is no housing benefit system at all, at least not at national level. ",

In most countries universal (non-means-tested) child benefits are paid for each dependent child, so this component usually does not have any impact on METRs. A few exceptions are worth noting, however. In Italy child allowances are related to income and hours of work so that part-time workers receive less than full-time workers and high-income full-time workers receive less than low-income full-time workers. A second notable feature is that family benefits can also be received by one- earner couples without children. A particular relevance on the determination of the METRs is apparent through family-related in-work benefits which are phased-out for higher incomes. In 2001, such in-work benefits existed in the UK (Working Families\u2019 Tax Credit, WFTC) and Ireland (Family Income Supplement, FIS). 20 In both cases the 20 The UK Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC, recently replaced by Child Credit and Employment Credit) is an in-work benefit for parents working at least 16 hours per week. The WFTC is aimed at improving work incentives by increasing in-work incomes of low-wage workers relative to the net income available to recipients of unemployment benefits (see Blundell et al. , 2000).

        "- 18 - withdrawal of in-work benefits is one of the main driving forces of METR lw . In the case of the WFTC, benefit amounts were reduced by 55 pence for each \u00a31 extra income giving rise to relatively high METR lw . For recipients of these benefits, the phase-out range ends at around 100% APW (somewhat lower in the case of Ireland and somewhat above in the case of the WFTC) so that METR lw of higher earnings levels are no longer affected by the benefits withdrawals (and are therefore lower). Looking at the earnings ranges over which benefits have an influence on METR lw we can conclude that they will only be relevant for lower earnings levels (often close to the earnings of a full-time worker earning the statutory minimum wage where it exists) and will rarely be relevant beyond APW earnings levels. In the discussion that follows we will therefore focus mainly on households at the lower end of the income scale. Indeed, for a two-earner couple where one spouse earns at least 67% APW (one of the family types for which results are shown below) the financial effects of the second spouse\u2019s working hours decision will, in most countries, be determined almost exclusively by taxes and SSC. Most income-related benefits are already phased out at 67% APW and will therefore not affect the second spouse\u2019s METR lw (of course, the decision of whether to participate at all will be affected by out-of-work benefits \u2013 this will be shown in the discussion of METR ut and METR it in sections III.2 and III.3 below). III.1.1 Budget constraints To summarise the large volume of model output we show a summary of METR lw results for selected earnings levels as a first step (Table 4). Comparing results across countries one can see a substantial divergence of METRs even at similar relative earnings levels. Yet, it is very important to remember that, given the often complex shapes of budget constraints, single point estimates of METRs, for particular earnings levels are not very informative and may give a misleading picture of the overall situation if presented in isolation (Immervoll et al. , 2001). In the second step we therefore derive a fuller representation by plotting both net incomes and METR lw over the 0-200% APW range of gross earnings income for all six family types discussed above (Figures 1-6). The \u201cadditional earnings\u201d ( \u2206 y gross ) used for computing METR lw is 1% of APW. For people earning less than 50% APW we assume part-time work (at APW hourly wage level). one employment-conditional benefit is the Family Income Supplement (FIS) which pays 60% of the difference between the net family income and an earning limit (dependent on family size). A claimant must be working at least 19 hours per week (two-earner couples can combine their joint working hours for this purpose). Several other EU countries have introduced employment- conditional benefits since 2001. In the United States, an employment conditional refundable tax credit (Earned Income Tax Credit) has been in place for more than two decades and has been made successively more generous since the early 1990s.

In these charts, METR lw (thick solid black line, plotted against the right-hand axis) is depicted along with net incomes (for the household as a whole: thick upwards sloping kinked line) and gross earnings (thin upwards sloping straight line). 21 The net income plot represents the \u201cbudget constraint\u201d: it shows the opportunity set in terms of feasible combinations of net income and gross earnings (with earnings being determined by hourly wages and working hours). The vertical distance between gross and net income is the amount of net taxes. Net taxes are positive if net income is below gross income and negative if it is above. Dividing net taxes by gross income gives the effective tax burden. The point where the two lines cross represents situations where the effective tax burden is zero. We call this the break-even point. All persons with net incomes 21 For presentational convenience we have limited the METR range shown to [-120%; +120%]. ",
        "- 20 - above gross incomes receive a net transfer. For a given country and family type, higher break-even points mean larger numbers of net benefit recipients. 22 The slope of the net income plot represents the marginal effective tax rate METR lw . METR lw = 0 where the slope of the net income line is parallel to the gross income line since in this case, any change in gross income results in the same change in net income. The flatter the net income plot the larger the part of any \u201cadditional earnings\u201d that is \u201ctaxed away\u201d. Where the net income line is horizontal, an increase in gross income is taxed away entirely ( METR lw = 100%). Of course, METR lw can exceed 100% in which case the net income line will be downwards sloping (e.g., in Hungary where the entire amount of minimum income benefit is withdrawn once earnings of a single person exceed about 16% APW). Negative METR lw occur in cases where the increase in net income exceeds the amount of \u201cadditional earnings\u201d. This can, for instance, be an (intended) result of in-work benefits where workers receive a relatively large benefit when they increase earnings beyond a certain threshold (UK families with children). Another reason may be that certain types of SSC are no longer compulsory once earnings exceed a certain level (such as in the Netherlands where high-wage earners are supposed to fund their own private health insurance). 23 Looking at the METR lw plot it is apparent that there are numerous spikes and steps reflecting kinks in the budget constraint. It is important to note that a large spike in itself will not necessarily translate into a large work (dis-)incentive. The budget constraint (or what we have termed the \u201copportunity set\u201d above) is based on the assumption that people can \u201cchoose\u201d any earnings levels (or at least any of the 200 points used to draw each of the graphs in figures 1-6). Clearly, this is unrealistic if we interpret the budget constraint in terms of changing working hours. However, workers may also be able to influence their earnings through increasing the quality of their work (or \u201ceffort\u201d). Nevertheless, the \u201cadditional earnings\u201d that a typical worker would consider when deciding whether additional work \u201cpays\u201d may frequently be larger than the 1% APW interval we have chosen for computing METR lw . It is useful to note therefore that, following equation (1), alternative METR lw measures can easily be recomputed for other earnings changes using the same numerical model output presented here. 24 To understand the mechanics of existing tax-benefit systems and to capture all interactions between different tax-benefit instruments that might potentially influence people\u2019s choices it is, in the first instance, nevertheless desirable to look at the effects of small changes in earnings (such as 1% of APW) on net incomes. Spikes are most obvious at low earnings levels where several different tax and benefit instruments often interact in complex ways. At very low gross earnings levels marginal rates are usually close to 100% reflecting the withdrawal of minimum income/social assistance benefits. Where different benefits are withdrawn 22 Note that the distribution of gross incomes differs across countries. As a result, the break even point is not sufficient to make inferences about the number of benefit recipients across countries. 23 Contributions to private insurance schemes are not taken into account in our model calculations. 24 Doing this for multiples of the 1% APW interval as considered here is facilitated by the detailed numerical breakdowns of budget constraints (table A5 in annex A). This table is also available in electronic spreadsheet format ( http://europa.eu.int/comm/economy_finance/publications/economicpapers_en.htm). ",
        "- 21 - independently (e.g., social assistance and housing benefits in Luxembourg), METR lw can remain above 100% over an extended earnings range resulting in decreasing net incomes as working hours increase. At the other extreme, METR lw at low earnings levels are much lower (and driven by the marginal income tax and SSC rates) in countries where extensive minimum income safety nets do not exist (Greece, Italy). Of course this comes at the expense of high risks of poverty for those with low or zero earnings. 25 Indeed, an essential use of the \u201cbudget constraint\u201d graphs is the evaluation of the adequacy of minimum income/social assistance schemes and their role in reducing poverty risks 26 . The minimum income level guaranteed by such schemes is represented by the point at which the net income line intersects the left-hand axis. At the upper end of the earnings spectrum, changes in METR lw usually result from a combination of increasing marginal income tax rates and SSC provisions which frequently cause drops of METR lw due to upper contribution thresholds above which marginal SSC rates drop to zero (e.g., Austria, Luxembourg). A notable feature of the German income tax is that statutory marginal rates rise continuously rather than in steps. III.1.2 Decomposition by tax-benefit instrument The influence of each tax-benefit instrument can be seen more clearly from Table A1 in annex A where we show a decomposition of METR lw results in terms of individual tax-benefit components. This decomposition (see equation (2a) ) identifies the relative contribution of different tax and benefit instruments to high METR lw which is essential when thinking about the influence of individual policy measures. Without commenting on the results in great detail, it is instructive to look at the influence of the Family Benefit component in Ireland and the United Kingdom as this provides an example of the adverse impact on METR lw of benefit instruments aimed at increasing labour force participation. While Irish METR lw are close to zero for families without children up to 60-70% of APW they are far higher (about 60%) over the same income range for households with children, due to the functioning of the aforementioned Family Income Supplement (counted in the Family Benefit category in Table A1). In the United Kingdom we find a similar picture due to the gradual reduction of the Working Family Tax Credit. Yet, the marginal deduction rate is lower than in Ireland. At the same time, these programmes increase the incomes of low- wage employees and thus provide both income support for the \u201cworking poor\u201d and an incentive to seek employment. These latter effects will be reflected in the METR ut and METR it measures discussed in sections III.2 and III.3 below. 25 Several countries are, however, successful at combining means-tested minimum income safety nets with retaining a degree of work incentives for benefit recipients by exempting a part of in-work earnings from means-testing. 26 Immervoll et al. (2001) use this method to analyse and compare the effects of the tax-benefit system on low-income households in the Benelux countries. ",
        "- 22 - BOX 2 \u2013 Major differences across household types in Member States As calculated METR lw may be quite sensitive to the household characteristics, it is useful to pinpoint possible striking divergences among different households types across countries. Comparing results across family types in Figure 1-6 it is apparent that in Denmark the METR lw for single persons (with or without children) is only half as much as the high rate (close or even higher than 100%- a clear poverty trap) faced by couples (with or without children) with earnings over the range of 50-80% of the APW wage level. In France , the METR lw for single workers over the range 50-65% of APW earnings is only 27% while it is close to 90% for a couple with children (up to 75% of APW earnings) because of the withdrawal of relatively more generous housing benefits. In Ireland , the presence of children makes the METR lw for single parents and one-earner couples with children close to 60% over an income range of 40-90 % of APW earnings, while it is only 20% for single people without children. Low-income one-earner households, without children, face METR lw as high as 100% over the income range up to the 55 % of APW earnings. In Luxembourg , the METR lw is higher than 100% until a gross wage of 43% of APW earnings for all the 6 family types considered in the analysis. After that level of earnings, it drops to about 30% for single workers and to 13% for single parents (after 50% of APW earnings). Yet, for a one-earner couple with children it remains higher than 100% until earnings reach 60% of APW earnings, a clear case of poverty trap. In Austria , the pattern of the METR lw across family types and income levels is very similar to the one in Luxembourg. Indeed, the METR lw is 100% for all family types until 40% of APW earnings. Then it drops substantially (to 18%) only for singles and lone parents. For one- earner couples the rates remain at 100% until an income level of 50% of APW earnings is reached, while for one-earner couples with children the METR lw remains at 100% up to an income level of 60% of APW earnings. In Finland , risk of poverty trap is a concern for one-earner couples with two children, who face a METR lw of 100% over a wide range of income (up to 65% of APW earnings), due to the withdrawal of housing benefit and social assistance. On the other hand, METR lw for single workers and for single parents are generally lower (but for single parents are high at between 40-80% of APW). A similar situation is found in Sweden , where the METR lw are at 100% for couples (with and without children, because in Sweden, as in Finland, child benefits are not means-tested) until their gross earnings are close to 65-70% of the APW wage level. In both countries, these results are generated by the combined effect of high tax rates and withdrawal rates of social assistance and housing benefits as earned income increases. For the United Kingdom , the phase\u2013out of in-work benefits gives rise to high METR lw for single parents and households with children up to high levels of earnings (a rate close to around 90%).

        "- 35 - III.2 Marginal effective tax rate relating to the \u201cunemployment trap\u201d The above analysis has focussed on measuring to what extent any incremental change in gross earnings feeds through to net income levels for people already in employment. The unemployment and inactivity traps, on the other hand, are related to the net income effects of transitions between employment and non-employment and, in particular, how the relative gain from employment is affected by tax and transfer policies. While the formal representation of the relevant marginal tax rate indicators is equivalent to the METR lw discussed in the previous section, their interpretation for policy purposes is different. Indeed, and as we have argued above, policies aimed at making work pay often face a trade-off between providing incentives at the \u201cextensive\u201d and \u201cintensive\u201d margin of labour supply: policies that improve the incentive situation in terms of participation may create financial disincentives for those already in work. Definition: The marginal effective tax rate for an unemployed person ( METR ut ) is an indicator of the so-called unemployment trap. It aims to measure the short-term financial incentives to move from unemployment (where unemployment benefits are received) into paid employment and is defined as the rate at which taxes increase and benefits (mainly unemployment benefits) decrease as a person takes up a given job. The METR ut thus measures what part of in-work earnings is effectively \u201ctaxed away\u201d when moving into work. When measuring the financial consequences of moving into work a critical question is, of course, what hourly wage the job pays and how many hours the person works. In our calculations we assume a transition into a full-time job. For computing unemployment benefits in the unemployed situation the characteristics of the previous job are also relevant. We assume that the previous job was also full- time with earnings in the previous job amounting to 67% APW (Table 6) and 100% APW (Table 7). In countries with earnings-related unemployment benefits this will obviously have an impact on the level of out-of-work income ( y netA and y grossA in equations 1a and 1b). 27 For low income families, any topping up of incomes with means-tested benefits (such as social assistance where available) is taken into account in both the in-work and out-of-work situation (i.e., it is assumed that people in fact apply for the benefits they are entitled to and that they do not have assets or other characteristics that disqualify them from benefit receipt). Since re-entry wages for unemployed persons may be different from wages received in the previous job, we consider a range of different scenarios in Tables 6 and 7. 28 In annex A (Figures A1-A6) we also present METR ut (and METR it ) results for a continuous range of re-entry wage levels from 50% to 200% of APW. Similar to 27 The benefit level is generally related to previous earnings but may also be influenced by other factors such as employment record, age and family situation, and is usually subject to floor and ceilings. Depending on the level of in-work earnings any non-earnings related elements of benefit payments (such as floor or ceilings) can give rise to very high or very low out-of-work incomes relative to in- work incomes. 28 The literature on the \u201ccost\u201d of job loss refers to the interaction of several mechanisms, such as the erosion of human capital skills or considerations of social stigma, that lead to deteriorating wage prospects following a period of unemployment (See Kletzer (1998)). On the other hand, prospective wages may have improved due to training measures, for example. ",
        "- 36 - section III.1 we have decomposed the METR ut measures in terms of the tax-benefit instruments that drive them (Table A2\u2013A3 in the annex). All simulations look at the level of unemployment benefits during the second month of unemployment (i.e., after expiration of any waiting periods) and, as explained in section II, assume an uninterrupted work history of 22 years. In interpreting the figures on the risk of unemployment trap one should consider that for those entitled, the duration of the unemployment benefit is often limited and is also conditional upon other eligibility criteria (Table 5). In particular, job search requirements and their enforcement can differ considerably across countries and this will need to be borne in mind especially when comparing computed METR ut measures across countries. Furthermore, in some countries, unemployment benefits are reduced during the period of unemployment. 29 Thus, in these cases the METR ut faced by an unemployed person would decline over time. Clearly, the computed unemployment benefits will therefore often represent an \u201cupper bound\u201d while unemployment benefits (and thus METR ut ) may be lower for those with shorter work histories or longer unemployment spells. To obtain a measure of the importance of the modelling assumptions as well as the relevant range of possible values, the section on \u201cinactivity traps\u201d below (see section III.3) considers a situation where people are not entitled to unemployment benefits at all (or where unemployment benefits have expired). 29 For instance, the payment rate in Belgium decreases over time from 60% to 43% for a single person. For couples with children, when need is proven, the payment rate can continue at 60% for a prolonged period. In the Czech Republic, France, the Slovak Republic and Spain payment rates decrease over time for all family situations. In France the decrease of UI benefits is graduated and depends on the duration of contribution and the age of the claimants. The maximum duration of benefit payments is either fixed or depends on the employment record ( Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain) or age (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden). See EC-MISSOC 2002 and OECD (2002a) for details. ",
        "- 37 - 1) The duration of unemployment insurance may vary according to the duration of the employment record (contribution period), the age and the family situation of the beneficiary. 2) Expressed in terms of months that the unemployed person must have been employed and contributing to the insurance scheme (the first figure) within the investigated period of time (the latter figure) Looking at the third column in Table 6 (see also panel 3 in table A2.1 in the annex) we can see that for an unemployed person (single without children) previously employed at a low wage level of 67% of APW and taking up a new job at the same wage level as before unemployment, the METR ut is close to 90% in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden. In other words, the short-term net financial reward for taking up a job is only 10% of gross earnings. In most of these countries, this high METR ut is due to the loss of relatively generous unemployment benefits. In Belgium, part of the high METR is also due to a relatively large increase in taxes when taking up a job (21% of gross earnings). Obviously, undertaking a job paying a wage lower (higher) than the wage before unemployment implies higher (lower) METR ut . Take the case of returning to work with a re-entry wage equivalent to 50% of APW earnings 30 (Table 6, first column in each panel). A single person with a pre-unemployment wage of 67% of APW earnings may see his/her disposable income fall to a level lower than in the case where he/she remains unemployed. This unemployment trap is revealed by a METR ut 30 According to Table 1, half of the average production worker wage level is close to the statutory minimum wage in several Member States .

        "- 38 - even higher than 100% in as many as nine Member States (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Portugal, and Sweden). Of course this is only true for as long as the person remains entitled to unemployment benefits. If benefits are withdrawn completely as a result of the unemployed person\u2019s refusal to accept the lower paid job then the alternative to low-paid work is no income at all or social assistance benefits, and therefore the METR ut may in fact be in fact much lower. It is interesting to note (panel 1 and 2 in Tables A2.2, A2.3 and A2.4 in the annex) that for very low-income (up to 50% of APW) single parent and one-earner households, the income support provided by social assistance programmes in some member states (Denmark, France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Sweden) while in work makes METRs lower than they would otherwise have been. Indeed, transfers from social assistance schemes reduce the negative impact on net incomes from the complete withdrawal of the unemployment benefits transfers when moving into work. While social assistance may in some countries also be received as a top-up to low unemployment benefits, employment-conditional benefits (or tax credits) are, of course, only available while in work (in Tables A1-A3 in the annex tax credits are shown as part of income tax component -IT - while family-related in-work benefits and tax credits are included in component FB). These in-work benefit schemes are designed to significantly raise in-work income for low-wage families above out-of- work income levels. As discussed in section III.1, the resulting reduction in METR ut is the intended positive effect on participation incentives which needs to be traded off against an increase of METR lw as a result of phasing out in-work benefits at higher income levels. The METR ut faced by a single unemployed person with a pre-unemployment wage of 100% APW is broadly similar for low re-entry wages (Table 7). Yet, when taking up a new job at the same wage level as before, unemployment METR ut are generally lower than those faced by low-wage workers (compare columns 2-3 in Table 6 and Table 7). It is also interesting to note the differences across family types. The risk of an unemployment trap is usually higher for a one-earner couple with two children than for a single person. To conclude this section it is worth recalling that an alternative but related indicator of the unemployment trap is the net replacement rate (NRR). The NRR is the ratio of net income when out of work divided by net income when in work. This indicator is conceptually and numerically different from the METR ut (see footnote 11) which indicates the part of gross earnings that is \u201ctaxed away\u201d when taking up a job. To complement the information provided by the METR ut measures, we have computed a range of NRRs for the hypothetical family types at low and average wage levels (Table 8). These NRRs are computed for a transition from full-time jobs paying wages between 50% and 150% of APW to unemployment (as before, with the unemployment benefit being computed for the second month of unemployment; all other definitions are also similar to the ones used for computing the METR measures).

        "- 42 - III. 3 Marginal effective tax rates relating to the \u201cinactivity trap\u201d To conclude, we examine the financial disincentives to move from a labour market condition of inactivity or long-term unemployment (that is, individuals looking for a job but not or no longer entitled to unemployment benefits). 31 This means that we are considering as a starting point for the calculation of the METR it a hypothetical individual living in a household where the only source of net out-of-work income is provided through benefits other than unemployment benefits or through the earnings of a spouse. This is a relevant situation for low-income families where one or both of the spouses have never worked or are otherwise excluded from receiving unemployment benefits. Definition: The marginal effective tax rate for an \u201cinactive\u201d person ( METR it ) is an indicator of the so-called inactivity trap. It aims to measure the short-term financial incentives to move from inactivity, unpaid work or unemployment where no unemployment benefits are received, into paid employment and is defined as the rate at which taxes increase and benefits (mainly minimum income or social assistance benefits) decrease as a person takes up a given job. Except for the receipt of unemployment benefits, all other modelling assumptions are the same as in section III.2 above. Table 9 reports estimates of METR it faced by \u201cinactive\u201d persons deciding to take up employment. As in the previous section we have calculated METR it for a move to work at different gross wage levels. Decomposition of the METR it in terms of underlying tax-benefit instruments is reported in Table A4 in annex A. As with the METR ut results in the previous section, figures A1-A6 in the annex A show METR it over a broad range of re-entry wages (50- 200% of APW). We start by looking at the results for taking up employment with very low earnings of 33% of the APW wage level corresponding, in most cases, to a low wage part-time job. Table 9 clearly show that all one-earner household types considered in our analysis face a high risk of an inactivity trap in at least eight member states. In fact, METRs are close to or higher than 90-100% in the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland (but not for single parents with children), Netherlands, Austria, Finland, and Sweden. In the short-term there is no, or only very little, gain for recipients of means-tested benefits who take up employment. This is mainly due to the withdrawal of transfers from social assistance schemes, but in some countries (Denmark, Germany, France, Austria, Sweden, United Kingdom) the withdrawal of housing benefit also contributes to high METR it . 31 After the exhaustion of unemployment insurance, jobless persons often continue to receive unemployment assistance (e.g., Austria, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden).

This is a result of the recognition that larger families require more resources. As a result, means-tested benefits are often substantially larger than for single persons. This implies that the range of benefit withdrawal will extend further up the earnings scale. For one-earner couples with two children we therefore see that in seven member states, taking up a job with a wage close to 50% of APW earnings results in about the same net income as remaining with no work at all (Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden). There is therefore a relatively high risk that social assistance recipients might remain trapped in long-term benefit ",
        "- 44 - dependence. The potential disincentive to take up a job remains strong up to wage levels of 67% of APW in most of the aforementioned EU Member States. In Finland and Sweden, a relatively high marginal income tax rate (above 25%, considering both personal income tax and social security contributions), combines with the withdrawal of means-tested benefits to generate a METR it of 100%. A move from inactivity to work at the average wage level (100% of APW) of one spouse can still be problematic (or financially unrewarding, given METR it higher than 80%) for jobless households with children in Austria, The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden. To recoup a greater part of lost subsidies, a job paying more than the average wage is required. In the first three of these countries, 50% or more of the high METR it is due to the withdrawal of social assistance while in Sweden we can see that the withdrawal of the social assistance benefit and the housing benefit has roughly the same influence as income taxes (see Table A4.4 in the annex A). The METR it for our hypothetical household with 2 earners (\u2018with or without children) shows the financial incentive for the second spouse to move from inactivity to work (in our calculation the first earner is assumed to be always employed at 67% of the APW wage level). The METR it when the second earner in a family with 2 children decides to take up a job (see last panel in table 9) is relatively high in Denmark, Germany and Portugal. While in Portugal this is mainly due to the withdrawal of social assistance, in Germany it is mainly the result of the joint taxation of family income. As mentioned in Box 1, high participation disincentives generated by the tax-benefit system have been found to be more likely to have an impact on labour market behaviour when they concern certain groups of persons, one being lone parents. Lone parent social assistance recipients often face METR it that are higher than for other household types. At the same time, the direct benefit of staying home to engage in unpaid childcare or housework will frequently be larger than in households where there are no children or where responsibilities can be shared. It is interesting to note to what extent recent policy effort to overcome inactivity trap for these persons in some countries has succeeded in designing appropriate measures. For example, in the UK, METR it for lone parents receiving social assistance are usually lower than for other family types. A lone parent taking up a minimum wage job (50% of APW earnings) will see 45% of his/her earnings \u201ctaxed away\u201d while for singles, one-earner couples without children, and one-earner couples with children, METR it are 78%, 84% and 66%, respectively. ",
        "- 45 - IV. DISCUSSION The scope of the modelling approach taken in this paper has been discussed in some detail in the preceding sections. We have also highlighted some of the limitations and caveats to be borne in mind when interpreting results and, particularly, when comparing them across countries. In this section we briefly re-iterate these issues and discuss how some of them are addressed in parallel work undertaken jointly by the European Commission and OECD. The results presented in this paper can be characterised in terms of the following features: 1. as tax-benefit indicators they describe features of tax-benefit systems as they apply to individuals in specific situations (rather than the country population as a whole), thus they can be considered as policy indicators; 2. as work incentive indicators they relate to the financial trade-off applying to individuals\u2019 participation and working time/effort decisions (rather than the behavioural response of individuals facing these trade-offs); 3. as income indicators , they focus on household disposable income (rather than labour costs), current income (rather than longer-term or life-time income), and cash incomes (rather than broader income concepts including benefits in kind, etc.). Indicators such as the METRs and NRRs presented here provide point estimates for one particular set of circumstances which makes it essential that the sensitivity analyses be undertaken with respect to the assumptions underlying the calculations. Evaluating taxes and benefits for a wide range of earnings and household types goes some way towards such an assessment. However, while having results for different scenarios is a starting point, we would ideally want to know how important each of the scenarios is in a particular country in order to have a basis for choosing between them. This is particularly important if indicators are to be compared across countries. Some of the relevant issues have been anticipated and are currently being investigated. These include the question of how relevant different types of social benefits are when considering individual household circumstances: how likely is it that individuals actually receive the social benefits to which they are legally entitled? One specific facet of this issue concerns the receipt of different types of social benefits at the same time. For instance, unemployed individuals in low-income families may receive unemployment benefits and, at the same time, a low overall family income may make the family as a whole eligible for social assistance or minimum income benefits. While in some countries, the concurrent receipt of these two types of benefits is not legally possible, the situation is less clear in others and the most appropriate modelling assumption will therefore depend on how many cases of concurrent benefit receipt there are in practice. Clearly, the decision whether to include minimum income schemes in the calculation can have a considerable impact on relevant indicators. This is particularly the case for countries operating relatively generous minimum income schemes. In the present paper, we have presented all indicators under the assumption that the unemployed ",
        "- 46 - person receives unemployment insurance benefits and, where legally possible, also minimum income benefits. However, all indicators have been computed under both assumptions (receiving and not receiving social assistance) and the \u201cno Social Assistance\u201d results are available on request. Another issue that arises when comparing net household incomes across countries is the conceptual scope of the net income definition (as discussed in section II). Social transfers can take the form of direct cash payments to recipients. Alternatively, they can be delivered indirectly by intervening in the markets of goods and services likely to be consumed by intended recipients. Subsidised housing or childcare services are prime examples of the latter approach. In a similar way, taxes may directly reduce people\u2019s current incomes (income taxes or employees\u2019 social insurance contributions). But they may also alter the price structure in relevant markets affecting wages (taxes on employers including employer\u2019s social insurance contributions: see footnote 17) and the prices of goods and services (indirect taxes). Tax/benefit models are primarily designed to capture the direct effects on current cash incomes. As such, they do not normally consider: \u2022 benefits in-kind; \u2022 the value of deferred benefits bought by current contributions to social insurance or compulsory private insurance schemes; \u2022 differences of consumption possibilities due to indirect taxes; \u2022 the effects on gross wages resulting from the imposition of taxes levied on the employer. This focus is useful since direct cash payments made to households are of considerable interest. In comparing results across countries and over time it is nevertheless important to keep in mind differences in the extent to which direct payments capture the functioning of taxes and benefits. While tax/benefit models based on typical households cannot fully capture these differences, it is possible to complement the main output of these models (current cash household income and its components) in order to illustrate limitations of a strict focus on this income concept. In the framework of the present EC-OECD project, work is currently being undertaken in four areas. First, insurance contributions paid by employers are now computed alongside current cash household incomes. Whilst these are not directly included in (most) of the indicators produced, they do provide important contextual background. Secondly, a detailed review of available evidence on benefit take-up analyses the extent and determinants of non-benefit take-up across countries. Thirdly, a study of coverage rates using both survey data and administrative sources aims to improve our understanding of who the benefit recipients are and how the combination of different benefits contributes to incomes of different types of household. Finally, efforts are underway to be able to compare household incomes after childcare costs have been deducted and respective subsidies taken into account. This is particularly relevant since childcare costs can use up a considerable part of family budgets and can therefore have important implications for parents\u2019 labour supply decisions. Since childcare is one area where institutional arrangements vary greatly across countries, it ",
        "- 47 - is not sufficient to only take into account childcare benefits paid directly to parents since subsidies to childcare institutions can have equally important effects on family budgets. To capture these factors, information on childcare costs has been collected and is currently being reviewed. A subsequent analysis of the implications for families\u2019 budgets of countries\u2019 childcare arrangements will build on this. V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This note has presented a cross-country comparison of 3 indicators of so-called unemployment, inactivity and low-wage traps for a set of hypothetical family types. Technically speaking, these are marginal effective tax rates (METRs) and constitute the main empirical results of the joint European Commission-OECD project allowing comparable tax-benefit calculation to be performed within a consistent conceptual framework. These indicators provide a useful picture of the financial (dis)incentive to take up a job (unemployment/inactivity trap) or increasing working time or work efforts (low- wage trap) when potential earnings are low. Results have been presented for all current EU Member States along with a range of Candidate and non-EU countries. By taking into account the interactions between various components of each country\u2019s tax-benefit system, the calculations presented in this note provide a detailed picture of the mechanics of tax-benefit systems. The plots of net incomes for different earnings levels (budget constraints) allow us to address issues of work incentives and benefit adequacy in a single framework. The resulting METRs vary greatly across individual circumstances and family structures. Moreover, certain benefits (e.g. housing benefits and family benefits) are often available to certain groups of unemployed or low-income households. Figures presented here show the extent to which features of the tax system and the possibility of receiving means-tested benefits can produce METRs that can be much higher at the bottom than the top end of the earnings distribution. This implies that low-skilled individuals are more likely to confront unemployment, inactivity or low-wage traps. The analysis of available figures shows that, as a result of the interaction of tax and benefit provisions, there is a risk of a low-wage trap for employed persons in several Member States, especially in those where means-testing has traditionally played an important role in the benefit system. We have also seen that the risk is the highest for households whose overall gross earning is close to the minimum wage and, in most case, not higher than 60-70% of APW earnings. For persons entitled to unemployment benefit, we have seen that the risk of an unemployment trap is particularly high when, as a result of depreciation of past skills of an unemployed person, potential re-entry wages are lower than those before unemployment. When re-entry wages are lower than earnings before unemployment, individuals in Member States may find there is little, if any, immediate financial incentive to return to work. Any related work disincentives are also more likely to be relevant for the low-skilled because their unemployment spells tend to be longer and more frequent than for highly skilled workers. It is important to note that the work incentive indicators presented in this paper are based on the assumption that the unemployed person actually has a choice. Strictly enforced job search requirements ",
        "- 48 - can go some way towards reducing the possibility of job refusals. Also, while an important influence especially for low-income households, the immediate financial gain is likely not to be the only consideration when deciding whether to return to work. Nevertheless, unemployment traps are a distinct possibility which, along with benefit adequacy, needs to be taken into account when discussing benefit reforms. As one would expect, the likelihood of an inactivity trap for people receiving means- tested benefits is also highest for low-skilled workers with low earnings potential - possibly leading to continued benefit dependency and progressive marginalisation in the labour market. To some extent, this is more worrying than the possibility of an unemployment trap. The duration of unemployment insurance benefits is usually limited and benefits are more likely to be subject to stringent job search conditions. While the institutional diversity is considerable, these features restricting benefit recipiency apply to a lesser extent to means-tested benefits of \u201clast resort\u201d. At the same time, concerns over poverty levels make re-designing these benefit schemes more difficult. Job-search requirements and other conditions need to be more finely tuned than in the case of unemployment benefit recipients who have already, and recently, demonstrated their ability to work. Careful analysis of budget constraints can, however, help to reduce any existing negative impact on work incentives. Earnings disregard allows benefit recipients to maintain some work attachment, while in-work benefits can increase the attractiveness of taking up employment. In the case of non-working spouses, potential inactivity traps can be addressed by reducing the degree to which taxes paid by the working (or unemployed) spouse would be affected if the non-working spouse were to take up employment. Finally, integrating and co- ordinating the functioning of different parts of the tax-benefit system can prevent situations where taxes in combination with the withdrawal of a number of benefits generate METRs close to or in excess of 100%. The results presented in this note allow us to identify countries and family types that face hardly any financial incentive to increase work efforts or to take up a job. Recent reforms to \u201cmake work pay\u201d and to reduce the tax burden on labour, especially for low wage earners, have contributed to lower marginal (effective) tax rates on transfer recipients. This has diminished the risk of potential poverty and unemployment traps at certain income levels. Yet, despite such efforts there are still fundamental trade-offs in the ability of low income support programmes to be effective in relieving poverty and to have well-targeted benefits while maintaining desirable work incentives. We have seen that the risk of negative effects on work incentives remains particularly high in some member states. Mostly concerned are countries where income support and social policy measures are significant and where means-testing of benefits is substantial. On the other hand, the recourse to strict targeting through means-testing is almost inevitable if unsustainable budgetary costs are to be avoided. The search for a suitable solution to the \u201cchallenging triangle\u201d of welfare, that is designing a satisfactory income-support scheme for low-income families, while minimising disincentives to work and avoiding excessive budgetary cost, remains the key issue in the agenda of the reform of tax-benefit systems in many European countries. A continued monitoring of the mechanics of tax-benefit systems can serve as a valuable input into this process. ",
