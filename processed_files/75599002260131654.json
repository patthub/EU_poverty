        "4 Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Foreword \u2018You cannot manage what you don\u2019t measure\u2019, which is why I attach a lot of importance to this report. We must monitor the progress that Europe makes on sustainable develop- ment in an integrated way. We are, after all, pursuing economic growth as well as protect- ing our natural capital and promoting social justice. Measuring all these elements helps us to define, adapt and improve our policies. The findings of the 2015 report show success and give us reasons for optimism in some areas, but also illustrate that much more needs to be done. As First Vice-President with the overall responsibility for sustainable development within the Commission, I am strongly committed to working towards a more sustainable Union. At the global level, 2015 is a defining year for sustainable development. The September UN Summit will adopt an ambitious set of global Sustainable Development Goals. The European Union must continue to lead the way in implementing these pledges. Sustainable development has long been at the heart of the European project. It is anchored in our Treaties and in our policies. Our long-term policy agenda must bring about a systemic change in which economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection go hand in hand and are mutually reinforc- ing. This vision will define our social agenda and growth strategy, our energy and climate goals, our environmental ambitions and our research and innovation programmes. We will make sure that each of them balances social, economic and environmental considerations and contributes to a good standard of life for all Europeans, within the limits of our planet. New developments in Europe and at international level are likely to influence the future ver- sions of this report. The global Sustainable Development Goals will help to shape the agenda ahead, and how we measure and report on progress. This is a unifying global project: we all live on the same planet, we all breathe the same air and we all cherish our children\u2019s future.

        "5 Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Foreword The year 2015 marks an important mile- stone in the progress towards sustainable development, with the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets by the United Nations Summit of 25\u201327 September 2015. Following up on the Millennium Development Goals, the SDGs constitute a new global agenda for development up to 2030, striving to rec- oncile the objectives of economic progress while safeguarding the natural environ- ment and promoting social justice. Sustainable development has long been on the political agenda of the European Union. The EU sustainable development strategy (EU SDS) brings together the many strands of eco- nomic, social and environmental policy under one overarching objective \u2014 to continually improve the quality of life and well-being for present and future generations. The Eurostat monitoring report, based on the EU set of sustainable development indicators and published every two years, provides an objective, statistical picture of progress towards the goals and objectives of the EU SDS. In the rather busy time we live in, there is an increasing need for presenting complex infor- mation in a concise way. The \u2018lite\u2019 version of the 2015 monitoring report therefore makes use of the universal language of visuals, offering a shortcut to the essence of the messages delivered through the full version of the monitoring report. I hope that this publication provides you with a useful snapshot of the key trends related to the sustainable development in the European Union. For a more comprehensive picture, I invite you to read the complete 2015 edition of the monitoring report ( 1 ) available on the Eurostat website.

        "10 Executive summary Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Executive summary Sustainable development policy aims to achieve a continuous improvement in citizens\u2019 quality of life and well-being. This involves the pursuit of economic progress while safeguarding the natural environment and promoting social justice. The economic, environmental and social dimensions are all part of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS) adopted in 2001 and renewed in 2006 ( 1 ). The EU SDS also includes an institutional and a global dimension, involving the adoption of good governance practices in the EU and the promotion of a global partnership for worldwide sustain- able development. In view of these five dimensions, the EU SDS defines objectives and targets aimed at putting the EU on a path to sustainable development. This moni- toring report provides a quantitative assessment of whether the EU is moving in the right direction. Progress towards the EU SDS objectives is evaluated using a set of sustainable devel- opment indicators (SDIs) grouped into ten thematic areas. More than 100 indica- tors structured around the ten themes are presented in this report. Each theme has a headline indicator that shows whether the EU has made overall progress towards EU SDS objectives and targets. One development that may affect future versions of this monitoring report will be the adoption of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by UN Member States in September 2015. These goals will shape the global agenda for sustainable development for the coming decades. This monitoring report evaluates progress over two periods: the long term, account- ing for progress since the year 2000; and the short term, looking at the trends over the past five years. This summary focuses on the long-term trends of the headline indicators. Some short-term trends are also analysed in cases where they deviate substantially from the respective long-term trends. Is the EU moving towards sustainable development? As illustrated in Table A.1, the overall picture is rather mixed across indicators and over time for the ten thematic areas covered by the EU SDI set. Progress towards sustainable development is summarised below, organised by the five dimensions of the EU SDS. Economic development: real GDP per capita and resource productivity in the EU have improved over the long term In terms of the economic dimension of sustainable development, the headline indicators depict an overall favourable picture for the EU. Moderately favourable changes have been observed in real GDP per capita , the headline indicator of the \u2018socioeconomic development\u2019 theme. The indicator increased by more than 13 % between 2000 and 2014.

        "12 Executive summary Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages crisis, but was interrupted in 2008 as the financial market turmoil spilled over into the real economy. Following a modest recovery in 2010 and 2011 and another, less pronounced contraction in 2012 and 2013, real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita grew again in 2014. The headline indicator of the \u2018sustainable consumption and production\u2019 theme has developed even more favourably in the long term. Resource productivity (the ratio between GDP and the total amount of materials directly used to produce it) has improved substantially since 2002 thanks to an overall reduction in material consumption and an increase in GDP. This means the EU has been able to gener- ate higher economic value for each unit of material used. However, the most pro- nounced reduction in material consumption occurred at the height of the economic crisis, between 2008 and 2009. During this period, the drop in material consump- tion outstripped the fall in GDP. Therefore, it is possible that the observed improve- ment in resource productivity does not represent a major turnaround in resource use patterns, but is rather a result of the recent economic slump and its negative effect on resource-intensive industries, such as construction. Social development: improvements in public health and demographic change are evident, but poverty increased sharply since the start of the economic crisis Progress towards the social dimension of sustainable development has been une- ven. Indicators that are strongly linked to economic activity have moved in a clearly unfavourable direction since the start of the economic crisis. This is particularly true in the area of \u2018social inclusion\u2019. In other areas, however, some progress is evident. The headline indicators of the \u2018demographic change\u2019 and \u2018public health\u2019 themes reveal a favourable picture. The headline indicator of the \u2018social inclusion\u2019 theme has developed in a moderately unfavourable way over the long-term period. Between 2005 and 2013, 2.7 million people were lifted out of the risk of poverty or social exclusion , but this was not enough to keep the EU on track towards the Europe 2020 poverty reduction target. The number of people affected by one or more forms of poverty increased sharply with the start of the economic crisis in late 2008, which offset some progress in the previous years. It peaked at 123 million people in 2012 before falling slightly in 2013. Almost one in four people in the EU were at risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2013. As a result, the indicator\u2019s short-term trend has been clearly unfavourable. The EU has progressed in a more favourable direction for other social objectives. The employment rate of older workers , the headline indicator of the \u2018demographic changes\u2019 theme, has increased continuously since 2002. In 2013, the EU finally met its 50 % employment target for older workers, which was originally set for 2010. Although the trend has been positive for both men and women, the increase in the employment rate of older men slowed down in recent years. This has led to a narrowing of the gender employment gap among older workers. Compared with ",
        "13 Executive summary Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages prime-aged and younger workers, older people enjoyed more secure job positions during the economic crisis. Life expectancy increased moderately in the long run, reflecting some positive developments in the \u2018public health\u2019 theme. A girl born in the EU in 2013 can expect to live on average 83.3 years and a boy 77.8 years. This constitutes an increase of 1.8 years for females and 2.6 years for males since 2004. Despite these longer life spans, the time men and women can expect to live in good health has not increased. There- fore, people on average are not expected to spend all the years of life gained in good health, but will have to live with some kind of disability or disease. Environmental development: weak economic activity in the short term has reduced some pressure on the environment, but overall progress is mixed Regarding the environmental dimension of sustainable development, the headline indicators show mixed results. Environmental indicators linked to economic perfor- mance have developed favourably in the short term, but this is mainly due to reduced economic activity. This is evident in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. However, some setbacks can be expected with the recent eco- nomic recovery. Despite some mildly positive long-term developments, the pressure on natural resources has increased in the short term. Clearly favourable developments have been observed for one of the two headline indicators of the \u2018climate change and energy\u2019 theme. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emis- sions have steadily decreased in the long run. If this trend continues, the EU is likely to surpass its Europe 2020 target of reducing emissions by 20 % compared with 1990 levels. In 2012, the EU was only two percentage points away from its target. This favourable trend has been largely driven by a transformation of the energy sector, in particular by gains in energy efficiency and a switch from oil and coal to natural gas and renewable sources. However, the recent economic downturn and the associ- ated decline in production and energy use have also contributed to this trend. The economic recovery could therefore increase GHG emissions in the coming years. Primary energy consumption , the second headline indicator of the \u2018climate change and energy\u2019 theme, has developed in an unfavourable direction over the long term. This is largely due to a substantial increase in the consumption of primary energy in the early 2000s. The situation has changed considerably in the most recent period. Since 2008, primary energy consumption has declined more or less continuously as a result of effective energy efficiency policies and weak economic performance in the EU. The reduction has been sufficient to place the EU back on track to meet its Europe 2020 target of improving energy efficiency by 20 % by 2020. Similar trends can be observed for the headline indicator of the \u2018sustainable trans- port\u2019 theme. Energy consumption of transport relative to GDP has followed a mod- erately unfavourable long-term trend but a clearly favourable short-term trend. The indicator has fallen more or less continuously since 2000, which does not necessarily ",
        "14 Executive summary Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages reflect better environmental outcomes. In fact, between 2000 and 2007, transport energy use increased, although less than the increase in GDP. However, the situa- tion has changed in the short term. Since the start of the economic crisis in 2008, the demand for energy has dropped, while GDP has declined at a slower pace. It is unclear whether this favourable short-term trend will continue with the economic recovery. The population status of common birds , the headline indicator in the \u2018natural resources\u2019 theme, has deteriorated in the long term. Short-term developments have been even more aggravated as a result of the substantial decline in the abundance of farmland birds. Overall, biodiversity within the EU has been under continuous pressure by the transformation of land, which is increasingly used for agriculture, infrastructure and human settlements. Although biodiversity concerns are increas- ingly being integrated into EU policies, further efforts may be required to reverse the negative trend. Global partnership: the EU is not on track to meet its target on official development assistance, but shows clear progress in other areas Regarding commitments in the area of \u2018global partnership\u2019, the share of gross national income (GNI) spent by the EU on official development assistance (ODA) has increased only marginally since 2004. The increase has been too slow to place the EU on track to meet its long-standing target of dedicating 0.7 % of GNI to ODA in 2015. To some extent, this is linked to the EU\u2019s weakened economic situation since the start of the economic and financial crisis in 2008. Nonetheless, the EU remains the world\u2019s largest donor and its share of ODA to low-income countries has increased more markedly over the long term. It should also be noted that most indi- cators in the \u2018global partnership\u2019 theme display favourable trends. Good governance: no headline indicator The theme \u2018good governance\u2019 has no headline indicator because no indicator is considered to be sufficiently robust and policy-relevant to provide a comprehensive overview of the good governance concept.

        "16 Introduction Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Introduction Sustainable development is a fundamental and overarching objective of the European Union, enshrined in the Treaty ( 1 ). Measuring progress towards sustainable develop- ment is an integral part of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS), and it is Eurostat\u2019s task to produce a monitoring report every two years based on the EU set of sustainable development indicators (SDIs). This 2015 edition of the monitoring report is the sixth quantitative assessment of progress of the EU towards its sustain- able development objectives ( 2 ). The EU set of sustainable development indicators (SDIs) Background The first steps of Eurostat towards measuring sustainable development (SD) go back to the 1990s. Following the United Nations (UN) Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 (also known as \u2018Rio Earth Summit\u2019), Eurostat started working closely with the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) on global indicators of sustainable development, and pub- lished indicator compilations in 1997 ( 3 ) and in 2001 ( 4 ). A first EU SDI set was proposed following the adoption of the first EU SDS in 2001 ( 5 ) and was endorsed by the Commission in 2005 ( 6 ). The set was slightly revised after the review of the first EU SDS ( 7 ) that led to an adoption of a renewed strategy in 2006 ( 8 ). Since then, several reviews of the SDI set have been carried out by the Commission with the assistance of the working group on SDIs, which is composed of statisticians and policy representatives at national and EU level. Nevertheless, the current set of SDIs, as presented in this report, is still close to that endorsed in 2005. The thematic framework The EU SDI set is organised in a theme-oriented framework, which provides a clear and easily communicable structure relevant for political decision-making. The framework is based on current priority policy issues, but can be adjusted to possible changes in these priorities and objectives which may emerge over time.

Each theme is further divided into subthemes and includes three different levels of indicators (see the following section on the different kinds of indicators included in the set). The main body of the current EU SDS, essentially unchanged since 2006, is built around seven key challenges, with corresponding operational objectives and targets as well as associated actions and measures ( 9 ). In addition, a number of key objectives and policy guiding principles serve as a basis for the strategy. The SDI framework additionally includes a theme on \u2018socioeconomic development\u2019 which focuses on the key objective of economic prosperity, and a theme on \u2018good governance\u2019 related to the guiding principles of the EU SDS and other cross-cutting issues. The most recent changes to the indicator set followed the adoption of the Europe 2020 strategy ( 10 ) and its eight headline indicators, which have been integrated into the SDI framework in the themes \u2018socioeconomic development\u2019, \u2018social inclusion\u2019 and \u2018climate change and energy\u2019. Over the course of several revisions \u2014 the latest dating from an online discussion held with the members of the SDI working group in late 2014 \u2014 some changes have been made to reflect trends in EU policies related to sustainable development and to adjust to data availability. The overall framework has, however, proved sufficiently robust to remain unchanged. ( 9 ) The topics \u2018social inclusion, demography and migration\u2019 are considered together in one EU SDS key challenge, but are represented by two separate themes (\u2018social inclusion\u2019 and \u2018demographic changes\u2019) in the SDI framework. This division reflects the different nature of these two issues. ( 10 ) European Commission (2010), Europe 2020 \u2014 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth , COM(2010) 2020 final.

They are the lead indicators in their respective subthemes. They are robust and available for most EU Member States for a period of at least three years. \u2022 The third level consists of indicators related to actions described in the Strategy or to other issues which are useful for analysing progress towards the Strategy\u2019s objectives.

For the purpose of the monitoring report it was necessary to focus the analysis on a meaningful sub-set, by selecting those indicators that are considered most important for illustrating the overall EU progress towards sustainable development. This means that, for example, some third-level indicators and contextual indicators are not included in the analy- sis. The sub-set of indicators selected for this 2015 edition of the monitoring report is presented in Annex II of this publication. Data are mainly presented for the aggregated EU-28 level. In the cases when EU-28 aggregated data are not available, EU-27 data are presented instead, referring to the situation of the 27 EU Member States before the accession of Croatia to the EU in July 2013. Also, whenever EU-28 data are only available for a very short time period, the EU-27 data are presented in addition to the EU-28. In a few cases (in particular for indicators on \u2018global partnership\u2019) data are shown for the EU-15 aggregate level, referring to the EU before the enlargement of 2004. In addition to the 28 EU Member States, data for EU candidate countries and the countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are included in the coun- try-level comparisons throughout the report when available, complementing the EU-level analysis. Additionally, global comparisons of the EU with other major economies in the world (for example, the United States, Japan and China) are included, mainly for the SDI headline indicators and the Europe 2020 indicators. The data presented in this report were mainly extracted in early July 2015. Most of the data used to compile the indicators stem from the standard Eurostat collection of statistics through the European Statistical System (ESS), but a number of other data sources have also been used, notably other European Commission services, the European Environment Agency (EEA), the OECD and the World Bank. The Eurostat website contains a section dedicated to the SDIs in the ten thematic areas of the EU SDS ( 11 ). Eurostat online data codes, such as tsdec100 and nama_10_ gdp ( 12 ), allow easy access to the most recent data on Eurostat\u2019s website. In this report, these online data codes are given as part of the source below each table and figure. The reader is led directly to the most recent data when clicking on the online data code. Online data codes lead to an open dataset which generally contains more dimensions and longer time series using the Data Explorer interface. Alternatively, data can be accessed by entering the data code into the search field on the Eurostat\u2019s website. ( 11 ) See http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/indicators ( 12 ) There are two types of online data codes: tables have eight-character codes the first of which is the letter \u2018t\u2019 \u2014 for example tps00001 and tsdph220, while databases have codes that use an underscore \u2018_\u2019 within the syntax of the code, for example nama_gdp_c or demo_pjan.

        "20 Introduction Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Eurostat\u2019s website also includes a section called \u2018Statistics Explained\u2019, accessible at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Main_Page. This is an official Eurostat website presenting the full range of statistical subjects covered by Eurostat, including the EU SDS, in an easily understandable way. It works in a simi- lar way to Wikipedia. Together, the articles make up an encyclopaedia of European statistics for everyone, completed by a statistical glossary clarifying all terms used and by numerous links to further information and the latest data and metadata, a portal for occasional and regular users. Treatment of breaks in time series Breaks in time series occur when the data collected in a specific year are not com- pletely comparable with the data from previous years. This could be caused by a change in the classification used, the definition of the variable, the data coverage and/or other reasons. Breaks in time series could affect the continuity and consist- ency of data over time. However, it should be noted that such breaks do not neces- sarily undermine the reliability of time series. There are certain techniques applied by Eurostat and other statistical agencies to ensure the continuity of time series in the presence of breaks. In the course of preparing this 2015 edition of the monitoring report, a case-by-case assessment of breaks in times series has been conducted to determine the extent to which a break would affect the assessment of an indicator. In cases where a break was considered significant enough to affect the evaluation of an indicator or the compa- rability between countries, the analysis of the indicator was adjusted accordingly. Breaks in times series are indicated throughout the report in footnotes below the graphs. Evaluation of indicators What is evaluated? The main purpose of this publication is to assess progress towards sustainable devel- opment based on the objectives and targets set out in the EU SDS and other relevant policy initiatives such as the Europe 2020 strategy. The object of the evaluation is the relative direction and rate of change in the light of sustainable development objec- tives, not the \u2018sustainability\u2019 ( 13 ) of the situation at any point in time. It is therefore a relative, not an absolute assessment. Ideally, each indicator would be evaluated against either a quantitative target set within the political process or a scientifically established threshold. However, many ( 13 ) The concept of sustainable development should be distinguished from that of sustainability. \u2018Sustainability\u2019 is a property of a system, whereby it is maintained in a particular state through time. The concept of sustainable development refers to a process involving change or development. The strategy aims to \u2018achieve continuous improvement of quality of life\u2019, and the focus is therefore on sustaining the process of improving human well-being. Rather than seeking a stable equilibrium, sustainable development is a dynamic concept, recognising that changes are inherent to human societies. ",
        "21 Introduction Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages of the objectives of the EU SDS lack an explicit quantified and measurable target. In these cases, the indicator is evaluated according to a set of common and objective rules to ensure a consistent approach across indicators and to avoid ad hoc value judgments. These rules, although imperfect, provide a simple, transparent, consist- ent and easily understandable approach across the report. There are certain limitations of the evaluation method applied in this publication, in particular regarding the evaluation of the direction and magnitude of change of some indicators. For some indicators, such as household saving, it is difficult to determine the desired direction of change; for example, while reducing household saving could be beneficial in the short term, it could be economically detrimental in the long term. Evaluating the magnitude of change could also be difficult for some indicators. In particular, environmental trends tend to be irreversible, therefore even a small change in the indicator could be considered strictly unfavourable. For con- sistency purposes, the same assessment categories are used for all indicators evalu- ated in the report. How is an indicator evaluated? The report evaluates progress by means of four categories depending on how favour- able or unfavourable the developments have been over the assessment period. The four categories are represented visually by means of weather symbols, as shown in Table B.1. Table B.1: Categories and associated weather symbols for the evaluation of the indicators Evaluation category Symbol Changes are clearly favourable in relation to SD objectives No or moderately favourable changes in relation to SD objectives Changes are moderately unfavourable in relation to SD objectives Changes are clearly unfavourable in relation to SD objectives Contextual indicator or not enough data available for an evaluation : It is important to note that the evaluation presented in this report is based only on the development of the EU and does not take into account international compari- sons. As a result, the evaluation of certain indicators might disregard some impor- tant aspects and present a different picture than expected. For example, looking at ",
        "22 Introduction Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages labour productivity, the evaluation could come to a different conclusion if consider- ing the productivity growth gap between the EU and the US. However, for consist- ency purposes such international comparisons are not taken into account for the evaluation of the indicators. This publication assesses progress for the EU as a whole since the adoption of the EU SDS ( 14 ). Since this constitutes a rather long time period (over ten years for most indicators), it is important to consider whether a trend has been continuous over time or whether there has been a turnaround in the development over the years. In order to account for such recent fluctuations, the evaluation of each indicator in this publication is carried out over two time periods: \u2022 A long-term evaluation is based as far as possible on the evolution of the indicator between 2000 and the latest year of data available for the EU-28 ( 15 ). If data are only available for five consecutive years or less, no long-term evaluation is made ( 16 ). Previous editions of the report only monitored long-term trends of the indicators. Since the evaluation method itself has not changed, the results of the long-term evaluation in this edi- tion are comparable with the evaluation results in previous editions. \u2022 The long-term evaluation is complemented by a short-term evaluation based on the indicator evolution during the latest five-year period ( 17 ). This new component of the monitoring report allows comparing the results of the short-term and long-term evaluation in order to reveal whether a trend has been continuous over the years or whether the indicator has deviated from its long-term path at a certain point in time. Both the long- and the short-term evaluations are based on the \u2018compound annual growth rate\u2019 (CAGR) formula, which assesses the pace and direction of the evolution of an indicator. This method uses the data from the first and the last years of the evaluated time span and calculates the average annual rate of change of the indica- tor (in %) between these two data points. Usually, the long-term evaluation uses the year 2000 as a base, while the short-term evaluation uses the year 2007, 2008 or 2009, depending on whether the latest available data are for 2012, 2013 or 2014 respec- tively. It is important to note that the short-term evaluation considers five year-on- year changes, which consequently involve six consecutive years. ( 14 ) Although it could be argued that longer time periods are needed to monitor sustainable development, it is the purpose of this publication to assess progress since commitments were taken on the various issues monitored. Year 2000 is used as reference as it is the last year before the adoption of the EU SDS in 2001. ( 15 ) EU aggregates are back-calculated when sufficient information is available. For example, the EU-28 aggregate is often presented for periods prior to the accession of Croatia in 2014 and the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, as if all 28 Member States had always been members of the EU. The label is changed if the data refer to another aggregate (EU-27 or EU-25) or a note is added if the data refer to a partial aggregate created from an incomplete set of country information (no data for certain Member States or reference years). ( 16 ) In the case when data for the EU-28 are available for a rather short time period and the trend is not in line with the long- term trend observable for the EU-27, data for the EU-27 are used for the long-term evaluation instead. ( 17 ) The short-term evaluation is based on data from at least three consecutive years. If these are not available for the EU-28, data for the EU-27 are instead used for the evaluation if available. ",
        "23 Introduction Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Depending on the type of indicator and the presence or absence of a quanti- tative target, two different calculation methods have been applied: 1. Indicators with quantitative targets: Whenever possible, the evaluation of indicators takes into account concrete targets set in relevant EU policies and strategies. Most of the targets included in the EU SDS from 2006 (with a time horizon until 2010) have already been replaced by newer targets (with a time horizon up to 2020 and beyond) in more recent policy initiatives. As a consequence, most of the targets used for the monitoring of the progress in this 2015 edition actually stem from the Europe 2020 strategy and other relevant initiatives. In the presence of a quantified political target (such as for greenhouse gas emissions or employment), the actual rate of change of the indicator (based on) is compared with the theoretical rate of change that would be required to meet the target in the target year. If the actual rate is 95 % or more of the required rate, the indicator is evaluated as clearly favourable (\u2018on tar- get path\u2019). Between 80 % and 95 %, it is evaluated as moderately favourable (\u2018close to target path\u2019), and between 0 % and 80 %, it is evaluated as mod- erately unfavourable (\u2018far from the target path\u2019). The evaluation is clearly unfavourable if the actual trend is pointing in the wrong direction \u2014 away from the target path. Figure B.2 shows an example for an indicator for which an increase constitutes the desired direction in terms of SD objectives, such as \u2018share of renewable energies\u2019. Figure B.2: Schematic representation of the evaluation of indicators with quantitative targets Target path 95% of target path 80% of target path ",
        "24 Introduction Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages 2. Indicators without quantitative targets: In the absence of a quantified target, the evaluation of an indicator is entirely based on the calculation of the observed rate of change of the indicator (based on the CAGR) and using the following thresholds: A change of more than 1 % per year is considered clearly favourable or unfavourable (depending on the direction of the change in relation to SD objectives). A favourable annual change of more than 1 % corresponds to the \u2018sun\u2019 symbol in Table B.2, whereas an unfavourable change of similar magnitude corresponds to the \u2018thunderstorm\u2019 symbol. A change between 0 % and 1 % per year is considered moderately favourable or unfavourable, again depending on the direction of the change, thus corresponding to the \u2018sun/cloud\u2019 and \u2018rain\u2019 symbols in Table B.2 respectively. Figure B.3 shows an example of an indicator for which an increase constitutes the desired direction in terms of SD, such as \u2018organic farming\u2019. Figure B.3: Schematic representation of the evaluation of indicators without quantitative targets 1% growth per year Decoupling indicators as a special case: For some of the indicators the issue of interest is not the change in one single trend but in the relationship of two trends. One of these two trends is usually an economic variable (such as GDP), and the other one an environmental variable that shows the environmental pressures exerted by the economic activity. For example, this is the case when analysing trends in resource productivity, where the focus is put on the relationship between the trends in GDP and material consumption. These are called \u2018decoupling\u2019 indicators because they show the strength of the link (or the \u2018coupling\u2019) between the economic and the environmental variable. In rela- tion to sustainable development, the aim is to achieve a \u2018decoupling\u2019 of these two variables, so that continued economic growth does not lead to a further increase in environmental degradation. ",
        "25 Introduction Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 Key messages It is important to note that the evaluation method used for this monitoring report does not look at the correlation of the two underlying indicators (pressure and driv- ing force) but at the development of the pressure variable in relation to the develop- ment of the driving force variable ( 18 ). Overall, the evaluation is considered favour- able if the (environmental) pressure variable is decreasing and unfavourable if it is increasing. Depending on the direction and magnitude of change in the pressure variable in relation to the driving force, there are four different degrees of decou- pling and thus four evaluation categories: \u2022 Absolute decoupling: The situation when the pressure on the environment decreases while the (economic) driving force increases is considered to be \u2018clearly favourable\u2019. This is also the case when the driving force is decreas- ing but at a slower pace than the decrease in the pressure variable. These situations represent \u2018absolute decoupling\u2019 between the driving force (eco- nomic) variable and the pressure (environmental) variable. \u2022 Favourable relative decoupling: When the pressure on the environment decreases but at a slower pace than the decrease in the economic variable, the situation is referred to as \u2018favourable relative decoupling\u2019 and is evalu- ated as \u2018moderately favourable\u2019. \u2022 Unfavourable relative decoupling: When the environmental pressure increases but at a slower pace than the increase in the driving force, the situation is referred to as \u2018unfavourable relative decoupling\u2019. It is evaluated as \u2018moderately unfavourable\u2019 because of the increase in the environmental impacts. \u2022 No decoupling: When the pressure on the environment increases at the same or higher rate than the growth of the economic variable, or if the pres- sure on the environment increases while the economic variable regresses, it is referred to as a situation of \u2018no decoupling\u2019 and is evaluated as \u2018clearly unfavourable\u2019. Graphical representation of indicators with quantitative targets For each indicator with a quantitative target, the graph on the indicator page shows a \u2018target path\u2019 \u2014 a dashed line which is in a different colour from the observed path of the indicator. It represents a theoretical path which starts in the year in which the target has been set in a policy process or which has been defined as a base year for the target. The target path finishes at the target year by which the desired (target) value of the indicator would ideally be reached. The slope of the target path is calcu- lated using the CAGR formula described above, thus it has an exponential form ( 19 ). Figure B.4 shows as an example both the observed and the target paths of the \u2018total employment rate\u2019 indicator. Most targets presented in the report apply to all 28 EU ( 18 ) For more information and specific examples of decoupling indicators see: http://europa.eu/!Bd93tk ( 19 ) Although the target path has an exponential form, it may appear linear due to the rather short period shown in the graph.

Household savings have been strongly reduced in the short run, although disposable household income has im- proved moderately. Investment has also contracted, particularly in the short term. More favourable developments can be seen in some areas of competitiveness and eco- efficiency. Labour productivity has increased substantially since 2000, although some gains were reversed during the economic crisis. Energy intensity has improved even more steadily, both in the long term and short term. Investment in research and de- velopment (R&D) has increased only slightly. Key trends in socioeconomic development Recent changes in real GDP per capita indicate fragile recovery under way In the long run between 2000 and 2014 real GDP per capita in the EU grew moder- ately by 0.9 % per year on average. Growth was more pronounced before the economic crisis of 2008. Between 1995 and 2007 real GDP per capita increased continuously at a rate of 2.2 % per year on average. As the financial and economic crisis took hold of the EU economy, however, GDP growth stalled in 2008 and by 2009 had contracted by 4.7 %. Swift implementation of fiscal stimuli and other policy actions at national and EU levels contained the worst effects of the crisis and restored economic growth in 2010 and 2011. Although real GDP per capita contracted slightly in 2012 and 2013, it increased again in 2014 by 1.1 %. As a result, in the short term between 2009 and 2014 the EU economy grew at an average annual rate of 0.7 %.

This was most likely due to a loss of household and business confidence during the financial market turmoil and the economic crisis. The drop in total investment was somewhat offset by increased government spending in the first years of the crisis. However, since 2009 government investment has also declined as a result of fiscal consolida- tion efforts, driving total investment down further.

Therefore, it is debatable whether a shift towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns has actually occurred. This is particularly so for material use, generation of waste excluding major mineral wastes and, to a lesser extent, final energy consump- tion and electricity consumption. Hazardous waste has continued to show a clearly unfavourable trend. However, some long-term improvements can be seen in waste treatment, environmentally friendly production patterns and pollutant emissions of ammonia (NH 3 ), sulphur oxides (SO x ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). Key trends in sustainable consumption and production Modest signs of material use decoupling from economic growth In 2013, the EU generated an economic value of EUR 1.93 per kilogram of mate- rial consumed. This represents a considerable improvement in resource productiv- ity since 2002, when the economic benefit created had only been EUR 1.52 per kg. This long-term efficiency gain occurred because GDP had been growing faster than domestic material consumption (DMC), in particular before the onset of the eco- nomic crisis. Since 2008, EU resource use has dropped sharply, putting DMC below levels observed a decade ago.

Because the long-term trend was mainly due to positive short-term develop- ments, the improvements in resource productivity are not likely to represent a major turnaround in resource use patterns, but rather mirror the impact of the economic crisis on resource-intensive industries such as construction. Improvements in generation of waste excluding major mineral wastes, waste treatment and pollutant emissions, but hazardous waste continued to increase The amount of waste excluding major mineral wastes generated per inhabitant in the EU was reduced by about 5.8 % between 2004 and 2012.

Growth in the number of households has been a main driver of this trend.

This is also evident in the steadily decreasing amount of people dying from chronic diseases before the age of 65. However, the expected amount of years lived without activity limitations has not risen. This indicates that the extra years of life gained are not necessarily spent in good health. Other public health trends generally show a moderately favourable picture. Progress can be seen in two determinants of health: the production of toxic chemicals and the share of people residing in living quarters exposed to excess noise. No improvements are visible in the amount of people reporting unmet needs for health care due to monetary constraints. The share of people unable to afford health care has risen since the onset of the economic crisis in 2008.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have decreased both in the short term since 2008 and over the long run since 2000. In 2020, the EU is likely to surpass its 20 % reduction target compared with 1990 levels. While primary energy consumption has risen in the past, reaching a peak in 2006, the trend has reversed in recent years and the short-term trend is therefore clearly positive. Some of the favourable trend can be attributed to the economic crisis, with a continuous economic downturn in some EU countries driving down industrial production, transport volumes and energy demand between 2007 and 2013 (with the exception of a limited rebound in 2010). Therefore, further action will be needed to continue improving energy efficiency up to 2020, particularly to avoid a bounce back in energy demand that is expected once economic growth picks up again.

For exam- ple, renewable energy provides a growing share of the EU\u2019s energy consumption. At the same time, economic difficulties and policy changes have recently led to a slump in renewable energy investments after years of rapid growth. Despite these challenges, recent progress demonstrates that EU and national climate and energy policies have an impact on the energy system. Improvements in energy efficiency and higher shares of renewables have lowered carbon emissions per unit of energy and per unit of gross domestic product (GDP). These trends have helped to stabilise the level of energy de- pendence and contributed to the sizable reduction in emissions between 2005 and 2012. Key trends in climate change and energy Greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy consumption are nearing 2020 targets In 2012, EU greenhouse gas emissions , including emissions from international avi- ation, were down by 17.9 % compared with 1990 levels. This has put the EU within reach of meeting the Europe 2020 target of reducing GHG emissions by 20 % by 2020 eight years ahead of schedule. With average emissions 11.8 % below base-year levels in the period 2008\u20132012, the EU-15 has also overachieved its commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to reach an average emission reduction of 8 % in 2008\u20132012 com- pared with the base year ( 1 ).

This downward trend was amplified by the impacts of the economic crisis starting in 2008. It is unclear whether this favourable short-term trend will continue with the economic recovery. Because transport volumes are strongly dependent on economic activity, the eco- nomic crisis has also affected the other indicators in the \u2018sustainable transport\u2019 theme. In the short term, modal split and volumes of freight transport have recorded slightly favourable developments. However, no conclusive assessment of these trends can yet be made.

This can be explained partly by smaller transport volumes as well as other factors such as newly implemented transport and environmental regulation policies and technological progress. These underlying reasons can also explain the favour- able trends of other transport impact indicators such as people killed by road acci- dents or emissions of ozone precursors and particulate matter. Key trends in sustainable transport Absolute decoupling of energy consumption of transport from economic growth in the short term but not in the long term Energy consumption of transport per unit of GDP has fallen by 13.1 % since 2000 and by 6.2 % since 2008. The environmental component of this indicator \u2014 trans- port energy use \u2014 has only declined since the start of the economic crisis in 2008. Between 2000 and 2013 GDP grew by 16.2 % while transport energy only showed a minor increase.

In the short term an absolute decoupling (that is a strong reduction in transport energy consumption while the economy decreased at a slower rate) could be observed. But it is yet unclear whether transport energy use will rise again with the economic recovery. ",

While the forest bird index has shown improvements since 2000, substantial declines in the abundance of farmland birds have led to an overall deterioration of the common bird index. Moreover, despite progress in the sufficiency of nature conservation sites designated to implement the Habitats Directive, many of the EU\u2019s natural resources ( 1 ), such as biodiversity, air, water, soil and spatial resources, are under continuous pressure, mainly due to land- take for settlements and infrastructure as well as intensification of agricultural pro- duction and fisheries. However, progress can be observed in the water quality of riv- ers as well as in the gross nutrient balance on agricultural land. These improvements, among other reasons, are due to better waste water treatment and farm management ( 1 ) The concept of natural resources also commonly includes raw materials, air and energy resources; however, these natural resource types are dealt separately under the Chapter 2 on sustainable consumption and production and Chapter 6 on climate change and energy.

New concepts and solutions are required in a number of areas, including agriculture, fisheries and water policies as well as transport, consumption and production patterns. Key trends in natural resources Continued pressure on the EU\u2019s natural capital The index for all common birds declined by 1.8 percentage points between 2000 and 2013, with two polarised trends in the populations of common farmland and common forest birds. While the forest bird index increased by 8.0 percentage points, the farmland bird index dropped by 12.7 percentage points in the long-term trend. Agricultural intensification has largely been blamed for the decline of common farmland birds. Harmful subsidies and increased use of biomass for renewable en- ergy production are key drivers of this intensification. Biodiversity concerns are in- creasingly being integrated into the regional development policy and the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU, but further efforts are needed.

However, compared with other countries in the world, the EU remains the world\u2019s largest donor, also in terms of ODA/GNI. Many indicators in the global partnership theme are linked to the EU\u2019s economic situation. For this reason, several show clear impacts of the onset of the financial and economic crisis in 2008. This is particularly visible in the headline indicator \u2018official development assistance\u2019 where overall flows fell during the economic downturn. Al- though the EU is the world\u2019s largest donor, it is not on track to meet its long-standing target of dedicating 0.7 % of its GNI to ODA in 2015. Nevertheless, the share of ODA for low-income countries did improve between 2000 and 2013 to some extent and particularly shows a favourable trend for the last five years. In addition, although ODA to developing countries is not enough to meet EU targets, it remains a largely stable source of finance in absolute terms. A negative trend that emerges is the fluc- tuation of private financial flows. These fluctuations can create unpredictability for developing countries that particularly rely on external financial support. In relation to trade, the EU has increased its imports from developing countries, although these have mainly been from China. Imports from least-developed countries (LDCs) rep- resent a considerably lower share of overall EU imports. The largest increase among imports from LDCs is in the category of mineral fuels and lubricants. The proportion of people whose income is less than USD 1.25 a day halved between 2010 and 1990. However, regional differences exist. The target had not been met in Sub- Saharan Africa, Southern Asia and Western Asia. The ratio between per capita carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions in the EU and develop- ing countries was halved between 2000 and 2012; yet this was mainly due to increas- ing emissions in developing countries. The global target to halve the share of the population without access to safe drink- ing water by 2015 was achieved early in 2010. However, a large gap remains between high-income countries and LDCs.
