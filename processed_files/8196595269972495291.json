The Commissioner said there would be annual programmes which deal with unemployment and equal opportunities within the Member States. Furthermore the Commission will take action with the social partners in revising national strategies. The Commissioner emphasised the importance of collective bargaining: \"It is important to ensure that the equality dimension is adequately reflected throughout the layers of Social Dialogue.\" Asking the social partners to facilitate the development of these actions the Commissioner said, \"Collective bargaining is now an essential factor in the equality policy of the European Union.\" The conference was organ\u00ad ised by the Foundation in coll\u00ad aboration with the Directorate General V of the Commission as part of its ongoing project to promote integration of the equal opportunities for men and women in all policies and activities, to reconcile working and family life for both sexes and to promote gender balance in decision making as laid out in the Community Action Programme on Equal Opportunities. Highlighting the position of women, Ms Miet Smet, Minister for Employment and Labour identified women's participation as \"the critical factor for future action on equality.\" The Minister cited the success of recent measures taken in Belgium on social elections and plans of employment where women's participation was the main instrument to promote equality. She asked the Commissioner to fix terms in the European equality programmes. Representing the European Parliament, Ms Nel Van Dijk. MEP and Chair of the Women's Rights Committee underlined the decisive role played by the Parliament as the body where equal opportunities are set up and supported. She told the The conference examined policies directed at gender equality and their impact on the labour market and workplace practices. Although Community law guarantees equal pay for men and women, inequality has been perpetuated by both structural and cultural factors. Women rarely hold the top jobs despite the fact that women have become increasingly involved in the labour market in recent decades. Their employ\u00ad ment is \"precarious\" in that they are covered by few legal guar\u00ad antees and entitlements. Pay differentials between men and women tend to increase with age \u00ad many women are Ms Nel Van Dijk, MEP and Commissioner P\u00e1draig Flynn pictured al the recent European Conference on Equal Opportunities and Collective Bargaining in the Member States of the European Union. conference that dialogue between the social partners should be the main source of regulating equality issues in the workplace at European level. Ms Ghilardotti, MEP, member of the Committee on Employ\u00ad ment and Social Affairs and the Women's Rights Committee stressed the need to give partic\u00ad ipation the impetus to develop its potential. Participation will only be increased if there is a balanced representation of women and a wide range of women's action in the negotiat\u00ad ion processes of working conditions, she told delegates. penalised if they interrupt their careers for family reasons. However there are collective agreements throughout Europe which establish programmes of affirmative action by removing gender barriers and dealing with sexual discrimination. The modernisation of bargaining is essential if it is to meet the needs of men and women in the EU. If women are to take their place as negotiators, they need training and placement in the bargaining process.

        "The City in t he Next Millennium \u00ad The search for Urban Sustainability The city must be socially, economically and environmentally sustainable A ddressing the European Parliament in Brussels recently, Voula Mega, programme manager with overall responsibility for the European Foundation's research on urban environments, outlined the challenges facing the future of European cities. Mega was addressing the Parliament as part of a public hearing to stimulate dialogue and consultation on Communication \"Towards an urban agenda\" issued by the European Commission. \"Europe is first and foremost urban. As we move towards the 21st century cities seem decided to be the main centres of economic activity, innov\u00ad ation and culture. They all want to win the battle of sustainable development and to become more attractive to people and capital. \"Change is inevitable. The challenge is how best to manage change in order to achieve the best European future. The Foundation's research suggests that cities are the political institutions most able to create new democratic spaces, between the world economic macro\u00adregulations and the micro\u00ad regulations of the local communities. The Foundation's project on urban innovations linked up with all European and international efforts to produce best practices and paradigms to inspire and motive cities.\" according to Mega. The search for the sustainable city has been the theme of a major research project carried out by the Foundation since 1993\u00b7 \"The Over\u00ad view of Urban Innovations in the European Union\", conducted by the Foundation included the identification and description of 110 creative pro\u00ad jects, to stimulate urban sustainability. The project synthesises information on existing and planned policies as well as actions and research on innovative approaches. It highlights the different approaches where innovative policies have achieved gains towards the sustainable city. The value of this work is that while each city is unique, models are universal and important shortcuts can be made by imitation. \"The city must be socially, econ\u00ad omically and environmentally sus\u00ad tainable. A sustainable city cannot be conceived without environmental awareness, social integration, a sus\u00ad tained economy and citizen particip\u00ad ation, together in harmonious co\u00ad evolution.\" says Mega. Cities also need sustainable regions and have enormous potential in promoting sustainable territorial patterns thus acting as accelerators of balanced regional development. The Environment of a City Cities are the main contributors to and victims of global environmental problems. Before defining any urban policy, the state of the city's environ\u00ad ment must be well understood. Environmental problems in European metro\u00adpolitan areas do not mainly come from production; they come from consumption and from traffic. The private car is assessed as the single most destructive factor for cities. The main threat to the sus\u00ad tainable city is that countries become too greedy, leading to unsustainable patterns of consumption. Urban Economics Within the European Union, increas\u00ad ing environmental deterioration and poverty in cities are considered to be the main factors reducing their econ\u00ad omic productive potential. Creating the policy climate for more product\u00ad ive urban economies needs flexible structures and adjustments that will allow cities to be sustainable, innovative and inventive. Social Justice in the City Even in the most prosperous European cities there are \"urban islands\" where environmental degrad\u00ad ation and social exclusion go hand in hand. The spirals of unemployment and exclusion constitute the most severe problems for cities that do not wish to become \"dual cities\". An estimated 52 million people live below the poverty line, with 18 million unemployed and 3 million homeless, according to the research. This phenomenon of new forms of poverty must be tackled. Project Objectives Q To highlight innovative visions, practices and actions towards the improvement in the quality of the urban environment. U To pull together information on exemplary approaches with innovative policy elements. \u25a1 To identify ways in which urban innovation can serve sustainability. \u00a1j To identify concrete interests of the employers and trade union associations on innovations needed for the achievement of the intelligent and sustainable city of the 21st century. Measuring Progress The Commission's European Sustain\u00ad able Cities Report recognised the need to measure the movement towards the goal of sustainable urban development. A fundamental element of the research carried out by the Foundation has been the develop\u00ad ment of a set of sustainability indicators for medium\u00adsized cities. A methodological framework for success and failure to be evaluated is now in place. Meeting the challenge Cities are meeting the challenge posed by urban innovation. However the degree or level of awareness varies greatly from city to city, according to Mega. Research shows that established administrative and financial structures can inhibit the potential of innovative policies. Re\u00ad dressing this problem represents a vast field of innovation and change. Overall, top\u00addown models which seek to impose innovation have failed. \"You have to convince people to make real alliances with all the inter\u00ad ested parties if we are to find new solutions. Government and local agencies also have a role to play through the incubation of innovation and ideas and their promotion through incentives. All this tends towards creating a climate that is innovative.\" The research concluded that cities cannot progress without innovation. While innovation will not happen without human creativity. It has to be accepted that success is never certain. Each successful innovation is prob\u00ad ably the result of various trials. Trad\u00ad itional cost\u00adbenefit analysis does not apply in matters of urban sustainability. \u25a0 ",
        "The Fight Against Racism and Xenophobia \u25a1 The Joint Declaration on the Prevention of Racial Discrimin\u00ad ation and Xenophobia and the Promotion of Equal Treatment in the Work Place agreed by the European social partners in October 1995. J European Year against Racism declared in 1997. \u25a1 European Conference on Preventing Racism at the Work\u00ad place organised by the Found\u00ad ation in conjunction with the Spanish Presidency and the Commission. \u25a1 Preventing Racism at the Workplace: A Report on 16 European Countries published by the Foundation. \u00fc Compendium of Good Pract\u00ad ice on the Prevention of Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia and Promotion of Equal Treatment in the Workplace: researched and compiled by the Foundation. Racism and Xenophobia at Work: Are Attitudes Changing? T he Foundation has launched a Compendium of good practice in Member States on the prevention of racial discrimination and xenophobia and promotion of equal treatment in the workplace. The Compendium was launched at a European conference in Lisbon opened by the President of the Republic of Portugal Dr. Jorge Sampaio. The work was undertaken as a follow up measure to the Joint Declaration agreed by the European social partners in October 1995. Over the past five years the Foundation has been actively involved in considerable research to identify policy initiatives in this area. The Compendium represents an important contribution to the fight against racism and xenophobia. As stated by Commissioner P\u00e1draig Flynn, \"Racism, xenophobia and anti\u00adSemitism are a threat to the respect of fundamental rights and to the economic and social cohesion of the European Union.\" The studies from each of the Member States demonstrate that practical action at work is effective in the fight against this threat. As detailed in the report, previous experience can provide a key to future policy to assist policy makers, social partners and practitioners in implementing practical action to prevent racism and xenophobia. The publication includes 25 case\u00adstudies on preventing racism from all 15 members of the European Union. These studies encompass private and public sector companies, trade unions, collective agreements, codes of conduct and national initiatives. Legal measures alone will not overcome the problem; they must be supported by more \"voluntary actions\". An increasing number of European countries have introduced or are in the process of introducing legislation which specifically prohibits discrimination in employment. However, legal prohibitions in this area, while necessary, are not sufficient to tackle the problem. They can only provide the context for more \"voluntary\" actions, either at company level or at national or sectoral level. The compendium focuses on examples of good practice at this voluntary level. For its compilation. national researchers within each member state produced a report covering national case studies of good practice. These studies present national collective agreements, joint declarations and information, training and education campaigns. They are grouped according to their sector or nature. The first group contains private sector companies in the manufacturing, metal industries and the retail sectors. The second group consists of public sector organizations along with some private sector companies involved in the provision of services. The third group are trade union organizations and the fourth group are agreements and initiatives usually involving the social partners. A fuller account of these studies can be found in the Compendium while a more detailed account of all the original cases can be found in the individual national reports. \u25a0 A Note from the Director I odernisation of the collective bargaining process is essential to address the imbalance in equal opportunities which persists despite the commit\u00ad ment to gender equality in the EU. Women must take their place at the bargaining table if these inequalities are to be redressed. Gender equality is a significant factor in realizing the full potential of Europe's human resources. The Foundation has devoted considerable attention to this issue, incorporating an equality and gender perspective into all relevant work. However our focus cannot be blinkered. The area of equal opportunities has expanded beyond the gender issue; man)' suffer due to direct and indirect discrimination based on a wide range of factors. Racism has become a particularly pressing issue. While the commitment to fight racism was enshrined in the Joint Declaration signed by the European social partners in 1995, those principles must be put into practice. Legislation can only go so far; to achieve real harmony there must be a volun\u00ad tary commitment on all levels. Our Compendium of \"good practice\" on the prevention of racial discrimination at the work place illustrates just how much can be x\u00ad \u00adN done on the voluntary level. \u25a0 /j , ^~-< New additions to Labour Law Glossaries The European Employment and Industrial Relations Glossary series has been expanded by the publication of three new volumes: the glossar)' on Denmark and the Greek and Spanish vernacular editions. The series has become an indispensable guide for all players in the industrial relations and labour law in the EU sphere. The glossaries have been specifically designed to meet the needs of those seeking a comprehensive overview of employment and industrial relations practices throughout the EU \u00ad national and international administrators, trade unionists, managers and researchers. The series has been described by Professor Bob Ilepple in the \"Industrial Law Journal\" as \"a major event in the development of European industrial relations and labour law.\" Each volume contains an introductor)' survey of the characteristic features of the Member State. Several hundred entries explain the key employment and labour relations issues and terms current in the jurisdiction. Tiziano Treu, Professor of Labour Law, Catholic University of Milan and Michael Terry, Professor of Industrial Relations, University of Warwick are the general editors of the series while each volume is edited by leading experts within each country.

        "Industrial Relations Congress T he Foundation will be playing a major role at the forthcoming 11th World Congress of the International Industrial Relations Association (IIRA) in Bologna next September. Over 1000 delegates are expected to attend the conference at which some 300 papers on industrial relations, work organisation, competitiveness and employment will be presented. As an affiliate of the IIRA, the Foundation will chair sessions and make a number of presentations on its research projects in the area. The World Congress will continue the important work of the 5th Euro\u00ad pean Industrial Relations Congress at which the Foundation hosted a most successful off\u00adsite seminar. The seminar explored a number of research ideas for the future work of the Foundation. It was opened by the Director of the Foundation, Clive Purkiss. A panel of experts representing the European trade unions, employers and Economic and Social Committee, chaired by the Deputy Director, Eric Verborgh, discussed and responded to ideas which emerged from the seminar under four headings: equal oppor\u00ad tunities, work organisation, European collective bargaining and the Europeanisation of industrial relations.

EIRO Annual Review goes online J une 1998 saw the online publication of the 1997 Annual Review of the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). For the first time, a Foundation publication has become directly available to the public on the World\u00adWide Web before it appears in printed form. EIRO is a major Foundation project, which initiates, collects, stores, disseminates and provides access to information and analysis on developments in industrial relations in the 15 EU Member States, plus Norway, and at European level. EIRO started operations in early 1997, and the new Annual Review provides a snapshot of developments in European industrial relations over the year, while looking forward into 1998. The Review contains a comparative overview of developments across the EU Member States and Norway, and at the EU level, followed by a summary of the main events and issues in each of the individual countries concerned (based on reports from EIRO's national centres). The Annual Review can be found, along with EIRO's monthly news and feature reports and comparative studies, on the EIROnline Website \u00ad at http://www.eiro.eurofound.ie/. \"We believe that this first Annual Review demonstrates the usefulness of EIRO and the quality of its information and analysis, as well as illustrating the speed and efficiency of electronic publishing on the World\u00adWide Web\", commented Mark Carley, Chief Editor of EIRO. \u25a0 Future European Ecology of Work Conferences T wo conferences in the Ecology of Work series will be held within the next year: \u25a1 The 6th Conference will take place in the Leeuwenhorst Congress Centre in the Netherlands from 24 to 27 November, 1998 and D The 7th Conference will be held in the Stresemann Institute, Bonn. Germany from 17 to 20 May, 1999. These conferences are hosted jointly by the Foundation and the US Ecology of Work Inc. They are designed to give practitioners an opportunity to share experiences and practices in organisational change through people. At both conferences some 20 case study presentations will be made by joint management/ worker representative teams. For further information on either conference contact Eberhard K\u00f6hler or Kevin \u03a1 O'Kelly at the Foundation. \u25a0 BULLETIN FROM THE FOUNDATION ISSN 0258 1965 Number 56 (1998) The European Foundation for [he Improvement of living and Working Conditions is in autonomous body of the European Union.
