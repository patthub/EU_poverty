        "DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR INTERNAL POLICIES POLICY DEPARTMENT B: STRUCTURAL AND COHESION POLICIES REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF COHESION POLICY 2014-2020: PREPARATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY OF MEMBER STATES ANNEX Abstract The aim of this study is to assess the administrative capacity of Member States for implementing Cohesion policy in 2014-2020, and the preparations undertaken at administrative level for a successful start of the programming period. Fourteen case studies support the finding that simplification measures are being prepared at EU and Member State levels based on the lessons learned from previous periods, but that the efficient and effective Funds management in 2014-2020 will still be coupled with administrative challenges for national and regional authorities.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 17 INTRODUCTION The following case studies aim to complement and illustrate the findings presented in the main text of the study on the 'Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States' commissioned by the European Parliament. These case studies describe the state-of-play of the preparation and implementation process of the Partnership Agreement (PA) and the Operational Programmes (OP) overall in 14 Member States, as well as selected OPs wherever possible at the time of writing (see Table 1:). The case studies were based on the draft PA and European Commission Position Papers (hereinafter referred to as EC Position Papers) available, as well as other sources wherever deemed relevant. In addition, the case studies were informed by interviews carried out with authorities at national/coordinating level and OP authorities, mainly for the OPs selected for further analysis. The case studies follow a common structure to assist clarity and coherence. First, each case study describes the state-of-play and the process of developing the PA in the country in question. Next, the programme architecture is described, i.e. the number, type and funding of the OPs planned for the 2014-2020 programming period are described. 1 The subsequent sections of the case studies focus on a description of a selected OP (wherever possible), including an analysis of the changes compared to the 2007-2013 programming period\u2019s equivalent OP and the conditions for its preparation (including the impact of the financial and economic crisis). The lessons learned from the capacity issues experienced in the 2007- 2013 programming period are then systematically described across the different themes implemented and across the phases of the policy cycle. The final section of each case study consists of a description of the changes planned and anticipated with regard to administrative capacity in the 2014-2020 programming period, as well as the associated difficulties expected. It should be noted that the level of information differs between the case studies, depending on the progress in developing the PA and OPs and the information provided by the interviewees. Furthermore, the information provided does not necessarily relate to the whole country, but rather to the OP and therefore the region or thematic scope of the OP analysed. Table 1 presents the selection of Member States along the following general parameters: \uf0b7 EU13 and EU15; \uf0b7 size of ERDF and ESF budgets; and the following specific parameters: \uf0b7 below \u2010 average absorption rate (BA) between 2007 and January 2013; \uf0b7 above \u2010 average absorption rate (AA) between 2007 and January 2013; \uf0b7 OP architecture (multi-funded, single \u2010 funded OP); \uf0b7 number of OPs; \uf0b7 type of OP (thematic, regional). 1 It should be noted that ETC programmes are omitted from the analyses that focus on national thematic and regional OPs.

Partnership Agreement In Austria, the process of developing the PA began in spring 2012 and ended in the first quarter of 2014. The \u00d6ROK, the Austrian Conference on Spatial Planning, was responsible for coordinating theinteraction between the different funds and the elaboration of the PA. The project was named \u2018STRAT.AT 2020\u2019, indicating a continuation of \u2018STRAT.ATplus\u2019, i.e. the Austrian National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) of the 2007-2013 programming period. For the elaboration of the PA, different working bodies were set up. 2 The STRAT.AT 2020 Steering Group is composed of high-ranking public officials carrying out strategic tasks concerning the overall process, bringing together the so-called Project Group, the Subcommittee on Regional Economy (coordination board for European Union (EU) regional policy and its implementation in Austria) and the political bodies of the \u00d6ROK. The STRAT.AT 2020 Project Group was responsible for the core process of defining the common themes and strands of the national Cohesion policy objectives and the development of rural areas/rural development policy as well as for generally laying the ground. The Project Group included therepresentatives of the programming bodies, namely the Federal Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, representatives of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management, the bodies of the L\u00e4nder (Austrian regions) responsible for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and the Federal Chancellery responsible for the overall coordination. STRAT.AT 2020 Focus Groups were set up by the Steering Group for the purpose of carrying out preparatory work to clarify and deepen certain issues and themes. The themes of the respective Focus Groups and their composition were therefore agreed on an individual basis. The Focus Groups reported to the Project Group, which decides on the further use of the results for STRAT.AT 2020. In total, 15 Thematic Focus Groups were held. 3 The STRAT.AT 2020 Forums were open to all actors involved in the programming (programme implementation partners, economic and social partners, Association of Towns and Associations of Municipalities, intermediaries, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), experts/academia). The forums were designed to provide information on the interim results and feedback, as well as to deepen the exchange among the actors from all programming areas. Four STRAT.AT 2020 forums were planned for the process, including a presentation of results of the process as a starting event for the new European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) period. During the STRAT.AT 2020 process, there were two online hearing procedures, in the summers of 2012 and 2013 (online consultation). On 8 April 2014, the PA passed the Ministerrat (Austrian Council of Ministers), and at the time of the interview it was clear that, in accordance with the regulatory deadline, it was going to be submitted via the Structural Funds Common database (SFC) to the European 2 See http://www.oerok.gv.at/eu-regionalpolitik/europaeische-struktur-und-investitionsfonds-in-oesterreich- 2014-2020/partnerschaftsvereinbarung-stratat-2020/english-summary.html . 3 See http://www.oerok.gv.at/eu-regionalpolitik/europaeische-struktur-und-investitionsfonds-in-oesterreich- 2014-2020/partnerschaftsvereinbarung-stratat-2020/prozess/fokusgruppen.html .

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 20 Commission by 22 April 2014 at the latest.In practice, the submission of the PA and one OP took place on 17 April 2014. Lessons learned According to the opinion of the interviewed expert, two main lessons were learned in Austria, the first in relation to the timing of the process and the second related to the interests of different stakeholders involved. The strategic planning process started too early in Austria, namely in spring 2012, before substantial changes were announced by the European Commission in terms of standards and provisions for the PAand the OPs (e.g. guidelines for the PA and OP templates). This resulted in a substantial amount of additional work. The PA also had to be modified over time, because certain analyses were carried out at a rather early stage in 2012 (which resulted in the need for updating), and also because the 2013 EC Position Paper\u2019s specific recommendations for Austria raised new considerations. 4 The requirement to set up the OPs in parallel to the elaboration of the PA was not considered as ideal by the interviewee. The Managing Authorities who were responsible for developing the 2014-2020 OPs showed little interest in the process of elaborating the PA at the beginning of the process. The OP authorities showed little active involvement, because they wereconcerned with the day-to-day management of the programmes rather than with the overall strategic processes. In this context, for the OP authorities, regional strategies play a greater role and have a more binding character than discussion processes launched by a national coordinating institution (\u00d6ROK). For the ERDF OPs, the OP programming processes did not start before 2013. The process of preparing the PA aimed at including as many relevant stakeholders as possible and created high expectations among some stakeholders (i.e. to have a real influence on the orientation of the programmes), which were frequentlydisappointed. Advantages and disadvantages of the new instrument In the case of Austria, the ERDF and European Social Fund (ESF) amount to approximately 5% to 8% of overall funding within the respective policy areas, and the funds hence play a complementary role in the respective Thematic Objectives. 5 The new instrument does not create any advantage for the programming process of Structural Funds. The situation is completely different with regard to the Eureopan Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), from which almost 100% of funds for rural development in Austria originate. Consequently, there was a real need during the PA process to discuss whether EAFRD funds could also be used for social services in rural areas (EAFRD should not be limited solely to agriculture), and the PA was the appropriate vehicle for this discussion and the fine-tuning of the decision (which was taken at ministerial level). Stage of preparations for the thematic orientation of the PA The overall thematic orientation of the programmes is defined in the PA and was decided at an early stage in the process. A more important challenge consisted of choosing the\u2018Investment Priorities\u2019 (for ERDF) or \u2018Focus Areas\u2019 (for EAFRD) at programme level. 4 See http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/nd/csr2013_austria_en.pdf . 5 Based on estimations, see Partnership Agreement, Final Draft, Chapter 1.3, p. 72. ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 21 For the ERDF, the regulation foresees that at least 80% of the funds have to be allocated to two or more of the four Thematic Objectives: TO1 (strengthening research, technological development and innovation), TO2 (enhancing access to and use of quality of Information and Communication Technology - ICT), TO3 (enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs) and TO4 (supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors). At least 20% must be reserved for a reduction of CO 2 . For the region of Burgenland, which is a transition region, 60% of the funds have to be focused on at least two of the four mentioned Thematic Objectives and 15% on CO 2 reduction (5% of ERDF funds have to be for \u2018sustainable urban development\u2019). The ERDF in Austria will contribute to TO1, TO3 and TO4. The integrated urban and regional development will encompass TO6 (environmental protection and resource efficiency), TO8 (employment and labour mobility) and TO9 (social inclusion, combating poverty and discrimination). It was stated at the time of the interview that, with the Priority Axes and Investment Priorities of the future single Austrian ERDF programme being defined, the ERDF OP would be submitted as legally stipulated alongside the PA to the European Commission in April 2014. With regard to the ESF, the concentration is envisaged at the level of Investment Priorities, deriving from TO8 (employment and labour mobility), TO9 (social inclusion, combating poverty and discrimination), TO10 (education and training, lifelong learning) and TO11 (institutional capacity). At least 20% of the funds must be allocated to TO9. A first draft of the ESF OP was sent to the European Commission in November 2013, and the European Commission responded with a statement. At the time of the interview, the revised ESF OP draft was subject to consultation and was to be submitted to the European Commission alongside the PA in April 2014. Significant changes from 2007-2013 The Austrian NSRF 2007-2013 (\u2018STRAT.AT 2007-2013\u2019) foresaw the following priorities: Regional Competitiveness and Innovation (Priority 1), Attractive Regions and Quality of Locations (Priority 2), and Adaptability and Qualification of the Labour Force (Priority 3). The horizontal priorities are Territorial Cooperation (Priority 4) and Governance for the Implementation of EU Structural Funds Programmes in Austria (Priority 5). There are no significant changes in the future ERDF programme in comparison to the 2007- 2013 programming period, but the focus is stronger. The emphasis on innovation and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is greater in the 2014-2020 programming period than in the 2007-2013 period, and an even stronger focus can be noticed in the urban dimension. TO6 (environment) and TO9 (poverty) will not be included. Difficulties in responding to thematic orientation/concentration needs No difficulties were encountered in responding to the thematic orientation/concentration needs (see above). Progress in fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities All ex-ante conditionalities, the seven general ex-ante conditionalities and the relevant thematic ex-ante conditionalitieswere fulfilled, according to the self-assessment in the PA. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 22 Experiences with any formal or informal consultation with the European Commission about the PA (and programmes) The informal consultation of formal institutions was characterised as difficult by the interviewed expert, and in general it seems to be a significant challenge to link formal and informal processes at national and EU levels. The position of the European Commission in the entire PA process was not really clear. The EC Position Papers were initially not foreseen in the process, and in practice they were brought into the whole process at an arbitrary point in time, completely detached from the process taking place at the national level. 1.2. Programme architecture In the 2014-2020 programming period, there will be one ERDF OP, one ESF OP and one EAFRD OP. In contrast to the 2007-2013 programming period, the number of ERDF OPs has been reduced from nine (eight for Regional Competitiveness and Employment regions - one per region - and one for a Convergence region) to one single OP resulting from the merger of different regional ERDF programmes into one programme coordinated centrally by a new Managing Authority (situated in the \u00d6ROK). In the ESF, the number of Managing Authorities has been reduced from two to one. The reform of the ERDF administration was politically agreed between the Austrian L\u00e4nder and the central administration (Austria is characterised by a strong federal system). An increase of efficiency in spending ERDF funds is foreseen, comprising a reduction of funding bodies, the use of synergies in terms of organisation and delivery of tasks, and the development of common quality standards. This is intended to deliver increased capacity, with three Managing Authorities (one per fund) instead of 12 as in the 2007-2013 programming period. One central Managing Authority Afor the ERDF with decentralised implementation bodies can be regarded as an advantage in terms of a territorialised approach. Main challenges Despite the fact that nine regional programmes have been merged into one ERDF programme, it is not yet apparent to what extent the Managing Authority, which is situated at central level, will take over tasks from the regional level to generate the intended effect of enhanced resource efficiency on programme level.

Operational Programme(s) Case: Austrian IWB/ERDF 'Investment for growth and jobs' OP The process of developing an overall strategy is already finalised, and it is connected to the PA. There will be no significant changes with regard to the output indicators in comparison to the 2007-2013 programming period. However, the concentration targets set in the regulations have consequences for the targets of the individual programmes (for instance, 20% of ERDF funds have to be reserved for a reduction of CO 2 ). A challenging or at least \u2018discussion-intensive\u2019 issue wasencountered with regard to result indicators, but theyhad a positive effect ultimately, as they helped to focus the programmes. A critical issue in relation to the new indicator system \u2013which overall has been considered as a helpful orientation framework \u2013 relates to interpretation in the event of deviance of result indicators from the officially set targets. At the time of the interview, financial tables were available in a pre-final version, distinguishing between the \u2018transition\u2019 region of Burgenland and the rest of \u2018more developed\u2019 Austria as well as the Priority Axes. 6 6 http://www.oerok.gv.at/fileadmin/Bilder/3.Reiter-Regionalpolitik/2.EU- Kohaesionspolitik_2014_/EFRE/IWB_EFRE_AT_Draft_2.0_2014-02-05_inkl_Anhang.pdf , p. 76.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 25 According to the PA, the programmes will make use of the simplification measures foreseen in the regulation \u2013 notably the simplified cost options. These simplifications will be reflected in the national and regional eligibility rules. With regard to the ERDF, the eligibility rules are going to be revised and harmonised and will be made much clearer for the beneficiaries. On the level of programme structures, the merger of nine ERDF programmes will also reduce the number of funding bodies and foster the concentration and increase of know- how, e.g. at the First-Level Control (FLC) bodies. Main differences between the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 programmes The main differences relate to the already-mentioned reform of the ERDF programmes in Austria in administrative and organisational terms. Impact of the financial crisis or political instability The financial crisis had no significant impact. Impact of administrative issues One of Austria\u2019s characteristics is its strong federal system. With regard to the ERDF, for instance, this led to different eligibility rules. National and regional rules and basic standards were not harmonised between the nine regional ERDF OPs (nor in the European Territorial Cooperation - ETC - programmes). The aim for the 2014-2020 programming period is to achieve a harmonisation of national and ERDF eligibility rules. Role of the European Commission, the European Semester or any other European influence The European Commission and European Semester certainly play an important role in Cohesion policy processes, starting with the regulations and the indicator system, which offers the strongest leverage to exert influence on the programmes. The influence of the European Semester is noticeable via the Council\u2019s \u2018country-specific recommendations\u2019, which have influenced both the PA and the programmes (mainly the ESF). ",

Furthermore, at levels such as project generation or project appraisals, no tasks are foreseen for the central coordination. In principle, the capacities at programme level were sufficient for day-to-day management. Only when additional activities such as action plans were requiredwere the capacities found to be limited.

Due to the creation of one central Managing Authority for all ERDF programmes (as opposed to nine in the 2007-2013 programming period), capacity-related issues are expected to arise in institutional and procedural terms. Synergies between the former nine ERDF programmes can be used (e.g. important for evaluations), and there is greater flexibility in financial terms than in the 2007-2013 programming period. There will be more streamlined processes and information flows. The changes made acknowledge the European Commission\u2019s assessment of administrative capacity in its Position Paper.

It was sent to the European Commission on 4 April 2014 and has been in the process of inter- service consultation within the European Commission since 14 April. The PA is based on a number of national strategic documents developed at the end of the 2007-2013 programming period, more specifically the National Regional Development Strategy (2012-2022) and the National Concept for Spatial Development (2013-2025), both adopted in the second half of 2012. According to the National Concept for Spatial Development, Bulgaria will strive to achieve the moderate polycentric model for urban development over the next ten years. In this scenario, the larger towns and cities are expected to play a key role in national economic progress and in regional policy. This is seen as a way to counterbalance the increasing centralisation of the capital city of Sofia, which may, in the long run, deepen the gap in the social and economic development of some parts of the country and prevent the utilisation of the full potential of the territory. The PA also envisages the pilot implementation of Integrated Territorial Investments in the North-western Region (NUTS 2 level), identified as the least-developed region of the EU (Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per inhabitant at 27% of the EU27 average in 2010, expressed in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) terms). Lessons learned The PA is a very comprehensive document providing a basis for development over the 2014-2020 programming period and is much better targeted than the NSRF. The working group for its elaboration comprised a wide variety of stakeholders, including the regional development councils (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) 2 level), the National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria, national organisations representing people with disabilities, national organisations of employers and employees, environmental NGOs, etc., which provided a wide platform for consultations. The experience generated during the 2007-2013 programming period will provide the basis for better implementation of the programmes and improved absorption of the available funds. The new procedures that will be introduced will be based on already established mechanisms and are expected to be more effective and efficient. The 2014-2020 programming period will widen the access of new actors that can become beneficiaries under the available grant schemes, which have proved to be very useful for the respective time period in meeting a specific need or enabling successful project implementation. This is further described below. The elimination of the Intermediate Bodiesin some of the OPs that had such structures is expected to accelerate project approvals and improve their management. ",

Annex 5 provides an action plan for fulfilling all thematic ex-ante conditionalities applicable at national level, with deadlines and responsible institutions. All general and thematic ex-ante conditionalities of the ESIF are applicable, with the exception of 7.4, \u2018Development of smart energy distribution, storage and transmission systems\u2019, since there will be no planned measures and funds from ESIF for this theme. By 31 December 2016, all ex-ante conditionalities are to be covered. The status in April 2014 indicated that some of the criteria under the different conditionalitieswere fulfilled, while the remaining ones were to be met within the first half of 2014. Experiences with any formal or informal consultation with the European Commission about the PA (and programmes) The PA and the respective OPs were subject to consultation with the European Commission at a number of stages throughout their development \u2013 both formally and informally. The European Commission was very supportive in providing comments and suggestions. 2.2 Programme architecture During the 2014-2020 period, Bulgaria will implement seven national OPs financed by the ESI Funds. The country will also benefit from five cross-border cooperation OPs (Bulgaria/Greece-Romania-Turkey-Macedonia-Serbia). There will be no ROPs. Several changes have been introduced for the 2014-2020 programming period: \uf0b7 A new OP has been developed called \u2018Science and Education for Smart Growth\u2019 in response to the need tostrengthen R&D activities and education in science sectors. It will be managed by the Ministry of Education and Science, formerly an Intermediate Body under the OP Human Resources Development; \uf0b7 Two of the OPs from the 2007-2013 programming period (OP Administrative Capacity and OP Technical Assistance (TA)) have been merged into the OP Good Management; \uf0b7 The former OP Competitiveness has been focused more strongly on supporting innovations by companies to become OP \u2018Innovations and Competitiveness\u2019. The remaining OPs are: \uf0b7 OP Regions in Growth (former OP Regional Development); \uf0b7 OP Human Resources Development; \uf0b7 OP Transport and Transport Infrastructure (former OP Transport); \uf0b7 OP Environment. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 36 Three of the OPs will receive multi-funding, such as: \uf0b7 The new OP Science and Education for Smart Growth \u2013 from ESF (57.5%) and ERDF (42.5%); \uf0b7 OP Transport and Transport Infrastructure \u2013 from Cohesion Fund (CF) (71%) and ERDF (29%); \uf0b7 OP Environment \u2013 from CF (75.9%) and ERDF (24.1%). Main challenges The main challenges in the 2014-2020 programming period will be to ensurebalanced development of the territory of the country, which is now economically dominated by the capital city, as well as to ensure full absorption of the funds under the different OPs (which was a challenge in the 2007-2013 period). This will lead to an improvement of the competitiveness of Bulgarian businesses, better physical and engineering infrastructure, and an upgrade of the human capital. Management of multi-fund programmes The following institutions will be taking the roles of Managing Authorities in the implementation of the three multi-funded OPs: the Ministry of Education and Science will be the Managing Authority of the new OP Science and Education for Smart Growth; the Ministry of Transport, Information Technology and Communications for the OP Transport and Transport Infrastructure; and the Ministry of Environment and Water for the OP Environment. The Ministry of Education and Science is in the process of establishing the Managing Authority, as it will largely benefit from its previous experience as an Intermediate Body under the OP Human Resources Development. The other two Managing Authorities are well prepared and have structures, staff and procedures in place from the 2007-2013 programming period. Improvements are anticipated in the Managing Authority of the OP Environment, which achieved very high contracting rates in the 2007-2013 period, but the level of implementation remains insufficient, even though it has been slowly catching up.

Most of the final drafts (third or fourth revisions) were to be published for public consultation by the end of April or beginning of May 2014. The ex-ante evaluations of the OPs had either been finalised by the end of 2013 or were in a final phase of preparation, such as in the case of the OP Environment. Indicators and targets Most of the indicators and targets will stem from the national strategic documents. Compared to the 2007-2013 period, there will be fewer indicators and there will be a clear distinction between output and result indicators. The main challenges are related to the possibility of obtaining quantitative information from national sources in order to verify the achievement of the targets set. Financial tables (i.e. funding earmarked to regions or selected measures) Most of the financial tables for the respective OPs have been drafted based on the financial distribution in the PA. There will be more focus on the development of the different urban agglomerations seen as generators of regional economic growth. Under the OP Regions in Growth, for example, over 60% of the funds will go for sustainable and integrated urban development. Balance will be sought between the development of the national and regional transport infrastructure, which has serious deficiencies. In the OP Human Resources Development, the focus will be put on youth employment and social inclusion. Simplification measures In an effort to improve the implementation of projects, the following simplification measures are planned to be introduced: \uf0b7 Electronic submission and reporting of project proposals \u2013 for both public and private beneficiaries. The municipalities already have experience in submitting grant applications through the Module for electronic services of the Information System for Management and Monitoring of EU Structural Instruments in Bulgaria (https://eumis.government.bg); \uf0b7 Simplified financial reporting under the projects: introduction of flat rates and lump sums, as well as verification of costs based on sample checks; \uf0b7 Elimination of Intermediate Bodies, e.g. in the OP Human Resources Development, which had three Intermediate Bodies in the 2007-2013 programming period; \uf0b7 Focus on direct beneficiaries with clearly identified needs and proven impact as well as on projects proposals at an advanced stage of preparation, e.g. already prepared technical designs for construction works \u2013 for the OPs Regions in Growth, Transport and Transport Infrastructure, and Environment. Main differences between the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 programme(s) There is more thematic focus in the new OPs, based on the experience of the 2007-2013 programming period, more specifically on urban development as a basis for regional economic growth (67 urban agglomerations will receive the majority of the support under the OP \u2018Regions in Growth\u2019), R&D and innovations, as well as transition to low-carbon economy, preservation of environment and resource effectiveness.

Efforts willfocus on making a clear demarcation between the areas of support, both in terms of Thematic Objectives and between urban and rural regions. During the 2007-2013 programming period, settlements in some municipalities were unable to apply for funding due to the limitations of the OPs (e.g. Rural Areas Development Programme vs. OP Regional Development). Therefore, efforts will be made to widen the funding opportunities to all. Impact of the financial crisis or political instability The financial crisis has largely impacted on the capacity of the project beneficiaries to implement their grant contracts, which in some cases, e.g. under the OP Competitiveness, has led to the inability of SMEs to implement a significant number of projects that had already been approved. The municipalities have also had problems securing sufficient financial resources for the implementation of their projects. The political instability did not have a significant impact on capacity. The Managing Authorities have managed to preserve most of their expert staff since the preliminary elections in 2013, although there have been changes among the heads of the Managing Authorities. Influence of national political structure on administration The national government and the respective ministries responsible for the OPs have the greatest power in managing the programmes. The level of self-government is not sufficiently developed either in terms of decision-making power or financial resources. Most of the Managing Authorities have regional representation in the 28 districts of the country, dealing with the operational management and monitoring of the projects. However, all decisions are taken centrally, including the verification of costs and payments to the beneficiaries. Role of the European Commission, the European Semester or any other European influence The consultations with the European Commission and its recommendations were reported as very effective, as full support was provided both for the implementation of the OPs during the 2007-2013 programming period and for the development of the 2014-2020 OPs.

Legend : -- least effective, - not effective; + effective; ++ very effective; N/A not applicable The Intermediate Bodies proved to be the weaker link in the implementation of the OPs, due to a lack of administrative capacity to evaluate and contract projects within a reasonable time frame, e.g. three to four months from the end of the respective grant scheme. This led to delayed implementation of a number of projects, especially for businesses. The most significant deficiencies accumulated in the State Fund \u2018Agriculture\u2019 (Rural Areas Development Programme), where some projects were not rankedfor over a year. Following a very slow start, the OP Competitiveness managed to generate momentum over time and to reach a stage where reimbursement of incurred costs to beneficiaries wasexecuted within 30-40 days from submission of the technical and financial reports. Good practice and lessons learned There are no specific areas where capacity could be evaluated as \u2018very effective\u2019. Rather, some specific OPs managed to implement grant schemes that proved to be very useful for the respective time period in meeting a specific need or enabling successful project implementation in the 2014-2020 programming period. Several examples can be named in this regard: \uf0b7 The INTEGRA scheme, funded by the OP Human Resources Development and targeting three municipalities (Vidin, Devnya and Dupnitsa), each of which suffers from specific deficiencies. The scheme provided an integrated approach for tackling the labour market integration of marginalised groups, ensuring access to education and training, supporting social inclusion through improving access to social services and healthcare, and supporting social inclusion and long-term integration of the most marginalised groups; \uf0b7 Support for the de-institutionalisation of children in Bulgaria \u2013 a good practice for the joint use of funds under the OP Human Resources Development (ESF), the OP Regional Development (ERDF) and the OP Rural Areas Development (EAFRD) \u2013 in which physical infrastructure (construction of premises) for resident services in ",

The plans represent a combination of time-and-space-integrated projects, actions and investment intentions that will be applied in 67 urban agglomerations. The purposes of the IPURDs are to integrate policies and gather different stakeholders for their joint implementation, which will contribute to the realisation of the vision and strategy for urban development and will combine specific development priorities as defined in the municipal development plans, the general area development plans, and other strategic documents at national and European levels. The Integrated Plans for Urban Regeneration and Development have served as the basis for the development of the largest in terms of financing Axis 1 of the new OP Regions in Growth. Over the course of the 2007-2013 programming period, the capacity of the beneficiaries significantly improved, but the following issues can be identified: \uf0b7 The larger municipalities that were beneficiaries under the OPs have more staff and better-prepared staff able to deal with project development, implementation and reporting, compared to small or rural municipalities, which lack sufficient capacity and expertise; \uf0b7 The same applies to the financial capacity for the implementation of projects. The smaller the municipality, the less (access to) resources it has available; \uf0b7 A similar pattern is observed with businesses, where access to finance, especially for micro- and small enterprises, is still a challenge for the implementation of EU- funded projects.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 43 Action taken In an effort to reduce the deficiencies in the Intermediate Bodies, the Managing Authorities have taken stronger control over the process of selection, monitoring and evaluation of projects. There are still many unresolved issues with \u2018State Fund Agriculture\u2019, 8 where the Managing Authority is the \u2018Development of Rural Regions\u2019 Directorate within the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. The State Fund Agriculture was established in 1998 under the Agricultural Producers Support Act to provide financial support to agricultural producers under state aid programmes, the pre-accession SAPARD Programme, the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy of the EU, including the Rural Development OP. Another action is the revision of the annual indicative programmes under the different OPs, in an effort to include grant schemes that are able to generate interest. Capacity issues in the past Most of the capacity issues in relation to the programming and management of the OPs in Bulgaria were expressed in the first few years after EU accession (2007-2009). This was also reflected in the very low absorption rate of EU funds during this first three-year period (<3% from all available Structural and Cohesion Funds). Over the next few years, capacity gradually increased to reach acceptable levels by the end of the period. Therefore, there has been significant improvement in all areas. The Managing Authorities have gained significant experience in all aspects of programming and project cycle management. Procedures are now established and efforts have been made in favour of their simplification, especially in the fields of contracting (e.g. Ordinance of the Council of Ministers \u211669/11 March 2013 has replaced Ordinance 55/2007 to ease the procurement procedures made by enterprises and NGOs) and reporting (e.g. OP Human Resources Development has developed a unified Operational Manual for Project Management for all grant schemes under the programme). There have been some issues with the turnover of staff both centrally (Managing Authorities / Intermediate Bodies) and regionally (regional representations of the contracting/implementing authorities) \u2013 at both managerial and expert levels, which has had an impact on the administrative capacity. The major changes were implemented in the period after the parliamentary elections in July 2009, during the mandate of the interim government in 2013 (13 March-29 May 2013) and after the preliminary parliamentary elections in May 2013. In the view of external experts, no specific problems were reported, although sometimes there were issues with the quality of the delivered final products. However, this was very much related to the detail available in the scope of work described in the Terms of Reference developed for the respective projects and the expected outcomes. Major changes in administrative structures There were no major changes in administrative structures within the last few years of the 2007-2013 programming period. The only exception is the Managing Authority of the OP Administrative Capacity, which was moved from the Ministry of State Administration and Administrative Reform (closed in 2009 after the parliamentary elections) to the Ministry of Finance. 8 http://www.dfz.bg/en/about-sfa / ",

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 45 complex approach in meeting the existing challenges. The elimination of the Intermediate Bodies in some of the OPs that had such structures is expected to accelerate project approvals and improve project management. The experience generated during the 2007-2013 programming period will provide the basis for better implementation of the programmes and improved absorption of the available funds (a bit over 60%, as of 31 March 2014 for the previous period). The new procedures that will be introduced will be based on already established mechanisms and are expected to be more effective and efficient. Anticipated future capacity issues Capacity issues will largely remain at the level of institutional development of the new Managing Authorites of the OP Science and Education for Smart Growth (presently an Intermediate Bodyof OP Human Resources Development) and the OP Good Management (a merger of OP Administrative Capacity and OP TA). Also, since the Managing Authority of the OP Human Resources Development will be released from its three Intermediate Bodies but will be entrusted with additional functions (contracting, management, monitoring and assessment of the grant schemes under the programme), it will need to integrate management systems, increase staff and ensure adequate logistics for its normal operation. Since the intentions are for the procedures to be simplified, there should be no specific issues in this regard. The human resources working in public administration will remain one of the critical factors, especially for retaining high motivation and reducing the turnover of staff. There will still be issues related to the capacity of the personnel of the additional actors and smaller municipalities to participate in the 2014-2020 programming period, which need to be addressed. In terms of external expertise, this will continue to be one of the milestones for the success of the new OPs. This role was somehow underestimated during the 2007-2013 programming period, while external services proved to be instrumental in the successful development, management and/or implementation of a number of projects of the public administration and private business, both on the side of the beneficiaries and as sub- contractors for the realisation of specific assignments.

Croatia is, therefore, unique in this study in that it is the only Member State that has to make the transition in the 2014-2020 programming period from the pre-accession instruments to ESI Funds. 3.1 The pre-accession period During its pre-accession period, Croatia had access to, and developed, organisational structures for Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS), Poland and Hungary: Aid for Restructuring of the Economies (PHARE) / Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA) and the Instrument for Pre- Accession Assistance (IPA). With regard to the preparation for the 2014-2020 Cohesion period, the most relevant instrument was the IPA. The IPA period from 2007 to 2013 required beneficiary countries to set up an IPA structure based on five components. These five components were intended to match with relevant ESIFunding sources and themes on the move to Structural Instruments. Each component or programme was required to be supported by an Operating Structure plus horizontal structures such as the National Fund and Audit Authority. Croatia has, therefore, gained considerable experience in the management of EU Funds, programmes and projects during the IPA funding period prior to its accession to the EU. During the IPA period, Croatia was generally seen to be making good progress with the programming, implementation and management of the IPA. However, despite its reasonably efficient structures of operation, the following issues were raised: 9 \uf0b7 Staffing and capacity issues due to high staff turnover in a context of having to complete PHARE/ISPA programmes and projects, setting up teams and operating the IPA structures, and starting with the recruitment and training for EU Cohesion policy funds and instruments upon EU accession; \uf0b7 Handling of the procurement process in a formalistic way, together with a continuing weakness in the quality of procurement documentation produced, 10 leading to a slow procurement process, problems with absorption, and issues of de-commitment in some of the major OPs. The national authorities have worked on resolving these issues. However, after the change of government following the general election held on 4 December 2011, there was some disruption to the IPA structures and to ESIF preparation, as personnel and organisational changes were undertaken by the new government. 9 Audit Reports and EC Funding Reports perused by the author. 10 Sigma Assessment Croatia Public Procurement System May 2009, p. 10.

As a new Member State, it was no longer eligible to receive financing under the IPA pre-accession instrument. However, with only six months left in the 2007-2013 period, it was not feasible to put programmes or projects in place under 2007-2013 rules for such a short period of time. The solution was that a provision was made within the 2013 budget to create convergence funds for Croatia to deal with the transfer from IPA to Cohesion policy funding. 11 Some of the IPA Operational Programmes that were running at the time of Croatia\u2019s accession (such as the OP Transport) were turned into Convergence programmes that were to be funded from these allocations but to be run under the applicable rules of the 2007-2013 funding period. These allocations amounted to around \u20ac449.4 million for Sustainable Growth, of which \u20ac299.6 million were to be funded from Structural Funds and \u20ac149.8 million from the Cohesion Fund. 12 While this funding solution is maintained, for the OPs (or Convergence programmes) that were still running at the time of Croatia\u2019s accession, some of the Managing Authorities (such as the Ministry of Transport for the Transport OP) will not be keeping their role under the proposed structure set out in the PA submitted by Croatia to the European Commission for the 2014-2020 funding period. This means, in effect, that for the period leading up to 2016 the Croatian authorities will have to run structures and programmes for: \uf0b7 IPA \u2013 mainly the larger programmes and projects financed under IPA and subject to IPA rules of implementation and financing; \uf0b7 The Convergence OPs running under the 2007-2013 rules managed by the Managing Authorities that are not designated as such for the 2014-2020 period under the draft PA for the 2014-2020 funding period; \uf0b7 The 2014-2020 period itself, with any specific changes in the rules from the 2007- 2013 funding period now in force within a new organisational set-up (described below) and slightly different lines of communications and responsibilities; \uf0b7 The responsibilities for closing the IPA and Convergence programmes during the 2014-2020 operational period. While the Croatian authorities are clearly aware of and prepared forthe challenges these different responsibilities entail, the transition period that Croatia will go through in the period up until 2016 will: \uf0b7 Require staff to operate in different legal and regulatoryenvironments with new requirements putting staff under additional pressure to \u2018get things right\u2019; \uf0b7 Put staffing levels under pressure unless the Croatian Government is prepared to increase the levels in the short term in order to deal with the additional workload; \uf0b7 Require additional audit and monitoring efforts from the relevant audit and monitoring bodies; 11 Inside Europe www.InsidEurope.eu . 12 Inside Europe www.InsidEurope.eu ",

In the draft PA, the Croatian authorities sought to address these issues through the further development of organisational and legal resources and capacity enhancement. The PA was prepared and coordinated by the Ministry for Regional Development and EU Funds. Line ministries, local and regional representatives, representatives of business organisations and other relevant institutions participated in the process of drafting programming documents for the 2014-2020 periodin six Thematic Working Groups. A high- level government body, the \u2018Coordination Committee for the Preparation of Programming Documents for the Period 2014-2020\u2019 steered the overall programming process. The planning of the PA and the Operational Programmes consisted of three phases: 1. A top-down process involving the planning of the main elements of the PA, based on the development needs defined by the Thematic Working Groups (including those contained in the national strategies), and on the planning guidelines, templates, and comments from the European Commission. In this phase, the intervention logic tables developed together by the line ministries, which form the basis of the PA, were subject to expert consultation. The consultations related toidentifying the main development challenges and needs, the identification of Croatian specific growth potentials, the definition of expected results to be achieved, and key actions that need to be implemented in order to achieve those results. The decision on the indicative allocation of resources and the number and content of OPs was taken by the Coordination Committee. 13 European Perspectives on the 2014-2020 Partnership Agreements and Programmes: A comparative review of the Commission's Position Papers, pp. 63-7, Mendez, Bachtler and Granqvist, University of Strathclyde, April 2013.

The Ministry for Regional Development and EU Funds opened an online public consultation process, which extended to two months (until 20 January 2014), inviting public responses to the presented investment strategy for the ESIFunds. Key elements were discussed at a Partnership event in Zagreb in December 2013. The planning documents were finalised on the basis of further expert consultations and input, followed by a broad partnership input. The partnership input accordinglyinvolved all relevant economic, social, environmental and territorial factors that were not included in the formal preparation stages and approval process of the various stages of programming documents. Special consultations were conducted at the beginning of 2014 with the Croatian Parliament.

During the preparation of the OP, the Managing Authority described the programme implementation asinvolving two layers at the Intermediate Bodylevel, with the distinction between first-level Intermediate Bodies and second-level Intermediate Bodies. The first level will concentrate on calls for proposals and overall monitoring of projects, and the second level will be tasked with verification of the eligibility of costs, on-the-spot checks and sending payment requests to the Payment Authority. Programming for 2014-2020 The Croatian authorities embarked on extensive public discussions regarding the content of the PA and the content of the OPs. This consultation process was completed in January 2014 with the first outputs being the PA itself and the broad outlines of the proposed OPs. More detailed planning of the programmes will follow as the PA is reviewed and revised as required. The draft OP for Competitiveness and Cohesion was submitted to the European Commission in May 2014.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 53 3.7 Capacity changes for the future By 2015, for the OP Competitiveness and Cohesion, the number of staff is estimated to amount to 100 persons at Managing Authority level and 250 at Intermediate Body level. For the OP Efficient Human Resources, it is estimated that by 2015 80 persons will be needed at Managing Authority level with a further 100 working at Intermediate Body level. This can be considered a sufficient level of staff with relevant experience in EU funds to staff the institutions through transfers from other bodies and through redeployment as the IPA and Convergence programmes wind down. This organisational set-up does seem, at first sight, to be adding another layer of complexity to the operation of the management and control system. However, the Croatian draft PA states that the delegation of specific tasks to the different Intermediate Bodies will streamline procedures and contribute to a better flow of information and documents. Most of the Intermediate Bodies have experience in the management of EU funds. Under IPA, the Croatian authorities had already setup a National Fund and Audit Authority. The National Fund, located in the Ministry of Finance, will become the Certifying Authority for EU funds and the role of the Audit Authority will remain as previously defined. The Croatian authorities plan to introduce the required legislation to set up this structure but, as the proposals are still in draft and awaiting detailed comments from the European Commission, the passing of this legislation is indicatively forecast for the third quarter of 2014.

CASE STUDY - CZECH REPUBLIC 4.1 Partnership Agreement The Ministry of Regional Development informally submitted the first draft of the PA and the draft OPs to the European Commission in October 2013. After the official national inter- service consultations and a revision, a new draft was submitted to the European Commission in February 2014. The Deputy Minister for Regional Development interviewed still expects slight modifications based on the comments but also the awaited information from the European Commission. The governmental discussions and informal dialogues are on-going, the draft of the PA has been submitted at the 17. April 2014. The preparation of the 2014-2020 programming period started in the second half of 2010, when deriving the five National Development Priorities 17 in a broad participation process that included a wide range of institutions, partners at national, regional and local levels, and the public, private and voluntary sectors. 18 The thematic scope and problem analyses were developed in a broad partnership process between September 2011 and November 2012. The draft programmes were defined in November 2012 and were based on the needs identified in national, regional and sectoral strategic documents, National Development Priorities, and thematic problem analyses from the partners. Next, platforms for the preparation and implementation of the 2014-2020 period were established in December 2012 and January 2013, mainly the NSRF Coordination Committees and the Ministry of Regional Development Ministerial Coordination Group for the EU (reviewing the materials and informing the partners about events). A working group for the preparation of the PA (including the Managing Authorities of the OPs) and a working group for developing the programmes were established at the end of 2012. A Council for Funds of the Common Strategic Framework was planned, including representatives of ministries, regional actors, NGOs, economic and social partners and others, encompassingfive thematically-focused working groups. Preparation of the sections of the PA incorporated the supporting documents received from individual partners, namely the Managing Authorities, relevant ministries, the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic as the coordinator of National Reform Programme, the regional and local partners, and so forth. The negotiations in the platforms were also accompanied by a representative of the Government Council for NGOs; moreover, a NGO Partnership Platform 2014+ was established, uniting NGOs from various policy areas. 19 17 Improving the competitiveness of the economy; 2) Development of backbone infrastructure; 3) Improving the quality and efficiency of public administration; 4) Promoting social inclusion, the fight against poverty and the health care system; 5) Integrated area development. 18 Ministry of Regional Development Czech Republic (2013).

Advantages and disadvantages of the new instrument The interviewed representative of the Ministry of Regional Development described mixed experiences regarding the PA process. One positive aspect throughout the process was the strong link of the PA content to the national strategies and policies. However, according to the Deputy Minister and coordinator of Structural Funds at the Ministry of Regional Development, there were two major difficulties: \uf0b7 The partnership principle: The involvement of numerous different partners in the development of the PA through several platforms resulted in complex and lengthy discussions, which made it difficult to reach consensus. In fact, according to the Deputy Minister and coordinator of Structural Funds, many involved actors perceived EU funds as an important financial source in a context of shortage of public finances; \uf0b7 Complexity of requirements for the 2014-2020 programming period: There are already heavy critiques from the actors involved in the management and implementation of Structural Funds about the complexity and the extent of the requirements. Although the interviewee considered these requirements to be rational and justifiable, they will result in too great an administrative burden and workload for the actors involved at implementation level. In this respect, one major example consists of the auditrequirements and extensive space for suspensions. Although these concerns were voiced to the European Commission, a compromise had to be reached on the legislative package, and the requirements included in the texts must be implemented at national level. In the opinion of the Deputy Minister and coordinator of Structural Funds at the Ministry of Regional Development, the PA does not represent a revolutionary change compared to the 2007-2013 period. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 58 The advantage he perceives is the greater link to the economic strategies at EU level (Europe 2020), whereas the disadvantage is the increase in requirements and interpretations. For example, with regard to the ex-ante conditionalities, the European Commission seems to require an increased strategic framework in order to better implement the Cohesion policy instruments. The disadvantage in these terms is that those national and regional strategies are still significantly influenced by the European Commission (e.g. smart specialisation strategy). Stage of preparations for the thematic orientation of the PA The Thematic Objectives identified have been tied to the analytical part in the PA. The choice of the Thematic Objectives selected is based on the urgency of the problem identified in the analytical part. The amount of financial allocation for each fund and Thematic Objective was the critical factor in setting the main result indicators. 21 The thematic priorities chosen are: 22 \uf0b7 Competitiveness of the economy; \uf0b7 Infrastructure; \uf0b7 Public Administration; \uf0b7 Social inclusion, combating poverty and healthcare system; \uf0b7 Environment. Significant changes from 2007-2013 In the opinion of the Deputy Minister and coordinator of Structural Funds at the Ministry of Regional Development, there was more freedom when choosing the thematic orientation in 2007-2013 (earmarking being voluntary and only partial) compared to the 2014-2020 period. The requirement of further thematic concentration is, according to the interview, sensible but difficult due to the need for reshuffling and the fact that some activities can no longer be co-financed from EU funds. In the Czech Republic, the thematic concentration results in: \uf0b7 a stronger focus on economic competitiveness and particularly the strengthening of innovation through linking businesses with research and development; \uf0b7 a diminished concentration on road infrastructure compared to the 2007-2013 period. Within the infrastructure priority, the focus has also become narrower, as is looks more at key TEN/TINA network infrastructure. 21 Ministry of Regional Development Czech Republic (2013) Draft Partnership Agreement for the 2014-2020 programming period.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 60 Difficulties in responding to thematic orientation/concentration needs Thematic concentration means that fewer areas are being financed. According to the Deputy Minister and coordinator of Structural Funds at the Ministry of Regional Development, this results in the exclusion of areas and activities that had been financed in the past. For instance, regional accessibility, tourism and local development were important topics that will now be difficult to finance. As a result, some investment will no longer be financed from EU funds, which of course creates tensions with some stakeholders. Progress in fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities Ex-ante conditionalities are discussed in all relevant platforms regularly, and then brought up to the Ministry level. In fact, the Ministry of Regional Development holds the role of coordinator for the ex-ante conditionalities, both within the context of the preparations for the programming period as well as during the implementation phase. 23 From January 2012, the Ministry of Regional Development and the partner organisations (ministries, departments and other relevant bodies) were asked to provide their positions on the ex- ante conditionalities. The fulfilment of pre-conditions was continuously monitored and updated in close cooperation with the Ministry of Regional Development. 24 At the national level, ex-ante conditionalities for the ESIF preparation phase are anchored in the guidance document for the preparation of programming documents for the 2014- 2020 programming period, as well as other guidance documents. 25 For the implementation phase, key documents apart from the PA include the Rule for Managing and Coordinating the PA and the Action Plan for Managing and Coordinating Ex-ante Conditionalities. The Action Plan was established for the purpose of setting up the management system and the coordination of ex-ante conditionalities, including their assessment andthe identification of problematic ex-ante conditionalities, together with a proposal for measures and a completion schedule. The Action Plan is binding for all implementation bodies of the 2014- 2020 programming period, and it takes into account the specificities of individual ESIFunds. At programme level, the Managing Authorities identify and determine the fulfilment of ex- ante conditionalities for a given programme and for a Priority Axis (ERDF, ESF and Cohesion Fund) or a Union Priority (EAFRD and EMFF, in cooperation with other stakeholders). The Managing Authorities must observe the Action Plan prepared at the national level. The Managing Authorities create individual action plans based on the European Commission templates on partially fulfilled or unfulfilled ex-ante conditionalities, including detailed measures declaring future fulfilment, a schedule and the bodies responsible for the implementation of ex-ante conditionalities. These action plans are updated on an on-going basis. Their ultimate fulfilment will be based on an agreement between the coordinators of ex-ante conditionalities, the Managing Authorities, the Ministry and the European Commission. The ex-ante conditionalities are not always easily fulfilled in the light of the Czech institutional arrangements, legislative environment or processes requiring interdepartmental coordination. Therefore, the fulfilment of certain ex-ante conditionalities is planned for the longer term. For these reasons, some ex-ante conditionalities are perceived by the Czech Republic as risky (e.g. risks associated with changes in legislation 23 Ministry of Regional Development Czech Republic (2014) Draft Partnership Agreement for the 2014-2020 programming period.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 61 or reforms; existence of strategic documents, etc.). The Action Plan for Managing and Coordinating Ex-ante Conditionalities includes, among other things, monitoring of the most risky ex-ante conditionalities. Based on the Action Plan, the risky ex-ante conditionalities are dealt with at regular intervals and discussed by the parties concerned, always under the supervision of the coordinator of the relevant ex-ante conditionality to which the risk is related, which results in its subsequent fulfilment or update of measures to achieve it. 26 Experiences with any formal or informal consultation with the European Commission about the PA (and programmes) There had been at least five dialogues with the European Commission by the time of the interview (April 2014). The Deputy Minister and coordinator of Structural Funds at the Ministry of Regional Development considered this exchange as positive, but he believed its effectiveness could be weakened if issues that had been discussed informally reoccurred at a later or formal stage of negotiations. 4.2 Programme architecture Programme architecture and types of programmes The main change compared to the 2007-2013 programming period is the reduction of Operational Programmes. In total, there will be ten OPs instead of 18 as in 2007-2013. The main changes are as follows. \uf0b7 Only one regional OP (ROP): Whereas in 2007-2013, there were thematic as well as ROPs, in 2014-2020 there will be only one ROP (multi-fund OP ERDF/ESF). \uf0b7 One OP for Prague: The two former OPs for Prague have been combined into one single multi-fund OP. \uf0b7 One OP combining Research and Development and Education: At national level, the former ERDF research and development programme will be merged with the ESF education programme, resulting in one multi-fund programme.

Reasons for change or stability There are three main reasons for these changes: \uf0b7 The system was too complex for the beneficiaries and for the management and controlling authorities. The result was a government decision to reduce the number of OPs; \uf0b7 There were institutional problems with regard to accountability and controls in ROPs. This was one of the reasons for further streamlining; \uf0b7 Lessons learned and strategic decisions based on the 2007-2013 period: The government considered it to be strategically and politically important to combine R&D with education (merging the two former ERDF and ESF OPs) with a view to strengthening the innovativeness of enterprises. Main challenges According to the Deputy Minister and Coordinator of Structural Funds at the Ministry of Regional Developmentany change that would impact on institutional set-ups, processes and inter-institutional relations will be analysed carefully. Discussions are on-goingbetween institutions on how to use potential synergies in the future. Management of multi-fund programmes There areon-going discussions regarding the management set-up,whichareprogressing steadily and are expected to lead to simplifications. At the coordinating level (Ministry of Regional Development), a streamlining process for all management bodies was being developed. More precisely, in the Czech Republic, European and domestic regional policies are managed and implemented separately with their own programming documents, implementation systems, rules and procedures. 27 European resources in the Czech Republic are allocated through specific channels and structures dedicated to the Structural-Funds. 27 EPRC (2009) Ex-post evaluation of Cohesion policy programmes 2000-2006 co-financed by the ERDF (Objective 1 and 2).

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 63 In the 2007-2013 programming period, Structural Funds OPs in the Czech Republic were managed and implemented by regional councils responsible for the eight ROPs and by six national authorities responsible for the national OPs. For staff working in ERDF implementation, the non-existence of a Civil Service Act (Act of Public Servants) in the Czech Republic has meant that they have been guided by different human resources documents. For 2014-2020, a methodology is being developed by the National Coordination Authority for the Manging Authorities and Interemdiate Bodies, which will specify the number of Interemdiate Bodies to be introduced, human resources guidelines for ESIF staff, guidelines on management structures, and other measures to ensure that sufficient staff with the right knowledge isinvolved in management and implementation. It will be an internal document. After extensive discussions and negotiations at national and European Commission levels, a concrete table of financial allocation was included in the last draft of the PA sent to the European Commission. Some minor changes are still possible in the consultation process with the European Commission, but no major shifts are expected. ",

The OP TA will be crucial for ensuring successful activities of the National Coordination Authority and other bodies. The goal of the OP TA is to make sure that ESIFunding is used as much and as efficiently as possible. 28 According to the interviewee, with regard to the strategy of the OP TA and the overall setting, it is important to realise that the role of the OP TA within the structure of the PAis significantly different fromthat of other thematic OPs. Whereas other OPs contribute directly to the objectives set in the PA, the OP TA has a supportive character and focuses on creating an environment for the implementation of the PAand thematic OPs that enables and simplifies the achievement of the objectives set. The OP TA focuses primarily on the removal of barriers that might hinder the implementation of other OPs, and it does not have a direct impact on achieving the Europe 2020 goals and objectives of the PA. However, the OP TA will support activities that indirectly contribute to the latter. The aim of the OP TA is to create an environment for the implementation of the ESIFunds that will minimise the negative factors reflected in the 2007-2013 programming period. Consequently, the ESIFunds will be used more effectively, and it will be possible to achieve the objectives of the PA. The OP TA also specifically seeks (i) to maintain a high level of control and monitoring, while respecting the principles of sound financial management, (ii) to develop and maintain administrative capacity, and (iii) to improve public awareness and public opinion on the ESIF. Within the administrative capacity priority, the OP TA has set complementary links with other OPs. Administrative capacity-building falls within the competence of the individual Managing Authorities. The OP TA is a follow-up to the programme of the same name from the 2007\u20132013 programming period. It will focus on creating the conditions for reaching the goals specified by the PA, including application of the partnership principle to partners outside public administration, preparing the 2021+ programming period, ensuring publicity and absorption capacity especially by providing information, promoting integrated approaches, providing an efficient single methodological environment and developing human resources at the PA level. It will be structured into the following Priority Axes: 1. PA management and coordination; 2. Single monitoring system. 28 Ministry of Regional Development Czech Republic (2014) Draft Partnership Agreement for the 2014-2020 programming period. Czech Republic, February 2014. ",

Progress with individual programme elements The OP TA strategy is based on the assumption that the results at the level of the PA would be worse, if not completely unattainable, in the absence of a central coordinator and a single management and coordination system of good quality,as well as a single monitoring system and a high standard of administrative capacity. The OP TA aims to enable and facilitate implementation and particularly to ensure the efficient use of resources that are available to other Operational Programmes. Indicators and targets According to the OP TA Managing Authority, the indicator system is now more sophisticated and complex than in the 2007-2013 programming period. The system of indicators was prepared in cooperation with the coordinators of the PA in the OP TA and the National Coordinating Authority. The National Coordinating Authority coordinated the development of a consolidated version of all the indicators related to TA. There has already been some fine-tuning of the formulation on the basis of technical meetings with the European Commission, and some default values of result indicators are to be based on survey results. Financial tables (i.e. funding earmarked to regions or selected measures) The OP TA is supposed to cover both categories of less-developed and more-developed regions. In comparison to the OP TA in 2007-2013, the allocation of the OP TA 2014-2020 is similar. However, a simple comparison of the two periods is not possible because of the changes in the OP TA 2014-2020. Simplification measures The concept of a single methodological environment consists of individual guidelines for relevant aspects of ESIF implementation. It unifies the implementation process and thus increases the transparency and clarity of rules and processes for potential beneficiaries. This concept, together with associated guidelines, is mandatory or recommended for all Managing Authorities and forall programming and implementing documents, including the OP TA. The main methodological tools for reducing the administrative burden for beneficiaries and the implementing bodies are: \uf0b7 the computerisation of administration processes; \uf0b7 establishing standardised processes with pre-established deadlines in order to shorten the length of the period for approval and reimbursement; \uf0b7 harmonisation of control activities; \uf0b7 reducing the number of methodological documents; ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 67 \uf0b7 setting up and using consistent terminology, and preparation and application of a single website for the publication of calls, information and documentation; \uf0b7 setting basic rules for publicity and information about the support from ESIF; \uf0b7 setting standard, binding and enforceable rules on support from ESIF etc. However, existing monitoring systems at Managing Authority level are not yet ready for the new concept of a single methodological environment for the implementation of procedures and processes that lead to the simplification of procedures for applicants and of the implementation structure. Main differences between the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 programme(s) The structure of the OP TA for the 2014-2020 programming period is similar to the OP TA for the 2007-2013 period. The changes are mainly at the level of supported activities and are recorded in detail in the description of the PA. Continuity between successive programmes is considered to be one of the greatest benefits and lessons learned from the 2007-2013 programming period and the experience of the implementation of EU funds. The main changes compared to the 2007-2013 programming period are as follows: \uf0b7 strengthening the role of the National Coordinating Authority, especially in building and setting the single methodological environment and management of the PA; \uf0b7 strengthening and developing evaluation activities at the PA level; \uf0b7 supporting the fulfilment of ex-ante conditionalities; \uf0b7 focusing on communication activities at the PA level; \uf0b7 supporting the leading actors of integrated strategies; \uf0b7 preparing and developing a new generation of a single monitoring system for the whole implementation structure, with noexceptions; \uf0b7 initiating training activities for partners outside the implementation structure, but which will be involved in the management of the PA. Increasing the absorption capacity is left primarily to the individual OPs, which are closer to the applicants and target groups. The OP TA will focus only on building a basic knowledge of the ESIF. The OP TA will finance all horizontal activities and activities that are connected to more than one programme. All other TA Priority Axes that finance activities connected to programmes will create complementary synergies to the OP TA. The OP TA will horizontally impact on the administrative capacity development of the other OPs in the following ways: \uf0b7 Financing administrative capacity \u2013 the OP TA shall finance the salaries of employees of horizontal institutions (OP TA Managing Authority, National Coording Authority, Audit Authority, ETC), whereas the remuneration of persons implementing the given OP will be covered from the TA of individual OPs; \uf0b7 Education of administrative capacity \u2013 the OP TA will finance education at the horizontal level as well as joint topics relevant to all the OPs. In the TA of individual OPs, funds are available for the provision of education focusing on specific areas of the OP concerned; \uf0b7 Absorption capacity \u2013 the OP TA focuses on communicating the PA and creating the basic awareness of EU funds, with the main target group being applicants who at the ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 68 given point of time do not know to which OP they should submit their idea in the form of a project application. Upon agreement with the Managing Authorities, the essential part of absorption capacity-building was left to the level of TA of the individual OPs, since the Managing Authorities are much closer to their potential applicants/beneficiaries; \uf0b7 Monitoring system \u2013 the OP TA will finance the monitoring system and also all its modifications either required by legislation or agreed upon by the majority of Managing Authorities. The Managing Authorities have a certain degree of discretion in cases where they wish to implement a very specific solution of linking their monitoring system to other systems within their organisation, but in such cases the given Managing Authority shall cover the costs thereof. Impact of the financial crisis or political instability During the financial crisis, there was some reduction of resources for public procurement due to the savings measures. Moreover, political instability was reflected in strategic decisions on the implementation of some large contracts. However, an evaluation of the achievements of Cohesion policy carried out in 2012 found that there had been no significant impacts of the crisis on the implementation of EU Cohesion policy support. 29 Influence of national political structure on administration According to the Managing Authority of the OP TA, the political structure has no direct impact on the administration, because political interference usually concerns only the senior management level, while most of the administration runs independently. In case of any changes in political leadership, other directions or outcomes in decision-making are expected on various issues. Ministers/deputies have differing ideas about the operation and functioning of each department, processes and (sometimes) micro-management. According to the Managing Authority of the OP TA, the expected approval of the new Civil Servant Law (Act of Public Servants) will prevent political interference. Role of the European Commission, the European Semester or any other European influence The most intensive interaction takes place between the Managing Authority and the European Commission in the context of informal and formal meetings during the preparation of the OP. In the words of the Managing Authority of the OP TA: \u2018While the discussion with the European Commission is often constructive and leads to the improvement of ideas, on other occasions the European Commission takes a strongly paternalistic top-down approach, unfortunately without the capacities to discuss the problems in depth and without any specific technical knowledge. This is perceived by the Managing Authority as a lack of trust. Some uniform and rigid elements sometimes prevent us from achieving better solutions, and we sometimes witness the inability of the European Commission to change its ideas, even though our arguments are scientifically backed, whereas the European Commission fails to support its ideas with recent scientific evidence\u2019. The European Commission representatives will be members of the OP TA Monitoring Committee and other platforms within the PA. On the other hand, the Community of Practice on Results-Based Management in the ESF (network of several Managing Authorities funded by the European Commission; www.coprbm.eu) helps to exchange fresh ideas and provides knowledge-brokering services to the OP TA Managing Authority. 29 Bla\u017eek J (2012) Task 2: Country Report on Achievements of Cohesion policy \u2013 Czech Republic, Expert evaluation network delivering policy analysis on the performance of Cohesion policy 2007-2013, Year 2 \u2013 2012, Final version, A report to the European Commission.

Evaluation activities are considered to be a highly specialised matter which in the Czech Republic is not yet as established and professional as in other EU Member States (according to the interviewees) due to lack of experience with this type of activities. Therefore, it is very difficult to ensure the quality of the future evaluation output. Based on the 2007-2013 programming period, the authorities interviewed believe that a better awareness of evaluation activities could be established. It is important to ensure a benefits-focused analysis, not just a summary of general information. 2014 Managing Authority OP TA External evaluators Simplification Advanced To reduce the administrative burden, substantial steps were taken at the national level under the coordination of the Ministry of Regional Development The Ministry of Regional Development prepared proposals to simplify the administrative burden for applicants and beneficiaries in the 2014- 2020programming period.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 72 4.4 Capacity issues \u2013 Lesson learned One of the changes in the OP TA described above is the fact that the OP will be financing the staff costs for all other OPs. This change is based on the finding that the staff fluctuation in 2007-2013 generally ranged between 13% and 21%. In detail, the rates of staff turnover for the last four years were reported as follows: \uf0b7 2009: 17.72% \uf0b7 2010: 20.97% \uf0b7 2011: 16.19% \uf0b7 2012: 13.18% Although the fluctuation rates decreased during the last three years, the moderate value is still considered a challenge for the OPs. The authorities believe that the following factors could be the reasons behind the staff turnover in Czech OPs: \uf0b7 The level of salary was not competitive enough; \uf0b7 Lack of career prospects; \uf0b7 Reorganisation/restructuring within the organisation. Additionally, the fluctuation can be explained by the lack of a clear Human Resources strategy as well as a Civil Service Law (Act of Public Servants), despite the fact that most of the staff managing and implementing Structural Funds OPs are public officials. Public administration modernisation and increased efficiency in OP management represent important fields for improvement. According to an evaluation carried out in 2012, despite the progress in implementation, the persistence or even deepening of several problems (especially the overly close relations between Managing Authorities and the respective audit bodies, the improper implementation of public procurement rules, and high fluctuation in the staff of the management and implementation system) led to a suspension of certification of expenditure by the European Commission in January 2012. On the basis of progress in implementation of the Czech Action Plan, the certification procedure was partially reopened at the end of July 2012. According to the evaluation, \u2018the excessive attention of Managing Authorities to procedural and implementation issues in both day-to-day management and in evaluation activities indicates that a fundamental reform in this sphere is necessary. These problems of administrative nature clearly squeeze out much more important questions connected with the implementation of EU support which are efficiency, effectiveness and even the strategic focus. 30 30 Bla\u017eek J (2012), Task 2: Country Report on Achievements of Cohesion policy \u2013 Czech Republic, Expert evaluation network delivering policy analysis on the performance of Cohesion policy 2007-2013, Year 2 \u2013 2012, Final version, A report to the European Commission.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 75 Action taken As mentioned above, problems of administrative capacity and staff fluctuation have been identified as important in various studies and evaluations 31 . One of the changes related to this issue is the expected adoption of a Civil Service Law (Act of Public Servants) that is to regulate the human resources management of the staff involved in Structural Funds implementation. Capacity issues at beneficiary level In the 2007-2013 programming period, problems experienced by beneficiaries were identified at various stages in the administration of project application and implementation (Interview Managing Authority OP TA). They included the administratively and technically demanding application process, public procurement issues, archiving all documentation, involving more control/audit bodies, etc. The Managing Authority OP TA provided consulting and technical support at all levels of administration. Capacity across the Thematic Objectives 32 The OP TA 2014-2020 is not directly linked to any Thematic Objective or any Investment Priority. By nature, the OP TA has an impact on improving the functioning of the implementation structure, which is part of the public administration and is closely related to Thematic Objective 11 \u2013 strengthening the institutional capacity and efficient public administration. Capacity issues in the past No explicitly procedural issues were recorded that wereso difficult that the Managing Authority was unable to cope with them. According to the Managing Authority, some processes are certainly time-consuming or administratively challenging, but this relates to the whole complex system of managing and implementing EU funds. The Managing Authority of the OP TA believes that thecommunication with other institutions was very good, and not only on an informal level. Major changes in administrative structure Whereas the structures were stable, there were frequent changes within the teams (staff members leaving and being replaced by new staff) in both managerial and operational positions. However, the authorities ensured that these staff changes do not result in a capacity loss. 31 See for instance: Bla\u017eek J (2012), Task 2: Country Report on Achievements of Cohesion policy \u2013 Czech Republic, Expert evaluation network delivering policy analysis on the performance of Cohesion policy 2007- 2013, Year 2 \u2013 2012, Final version, A report to the European Commission; Radzyner A, Frangenheim A and T\u00f6dtling-Sch\u00f6nhofer H (2014) Co-financing salaries, bonuses, top-ups from Structural Funds during the 2007- 2013 period, Final Report.

Three facts were mentioned by the Managing Authority to support this statement: \uf0b7 The core of the professional staff implementing the programme has been maintained, meaning that the experience gained by those individuals in the two previous programming periods will be used to further develop human resources capacities; \uf0b7 A National Coordination Authority has been established in the Ministry of Regional Development, which is not the case in all Member States, because it is merely a recommendation under the Regulation; \uf0b7 Various international seminars have been organised to exchange best practice in the field of implementation of the EU Funds.

The Managing Authority\u2019splan to stabilise the administrative capacity through the following steps: 33 \uf0b7 The Act of Public Servants must enter into force; \uf0b7 An adequate adjustment must be made to administrative capacity; \uf0b7 The amount of funds available for TA OPsmust be defined with respect to individual years and activities; \uf0b7 Uniform rules for the remuneration of employees must be initiated across implementation structures; \uf0b7 Uniform rules for the recruitment of employees must be implemented; \uf0b7 Common rules for employee evaluations and the establishment of individualised development plans (including education) are needed; \uf0b7 A staff training system must be developed. In order to increase efficiency at programme and project levels, the Managing Authorities will commission an analysis of the administrative system that should propose mechanisms to simplify the administrative burden through four phases: (i) calls for submitting project applications; (ii) submission of project applications; (iii) project selection and assessment; and (iv) project implementation.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 79 Positive/negative implications for administrative capacity The following changes are highlighted as positive by the Managing Authority of the OP TA: \uf0b7 Some simplification should be achieved by the integration of procedures into a single methodological environment and a single monitoring structure; \uf0b7 The description of tasks and responsibilities has been methodically adjusted; \uf0b7 With regard to new actors, the changes mainly concern actors in the territorial dimension \u2013 Integrated Territorial Investments, Integrated Plan of Territorial Development, Community-Led Local Development (CLLD); \uf0b7 The number of OPs has decreased in 2014-2020, with the 2007-2013 ROPs transformed into one OP, which will also result in a reduction in the number of actors. Anticipated future capacity issues The Managing Authority of the OP TA does not expect any capacity issues to arise. Everything is already set on the basis of the two previous programming periods. Moreover, the actors involved are considerably more educated than was (and could have been) the case at the beginning of the implementation of Structural Funds in the Czech Republic. According to the EC Position Paper 35 , \u2018the institutional environment and public administration are considered key weaknesses of the Czech Republic\u2019 (p.9). There is mistrust in public administration, the political influence over civil servants is high, resulting in significant staff turnover and dubious outsourcing that negatively affects the stability and effectiveness of public administration. Irregularities in public procurement and sub-optimal functioning of the management and control systems of the public administration are the main sources of problems in the implementation of the Structural Funds in the Czech Republic. Despite some progress achieved in the area of e-government and administrative burden, the Czech Republic is underperforming in terms of improving the business environment (ease of creating start-ups and issues linked to delays in payments; low efficiency of the civil justice system and lengthy judicial proceedings, and absence of alternative forms of dispute resolution). The following recommendations are included in the EC Position Paper: \uf0b7 To build on the positive measures of administrative capacityfrom the 2007-2013 programming period (jobs catalogue; harmonisation of remuneration/bonuses; staff selection rules) and integrate them into a Public Servants Act. This law should be in force at the start of the 2014-2020 implementation process; \uf0b7 To implement the national anti-corruption strategy, particularly those measures directly or indirectly linked to the implementation of the ESIFunds. This process should be monitored closely and be evaluated at the appropriate time; \uf0b7 To reflect on how sound financial management principles could be further enhanced by the application of simplification, better coordination of funds and programmes, a reduction in administrative costs and burdens for the beneficiaries and, for Cohesion policy, the wider use of e-cohesion possibilities; 35 European Commission (2012) Position of the Commission Services on the development of Partnership Agreement and programmes in the Czech Republic for the period 2014-2020, 30/10/2012.

This issue is also tackled at horizontal level \u2013 there are mandatory requirements for putting in place a code of ethics (the example of this code is attached to the \u2018Methodical Instruction for the development of human resources in the 2014-2020 programming period and in the 2007-2013 programming period\u2019, which is a part of a single methodological environment; \uf0b7 The above-mentioned methodical guide for human resources development follows the anti-fraud and anti-corruption government strategy and also the anti-fraud and anti-corruption strategy for the 2014-2020 programming period. According to the OP TA, the anti-corruption strategy is carried out at three levels \u2013 the national policy level, the ESIF level, and the level of the OP TA. Only the last level (OP TA) is directly influenced by the OP TA conditions, which in the field of anti-corruption measures will follow the \u2018Strategy for anti-fraud and anti-corruption in drawing funds under the SSR in 2014-2020\u2019 and its related action plan. The latter strategy is a document governing anti-fraud and anti-corruption in all areas of management and implementation of the ESIF. The strategy is in line with the 2007-2013 regulations in force in the Czech Republic and the EU regarding anti-fraud and anti- corruption. The main objective of the strategy is to minimise fraud in the implementation of the ESIF in the 2014-2020 programming period. The anti- corruption strategy is complemented by the \u2018Guidelines for Risk Management\u2019, which are part of the single methodological environment, whereby the risk of corruption in implementing the ESIF will be monitored and evaluated. For the Czech Republic, the equivalent key strategic document is the \u2018Anti-corruption strategy of the Government for the 2013-2014 programming period\u2019; \uf0b7 The management and control system of the OP TA already incorporates elements which by their nature (i.e. multi-stage approval, collective decision-making, publication of results, etc.) prevent the possibility of a corrupt environment or indirect favouritism, ensured by the automatic control elements in the OP in the form of internal management controls. Following the above-mentioned government strategy, as well as the \u2018Anti-corruption programme Ministry of Regional Development, anti-corruption measures have been adopted by the Managing Authority of the OP TA. They primarily translate intoan effort to build a stable organisational team and the selection of staff according to established rules. Every employee of the department is familiar with the Code of Ethics, and professional training is related to their job responsibilities. The Ministry of Regional Development regularly identifies, updates and evaluates the risk of internal fraud and corruption; \uf0b7 Sound financial management at the horizontal level is the main responsibility of the Audit Authority, which will be a beneficiary under Priority Area 1 (Specific Objective 1) of the OP TA; \uf0b7 The Monitoring system 2014+ is designed in accordance with the requirements/principles of e-cohesion, when most of the documents will be placed and retained electronically on the system, possibly utilising electronic signatures.

        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 83 5. CASE STUDY - ESTONIA 5.1 Partnership Agreement The PA was approved by the Government of Estonia on 25 February 2014 and submitted to the European Commission on 28 February 2014 (the OP was submitted on 2 March 2014). No official comments had beenreceived at the time of the interview, as the communication had been unofficial. Official European Commission comments were expected in May 2014. The PA and the OP were expected to be approved in the third quarter of 2014. A new approach of top-down strategic planning has been introduced. The planning process started by defining the most appropriate development needs for the whole country and ended with a carefully analysed list of thematic priorities. This holistic strategic approachis considered to be the most important novelty, the aim of whichhas been to get an overall view of strategic planning, as well as to better integrate EU funding into fulfilling the overall strategic objectives of Estonia. A centrally coordinated planning process was an advantage on the one hand, as it allowed a strategic focus to be retained throughout the whole process, but in some cases it preventedsectoral ministries from taking full responsibility for the final result of the process. The Ministry of Finance, as a leader of the process, was in many cases dictating decision-making and addressing thematic areas (in the opinion of sectoral ministries). Nevertheless, with one OP and one PA for the whole country, achieving focus and coherence between different thematic priorities was only possible under a centralised coordination process. Perhaps the management of information flows could have been better planned and managed, as the range of stakeholders was very large, and this may be one of the main reasons why the sectoral ministries were not always satisfied with the leadership of the Ministry of Finance. The involvement of stakeholders was better organised than ever before \u2013 the Ministry of Finance had learned from previous processes. For the whole involvement process, a tender was launched to find a company to organise communication flows between the Ministry of Finance and stakeholders. The consultation process involved two levels: consultation on the OP and the PA was the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance (with technical support from a consultancy company), whereasthe thematic areas were the responsibility of sectoral ministries. This organisation guaranteed full involvement of all stakeholders and enabled discussions on contextual topics. For the first time, an ex-ante evaluation was provided in parallel with the planning process in the year before submitting the PA. This enabled the Ministry of Finance as main responsible body to improve the quality of the PA, by strengthening the coherence of the thematic priorities as well as the supporting measures. The opinion of ex-ante experts significantly influenced the process and wasan important support in compiling a high- quality PA. The definition of smart specialisation areas provided guidance to the sectoral ministries regarding the areas with greatest potential for economic growth and helped to focus the PA on those areas. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 84 Advantages and disadvantages of the new instrument The PA complemented the holistic strategic planning approach that Estonia followed in planning the EU funds for 2014-2020. As the PA includes the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, EAFRD and EMFF, it made central and holistic strategic planning for Estonia easier. The PA development was a positive exercise, but the engagement of several different public institutions and stakeholders sometimes added to the complexity of the consultation and discussion processes. Nevertheless, the main added value of the PA can be seen in the common approach to the planning process and in the creationof synergies on a strategic level, as well as encouraging consultation and close cooperation among different types of partners from varying thematic areas. Thematic orientation Thematic areas in the PA are better focused than in the 2007-2013 period. Planning the thematic areas for the 2014-2020 programming period started with conceptual analyses of Estonian strategic long-term needsin order to address social challenges and generate economic growth. Afterwards, all strategic development needs were equipped with a list of possible solutions. From these solutions, the most appropriate and promising ones were chosen and thematic priorities were developed. Defining smart specialisation areas forced policy-makers to find the most promising areas supporting economic growth. It created discussion among policy-makers, academia and the private sector. Finally, the smart specialisation areas were included in the Research, Development and Innovation strategy and the entrepreneurship growth strategy 2014- 2020, which helped to retain public attention and support. By contrast, the smart specialisation areas were not integrated into any other thematic areas in the OP. The success of thesmart specialisation areas will strongly depend on the implementation tools. Difficulties in responding to thematic orientation/concentration needs As the holistic view in developing the PA and the OP was being applied for the first time, the whole process was difficult and produced several discussions. The planning process started with the identification of Estonia\u2019s strategic development needs in all areas. At this stage, no funding sources were taken into consideration \u2013 the main idea was to map the real development needs that the country was planning to tackle and the instruments and ways to do so. At the second stage, the Thematic Objectives were discussed in relation to fulfilling the development needs. This is where the most difficult discussions took place. The main problem was that sectoral ministries had to change their traditional way of thinking; instead of seeing only a narrow range of their own sectoral needs, the whole country (strategic picture) had to be considered. This motivated the sectoral ministries to understand the challenges and development needs faced in other sectors. The agreements reached in the end were seen as a breakthrough, as a number of cross-sectoral objectives were set up, which also requires the sectoral ministries to cooperate in implementing the Thematic Objectives. With regard to the implementation of the EU Strategy of the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR), the PA includes information about coordination of activities, sharing information and avoiding duplication in functions and funding internally, but international cooperation is not discussed. The PA acknowledges that EUSBSR priorities were taken into account during the planning process, as these priorities are significantly financed by EU Funds. ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 85 Progress in fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities The majority of ex-ante conditionalities are fulfilled. At the time of writing, some action plans, training plans and sectoral strategies were still in preparation or being updated. There is an action plan to fulfil the ex-ante conditionalities, which is under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. The fulfilment of all ex-ante conditionalitieswas expected to be completed within a few months. Experiences with any formal or informal consultation with the European Commission Nothing special can be highlighted. The main comments and open questions were normally resolved during informal consultations, leaving the official consultation to focus on agreementsin major areas or formalities. 5.2 Programme architecture Programme architecture and types of programmes There is one OP in Estonia for 2014-2020 covering all the thematic areas as well as the entire territory of Estonia, which isa NUTS 1 region. In 2007-2013, there were three thematic OPs, but to gain better thematic coherence and more efficient management it was decided that only one OP should be prepared for 2014-2020. The main challenge in implementinga single OP lies with the ability of ministries to cooperate in the implementation of thematic areas, which cover issues falling under the responsibility of several ministries. A good example is the implementation of R&D and entrepreneurship priorities (Priority Axes 4 and 5 in the OP), which must be coordinated between the Ministry of Education and Research and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications. The funding plan is agreed and approved by the government and included in the PA.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 86 5.3 Operational Programme(s) The one and only OP was prepared and submitted to the European Commission at the beginning of March 2014. The OP was drawn up in accordance with the principle that the EU Funds represent one-off leverage to achieve significant changes in Estonia. Their use should bring about a shift in development, increasing the efficiency, effectiveness or quality of target achievements in an area, sector or industry, and lead to positive long-term impact (e.g. initiation and implementation of structural reforms and key initiatives/projects). The OP is based on the following principles: \uf0b7 Funds should be focused on a limited number of important strategic objectives, in order to achieve significant changes, and improvement of capacity and better coordination; \uf0b7 Planning should take into account the long-term impact of activities and implementation capacity. The funding priorities were chosen and the alternatives were compared using the following selection criteria, which clarified the above principles: \uf0b7 compliance with the objectives and main courses of action of the \u2018Estonia 2020\u2019 National Reform Programme; \uf0b7 opportunities for international cooperation and value-added at the EU level; \uf0b7 (co)effect across policy areas; \uf0b7 increase in the leverage effect and preparedness for the future; \uf0b7 sufficient concentration of funds; and \uf0b7 availability of suitable alternative funding options. Based on the above, the focus of the OP is on investments that contribute to the central objectives of the 'Estonia 2020' National Reform Programme. The setting of output and result indicators has been a major challenge in the preparation of the OP. Both OP and Priority Axis indicators have been set, but they need further adjustment. The main difficulties encountered related to setting indicators that were sufficiently ambitious and defining indicators in a way thatwould really measure progress. In many cases, the indicators were repeatedly redefined, and the ex-ante evaluation team provided significant assistancein this task. The main simplification measure described in the PAis the simplification of the application process. The aim is to make the application process easier and faster for the applicant. First of all, the application submission process will be fully electronic, making communication between the applicant and administration easier and quicker. Secondly, a number of small simplification measures will be implemented, such as enabling advance payments to the applicant, introducing unified unit costs, and consulting applicants. ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 87 Main differences between the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 programme(s) First, in 2007-2013 there were three OPs for (i) development of human resources, (ii) development of the economic environment, and (iii) development of the living environment. In 2014-2020, there will be only one OP covering all the thematic areas as well as the whole geographic area of Estonia. Second, due to the holistic, strategic approach in 2014- 2020, there are cross-sectoral Thematic Objectives, whichmean that implementationneeds better collaboration between the different ministries. For Estonia, this is a challenge, as inter-ministerial cooperation has not been effective so far. In addition, the lack of sufficient coherence between the thematic areas in Estonia has always been criticised, and it should therefore beimproved in the2014-2020 OP. Impact of the financial crisis or political instability There has not been any political instability and the implementation structures and the capacity will remain the same in general. The only major change is that in 2014-2020 there will be one OP instead of three OPs as in 2007-2013, and therefore the former single political level of \u2018OP leading ministries\u2019 will be lost. In the same light, the number of second-level implementing agencies will be reduced in order to simplify the implementation system. Influence of national political structure on administration The government\u2019s role in the preparations for the 2014-2020 programming period has been to approve thematic areas and funding allocations, as well as the PA and the OP. The government also approves the implementation process and the Structural Funds Act, which lays down the overall legal framework for the implementation of EU Funds in Estonia. Lower-level legal acts (for implementation of programmes and measures, as well as horizontal legal acts) are the responsibility of ministers of sectoral ministries. Monitoring and evaluation as well as an auditing system will generally be set out in the Structural Funds Act, and implementation guidelines and regulations will be issued by the Minister of Finance. Role of the European Commission, the European Semester or any other European influence The European Commission\u2019s comments/recommendations were taken into account. ",

The interim evaluation underlined the following main findings: \uf0b7 there are some overlaps in the implementation system in terms of activities; \uf0b7 the number of staff in administration could in some cases be higher; \uf0b7 the management structure is not always clearly communicated to all staff of the administration; \uf0b7 double-control and reporting is sometimes too time-consuming and ineffective; \uf0b7 the importance of monitoring and evaluation is sometimes underestimated; \uf0b7 the decision-making process is sometimes inefficient. The main recommendations to solve these minor problems were: \uf0b7 to simplify the system by reducing the number of second-level implementing agencies; \uf0b7 to remove the level of lead ministries; \uf0b7 to centralise monitoring function; \uf0b7 to strengthen the different management levels in one institution; and \uf0b7 to reduce the number of departments in the Ministry of Finance conducting Managing Authority functions. ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 91 All these recommendations have been addressed in the PAand the2014-2020 OP. Good practice Since joining the EU and implementing its first period of EU Funds in 2004-2006, Estonia\u2019s most important basis for successful implementation was to havea level of irregularitiesthat was lower than 5% of the whole EU Funds budget for Estonia. The fulfilment of this principle required the creation of a strong implementation system with efficient monitoring and control systems. One very effective monitoring tool is on-the-spot checks, which helps to see clearly whether a project manager is keen on implementing the project, whether the project is progressing well and that the level of implementation corresponds to that declared in the report, and what the potential result of the project is. Despite the cost and time consumption of on-the-spot checks, this is still the most effective way to understand the real implementation stage of a project. The recent mid-term evaluation of the Structural Funds 2010-2013 concluded that, in 2010, 0.0203 crones were spent for the administration of one crone of support invested. 36 Capacity issues at beneficiary level Weak capacity of active participation both in programming/planning and in the implementation processes has been observed especially in the case of NGOs, which are organisations based on voluntary participation, often lacking specialised knowledge in relation to applications for EU funding. Although the situation has improved considerably, the participation of NGOs in applying for Structural Funds support/participating in projects may still be hampered. Consultations with applicants before they submit applications (which are also one of the simplification measures) will help NGOs to prepare better applications.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 92 Steps to prioritise the need for innovation were taken in the recent Research, Development and Innovation strategy 2014-20. According to the strategy, every sectoral ministry will have an R&D councillor and an R&D action plan in that particular area. In addition, The Government Office of Estonia is planning to introduce a training programme on innovation for the public sector's top executives. This should increase the knowledge and motivation of top managers in the public sector, and it would serve as one important precondition for innovation in the public sector. Low-carbon economy (or green economy) has been discussed substantially, but no real actions have been taken horizontally. Issues such as green procurement, zero-energy public housing and zero-energy public transport have been discussed, but the discussions will have to be translated into concrete actions. With a view to improving resource efficiency, this theme has been selected as one area for smart specialisation. It includes topics such as material technology, functional food, more effective use of oil-shale, and resource-efficient construction. Demand-side innovation policy instruments are planned to be used in this area, in order to boost demand and to introduce resource-efficient approaches in general. It is clear from Table 26: that there is no theme where capacity is very effective. This is a problem that is specific to the small size of this country and limited human resources, but it also reflects the overall approach of the public sector of not using external knowledge in policy planning. Capacity issues in the past No significant issues with regard to capacity have been identified yet. Perhaps in some cases, or in certain periods when the support measures were launched and many project applications needed to be addressed, the capacity of human resources in the second-level implementing agencies was considered problematic. But such management problems were quickly resolved. Sometimes, procedures were also seen as bottlenecks \u2013 especially in ESF measures, where small office costs had to be justified \u2013 but issues of this type wereresolved through the simplification of procedures. Major changes in administrative structure No substantial changes have been made in the administrative structures within the past few years. A couple of mergers between public authorities implementing EU funds took place in order to increase resource and management efficiency. However, all positions related to the implementation of EU funds were maintained, and the management and control systems were retained. One example is the transfer of functions of the Public Procurement Office under the Ministry of Finance procurement department. Another merger took place in the environmental sector, where the Estonian Meteorology Institute and the Environmental Information Centre were merged into the Estonian Environmental Agency. Examples of administrative procedures and/or capacity development measures which can be recommended as good practice Despite the fact that they have been characterised as highly time-consuming and resource- intensive, on-the-spot checks are seen as the most valuable tool for identifying the success of a project by the Estonian authorities, given that they help to verify that a project is on the best path to achieving its objectives in the most effective manner.

Positive/negative implications for administrative capacity The structure of the implementation system has been simplified, the lead-ministry level has been eliminated, the number of implementing bodies has been reduced, and some functions are now centralised (including supervision and monitoring at the level of the Operational Programme). As a result, the number of tasks, which are concurrently performed by institutions of various levels (or by various departments) and whose components (activities to be performed in the Structural Funds implementation system) have been delegated downwards by several levels, will be reduced for several functions. There will be no new actors in the system. Given that the implementation system was regarded as quite effective (mid-term evaluation of the Structural Funds, conducted in 2011), and that further efficiency measures have been or are intended to be taken, the implementation system can be deemed to be strong. For clarity of management Managing Authority and responsibilities, there are two levels of management and control systems: at the Managing Authority level as well as at the implementation authority level. Specific procedures concerning application and project management processes are described in legal acts issued by the sectoral ministers. Anticipated future capacity issues The Estonian EU funds implementation system has been running quite smoothly for 10 years. As no major changes are planned for 2014-2020, no major capacity issues are expected. Still, the practice so far has shown that, at a certain point of EU funds implementation, where many support measures and programmes are launched at the same time, the implementing agencies may experience a lack of human resources. This can be avoided with better communication between the Managing Authority and implementing agencies as well as better planning of activities. Secondly, the Managing Authority and sectoral ministries could plan more policy evaluations during the implementation period. There is no strong tradition of policy evaluation in Estonia \u2013 some evaluations are provided by the ministries, and some are purchased from the market, but in most cases no evaluations of policy impact, results or success are provided. The quality of evaluations and analyses provided by the ministries vary widely \u2013 the knowledge and methodologies of the ministries\u2019 analysts are very different. To strengthen the strategic planning cycle and move towards evidence-based policy planning, more external policy evaluations would be recommended. ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 95 Relevance of the assessment made by the European Commission on the status of administrative capacity The implementation system of EU funds in 2014-2020 will broadly remain the same as in 2007-2013. Nevertheless, a number of smaller adjustments to strengthen the functioning of the system also address the recommendations raised in the EC Position Paper. 37 First of all, the application process will be simplified and speeded up, becoming fully electronic. The existing management information system will also be developed and extended. Secondly, the implementation system has been simplified through the mergerof the Certifying Authority and the Managing Authority, as well as the elimination of the level of lead ministries. This also requires harmonising the working processes of the administration \u2013 they will be made more precise and clear. The involvement of national, regional and local partners during the programming process of 2014-2020 was organised better than in previous rounds. The consultation process was provided on two main levels: the Ministry of Finance had responsibility on the OP and PA level, whereas the sectoral ministries had to consult with their partners regarding support measures and programmes. On the OP and PA level, the Ministry of Finance hired a consultant company to support and conduct the consultation process \u2013 the technical part of the process was handled by the consultant company, allowing the Ministry to concentrate on thematic topics. All the larger organisations such as local governments, industry and NGOs were represented and consulted. The planning, tracking and reporting of climate-related expenditure are coordinated for all ESI Funds, in accordance with the methodology developed by the Commission. In practical terms, this means a categorisation of OP expenditure. The 2014-2020 Structural Assistance Act also includes the regulation of horizontal issues, including climate change and environment. The Ministry of Environment is preparing a standard questionnaire to track whether support measures or programmes relate to climate change or environmental issues. All support measures and programmes must complete this questionnaire. In cases where the support measure or programme is related to climate change or any other environmental issue, the support measure/programme needs approval from the Ministry of Environment. In order to reinforce the capacity of beneficiaries and partners, training and consultations are planned (during the application process and project implementation). Funding for this activity is foreseen from TA. This also requires preliminary training of administrative staff, in relation to which training plans are already under preparation. In addition, a Structural Funds management information system will be developed to simplify the application process. 37 European Commission (2012) Position of the Commission Services on the development of Partnership Agreement and programmes in ESTONIA for the period 2014-2020, 30/10/2012.

CASE STUDY - FINLAND 6.1 Partnership Agreement The Finnish Government approved the PA on 23 January 2014 to be submitted to the European Commission for approval. In 2007-2013, the Finnish NSRF had an important role in aligning and integrating the regional ERDF programmes and the ESF programme. The PA for 2014-2020 goes a step furtherbyfacilitating a more integrated approach across the different funds and avoiding overlaps. However, as there will be only one national programme for ERDF and ESF in Finland in 2014-2020, there is less need to emphasisethe integration of Structural Funds programmes. Overall, the introduction of the PA is considered to be advantageous, although there is less agreement about whether the instrument has been used to the most beneficial extent possible in the Finnish EU funds environment. Stage of preparations for the thematic orientation of the PA Concerning the thematic orientation, the following Thematic Objectives were chosen: \uf0b7 TO 3, Enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (40% of ERDF); \uf0b7 To 1, Strengthening research, technological development and innovation (53% of ERDF); \uf0b7 TO 4, Supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors (25% of ERDF); 38 \uf0b7 TO 8, Promoting employment and supporting labour mobility (47% of ESF); \uf0b7 TO 10, Investing in education, skills and lifelong learning (33% of ESF); \uf0b7 TO 9, Promoting social inclusion and combating poverty (20% of ESF). In general, the priority and financial weight given to the three ESF priorities will not change, butsocial inclusion will be given more emphasis than before (funds will be earmarked for this priority). From the four ERDF priorities, support for innovation and knowledge will be the highest priority. Increasing regional accessibility will not be given as much priority as in 2007-2013, and it will only be implemented in Eastern and Northern Finland. The main drivers for change have been Finland\u2019s decreased Structural Funds' allocation and the European Commission's requirements. Supporting innovation and knowledge is seen as an effective way to improve regional development outcomes. The emphasis on innovation and knowledge development also marks a shift from direct business aid to support for the business and innovation environment. Finally, in 2014-2020, \u2018supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy\u2019 will be introduced as a completely new priority in Finland. 38 25% of ERDF funding towards \u2018supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors\u2019 is integrated within Priorities 1 and 2 of the Operational Programme, which are: P1 \u2013 Enhancing access to and use and quality of information and communication technologies; P2 \u2013 Enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 98 Progress in fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities The ex-ante conditionalities have been fulfilled. This took place without any major issues. There has been some refinement of the smart specialisation strategies on the basis of the European Commission\u2019s feedback. Experiences with any formal or informal consultation with the European Commission about the PA (and programmes) The informal consultation with the European Commission was conducted on good terms. Feedback received from the European Commission as part of the PA drafting process was regarded as useful. The issues under discussion mostly concerned accessibility and the possibility to fund infrastructure projects in the new period. 6.2 Programme architecture Programme architecture and types of programmes In the 2014-2020 programming period, there will be onlyone national programme, integrating ERDF and ESF. The number of programmes will change significantly, from five (four regional ERDF and one national ESF programme) in 2007-2013 to one in 2014-2020, although the national programme will have two regional plans (one plan for Northern and Eastern Finland, and another plan for Western and Southern Finland). A single multi-fund programme is considered better to enable the integration of funds, while reducing administrative costs. The preparation and implementation of the programme is the responsibility of the two regions (Northern and Eastern Finland; Western and Southern Finland). This means that both regions prepared regional plans which fed into the national OP; and project proposals, approvals and guidance will take place at the regional level. In addition, there are designated national themes (prepared by the ministries) that facilitate projects with national coverage. The three national themes are knowledge and innovation networks (ERDF), low-carbon economy (ERDF) and employment, knowledge and social inclusion (ESF). The allocation of funding to the regional plans was made on the basis of a regional proposal. The proposal, which was approved by the government, was developed in collaboration with the regional councils and the Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment. On the basis of this proposal, Eastern and Northern Finland are due to receive approximately 71% of the funding (equivalent of \u20ac206 million), while Western and Southern Finland will receive 29% (equivalent of \u20ac85 million). The island of \u00c5land will be allocated 0.5% (equivalent of \u20ac1.3 million). The national themes were allocated 10% of ERDF funding (approximately \u20ac13 million) and 25% of ESF funding (approximately \u20ac32 million). The funding is therefore concentrated on the regions. 39 The Ministry of Employment and the Economy will continue as the Managing Authority of the Finnish OP in 2014-20. Changes have, however, been introduced at the regional level. The changes particularly concern the Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY). These are Intermediate Bodies alongside the regional councils at the regional level and responsible for project calls, preparation, decisions, monitoring, payment decisions and on-the-spot checks. There are 15 ELY-Centres across the country. 39 Ministry of Employment and the Economy (2013) Talouspoliittinen ministerivaliokunta teki linjaukset tulevalle rakennerahastokaudelle, Tiedote 2013. http://www.tem.fi/alueiden_kehittaminen/tiedotteet_alueiden_kehittaminen?89522_m=110551 ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 99 However, in 2014-2020 only four of these ELY-Centres are to specialise in the management of Structural Funds (alongside the regional councils), while the other ELY-Centres will function as regional development entities (essentially as the firstpoint of contact for the beneficiaries and assisting in the preparation of projects which are subsequently decided upon by the specialised ELY) and continue to cooperate closely with the four specialised ELY-Centres. The more streamlined management pursued as part of the reform is in line with the decreased Structural Funds and drive towards cost-efficiency in Finland. The aims of the reform include: improved synergies between project activities and the OP as a whole, improved project results and impacts, more flexible use of funding, more efficient steering and management of Structural Funds processes, faster handling times and more cost- efficient management. Following the practice of the ELY-Centre reform, similar changes are expected to take place within the regional councils. At the time of writing, coordinating regional councils had been named. However, there will be differences between the two regional plans. In the North and East Finland area, all councils will remain as Intermediate Bodies and only reporting and some other tasks will be given to the coordinating councils. In the South and West Finland area, the coordinating councils will also take over payment and funding decisions. At the time of writing, the discussions had still to be finalised. 6.3 Operational Programme(s) Finland will have one joint ERDF/ESF programme with two regional plans, one for East and North Finland (which together form one NUTS 2 region) and one for South and West Finland (composed of three NUTS 2 regions of Helsinki-Uusimaa, South Finland and West Finland). Compared to the 2007-2013 period, there will be increased emphasis on supporting innovation and knowledge, less support for regional accessibility (in contrast to 2007-2013, the \u2018increasing regional accessibility\u2019Priority will only be implemented in Eastern and Northern Finland), and the establishment of a Priority for low-carbon economy. Main differences between the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 programmes The development of the different programme elements, such as strategy, indicators and targets, financial tables and simplification measures, has been completed. Lessons from the 2007-2013programming period were used as a basis in the development process. With respect to the indicators and targets, the development started at an early stage. The number of indicators has increased, and they have also become more developed (or, depending on interpretation, more complex). The indicator set has been broadened with a view to measuring increasingly more developments, but there is some concern that data collection and reporting tasks will become more onerous as a result. The OP was approved by the Finnish Government on 23 January 2014, and was submitted to the European Commission in March 2014. Finland has a long tradition of a relatively strong region-based approach to development in comparison to many other countries with centralised administrations. However, in recent years, the role of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy in the management of EU programmes is perceived (particularly from the regional perspective) to have increased, while other ministries are considered to have become less important. The only exception to this is the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, which may have a stronger role in future, given the focus on the prevention of poverty under the ESF Funds. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 100 Impact of the financial crisis or political instability The financial crisis has had an impact on administration and capacity in the sense that there has been a shift towards a more streamlined administration in order to make economic savings. Financial pressuresare particularly visible in the administrative reforms implemented for the 2014-2020 programming period (see discussion above on the concentration of tasks on four specialised ELY-Centres and coordinating regional councils). In addition, the Managing Authority has reduced the TA budget from 4% to 3%, which is going to affect the number of people employed across the Intermediate Bodies (ELY- Centres and regional councils), but also at the level of the Ministry.

Similarly, weak ratings are noted at the level of programme management and programme implementation concerning simplification issues. No specific action had been taken to remedy these issues at the time of writing. In addition to central coordination, programme management and programme implementation, capacity issues were recorded at the level of the beneficiaries: for instance, difficulties related to the use of the new electronic data management systems. Capacity across the Thematic Objectives Concerning the effectiveness of capacities for the different themes, very effective ratings were given for the theme of SMEs. There is plenty of expertise regarding the growth of SMEs and their internationalisation, as well as on employment issues. Sufficiently effective ratings were given for themes such as innovation and low-carbon economy. Although there are no major concerns regarding either of these themes, the fact that many of the climate change and environmental issues have been integrated under the theme of low-carbon economy may cause disagreements between different administrative sectors during the implementation of the OP. In addition, the strong focus on the theme of low-carbon economy (which receives 25% of funding) means that there will be a steep learning curve for all the actors concerned in order to meet the targets. The concern with regard to the theme of ICT and digital economy, which has been rated as weak, is that this theme is not very visible in the plans of the regions or the ministry. ",

Legend : -- least effective, - not effective; + effective; ++ very effective; N/A not applicable Capacity issues in the past In the past, administrative issues were experienced in the context of limited funding for human resources as a result of broader funding cuts. Another issue was the limited supply of external experts. Given the small size of the country, external experts tend to be limited to a small number of consultancies. Since many of these consultancies have now merged and joined forces, which effectively means that there is even less variety available, the situation has become somewhat worse. New experts are rare, and there is some level of caution about using foreign experts. Administrative structures changed quite considerably in the 2007-2013programming period. The key changes concerned the creation of the new Intermediate Bodies (ELY- Centres). This was done in the context of a broader regional governance reform at the start of 2010, which saw a reduction in the number of the state\u2019s regional authorities from six to two. The new authorities include the agencies for regional administration (AVIs) and the ELY-Centres (for business, traffic and environment). The ELY-Centres are Intermediate Bodies alongside the regional councils for Structural Funds purposes. Another key change concerns the merger at the central level. In 2008, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy was created, merging the units responsible for regional development from the Ministries of Trade and Industry, Labour and the Interior in pursuit of a more simplified central-level structure.

Overall, they noted that the basic structures will remain largely unchanged. The Structural Funds management will focus on the four ELY- Centres and on the coordinating regional councils (there will be approximately four to nine coordinating regional councils), and the effects of this change will be experienced towards the end of the programming period. Indeed, at the start of the programming period, old routines will be applied and tasks will be largely implemented through the existing Intermediate Bodies, but during the course of the programming period, there will be more concentration of tasks in the coordinating Intermediate Bodies (i.e. the coordinating regional councils and coordinating ELY-Centres).

CASE STUDY - GERMANY 7.1 Partnership Agreement The final draft of the PA was sent to the European Commission at the end of February 2014 and was then subject to an internal assessment process in the European Commission. The PA for the Federal Republic of Germany was subject to a fast-track process, which is applied whenever all Directorates-General (DGs) approve of the draft. The PA was approved on 22 May 2014. The PAdevelopment process was very similar to the preparatory process for the 2007-2013 programming period. In the former reference framework, namely the NSRF, a partnership process had to be applied as well. In contrast to the preparatory process for the 2007-2013 framework, the 2014-2020 PA also had to include the EAFRD and the EMFF. This adjustment was challenging for the Federal Ministry in charge. According to the Managing Authority of the ERDF OP Saxony, the process ran very smoothly, all in all, given that all the actors and institutions involved were aware that they were\u2018sitting in the same boat\u2019, as expressed by the interviewee. The PA development process was carried out at different levels in Germany due to its federal structure. The ESIFunds are coordinated at national level. The responsible departments at L\u00e4nder -level define their strategic approach (and thematic focus) to implementing the ESIFunds based on their regional strengths and weaknesses, and taking into account the opinions of relevant partners (including social and economic partners), as well as the results from the 2007-2013 programming period. The cooperation between the different national and regional actors as well as the other partners is based on an organisational structure which allows for the exchange of information, as well as discussing and assessing the PA. The Ministry for Economy and Technology coordinates the PA development process, and it is responsible for identifying and agreeing investments related to the ERDF. The Ministry for Employment and Social Affairs coordinates the ESF programmes at national and L\u00e4nder level. The Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection coordinates the activities related to the EAFRD and the EMFF. The process of developing the PA includes consultations with all relevant actors involved in the preparation of the OPs. The organisation and implementation of this complex system of multi-level governance is documented thoroughly in the draft PA. 42 7.2 Programme architecture Programme architecture and types of programmes In Germany, there will be 15 regional ERDF OPs, 16 ESF OPs (one national, 15 regional), 1 regional ERDF/ESF OP, 14 EAFRD OPs and 1 EMFF OP. 43 The ERDF OP Saxony 2014-2020 will be a mono-fund programme.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 106 The final decision about the financial allocation was not clear for a very long time, due to the complex EU-level negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014- 2020. The budget allocated to Germany for implementing the ERDF and the ESF for the 2014-2020 programming period amounts to \u20ac17.1252 billion (2011 prices) or \u20ac19.3144 billion (April 2014 prices). 44 This negotiation process required substantial time, mainly due to the federal structure of the country. In fact, two authorities were involved in the negotiations. The Conference of Economic Ministers ( Wirtschaftsministerkonferenz ) was responsible for the more-developed regions and the State Chancelleries ( Staatskanzleien ) were responsible for the transitional regions. The more-developed regions in Germany and the transition regions were in constant negotiations at federal level. The negotiation was mainly about the share of budget for each Federal State and for each OP. For example, Saxony had initially estimated the budget to amount to \u20ac1 billion without even counting the inflation adjustment ensured by the European Commission. Then the additional allocation was granted and the transitional regions were freed from the originally 50/50 share between the ERDF and the ESF, planned by the authorities in Saxony. The fact that in the transitional regions of Dresden and Chemnitz the ESF share had been reduced to 23.1% resulted in a \u20ac600 million ERDF budget. In the region of Leipzig, which counts as a more-developed region, the 50% ESF share was maintained, based on a decision by the Conference of Economics Ministers ( Wirtschaftsministerkonferenz ). At the time of writing, the OP includes all elements with the exception of a performance framework and the intervention categories. The indicative output-indicators are still based on the initially planned budget. Assessment will be completed once the Ministry of Interior presents the final decision on the precise distribution of the urban development resources to the Thematic Objectives and Investment Priorities. The distribution of the resources for national co-financing in Chapter 3 will be clarified in the budget preparation process. With a view to ensuring a timely submission of the final OP-draft to the Saxon Parliament, the revised draft is (at the time of the interview) being sent to various departments and the fund managers. Upon their feedback, the draft will be revised again and is expected to be approved by the national Cabinet (Bundesregierung) on 4 March. Then, the Managing Authority of the ERDF OP can adapt the draft, based on the results of the ex-ante evaluations and the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), and revise the indicators selected. The changes compared to the draft approved by the national Cabinet (Bundesregierung) on 1 November 2013 are: \uf0b7 Adapting the draft according to the last OP Template, which translates into an increase in the number of tables and adds to the complexity of the document in general; \uf0b7 The so-called mixed Axis \u2018Sustainable regional development\u2019 has been dropped, Thematic Objective 7 (building road) has been deleted, and the resources have been redistributed into Investment Priority (IP) 3d \u2013 expanding broadband \u2013 and IP 4e \u2013 environmentally-friendly modes of transportation; 44 Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Technologie (2013) Partnerschaftsvereinbarung zwischen Deutschland und der Europ\u00e4ischen Kommission f\u00fcr die Umsetzung der ESI-Fonds unter dem Gemeinsamen Strategischen Rahmen in der F\u00f6rderperiode 2014 bis 2020, Draft, 01.08.2013.

The activities related to the Saxony Ministry for Environment and Agriculture have been integrated in the Priority Axis \u2018Risk prevention\u2019 (flood protection, consequent damages). This change was carried out upon a recommendation from the European Commission\u2019s DG for Regional and Urban Policy and a common decision taken at working level among the relevant departments; \uf0b7 The support of building institutions of higher education ( Hochschulbau ), which are to be based on application-oriented research, has been integrated in the existing planned activities, and the S-Bahn electrification in urban agglomerations (planned activities related to environmentally-friendly modes of transportation) has been included in the relevant activities; \uf0b7 The support of the new planned activity related to expanding broadband in industrial areas and wirtschaftliche Kumulationsgebiete (economica ccumulation areas) has been integrated as a new planned activity in IP 3d of expanding broadband, which also includes the activities related to the support for improving the regional economic structures. The European Commission has expressed its consent for this activity, which is also included in the PA; \uf0b7 The strategy has been revised so as to place the thematically superior challenges (demographics, regional disparities) first. The selection of Thematic Objectives and IPs has been concretely laid out in the relevant documents and therefore systematised. The new allocation of the individual planned activities has been taken into account. 7.3 Operational Programme(s) Case: Saxony The ERDF OP Saxony 2014-2020 is foreseen as a follow-up to the ERDF OP Saxony 2007- 2013. The current status is that the overall strategy has been defined, and the first calls are planned to start in autumn 2014, but some measures still have to go through a state- aid law approval process. Given that this lies within the responsibility of the European Commission (DG for Competition), the Managing Authority cannot take charge of the timetable. However, governmental project applicants can start applying earlier (e.g. flood prevention). One major change is that the use of subordinated loans will be increased and made more attractive. This instrument will be managed in the same way as in the past. However, it still needs to be checked from a state-aid law point of view. Main differences between the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 programme(s) The main changes compared to the 2007-2013 OP are: \uf0b7 road construction has been dropped, and instead broadband expansion which used to be an EAFRD activity has been included in the 2014-2020 ERDF OP; \uf0b7 in general terms, the new OP is characterised by continuity compared to the 2007- 2013 OP, with some modernisation. For instance, while there were three R&D measures in the past, these have been combined into one; \uf0b7 the activities related to improving the access of SMEs to the market have been expanded by including aspects such as product protection and product optimisation.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 108 Impact of the financial crisis or political instability The financial crisis had an impact in the 2007-2013 programming period and resulted in changes in the programme to ensure that the ERDF reacted to the short-term and long- term effects. These changes had consequences for the 2014-2020 programming period. In fact, some new instruments have been introduced, and others have been strengthened: \uf0b7 instruments strengthening subordinated loans and equity capital, risk capital; \uf0b7 strengthening the market entry for SMEs by offering the possibility of combining loans and grants. Influence of national political structure on administration The ERDF policy is integrated into the national and regional systems in the sense that it complements non-EU public funding support. Therefore, it needs to be well integrated into all policy agendas, including those of fund managers and Intermediate Bodies. Progress in fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities Most ex-ante conditionalities are fulfilled in Germany, since most of them are part of the national and regional strategies. However, with regard to the smart specialisation strategy, different federal states had different approaches. Some Member States merely adapted their previous innovation strategies to the new approach without much stakeholder involvement, others combined different strategies into one by involving only those ministries responsible for the strategies, while yet other federal states followed the smart specialisation process carefully involving not only ministries but also social and economic partners and regional and local authority representatives. In the case of Saxony, the smart specialisation strategy was very carefully elaborated and revised several times. It was finalised in 2013. The European Commission concentrated directly on the transition and less-developed regions and assessed the smart specialisation process carefully. Role of the European Commission, the European Semester or any other European influence In the words of the Managing Authority of the ERDF OP Saxony, \u2018the European Commission does not have any influence on the programme\u2019. The National Reform Programme contains only very general reference to the ESIFunds. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s recommendations did not add to the policy development; in fact, according to the Managing Authority, the same issues would have been included in the OP anyway. ",

For infrastructure and construction projects this commitment period can last up to 25 years. In the context of financing projects under the ERDF, Saxony follows the earmarking period provision of Article 71 of the CPR (Regulation (EU) 1303/2014), and the applicable state aid rules provisions.

In the preparation phase of the PA 2014-2020, the Managing Authority asked the social and economic partners to nominate 5 representatives for the drafting group. Given that this has proven to be a positive experience, these 5 representatives will participate in the Monitoring Committee. A \u2018partnership-speaker\u2019 has been nominated to manage the partnership principle (e.g. organise thematic workshops, send out newsletters and disseminate information,...) N/A Note: Depending on the different institutional set-up in each Member State, some actors may carry out several functions . Action taken The following solutions are planned with regard to the main weaknesses identified: \uf0b7 Staff fluctuation: The main problem in 2007-2013 was the significant staff fluctuation, which is due to a German-wide employment law that limits employment contracts in governmental institutions to two years (after the end of contract, there is a short-term period of five years in which the person cannot work for any other governmental institution). This law also applies to employees of the Saxon Aufbaubank. The know-how and experience built up by the Managing Authority is therefore lost, despite the regular training organised by the authorities. In 2014- 2020, the Managing Authority of the ERDF OP Saxony plans to organise regular training for fund managers, Intermediate Bodies, the Managing Authority, etc. on various topics ranging from ESIFunds to data-handling, IT systems (standardised system for all users), etc. These training sessions are expected to take place twice a year; ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 113 \uf0b7 Reporting by fund managers: A central audit group will be created in 2014-2020 to make regular checks and find errors in the accounts in advance of the Audit Authority's checks. This measure should preclude requests from the Audit Authority for a deduction of payment in cases when it finds errors; \uf0b7 Simplification in the ERDF by introducing flat rates: A concept is now being developed by a fund manager, after which this idea will be discussed with the Ministry of Finance; \uf0b7 Evaluations: In 2007-2013, each Priority Axis was evaluated one-by-one, which did not lead to any constructive results, given that the evaluations were carried out at early stages where no results and no data were yet available for that particular Axis. A new evaluation plan is now being developed that will guarantee an on-going evaluation of all Axes; \uf0b7 Communication to beneficiaries: In the past, the non-discriminatory access to communication material was underestimated. A new communication plan common to the ERDF and ESF is currently being developed; \uf0b7 Project preparation: The Saxon Aufbaubank established a call-centre that offers first aid support to applicants. A hotline for complaints was also planned, but due to the lack of an agreement between the social and economic partners, the idea has been dropped; \uf0b7 Partnership: A partnership-speaker in the Ministry of Economics is responsible for ensuring the involvement of economic and social partners in the processes (e.g. organising thematic workshops). The social and economic partners also have restricted access to information on the website of the Ministry of Economics. There were no critiques in 2007-2013. In the preparation phase of the PA 2014-2020, the Managing Authority asked the social and economic partners to nominate five representatives for the drafting group. Given that this has proven to be a positive experience, these five representatives will participate in the Monitoring Committee; \uf0b7 Financial instrument fund managers follow the internal Saxon regulations and not the Structural Funds regulations with regard to the distribution of budget to the fund managers (Article 124, paragraph 2 of the CPR). This led to problems in 2007-2013. Therefore, a new internal regulation was drafted in January 2014, which lays out how the budget is to be distributed to fund managers in 2014-2020. It should be finalised in autumn 2014, once the Managing Authority has checked that it corresponds to the EU Regulations. Capacity issues at beneficiary level One example is the fact that local residents have complained significantly about road construction and flood protection projects in the past. This has delayed project implementation. There is clearly a lack of capacity for better implementing infrastructure projects with increased participation of residents. The participation process requires significant resources and should be included in the project planning. The PA describes the following simplification measures for beneficiaries to be implemented at the level of the L\u00e4nder : 45 45 Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Technologie (2013) Partnerschaftsvereinbarung zwischen Deutschland und der Europ\u00e4ischen Kommission f\u00fcr die Umsetzung der ESI-Fonds unter dem Gemeinsamen Strategischen Rahmen in der F\u00f6rderperiode 2014 bis 2020, Draft, 01.08.2013.

This requires clarity at all levels with regard to any regulations (including procurement laws, standards, indicators and so forth). For instance, in North-Rhine Westphalia the procurement laws will be simplified for particular beneficiaries; \uf0b7 The thematic concentration of the available resources on selected Priorities can also lead to simplifications. The prioritisation makes funding more easily understandable and more manageable. It also results in fewer funding rules, fewer bodies involved, and therefore a reduced administrative burden for funding recipients. The administrative procedures can be standardised and the application procedures can become simpler. Some L\u00e4nder are planning minimum funding sums and de minimis thresholds in order to keep a balance between the funding and the administrative burden. Other L\u00e4nder are planning to reduce the number of Intermediate Bodies or to merge certain administrative units; \uf0b7 Flat rates can now be applied either in the form of standard costs, lump-sums (which cannot exceed \u20ac100,000 national funds), or lump-rates (percentage rates for one or more cost categories); \uf0b7 E-cohesion is to be strengthened.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 116 Positive/negative implications for administrative capacity and anticipated future capacity issues The persisting staff-fluctuation problem does not seem to be solvable by any new rules foreseen for the 2014-2020 programming period at EU level, due to the aforementioned German law according to which staff in government institutions are offered two-year contracts after the expiration of which he/she cannot work in another government institution for another five years. Considering this fact, there will most probably be no change in the 2014-2020 programming period. Relevance of the assessment of the European Commission towards the status of administrative capacity The EC Position Paper did not criticise the administrative capacity. The EC Position Paper stated that, after the reunification, all public administration at the federal, L\u00e4nder and communal levels were fundamentally rebuilt, and strengthening administrative efficiency is aon-going challenge supported by national funds. Moreover, it argued that a reduction in administrative burden for beneficiaries should be ensured, and the following actions were envisaged: 46 \uf0b7 simplified costs (the use of the flat-rate indirect cost system was limited and so is the use of standard scales of unit cost); \uf0b7 uniform and clear guidance provided to the beneficiaries (guidance should be precise and regularly updated to integrate the lessons learned by deficiencies identified; a certain stability in the methodology used for justifying the expenses would be advisable); \uf0b7 appropriate training to improve the administrative capacity of beneficiaries and the capacity of social and environmental partners; \uf0b7 regular evaluation ofthe administrative burden (regular actions for reduction of the administrative burden; dissemination of good practices as a part of monitoring and reporting on the processes within the implementation system; using national or regional benchmarking); \uf0b7 user-friendly e-cohesion platform (on the basis of existing good practices) allowing for a digitalised exchange of information with beneficiaries. 46 European Commission (2012) Position of the Commission Services on the development of Partnership Agreement and programmes in Germany for the period 2014-2020, 9/11/2012.

CASE STUDY - GREECE 8.1 Partnership Agreement Strategic planning for the new programming period started in April 2012, 47 with the involvement of all relevant ministries and stakeholders in the preparation and submission of proposals, in order to frame the strategic priorities at national, sectoral and regional levels. Following the processing of proposals, in March 2013 48 the Ministry for Development and Competitiveness set the general objectives of the National Development Policy for 2014- 2020 in parallel withthe announcement of the MFF. From that moment on, the policy- makers at all levels started to draft their proposals for 2014-2020 in cooperation with social partners and representatives from the scientific, business and industry sectors. Based on the EC Position Paper, the ministries, regions and Managing Authorities responsible for the implementation of the ESIFunds worked closely together on the preparation of the PA and the OPs. The European Commission proposed to group and limit EU funding to the key challenges outlined in the EC Position Paper. In this context, technical meetings and 13 regional conferences were organised in order to give all local bodies the opportunity to participate in the planning process. For that purpose, the Management Organisation Unit for development programmes designed and operated a common information sharing point (DIAVLOS) for data and document exchange between central, regional and local authorities and partners for the purpose of strategic planning for 2014-2020. In addition, to contribute to the process of identifying the critical activities to focus on in theresearch and technology activities planned for the 2014-2020 programming period, the General Secretariat for Research and Technology developed seven different innovation platforms serving as afocal consultation point for representatives from research centres, universities, ministries and regions. Specifically, the General Secretariat coordinates the following platforms: Transportation and Logistics, Agro-Nutrition, Environment and Sustainable Development, Information and Communication Technologies, Energy, Health and Drugs and Tourism. The aim isto create a national Innovation Strategy for 2014-2020 (RIS3) taking into account theRIS3 strategies formed in parallel by the regions. In the informal consultations with the European Commission between August 2013 and January 2014, the Greek Government submitted drafts of the PA. In addition, in January 2014, the third regulation act for preparing the OPs presented the progress of the PA as well as the planned time schedule for the submission of both the PA and the OPs. According to the third regulation act, the PA was planned to be formally submitted by the end of March 2014 and adopted on 23 May 2014, whereas the OPs were to be submitted three months after the approval of the PA. Most of the ERDF OPs were submitted in July 2014 and are now in the process of inter-service consultation. The last available draft of the PA 49 describes the full coverage of all 11 Thematic Objectives as well as the funding allocation per ESIFund.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 122 Significant changes from 2007-2013 The basic change that seems disadvantageous is that with the adoption of the CPR the focus on the 11 Thematic Objectives linked to Europe 2020 is an obligation, meaning that the ultimate goal of the PAand the OPs is to achieve the broader objectives of the EU, particularly those of Europe 2020 and, by contrast, a limited number of priorities at country level. The latter seems to neglect the main challenges that should be met by Greek OPs and lacks the necessary \u2018flexibility\u2019 for policy design in Member States and regions. According to an interviewee representing the central Greek administration, the conditionality on the macro-economic objectives for Cohesion policy funding runs the risk ofdepriving resources from precisely where they are most needed. This is particularly due to the fact that macro-economic goals are strongly affected by the international macro- economic situation. The macro-economic goals therefore do not always reflect the long- term effort to promote sustainable and socially equitable development. Cohesion policy funding disbursement should concern only the proper use of resources and issues of good governance, rather than achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy. According to an interviewee representing a Greek island region, the concept of using the average GDP in 2007-2009 prices as a criterion for funding creates a misleading picture ofregional data. In order to categorise Greek regions, more recent statistical data should be used in order to reflect the economic crisis effects after 2008. Furthermore, regions with special geographical characteristics (i.e. islands) should be considered as transition regions, regardless of per capita income. Finally, the so-called simplificationsin the monitoring and management processes are still not visible to the central or regional authorities, and by contrast, it is believed that the 2014-2020 programming period will be characterised by more complexity and difficulty in implementing interventions. On the other hand, the total funds allocated for research and innovation have doubled in 2014-2020 (8% in comparison to 4% in the 2007-2013 programming period), and there is a special focus on supporting entrepreneurship of businesses and export-orientation. In addition, the emphasis on measures promoting social cohesion has increased due to the future use of boththe ERDF and the ESF, in contrast toonly using ESF funding for such measures in the 2007-2013 programming period. Concerning spatial allocation, during the 2014-2020 programming period, the regional authorities will have to manage 12% more funds in every region in comparison to the resources allocated at regional level in the 2007- 2013 programming period. Finally, with regard to the advantages of the new instrument, the integration of EAFRD and EMFF in the general Cohesion policy provisions is considered as an advantage, especially at regional level. 8.2 Programme architecture The architecture of the new development strategy is considerably limited in comparison to the 2007-2013 programming period. Specifically, in the 2014-2020 programming period, Greece will implement seven sectoral OPs and 13 ROPs, in order to promote synergies and enhance complementarity between various development sectors: \uf0b7 OP Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation (ERDF, ESF); \uf0b7 OP Public Sector Reform (ERDF, ESF); \uf0b7 OP Transport, Environment and Sustainable Development (ERDF, CF); \uf0b7 OP Employment Development, Education and Lifelong Learning (ESF); \uf0b7 OP Rural Development (EAFRD); \uf0b7 OP Fisheries (EMFF); \uf0b7 13 ROPs (ERDF, ESF and CF). ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 123 Reasons for change or stability Compared to 2007-2013, the availability and the flow of funding are limited by several factors. More precisely, Greece has to meet both the macro-economic conditionalities aligned with the Stability and Growth Pact and the ex-ante conditionalities in relation to structural changes in the National Reform Programme and the PA. In addition, failure to achieve the milestones of continuous evaluation and binding directions to specific Investment Priorities with European added value may result in a suspensionof payments, whilea serious lag in achieving the objectives of a programme may lead to corrections of public finances at the end of the programming period. In addition, Greece is expected to receive, in absolute numbers, fewer resources from the Structural Funds (ERDF, ESF), because it has only five regions which fall into the category of less-developed regions, and which can leverage more funds. On the other hand, more funds are oriented towards \u2018soft actions\u2019 (human resources interventions), because most regions have moved to the \u2018developed\u2019 or \u2018transition\u2019 categories. The merger of some sectoral OPs (i.e. in 2007-2013 there was a separate OP for Transport and another OP for Environment Protection) constitutes a positive challenge to upgrade and integrate the quality of ESI Fund interventions, but it risks serious delays for their implementation depending on the coordination of two or three different ministries. Taking into account the public administration reform carried out in the Greek central and regional government in addition to the political changes of the past two years, the coordination of different central administration groups is quite complicated. In addition, in the last two years the coordination teams had to deal with the redirection of planning due to government reorganisation. Main challenges The main challenges for the 2014-2020 Greek development strategy are to prepare within a short period the implementation framework of the 2014-2020 OPs in order to efficiently and effectively absorb the allocated resources. In the past, the authorities lost valuable time in preparing and selecting activities, which resulted in project cancellation or ineligibility of expenditure. In addition, the integrated interventions should avoid bad practices aimed primarily at absorbing resources. The management and monitoring system for 2014-2020 has been included in the draft PA, but there is still no institutional framework to regulate what is proposed in the PA. The main problems encountered in the OP management of the 2007-2013 programming period related to the large number of assignments carried out by the Intermediate Managing Authorities and the complex and time-consuming procedures in the management and control system. The basic improvements planned in OP management in the 2014-2020 programming period are: \uf0b7 limiting the number of assignments and Intermediate Management Agencies, except those deriving from regulation guidelines; \uf0b7 simplification of the management and control system; \uf0b7 a separate Managing Authority responsible for the implementation of every OP, whether sectoral or regional. In cases of multi-funded programmes, the structure of the Managing Authority will use the model from the 2007-2013 programming period. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 124 8.3 Operational Programme(s) All OPs have made considerable progress with regard to describingtheir overall strategy and preliminary structures; more specifically, they have defined their planned Priority Axes and categories of intervention. At the time of the interview, all draft sectoral Ops were in the process of public consultation. The ROPs, on the other hand, were not as advanced. However, the majority of regions had submitted their proposals for smart specialisations and the territorial dimension. Concerning the presentation of indicators and targets, no progress had been made compared to the 2007-2013 programming period. All OPs describe the main results planned in a draft intervention logic, but without any quantitative approach. In addition, no reference was made to financial allocations to the regions or selected measures. The main difference between the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 OPs is that the 2014-2020 development programmes aim first to mitigatethe recession and second to support the country's development through targeted interventions. In addition, the fiscal reform taking place in Greece in the context of the Memorandum refers to cost-cutting and a significant reduction in the Public Investment Programme. 50 Furthermore, provided that the Greek investment programme contribution during the 2014-2020 programming period will be as minimal as possible, Cohesion policy resources targeting development activities should leverage a maximum of private investments. At implementation level, changes mainly relate to making payment flows more dependent upon the achievement of specific objectives, extending the application of innovative financing tools (such as Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas programme JESSICA and the Joint European Resources for Micro to medium Enterprises programme JEREMIE), reintroducing multi-funded OPs, and increasing the efforts to simplify the management process. Impact of the financial crisis or political instability Due to the on-going financial crisis and the recession, since 2009 the Greek economy has been characterised by acontinuing deterioration of the labour market, as reflected in the high unemployment rates, in addition to acontinued deterioration of the country\u2019s internationalposition in terms of competitiveness. The audit surveillance of the Greek economy of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \u2013 European Central Bank (ECB) \u2013 EU, the decrease in public expenditure especially through the Public Investment Programme, and society\u2019s general disapproval of the structural reforms are among the main factors related to the negative developments in the OP implementation in the 2007-2013 programming period. However, in reality, due to the strict control in the Greek economy, the absorption of EU funding was made a binding requirement. Namely, in the Memorandum for Economic Adjustment programme, Greece adopted a system for the quick implementation of delayed projects. 50 Since May 2010, the euro area Member States and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been providing financial support to Greece through an Economic Adjustment Programme in the context of a sharp deterioration in its financing conditions. The aim is to support the Greek Government's efforts to restore fiscal sustainability and to implement structural reforms in order to improve the competitiveness of the economy, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth. The release of each disbursement to Greece must be approved by both the Eurogroup and the IMF's Executive Board. Prior to this decision, the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF staff conduct joint review missions to Greece in order to monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the Programme. On 14 March 2012, the euro area finance ministers approved financing of the Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece. The policy package contains the following programme documents: the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP); the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality (MoU); and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 125 Influence of national political structure on administration The central character of the political structure is reflected in all steps of development strategy planning. During the last three years, the Greek Government has changed four times, resulting in a constant reallocation of responsibilities between the ministries, not to mention the changes in policy priorities made by different political groups. In addition to that, the Greek Government has implemented public administration reforms including the closure of central public sector departments and restructuring into more efficient units. ",

The main cause canbe attributed toaseries of deficits identified in the cooperation between the regional public administration, the central governmentand the beneficiaries. With regardto the political leadership, it is said that there are adverse effects,a discontinuity of policy choices and fiscal mismanagement, a lack of co-ordination,co-responsibilities, and a duplication of responsibilities horizontally (between ministries) and vertically (between services of the same Ministry). To remedy these obstacles, the Greek Government proceeded with the simplification of processes and reallocated the responsibilities to one single authority. The lack of qualified staff in several departments of the public sector must also be mentioned, mainly with regard to the capability of translating the desired reforms and operational needs into integrated interventions. There is also an inadequate number of staff in the Managing Authority, primarily for monitoring units and verification. On the other hand, since the Greek Government deficit has discouraged public procurement, financial management systems haveintroduced the obligation of making advance payments to the contractor in order to boost project implementation. In addition, the ministries have helpedto strengthen the liquidity of contracting firms with a series of measures to enable the financing of projects. ",

Legend : -- least effective, - not effective; + effective; ++ very effective; N/A not applicable Actions taken A major reform took place in the Greek administrative structure during the 2007-2013 programming period, namely in 2010. The Greek Law No. 3852/2010 gave legal status to the \u2018Kallikratis\u2019 reform, introducing key changes in regional and local policies. Before the implementation of the Kallikratisreform, the administrative structure included 13 decentralised regions, 54 prefectures as second-level self-governments, and 1034 local governments as first-level self-governments. A number of decentralised departments in ministries and independent public law entities existed at regional and local levels. After the Kallikratis implementation, there are now seven general directorates (decentralised authorities), 13 regional self-governments (second-level self-government) with sub- regional departments, and 325 local governments (first-level self-government). Finally, the existing departments in decentralised ministries and independent public law entities have been subject to a process of reorganisation. The Kalikratis reform leads to more effectiveness in terms of the central government as a coordinating structure and empowering regional and local governments with financial responsibilities. Regional and local governments are obliged to improve cooperation with the private sector, which should enhance flexible managerial structures that are closer to the needs and demands of the population and more transparent and cost effective. The transformed relationship between the local and regional entities from a hierarchical to a cooperativeapproach could be considered as an example of good practice. ",

CASE STUDY - HUNGARY 9.1 Partnership Agreement According to the website of the Office for National Economic Planning, 51 the work on the PA started in early 2013. In July 2013, the Hungarian draft PA was suitably developed to be reviewed by the European Commission. Hungary reached this stage early compared to other Member States (second among the Member States, after Finland). The EC Position Paper was published in July 2013. In the summer of 2013, the PA was also opened to a wider consultation process, and various stakeholder organisations were invited to comment on the draft both electronically and during events. More than 500 responses were received. In October 2013, the (public) consultations were further extended to encompass the development of the OPs and the associated public consultations. Once the results from the public consultations were integrated into the PA, Hungary submitted the final version to the European Commission on 7 March 2014. The development of the final versions of the OPs was underway at the time of writing, and in accordance with the formal obligations the final OPs were submitted in June 2014.

Expected time frame and management structure? Strategic programming/ thematic concentration PA completed and submitted to the Commission on 7 March 2014. The relatively \u2018rigid\u2019 format of the PA limited the scope for development of the PA and OPs (according to national specificities). There were some weaknesses in terms of overall coordination/ strategic planning (integrating all policy perspectives/OPs) in the PA at national level. The inclusion of financial allocations to various OPs (by Thematic Objectives) left little scope for manoeuvre/refinements. Following the submission of the revised draft PA on 7 March 2014, the OPs were submitted in June 2014. Performance framework Work in progress. Relevant programme indicators are currently being developed. The main challenge is to identify the right indicators (as stricter sanctions are foreseen in case of non- compliance with planned outputs): for more complex indicators, there is often no \u2018baseline\u2019 indicator available; if indicators are \u2018vague\u2019, this would not be approved. The system previously did not exist in this form. The main challenge is that there will be more scrutiny and more serious sanctions if a Member State does not perform according to the planned (financial and output) indicators. The Performance Framework is still under development. According to the PA, during 2013/14 the implementation capacities of the institutional system must be improved through training and regulations in order to ensure the systematic collection of data at programmelevel and projectlevel. In 2016 and 2017, Hungary plans to prepare a self- assessment of progress with the purpose of earlywarning. In 2018, an annual report will be produced outlining progress in the fulfilment of the performance framework. Indicators are currently being developed (likely to be finalised in parallel with the development of OPs, by earlyJune). Project generation / preparation In progress. The Sz\u00e9chenyi Programme Office has been appointed as a support organisation for local/territorial development stakeholders and for beneficiaries (PA) for the 2014-2020 programming period.

Legend : -- least effective, - not effective; + effective; ++ very effective; N/A not applicable Strategic programming/thematic concentration According to the Final Evaluation Report on the \u2018Implementation functions of 2007-2013 programming period\u2019, 53 one of the main weaknesses of the 2007-2013 programming period was the lack of central coordination that would have, inter alia , ensured the coordination of various policies in an integrated manner. As the Final Evaluation Report states, the function of coordinating strategy implementation was missing. While the responsibilities assigned with regard to planning and implementingsectoral programmes were clear, there was no specific organisation responsible for the overarching strategy at nationallevel. Instead, the task was kept at the level of the national government, an institutional level that was felt to be \u2018too high\u2019 to operate any efficient coordination mechanisms. The Final Evaluation Report recommends creating a stronger coordination function (one option being the delegation of this function to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office). The harmonisation of policies and support for integrated initiatives are also identified for improvement in the draft PA. Nevertheless, weaknesses have been identified with regard to strategic programming for the 2014-2020 programming period. The Office for National Economic Planning (which belongs to the Ministry for National Economy) had a strategic role in the planning for the 2014-2020 programming period and the development of the PA (as well as three of the OPs). However, according to some opinions, the overall strategic planning was still fragmented, since the other OPs had not been developed by the Office, and there had not been any full coordination of their integration into the PA. 53 Z\u00e1r\u00f3 \u00c9rt\u00e9kel\u00e9si Jelent\u00e9s a 2007-2013 id\u0151szak v\u00e9grehajt\u00e1si funkci\u00f3inak \u00e9rt\u00e9kel\u00e9s\u00e9r\u0151l, March 2013.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 138 Performance framework The Performance Framework is seen as a new formal element of the 2014-2020 programming, and therefore there is no account of the experience so far. The main challenges are described in Table 44. Project generation, preparation According to the evaluation report on the implementation functions, the institutional capacity with regard to beneficiary support was insufficient. The level and quality of support provided by theIntermediate Bodies varied considerably. Intermediate Bodies could not fully harmonise their support functions with their controlling role, and most of the time there was more emphasis on the latter. The most efficient actors in this regard were the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), which provided more efficient beneficiarysupport thanks to their local presence. Based on these findings, the evaluation made a number of recommendations, including: \uf0b7 Separation of the beneficiary-support and control functions; \uf0b7 Whereas the control function can be centralised, the supportfunction needs to be developed across the country, including the local level; \uf0b7 A formal relationship must be established between the support function and the county-level territorial development planning functions; \uf0b7 The unified support-structure needs to include rural development. Beneficiary support, professional and administrative support, and an advanced service approach have also been identified in the PA areas for improvement. Communication with beneficiaries Some weaknesses were identified with regard to the \u2018communication with beneficiaries\u2019 during the 2007-2013 programming period. The final evaluation report on the implementation system argued that, in general, the institution of \u2018one-stopshops\u2019 is missing from the system. With the exception of RDAs and the VATI (Hungarian Non-profit Limited Liability Company for Regional Development and Town Planning), Intermediate Bodies have no local offices. Furthermore, beneficiarysupport provided by the network of representatives at the micro- regional level was set up relatively late (and the process involved a lot of changes in staff) in the form of the Sz\u00e9chenyi Programme Offices. Although there are about 30 offices across the country, the beneficiaries still have little knowledge about them, and therefore they generally do not turn to these offices for support and information. Financial instruments During the 2014-2020 programming period, there is more scope to use innovative financial aid management solutions (financial instruments). According to the final evaluation report on the implementation functions, the use of such instruments will be facilitated by the fact that they were already tested during the 2007-2013 programming period (e.g. venture capital, intermediaries). Hungary has already accumulated experience with regard to the JEREMIE programme (including refinanced loan programmes, credit guarantee and venture capital) with management by Magyar V\u00e1llalkoz\u00e1sfinansz\u00edroz\u00e1siZrt (Venture Finance Hungary plc). ",
        "Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies 139 The final evaluation report suggests assessing how far these (and similar) innovative instruments can be used in various development areas during the 2014-2020 programming period. Monitoring The draft PA identifies the \u2018uniform monitoring experience\u2019 across various Structural and Cohesion Fund programmes as one element of a \u2018favourable starting situation\u2019 with regard to current institutional capacities. At the same time, the evaluation report on the implementation functions identifies that the way in which the Monitoring Committees have been operating is one of the weaknesses of the 2007-2013 programming period. Furthermore, the report highlights weaknesses related to capacities at the beneficiary level in this regard, and it stresses the challenges related to the in-depth monitoring of projects. Evaluation According to one of the interviews, \u2018evaluation practices\u2019 for Cohesion policies and programmes were well developed in the 2007-2013 programming period. The PA also identifies \u2018relevant evaluations on progress\u2019 as one of the main strengths of the existing institutional capacities. This is partly due to the allocation of appropriate resources (among others, TA support from the Implementation OP) that allowed in-depth evaluations of different aspects of the programmes. Partnership According to the Final Evaluation Report on the implementation functions (as well as informal comments/email-exchanges with various stakeholders), the partnership principle was applied in a formal manner, and in most cases no \u2018real\u2019 partnership consultations took place during the 2007-2013 programming period. This aspect was identified as one of the key weaknesses by the Final Evaluation Report on the implementation functions: \u2018The functioning of partnership is rather formal. Typically, this obligation is fulfilled through electronic exchange of opinions through the homepage of the National Development Agency. In-depth technical exchanges with representatives of civil partners are very rare\u2019. However, according to public administration interviewees involved in preparing the 2014- 2020 programming period, wide consultations took place with regard to the current planning (including public consultation procedures on the SEA). General findings A further area of weakness (according to the evaluation report on the implementation system) was the management of human resources (and human resources policy in general) within the various government institutions. Therefore, the evaluation recommends the creation of a unified \u2018career programme\u2019 for public employees, which would relate to their specific competences, the rewards system, and a rotation between functions (combined with public official training). Furthermore, the evaluation report highlighted the need to strengthen the knowledge-management system and training. The PA foresees the establishment of a \u2018career programme\u2019 inpublic administration (in line with the recommendations of the evaluation). ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 140 Furthermore, one of the factors that negatively influenced the performance of the institutions was the lack of stability. According to the evaluation report, the number of legislative, procedural and organisational changes largely exceeded the usual level of changeswithin a public administration, and this in turn had a negative impact on the performance of the institutions as well as the development of know-how amongst the staff. During the 2007-2013 programming period, the institutional system for support management was created outside the existing legal and organisational structure of public administration. The regulatory background did not precisely define the tasks and scope for decisions of the various institutions (such as the ministries, Managing Authorities and Intermediate Bodies). ",

        "Questionnaire - The Member States\u2019 preparedness for Cohesion policy 2014-2020 143 Background Considerable institutional changes have been introduced for the 2014-2020 programming period (see Section 9.4), and therefore a number of new actors and processes will be put in place. However, the PA also argues that the transition to the new system is \u2018based on the principle of continuity and does not threaten the implementation and results of the 2007- 2013 programming period, but builds upon experience\u2019. A change-management project aims to facilitate this transition. Due to these recent changes, as well as the recent elections held in Hungary (on 6 April 2014), further personnel and institutional changes are expected (although the government has been re-elected), but at the time of writing (May 2014) little information was available on the details of the 2014-2020 implementation system. Overall, most of the resources (human and financial) related to coordination and management tasks are likely to be reduced during the 2014-2020 programming period. There will be no separate (Implementation) OP, and the TA budget will be reduced. New management system of ESI Funds During the 2007-2013 programming period, the Managing Authorities of Structural Funds programmes were located within the National Development Agency. The Intermediate Bodies were organised in the form of majority state-owned organisations, government agencies, non-profit companies or companies operating under strict national rules. These Intermediate Bodies operated as \u2018market-based\u2019 organisations, and signed performance- based (business service) contracts. Furthermore, institutional development, capacity- building and TA were supported by a separate OP (the Implementation OP). The tasks and responsibilities of various institutions will change considerably during the 2014-2020 programming period. The PA describes the principles of the following main institutional changes: \uf0b7 Planning and management responsibilities of the ministries responsible for policy- making must be reinforced in the new institutional system. In order to ensure their professional independence, the Managing Authorities will directly report to the line minister; \uf0b7 At the same time, efficient central coordination functions are needed through which the well-coordinated operation of the institutional system can be established; \uf0b7 In order to retain the current human capacities and competences within the institutions, a career programme will be prepared for the employees of the institutions; \uf0b7 The Intermediate Bodies will operate under the supervision of the relevant minister. According to the draft PA, from 1 January 2014 onwards the Managing Authorities implementing the EU programmes in 2014-2020 are located in the ministries, and regional development agencies are placed under the direction of county governments that are competent in their territory.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 144 Technical Assistance funding In the 2014-2020 programming period, no separate OP will be set up for TA, and the TA funding will be reduced considerably overall. For instance, evaluations are likely to be mostly supported through national funding (and therefore the amount allocated to evaluations will be reduced). Simplification According to the draft PA, there will be a strong emphasis on simplification and rationalisation within the institutional system, including: 54 \uf0b7 The same rules and procedural regulations should apply to the same types of beneficiaries, and there should be uniform interpretation of the law for each Managing Authority and any other organisation; \uf0b7 In the implementation of projects and programmes, stable rules of arrangements should be ensured as far as possible; \uf0b7 There will be an extension of the electronic and online services and a further development of the applicants\u2019 project administration; \uf0b7 Procedures supporting the preparation and development of projects are to be introduced. Follow-up and consultancy phases supporting the increase of professional added value should be built into the procedures; \uf0b7 The sector-thematic divisions that were used until now should be developed by allowing the possibility of integration. Regarding the different programmes, funds and TA a project-based division should be allowed (Hungarian Partnership Agreement, 2 July 2014). Furthermore, the Magyary Zoltan Public Administration Development Programme has been adopted (and updated) as a base for administrative reform/developments and also for actions to address a country-specific recommendation in this area. Simplification is a priority objective of the Magyary Programme, which influences all fields within the public administration and services operated by the state. 54 Partnership Agreement for Hungary, Draft of 2 July 2013.

Some indication of the European Commission\u2019s remarks can be found in an article published by the daily La Stampa on 8 March. 56 The formal submission of the PA dated 22 April 2014. This article stated that,\u2018the PA written by Minister Trigilia will be dismantled and will have to be largely rewritten, despite the hard work put in by the Italian administration\u2019, noting that the European Commission had raised 351 observations. The article quotes the European Commission as saying that the 11 Thematic Objectives outlined by the government are, \u2018presented in a general manner and with weak references\u2019, that it is \u2018impossible in the document to identify a clear strategy of intervention\u2019, that expected results \u2018are difficult to quantify\u2019 and that it will be necessary to \u2018clarify the choices made towards maximum added value\u2019. In short, the PA was found to be unclear, unspecific and not sufficiently results- oriented. It is difficult to anticipate whether the revisions that will be made to the document will entail a reorientation of the thematic choices made. A radical change is unlikely; however it is possible that the regional authorities \u2013 who are not considered to have had a strong input into the document \u2013 might use the opportunity to introduce changes to the document in line with their priorities. Thematically, the change compared to the 2007-2013 programming period shows a significant decrease in the field of transport infrastructure and systems, and important increases in the fields of innovation and the competitiveness of firms, employment and social inclusion/fight against poverty. A criticism made of the document domestically related to its excessive focus on procedural aspects and the generality of the strategic choices, which seems somewhat in line with the criticism made by the European Commission. The regional authorities, in a document issued on 19 March 2014, indicated the necessity of\u2018defining as soon as possible, together with the regions, the implementation of clear and focused strategic goals, of methods centred on expected results defined as concrete and specific goals for development and the improvement of the quality of life of citizens\u2019. 57 The regions also lamented the lack of clarity on the content of the national OPs foreseen in the PA, which obviously affects the strategic choices to be made within the ROPs. 55 Ministro per la Coesione Territoriale (2013) Italia.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 146 Progress in fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities With regard to the ex-ante conditionalities, the Italian authorities have done extensive work on this issue, with a number of working groups dealing with different areas, and with a synthesis of the work beingincluded in the PA that was submitted to the European Commission. It has to be noted in this context, that the European Commission has circulated various updates of the guidelines on ex-ante conditionalities, which made the preparatory workeven more difficult for the Italian authorities. In some cases, the guidelines were also felt to go beyond the criteria of Annex IX of the CPR. For instance, one of the versions of the guidelines included stringent criteria on public procurement, which relates to legislation that (at the time of the interview in April 2014) was not yet in force in Italy. A reflection on lessons learnt from the PA process is probably premature. However, a number of issues linked to political instability have impacted negatively on the process. Political instability at national level There have been three different governments since the start of the PA drafting process. The whole process of drafting the PA was started under Minister Barca, who had a clear vision based on his past experience as Head of Department and as an expert (he drafted the so- called \u2018Barca report\u2019 58 in 2009 for the European Commission, which is at the heart of the current programming approach). The change of government slowed the process down and to an extent interrupted this strong sense of ownership and vision. Furthermore, the last change of government also entailed the abolition of the post of a dedicated Minister for Territorial Cohesion. The following key aspects have caused the above-mentioned instability and delays: \uf0b7 Low degree of political commitment in the regions at apical level, i.e. the regions' Presidents have not engaged in strategic discussions with the centre, mostly leaving this task to the technical levels; \uf0b7 Institutional reform currently taking shape nationally, i.e. the creation of an Agency for Territorial Cohesion and the related reorganisation of the Department for Development and Economic Cohesion Policies (which historically has been in charge of the oversight and coordination of regional development policy) have added a degree of uncertainty to the process, effectively reducing the political weight and clout of the Department in its dialogue with the regional authorities; \uf0b7 Fundamentally, the significant delays in the implementation of the 2007-2013 Cohesion policy programmes, compounded by the effects of the economic crisis and the related austerity measures (particularly in the Convergence regions), have meant that a lot of efforts had to be made, both nationally and in the regions, to limit the damages of possible loss of resources and accelerate the progression of expenditure. Measures put in place have included reprogramming the OPs, the setting-up of dedicated taskforces with representatives from the European Commission, the national government and the regions (in Campania, Sicily and, more recently, in Calabria), and the agreement with the European Commission on reduced co-financing rates, with the subsequent reassignment of the removed co- financing resources to a dedicated (domestic) Cohesion Action Plan. These measures paid off, with a significant catching-up of expenditure, but distracted human resources and time from the equally important task of programming for the new 2014-2020 programming period (particularly in the regions). 58 Barca, F (2009) An Agenda for a reformed Cohesion policy, A place-based approach to meeting European Union challenges and expectations.

        "Questionnaire - The Member States\u2019 preparedness for Cohesion policy 2014-2020 147 All of these factors have likely affected the ability of the Italian Government to propose a PA that includes a clear strategy and makes clear-cut choices. Observers from the regional authorities expressed the view that there has not been a real dialogue on strategies with the regional authorities, and that the process has been dominated by technicalities (e.g. listing types of actions, identifying processes), rather than reflecting strategically on what needs to be changed and how the programmes could deliver such change, particularly in terms of key areas. 10.2 Programme architecture There will be a mixture of ROPs (which are likely to be mostly mono-fund, although no hard evidence is yet available on this); national OPs operating in the less-developed and transition regions; National Operational Programmes (NOPs) operating across the entire national territory; and NOPs operating only in the less-developed regions. The NOPs are summarised in Table 47: below.

Once the PA is finalised (expectedly by 22 April), the programmes are expected to be submitted within three months (i.e. by the end of July). At the time of writing, this deadline is seen as unlikely to be met, but the programmes are expected to be submitted before the end of the year at the latest. One explanation for the delay is that the main preoccupation for the regional authority in Calabria has been the implementation of the 2007-2013 programmes. Nevertheless, the regional authority has also been working extensively on a Regional Strategy Document ( Documento Strategico ), which aims to set the strategic lines for both the ERDF and ESF ROPs, based on rich data and analyses.

In some fields, capacities within the administration, whether regional or national, may well be adequate, but this may not translate into effective delivery of processes. For instance, in relation to evaluation, there is an evaluation unit in Calabria (as required by national legislation), but this has been mostly utilised to assist the Managing Authority with strategy-setting and the selection procedures of integrated projects, rather than for undertaking actual evaluation work. This does not mean that the capacities are not there. It means that they are not effective in the realisation of evaluation activities (evaluation activities carried out in the region have been very few and mostly contracted out). Bearing the above caveat in mind, the Table 48: below attempts to provide an assessment of the degree to which administrative capacity is stronger/weaker by type of actor and level of governance, as indicated by the degree to which processes have been adequately fulfilled or, by contrast, by the bottlenecks and problems associated with given processes (taken as a broad and obviously imprecise proxy for the adequacy/inadequacy of levels of administrative capacity). The views gauged during fieldwork have also been utilised to fill in the table, but nevertheless it should be taken as indicative. ",

Legend : -- least effective, - not effective; + effective; ++ very effective; N/A not applicable Table 48: can be explained as follows: \uf0b7 Capacities in the area of strategic programming at central level, intended as the ability to analyse the needs of the territories and devise adequate strategic responses and clear-cut choices to attain them, is considered to be weak on the whole. At the national level, this weakness relates to the difficulty to make strong and clear-cut choices and to consult with the regions on these choices. This is partly a consequence of the institutional and political weakness that has characterised the national coordinating authority over the past decade, compounded by a limited degree of engagement by the political leaders in the regions in these discussions. In the regions, on the other hand, whereas there is a good understanding of societal needs and economic development opportunities, it is difficult to translate these into operational and results-orientated strategies, partly due to political interference at all levels and partly due to the lack of demand from civil society and the entrepreneurial fabric. Multi-level dialogue between centre and periphery has also been difficult (in terms of the involvement of the regional authorities in the strategic choices made relating to the NOPs for instance), and the communication channels between these two levels have not always been capable of supporting an effective, multi-level process of strategic programming. At the same time, the availability of data on needs and past implementation, and the ability to interpret this, is strong, at least at national level. In the regions, the dominance of political priorities in policy-making processes and a weak push from stakeholders have meant that the real needs and priorities have sometimes been obfuscated or could not be pursued effectively (e.g. leading to calls for projects that did not meet demand, or simply to the prioritisation of investments that should not have been prioritised); \uf0b7 In the region of Calabria, capacities are particularly weak in relation to the targeting of calls for projects and project selection. This is clearly reflected, in terms of outputs, in calls that yield only limited interest or no interest at all, and in the time- consuming nature of the whole public tendering cycle, from preparing and publishing calls for tenders to the selection of projects. A further undermining factor in this sphere is the limited human resources available amongst some types of recipients to effectively deal with project design, a problem particularly relevant for smaller municipalities and organisations; ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 152 \uf0b7 Project delivery, particularly in relation to interventions implemented by local authorities, can be very slow and this is due to the limited human resources that are available in the local authorities. Municipalities are often responsible for more than one project, yet small municipalities may have just one official in charge of following all the projects. This has a negative impact on the timetable of the completion of projects \u2013 and thus on the progress in spending\u2013 but also, and even more crucially, on the project-design capacity and proactivity of such municipalities; \uf0b7 Communication with beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries and the implementation of the partnership principle are also weak or even very weak. The involvement of social and economic partners is extremely limited, essentially confined to the participation of some main organisations atthe Monitoring Committee meetings. However, their role remains passive. This passivity and absence of explicit demand to be involved makes it difficult for the regional authority to be proactive. That is, it is extremely difficult to mobilise civil society and horizontal partners, for example by way of seminars, discussion meetings and other events intended to foster a dialogue between different stakeholders and the administration. This is in essence a vicious circle, which is difficult to overcome, and which goes beyond the mere scope of Cohesion policy; \uf0b7 Multi-level communication, particularly between the national government and the regional authority, has not been straightforward either. The setting-up of a task force was a direct response to the need to find more effective ways to channel information both upstream (especially from the regional authority to the national government) and downstream (from the national government to the regional authority), as well as to support the regional authority with the management and delivery of the programmes. However, in some areas improvements can be reported upon, such asthe new system of controls introduced in the 2007-2013 programming period (anaspect that is included under 'financial management'in Table 48: above). This was an area of weakness in the region, which had major difficulties with the first-level controls and had its payments suspended for two years. 61 As a consequence, substantial investments were made to strengthen the control procedures, to the point that the region has now become a reference point for other regions in this field. Some important nuances need to be added to the above analysis. The problem in the region of Calabria, and possibly also in other regions of the Mezzogiorno, is not just one of administrative capacity (which is weak beyond Cohesion policy and at different levels of government, regional and sub-regional), but is a wider problem of societal weakness. The entrepreneurial fabric, the network of local authorities, the universities located in the region and civil society at large are all weak. All of these elements need to be strengthened in order for the regional authority to have interlocutors that are demanding in terms of development and able to inform the strategic choices to be made. 61 This has been an area of difficulty for other regions too. For instance, the region of Puglia had c. \u20ac80 million withdrawn from its 2000-06 allocations because of ineffective audit and control procedures, which caused \u2018grave deficits and systemic irregularities\u2019. ",
        "Questionnaire - The Member States\u2019 preparedness for Cohesion policy 2014-2020 153 Furthermore, administrative capacity has been hampered by political disinterest (on macro- strategic choices) and at the same time political interference (on micro, allocative choices). These factors mean that, in terms of policy responses, it is the distribution of competencies and the task divisionthat needs to be changed, and therefore a simple increase in the number of civil servantsor improvements made in the training they receive is not sufficient. Administrative capacity is of course important, and it is a crucial factor across the board for a region such as Calabria (i.e. beyond Cohesion policy), but it is not the only factor to be taken into consideration. A wider challenge, which is not directly related to the specific theme of administrative capacity, is the availability of domestic funding for both co- financing and ordinary investments, which is nevertheless instrumental for allowing Cohesion policy to achieve its objectives. 10.5 Capacity changes for the future Looking to the future, according to the interviewee, when the 2014-2020 programmes will be launched, the main aspect that will have been strengthened in terms of administrative capacity at the regional level will be the ability to track and audit Cohesion policy expenditure. This is an area where considerable improvements have been made over the past few years, with dedicated investments in the design of procedures and training of officials. The regional Managing Authority now has a very advanced control system, and the intention is to extend it beyond the ERDF programme and mainstream it across the regional administration for all regional expenditure and policies. On the other hand, a major challenge will be, to use the words of a regional official interviewee, \u2018to issue calls for projects that will not be left deserted\u2019. That is, to identify the specific needs of the entrepreneurial fabric, for example, and address these with adequate instruments. In essence, there is still a need to improve the ability of the regional authority to interact with the territories and to improve the communication channels available to local stakeholders to dialogue with the regional authority, in order to allow for a more responsive process of elicitation of needs. Another problem that still needs to be addressed is the efficiency of the regional offices in charge of issuing and dealing with calls for projects. Timetables for these procedures are still by and large too long, particularly for infrastructure projects that involve local authorities. The adequacy of administrative capacities has been a theme that the DGs responsible for Cohesion policy within the European Commission \u2013 DG Regional and Urban Policy, and DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion \u2013 have increasingly insisted upon, not least in the light of the poor spending performance of the 2007-2013 programmes. At the beginning of April 2014, the two DGs sent a letter to the national government and to all the regional Managing Authorities, asking them to provide as soon as possible some \u2018Administrative Strengthening Plans\u2019, which should indicate the available resources and their competencies, and demonstrate that these are adequate to allow the programmes to be implemented according to plan and towards the desired results. These plans are supposed to be slim documents (of c. 10 pages), which should include: (i) a reappraisal of the competences and skills of all the staff in charge of functions related to the management and delivery of the programmes (i.e. a reappraisal of the CVs of such staff); (ii) demonstration that the conditions are in place to guarantee timely implementation; (iii) evidence that some key \u2018horizontal functions\u2019 are being strengthened (e.g. financial procedures and control systems, IT and data management systems, legislative simplification); (iv) illustration of how transparency on every aspect of the OPs will be assured; and (v) the identification of the person responsible for administrative capacity.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 154 This letter will be followed by a joint document, signed by the European Commission and the Italian Ministry for Economic Development, Department for Development and Economic Cohesion Policies, providing a template for the Plans. The Plans will have to be submitted to the Euopean Commission at the same time as the OPs. 62 As far as the number of staff dedicated to or involved in the implementation of the programmes is concerned, when fieldwork was carried out, no indication emerged as to an intention to increase the number of actors employed for different types of tasks (although the regional evaluation unit has recently been strengthened with a few additional colleagues). This would be an ambition difficult to fulfil, given the austerity measures and the freeze on public sector employment. This may change, however, as a result of submission and negotiation (presumably) of the above-mentioned Administrative Strengthening Plans. 62 Chiellino G (2014) Il diktat Ue per salvare I fondi , in Il Sole 24 Ore, 4 April 2014.

CASE STUDY - LUXEMBOURG 11.2 Partnership Agreement The first draft of the PA was presented to the European Commission in September 2013 for inter-service consultation. The European Commission\u2019s comments and recommendations on the draft were received almost five months later, in late February 2014. Although the comments mainly consisted of requests for more information and detail, this resulted in significant amounts of work for the authors of the PA. The PA was being finalised at the time of the interview and actual submission took place on 30 April 2014. The PA represents an unnecessary additional workload, according to the interviewees, given that the regional level equals to the national territorial level due to the small size of the country. Since there will be only one OP for each ESIFund, the PA is merely a sum of all OPs and therefore seems like repetitive work. According to the interviewee (responsible for Structural Funds at the Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade, Managing Authority of the ERDF OP), there is no \u2018cost-benefit balance\u2019 in the sense that the financial envelope is too small compared to the administrative burden. The responsible authorities do not consider the PA to be advantageous. Stage of preparations for the thematic orientation of the PA The PA was developed in a partnership process that included the Managing Authorities of the ERDF, ESF and EAFRD programmes, the economic and social partners, and civil society. With a view to coordinating the Managing Authorities, a committee was created that was coordinated by the ERDF Managing Authority (Directorate of Regional Policy at the Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade). The PA process included regular meetings of the committee from 17 December 2012. The Committee included the following bodies: \uf0b7 Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade, Managing Authority of the ERDF OP; \uf0b7 Ministry of Labour, Employment and the Social and Solidarity Economy, Managing Authority of the ESF OP; \uf0b7 Ministry of Agriculture, Viticulture and Rural Development, Managing Authority of the EAFRD OP; \uf0b7 Ministry of Sustainable Development and Infrastructure, responsible for the programmes INTERREG B and C, ESPON, URBACT and INTERACT; \uf0b7 Ministry for the Interior, responsible for the INTERREG A programme of the Greater Region. In addition to the ministries listed above, other ministries as well as external partners were consulted through a double approach of \u2018bottom-up\u2019 and \u2018top-down\u2019. The list of the partners consulted is included in the PA. 63 The regular meetings and workshops organised were interactive, according to the PA, with a view to promoting informative and consultative development. The Managing Authorities ensured that the partners involved were informed at least one month in advance in order to leave sufficient time to draw up recommendations. 63 Le Gouvernement du Grand Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg (2013), Accord de partenariat entre le Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg et la Commission europ\u00e9enne relatif aux Fonds relevant du cadre strat\u00e9gique commun pour la p\u00e9riode de programmation 2014-2020, Version provisoire, 26 septembre 2013, p. 25.

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 156 In the 2007-2013 programming period, the ERDF OP had two Priority Axes, namely \u2018Axis 1: Attractiveness for investment and jobs\u2019, and \u2018Axis 2: Knowledge and innovation\u2019. The ERDF funds were mostly concentrated on the policy areas of \u2018enterprise environment and RTDI\u2019 and \u2018environment and energy\u2019 (renewable energy sources and energy efficiency management). The share of ERDF resources spent on energy-related activities exceeded the resources planned in the OP (9% planned in 2007; 26% spent in 2011). Concentrating 80% of the ERDF on innovation, competitiveness and energy, as required by the ERDF Regulation, has not been considered problematic for Luxembourg, because the 2007-2013 ERDF interventions already concentrated on these objectives. 64 In fact, Luxembourg wanted to maintain continuity and stability between the 2007-2013 period and the 2014-2020 programming period (with regard to the management set-up and also thematically). Seven Thematic Objectives were selected based on the territorial analysis carried out in the framework of developing the PA, namelyTOs 1 (Research and innovation), 3 (SMEs), 4 (Low-carbon economy), 6 (Environmental protection and resource efficiency), 8 (Employment and labour mobility), 9 (Social inclusion and combating poverty) and 10 (Education, skills and lifelong learning). 65 However, the European Commission required the OPs to be even more thematically focused. As a result, the management of industrial sites had to be dropped from the OP. In other words, while the PA and the 2014-2020 OP had been planned to be consistent with their predecessors, after months of waiting for the European Commission\u2019s feedback, the number of Thematic Objectives had to be reduced.

        "Questionnaire - The Member States\u2019 preparedness for Cohesion policy 2014-2020 157 Progress in fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities The EC Position Paper and the Council recommendations were integrated in the first draft of the PA (September 2013). In that document, the ex-ante evaluators concluded that the selection of Thematic Objectives was coherent and corresponded to the development needs of Luxembourg. By contrast, the coherence between the programmes and the country- specific recommendations were criticised, because the interventions of the Funds were only partially relevant to Annex I of the Common Provision Regulation (in the budgetary and fiscal areas, salary and pension reforms); nevertheless, they were confirmed to contribute to the reduction of youth unemployment (ESF), the support of Research, Technolgy Development and Innovation (RTDI), and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (ERDF and EAFRD). The first versions of these strategies had to be consolidated by establishing a clearer link between the strategic choices and the challenges identified by taking into account the relevant existing national measures. The internal coherence of the programmes was characterised as particularly high, with measures also contributing to the achievement of objectives other than the ones for which they were foreseen. 66 The ex-ante conditionalities were fulfilled and are being revised for the new version of the PAin a timely manner. Experiences with any formal or informal consultation with the European Commission about the PA (and programmes) The first contact with the European Commission with regard to the PA was made in July 2013. After the first draft of the PA was submitted in September 2013, the Commission sent 10 pages of comments and recommendations to the Ministry in February 2014. On 13 February 2014, European Commission representatives came to Luxembourg to discuss the next draft of the PA. The contact was very professional, but the process was seen as lengthy and inefficient by the authorities from the Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade due to the need to revise the documents to a large extent and the associated administrative burden. 11.3 Programme architecture Programme architecture and types of programmes There have been no changes in the programme architecture in Luxembourg. There will be three programmes in Luxembourg, with no multi-fund OPs: \uf0b7 ERDF OP 2014-2020 (Investment for Growth and Jobs); \uf0b7 ESF OP 2014-2020 (Investment for Growth and Jobs); \uf0b7 EAFRD OP 2014-2020. The representatives from the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade explained that the reason for the absence of any changesis\u2018continuity and stability\u2019. If they had mixed or combined the funds, there would have been too many complications with regard to inter- ministerial coordination. By leaving the OPs separate, the same experienced persons responsible for their management and implementation could continue carrying out their activities. In fact, no major changes are foreseen in the management team either. The programme implementation seems to have been efficient in the past with regard to progress in implementation and the absorption rate as confirmed by several sources. 67 66 Le Gouvernement du Grand Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg (2013), Accord de partenariat entre le Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg et la Commission europ\u00e9enne relatif aux Fonds relevant du cadre strat\u00e9gique commun pour la p\u00e9riode de programmation 2014-2020, Version provisoire, 26 septembre 2013. 67 See for instance: http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/evaluation/pdf/eval2007/country_reports/luxemburg.pd f or http://www.eprc.strath.ac.uk/iqnet/downloads/IQ-Net_Reports(Public)/ReviewPaper29(1)Final.pdf.

Based on governmental decisions, the ESF will be allocated slightly more resources than the ERDF. More precisely, the ERDF will be allocated \u20ac19.5 million and the ESF will be allocated \u20ac20.1 million. 11.4 Operational Programme(s) Progress with individual programme elements The ERDF OP 2014-2020 was being prepared at the time of the interview, including its overall strategy, which will be a continuation of the 2007-2013 OP but more thematically concentrated (dropping the measure of \u2018Transformation of the south of Luxembourg into a second economic centre by redeveloping vacant industrial sites\u2019 from the OP). By limiting the ERDF intervention areas to only two Thematic Objectives, the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade hoped to reach some simplification. In fact, this also implied that there would be fewer indicators and ex-ante conditionalities to fulfil. The OP was to be sent to the European Commission before the summer of 2014. Main differences between the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 programme(s) The three main priority areas of the 2007-2013 ERDF programme were: (i) Innovation and growth economy, (ii) Environment and risk prevention, and (iii) ICT. As mentioned above, the ERDF OP 2014-2020 will differ from the 2007-2013 OP in that it will be thematically more focused. Impact of the financial crisis or political instability Although the macro-economic situation in Luxembourg has deteriorated due to the economic crisis that started in 2007/2008, as in other EU countries, 69 neither the financial crisis nor political instability has any impact on administration or capacity, according to the representatives of the Ministry. 70 Influence of national political structure on administration Regional policy is administered centrally by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, without direct involvement of sub-national government levels. 71 The management and implementation structures of the ERDF are strongly bound to the established national structures of the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade. The Managing Authority of the ERDF Programme is located in the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade (Directorate for Regional Policy). 68 Lacave (2013) Expert evaluation network delivering policy analyses of the performance of Cohesion policy 2007-2013, Year 2 -2012, Task 2: Country Report on Achievements of Cohesion policy Luxembourg; Final Version, A report to the European Commission DG REGIO; Technopolis. 69 Lacave (2013) Expert evaluation network delivering policy analyses of the performance of Cohesion policy 2007-2013, Year 2 -2012, Task 2: Country Report on Achievements of Cohesion policy Luxembourg; Final Version, A report to the European Commission DG REGIO; Technopolis. 70 See for instance: T\u00f6dtling-Sch\u00f6nhofer et al.

The Audit Authority is also located within the Ministry of Finance. TA staff within the Managing Authority plays a crucial role in day-to-day programme management. Processes are straightforward and streamlined. 72 The nature and objectives of regional policy are determined by the small size of the economy and the country. As a result, regional policy is largely identical with national industrial and economic policy. Moreover, Human resources management in ERDF implementation is integrated in the public administration structures. The number of persons involved in Structural Funds management is very small. According to the interviewees, the consultation processes and all other strategy and policy-development processes are very efficient due to the small size of structures. TA is used to ensure the smooth operation of the programme, by giving the Managing Authority the resources to guarantee successful management of the programme throughout the implementation phase and to comply with the European Commission\u2019s various data-exchange and transmission requirements. Moreover, TA co-finances the staff costs of the persons involved in managing and implementing the ERDF. Role of the European Commission, the European Semester or any other European influence The process of finalising the PA and the OP is difficult and lengthy, mainly due to the belated response and feedback from the European Commission, but the exchange has been professional, according to the interviewees.

The TA team amounts to merely three members (Full-Time Equivalent), of which one is an economist, another is a legal officer, and the third is an administrative and financial assistant. 73 According to an interview with the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade in a different study, the high level of staff turnover is a persisting challenge for the ERDF OP management and implementation, and it is likely to be due to a lack of career prospects as well as the termination of contracts with limited duration. However, given that only two contractual agents are co-financed by the ERDF, this implies that most work is carried out by the civil servants at the Ministry. Also, the authorities report that there is no demand but also no time and resources to carry out any training. In sum, although the administration seems to be well established, programme management faces a few persisting human resource challenges. However, according to the interviewees, the administrative burden in 2007-2013 was manageable compared to what is foreseen in the 2014-2020 programming period. \uf0b7 Human resources: According to the PA, the role of the ERDF the Managing Authorityis carried out by a high-ranking civil servant with a team of officials with adequate professional experience. With a view to supporting the Managing Authority and carrying out communication and information activities, a TA team is in place. The TA activities are co-financed by the ERDF and ESF. The TA team is led by the Managing Authority and is composed of three policy assistants. The PA mentions explicitly that these available human resources are limited compared to the demands for the 2014-2020 programming period. 74 ; \uf0b7 Reporting requirements: There will be more reports to be delivered to the European Commission, the performance framework is a novelty, and the Managing Authority is expected to reply to a number of requests (from the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Court of Auditors, national administration reports, etc.), which are highly time-intensive activities; \uf0b7 E-cohesion: Each Member State is requested to carry out e-cohesion, and an automatic system of data transmission will have to be established. However, according to the Managing Authorities, the financial resources allocated to Luxembourg are considered to be limited with regard to financing a new electronic system. The costs that come with these changes are not in proportion to the financial resources available and the benefits to be gained. The financial resources have been reduced to a degree where a joint support system between the ERDF and the ESF in Luxembourg has become debatable. 73 Autorit\u00e9 de Gestion FEDER 2007-2013 (2013) Programme Op\u00e9rationnel FEDER 2007-2013 Comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 et Emploi, Rapport annuel d\u2019ex\u00e9cution 2012 \u2013 Version approuv\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 de Suivi le 23 mai 2013. 74 Le Gouvernement du Grand Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg (2013) Accord de partenariat entre le Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg et la Commission europ\u00e9enne relatif aux Fonds relevant du cadre strat\u00e9gique commun pour la p\u00e9riode de programmation 2014-2020, Version provisoire, 26 septembre 2013.

The administration is so small, that the representatives interviewed mentioned that they are even acquainted with all the project representatives. Action taken to address weaknesses in capacity The interviewees did not identify any areas in which capacity could be considered to be weak, because in the 2007-2013 programming period the tasks were manageable. However, according to a different study, 75 no measures are in place to support the professional (skills) development of ERDF co-financed staff. This is due to a lack of financial resources as well as a lack of time due to the heavy workload, according to an interview with the Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade in the aforementioned study. Professional training is provided only when it is really needed and estimated as essential within the Structural Funds. Good practice In the 2007-2013 programming period, the Managing Authority sent questionnaires to the beneficiaries about their satisfaction with the management and coordination. These surveys revealed increasingly better results each time. This client satisfaction survey is in line with the ISO9001:2008 requirements. The interviewees identified two projects in the field of low-carbon economy as examples of particularly \u2018excellent\u2019 quality. The first project comprised the construction of a bio- composting facility in the south of Luxembourg to generate energy. The construction was carried out by engineers from German and Czech firms, and the coordination, management and implementation of this project ran very smoothly. The second project, which was also implemented efficiently, related to generating renewable energy by building briquettes out of mud. 75 Radzyner A, Frangenheim A and T\u00f6dtling-Sch\u00f6nhofer H (2014) Co-financing salaries, bonuses, top-ups from Structural Funds during the 2007-2013 period, Final Report.

The main administrative tasks faced by beneficiaries receiving financing under each of the three funds are: 76 \uf0b7 Obtaining and sending the application form, including the budget and the qualitative and quantitative objectives of the project; \uf0b7 Filling in the financial data (demand for automatic reimbursement, insurance declaration, etc.); \uf0b7 Obtaining and sending receipts and invoices; \uf0b7 Availability during on-the-spot controls of the Managing Authority, the Audit Authority or Intermediate Body; \uf0b7 Controls by various actors: the Managing Authority (where the number of controls has already been reduced from two to one), the Audit Authority, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Commission. For one project, three controllers from different institutions were present in the same room, which demonstrates that many demands are \u2018exaggerated, or even superfluous and ridiculous\u2019, according to a representative of the Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade; \uf0b7 Providing information in the framework of annual or final reports; \uf0b7 Preparing audit reports (for the European Court of Auditors), which takes about six months, and the Managing Authority often has only two weeks to reply. The on- going activities of the Managing Authority sometimes have to be put on hold in order to reply to the spontaneous requests of third-party administrations or organisations; \uf0b7 Developing proof of payment files (receipts, proof of payment, and relevant public documents); \uf0b7 The Managing Authority has to reply to numerous requests or send various reports at the request of the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Auditors, national administrations and so forth, which takes significant time; \uf0b7 Participating in various participative meetings for implementing the project and Monitoring Committee meetings related to indicators; \uf0b7 The Managing Authority is sometimes invited to Brussels to participate in working groups unrelated to its function. An associated problem is the organisation of those meetings: sometimes, the European Commission schedules two meetings on non- consecutive days (e.g. on a Tuesday and on a Thursday), which leads to tremendous time losses. 76 Le Gouvernement du Grand Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg (2013) Accord de partenariat entre le Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg et la Commission europ\u00e9enne relatif aux Fonds relevant du cadre strat\u00e9gique commun pour la p\u00e9riode de programmation 2014-2020, Version provisoire, 26 septembre 2013, p.39.

Consultants were also hired to carry out an ex-ante evaluation, develop the PA, carry out a strategic environment assessment, and set up a computerised system for the communication with beneficiaries. Major changes in administrative structure There were no major changes in administrative structures within the last few years of the 2007-2013 programming period. ",

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 168 Positive/negative implications for administrative capacity and anticipated future capacity issues For new actors: \uf0b7 External actors: the project partners are expected to remain almost the same, given that the same type of projects will be co-financed in 2014-2020 as in 2007-2013. A few new project partners will be added, such as communities, mainly for the energy/ CO 2 projects; \uf0b7 Internal actors: the same team will be maintained for the 2014-2020 programming period with no changes foreseen or authorised. The new tasks will be integrated into the existing system. The authorities will try as much as possible to keep the management and implementation system as it was in 2007-2013. Although the financial resources are lower than in the 2007-2013period, no reduction of staff is foreseen. The authorities expect procedural issues, given that more tasks will be expected (e.g. performance framework, regular accounts, etc.) with less financial resources. The required changes represent an administrative burden that is too large compared to the financial resources available. Relevance of the assessment of the European Commission towards the status of administrative capacity According to the interviewees, the European Commission has not criticised the administrative capacity in Luxembourg, especially because there have never been any irregularities or delays in reporting. However, the EC Position Paper stated that: 77 \uf0b7 Luxembourg should increase its administrative capacities with competent actors in order to really be able to apply environmental evaluation, state aid and public markets; \uf0b7 Ensure an efficient controlling environment and ensure the operational capacity of control systems; \uf0b7 Find a remedy for weak points in the implementation system (particularly first-level control) and ensure that the selection process for projects is sufficiently selective. In the EC Position Paper, Luxembourg is also encouraged to improve its financial management system by focusing on simplification and flexibility through online solutions, witha view to reducing the burden for beneficiaries. Moreover, partnership is to become more efficient, and the control of evaluations should become more efficient. Finally, the OPs are encouraged to introduce an online platform based on external good practice to enable information exchange with the beneficiaries. The interviewees stated that these changes would be implemented, but that the lack of resources would hinder the success of their implementation. 77 European Union (2012), Position des services de la Commission sur le d\u00e9veloppement d'un Accord de Partenariat et de programmes au Luxembourg pour la p\u00e9riode 2014-2020, Ref.

Their acceptance allowed Poland to start formal negotiations with the European Commission. The final PA was adopted on 23 May 2014. The Polish side wanted to maintain regular, informal contacts with the European Commission throughout the drafting process. This established strong links, although the European Commission's comments on drafts continued to be extensive. Advantages and disadvantages Poland found the exercise of developing the PA to be very productive. The PA is regarded as an important strategic document for development in Poland. The draft version is large and comprehensive. There are broad areas of agreement, particularly concerning the diagnoses of challenges where the four Thematic Objectives subject to thematic concentration and the priorities of Poland\u2019s National Strategy for Regional Development (KSRR) largely cohere. However, there are some issues of concern, including problems with ex-ante conditionalities.

Progress in fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities To avoid delays in the commencement of use of the resources allocated to Poland under the MFF 2014-2020, work on fulfilling the ex-ante conditionalities has been underway since the publication of the European Commission draft regulations. The basic premise of this work was to meet all conditions before the end of 2013.

The aim was to ensure that the key issues were discussed in time and that final negotiations would be largely formal. Nevertheless, the European Commission comments have still been extensive. 12.2 Programme architecture In the 2014-2020 period, Poland will implement eight OPs at the national level, financed by ERDF, ESF, CF, EAFRD and EMFF. \uf0b7 OP Intelligent Development -Innovation, R&D and links to the business environment (ERDF); \uf0b7 OP Infrastructure and Environment - Low-emission economy, environmental protection, adaption to climate change, transport and energy (ERDF, ESF); \uf0b7 OP Knowledge, Education, Development -Development of skills and training, social inclusion and good governance (ESF); \uf0b7 OP Digital Poland - New programme that aims to support information and communication technologies, including the development of e-government and broadband networking (ERDF); \uf0b7 OP Eastern Poland (ERDF) \u2013 Innovation, SME development, low-emission and infrastructure; \uf0b7 OP Technical Assistance (ERDF); \uf0b7 OP Territorial cooperation (ERDF); \uf0b7 OP Rural development (EAFRD); \uf0b7 OP Maritime development, fisheries (EMFF). At the regional level, as in the 2007-2013 programming period, 16 ROPs will be implemented. These will now be joint-funded by ERDF and ESF (in 2007-2013, they were ERDF only). Based on experience with the implementation of ROPs in the 2007-2013 programming period, further decentralisation of spending is planned for 2014-2020. There will be an overall increase in the share of total ERDF and ESF funds managed regionally from 37.3% to approximately 59.3%. The ERDF contribution for the ROPs in total ERDF allocation will be a minimum of 55% (up from 49.7%), while in the case of the ESF, this share will be about 75% of the total allocation for the fund. The division of funds among regions will be based on an algorithm as well as the amounts specified in the negotiations of territorial contracts between the national government and the regions. Thus, the following shares are proposed: \uf0b7 ESF: 75% of the ESF will be allocated to ROPs with the rest dedicated to envelopes (Priority Axes) in national OPs; \uf0b7 ERDF: about 55% for the ROPs with the rest dedicated to envelopes (Priority Axes) in NOPs. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 174 For the first time in the case of Poland, funding will go to two different types of regions: the less-developed and more-developed regions. Mazowieckie, the region where Poland\u2019s capital city Warsaw is located, has exceeded the 90% of GDP threshold and will become the first Polish region to move from Convergence tomore-developed status. Thus, the regional programme architecture will include: \uf0b7 15 multi-funded (ERDF, ESF) ROPs for regions classified as less-developed; \uf0b7 1 multi-funded ROP (ERDF, ESF) for Mazowieckie, falling within the more- developed category. Reasons for change or stability The decentralisation and increased funding to ROPs reflects growing experience of Cohesion policy management and implementation at the regional level. The decision to move to joint ERDF/ESF funding in the ROPs is based on the aim to maximise the integration of Cohesion policy funding and increase synergies between the actions supported by different funds in specific territories. Main challenges Several issues are prominent in the preparations for 2014-2020: \uf0b7 The more-developed status of Mazowieckie\u2013 the challenge is to ensure balanced coverage for the whole of the region, given substantial divergence between Warsaw and the rest of the territory; \uf0b7 Decentralisation\u2013 the on-going decentralisation of the Cohesion policy implementation system means a much larger role in managing and implementing programmes at the regional level. The larger pool of funds allocated to the regional level will mean greater responsibility for the decisions and actions implemented; \uf0b7 Joint-funded ROPs \u2013 the introduction of joint ERDF/ESF ROPs requires coordination between the programmes, funds and instruments. Regions will have to configure Managing Authority responsibilities to take this shift into account. Emphasis is being placed on developing solutions to ensure efficient and effective coordination and complementarity of interventions. Management of multi-fund OPs In the 2014-2020 programming period, ROPs will be joint-funded by ERDF/ESF. As a result, the Mazowieckie region plans to maintain separate ERDF and ESF departments with responsibilities for the management of specific priorities in the new ROP. Both units have considerable experience in managing interventions under these headings. However, a new regional development unit has been created to act as an overarching Managing Authority, with a particular focus on strategic issues.

The regions submitted their ROPs to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development at the end of October. The Ministry subsequently provided comments alongside relevant feedback from the European Commission on the PA. The revised ROPs were sent to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development by 10 April 2014 for review before formal negotiations with the European Commission. The main challenge is developing indicators that allow national analyses but are also relevant and can be monitored at programme and project levels. As in the 2007-2013 programming period, there is strong guidance from Ministry of Infrastructure and Development: national and regional Managing Authorities have been sent a Common List of Key Indicators (WLWK 2014) to choose from. The latest draft of the \u015al\u0105skie ROP 2014- 2020 at the time of the interview included corrections and adjustments of the system of indicators in line with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development methodology, including the construction of a system of indicators and the selection of indicators in keeping with the WLWK 2014. The indicator system in the draft of the \u015al\u0105skie ROP 2014- 2020 did not include targets, but the programme did have a financial table (see Table 59 below).

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 177 With regard to simplification in the 2014-2020 programming period, there will be greater decentralisation of the implementation system by increasing the share of regional programmes in the allocation of the total resources. Compared to the 2007-2013 programming period, voivodeship self-governments will be entrusted with the partial management of the ESF (within two of the funding programmes); and mechanisms to support integrated programmes will be introduced (the implementation of which will be entrusted to urban centres \u2013 Zit/RIT). They will also be responsible for using flexible forms of financing projects, ensuring wider access to support thematic reorientation, as well as providing easy access for potential beneficiaries to comprehensive information via an extensive network of information points for each Fund. Simplification measures are planned, including the use of revenue-generating projects, the widest possible use of lump sums, and a reduction in the level of co-financing under the relevant Priority Axis. In order to reduce the administrative burden, the Local System for Grant Applications will be launched in December 2014. This represents the introduction of electronic communication for grant applications in order to accelerate the selection and implementation of projects, and to improve the storage of project documents in accordance with Article 140 of the CPR. The systems will be made available free of charge, and will be available also outside office hours (i.e. 24/7) via the internet. Main differences between the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 programme(s) As mentioned above, based on experience with the implementation of ROPs in the 2007- 2013 programming period, further decentralisation of spending is planned for 2014-2020. There will be an overall increase in the share of total ERDF and ESF funds managed regionally from 37.3% to approximately 59.3%. The ERDF contribution for the ROPs in the total ERDF allocation will be a minimum of 55% (up from 49.7%), while in the case of the ESF, this share will be about 75% of the total allocation for the fund. There will be some thematic reorientation. The three main themes being supported are innovation/R&D, energy and transport (the development of regional transport infrastructure). Within this, there will be an overall increase in support for innovation in the economy and for interventions connected with the low-carbon economy. There will also be stronger concentration on the development of human capital (particularly for strengthening the quality of education at all levels and developing workforce skills in the R&D sector). At the same time, there will be a decrease in support for the development of transport infrastructure, most notably in terms of local transport infrastructure. One of the main reasons for the changes is the ring-fencing rule (thematic concentration requirements). The region still has significant needs in terms of basic infrastructure, and if no thematic concentration were being imposed, the next ROP would probably include more support for basic infrastructure (sewage systems, roads). Moreover, there will be no dedicated priorities for culture and tourism in the 2014-2020 ROP. Some changes also result from significant shifts in the demarcation line between national and regional funding. There will be a switch from mono-fund to multi-fund ROPs. As noted above, the \u015al\u0105skie ROP 2007-2013 is mono-fund OP (ERDF). For the 2007-2013 programming period, the Marshal\u2019s Office of each of Poland\u2019s 16 regional self-governments had the role of Managing Authority for the ROPs, funded through ERDF, and the Intermediate Body manages the regional priorities in the OP Human Capital (HCOP), funded under ESF (the Managing Authority is the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy).However, the 2014-2020 ROPs will be joint-funded by ERDF/ESF with a single Managing Authority in the regional Marshals\u2019 Offices. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 178 Impact of the financial crisis or political instability In terms of organisational stability, the administrative and staffing arrangements were consistent during the 2007-2013 programming period. Nevertheless, staff turnover was an important issue between the 2004-2006 and the 2007-2013 programming periods. Influence of national political structure on administration Poland has a regionalised unitary system.The key administrative issues are the coordination of regional administration and the aim ofensuring sufficient administrative capacity at regional levels to fulfil their responsibilities, including as Managing Authoritiesfor ROPs. The regional self-governments are now responsible for the development and implementation of ROPs, including the evaluation and selection of projects to be co-financed, making payments for beneficiaries, project control and programme evaluation and monitoring. While in some Marshal Offices some functions of the Managing Authorities and Intermediate Bodies were carried out by existing departments or units that were involved in the preparation of the OPs, in other Marshal Offices organisational changes resulted in the introduction ofnew organisational units. The increased share of funding for ROPs and the shift towards multi-funded ROPs emphasises the role of regional administrative capacity in the 2014-2020 programming period. Role of the European Commission, the European Semester or any other European influence The European Commission has supported the principle of joint-funded programmes to enhance integration and produce synergies. This was one of the motivations for the shift to joint-funded ROPs in the 2014-2020 programming period. In turn, this is prompting administrative review and reform in Polish regional governments. ",

Strategic programming / thematic concentration Completed Some issues with thematic concentration and \u2018ring-fencing\u2019: beneficiaries expect continued support for a wide range of interventions, but this is no longer the case. Also, the \u2018demarcation line\u2019 between national and regional interventions has influenced strategic thinking. Overall, the approach to strategy development has been more focused than in 2004-2006. Some areas will no longer be supported by the ROP i.e. no local social, health, sport, tourism infrastructure (only integrated revitalisation projects); no broadband network (only internet services); and no local roads or cycle paths. The general idea is to support existing infrastructure rather than to build new infrastructure. The Managing Authority programming unit is the responsible entity.Completed. Performance framework Advanced The main challenge is how to respond to a new approach to defining performance (i.e. beyond absorption to include impact). This requires a performance framework that measures the impact of a programme on the development of the region and its competitiveness, and how to comply the result indicators. In the 2007-2013 period, the performance and results-driven approach was understood in terms of timely spending and absorption, sound financial management, the limitation of irregularities, and the fulfilment of spending agreements.

Central government provided strong guidance and carried out ex-ante evaluation. For 2014-2020, regional-level capacity has been developed. There is still central-level guidance, but ROP programming is being carried out in closer proximity to the regional development unit in the regional government that is responsible for the domestic \u015al\u0105skie regional Development Strategy. The regional evaluation unit is stronger: it has carried out an ex-post analysis of the 2007- 2013 ROP and is carrying out ex-ante studies for 2014-2020. Moreover, as with all regions, a regional territorial observatory is now in operation, gathering data and conducting analyses of the regional socio-economic situation. All of this should ensure that there is a stronger regional dimension to the ROP strategy. Good practice The expansion of evaluation capacity in Poland can be seen as an example of good practice. This refers mostly to the national level, where the National Evaluation Unit developed several initiatives and tools during the 2007-2013 programming period. The unit established an evaluation database that gathered studies completed during the 2007-2013 programming period. In 2009, Poland launched an innovative initiative by building an integrated system for managing conclusions and recommendations from evaluation studies.The system was created in order to coordinate the process of implementation and strengthen the monitoring of recommendations formulated within completed studies. Managing Authorities play the main role in the system (making decisions on using recommendations, followed by monitoring the process of their implementation) alongside the National Evaluation Unit (managing the database of conclusions and recommendations, analysing and monitoring key recommendations). Evaluation was a crucial theme in the Polish presidency of the Council of the European Union.

In order to avoid duplication, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development introduced a so-called demarcation line. This was based on a table of common areas of EU funds interventions and introduced different criteria to avoid double-financing of projects in different Operational Programmes. Identification criteria included the type of project beneficiary, the value of the project, and its location. The demarcation line between the national Innovative Economy OP and the \u015al\u0105skie ROP has created some problems for the implementation of support for innovation and R&D activities in micro-enterprises and SMEs in the region. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 184 The demarcation line determines the level and type of eligible funding from national and sub-national levels. To an extent, this constrains the capacity of the ROP Managing Authority to administer funding in this field. For the 2014-2020 programming period, there has been further decentralisation of Cohesion policy funding to the regions, and although the demarcation line will still be used, it is anticipated that the role of regional authorities will be strengthened. The system for SME support is also fragmented in the region. The Managing Authority uses the Silesian Centre for Entrepreneurship as an Intermediate Body, but there is a range of regional and local development agencies and centres that compete to provide business advice and support. Major changes in administrative structure There were no major changes over the past two years, but recent months have seen considerable reorganisation for the 2014-2020 programming period. For the shift to joint- funded 2014-2020 ROPs, the region has maintained separate ERDF and ESF units with responsibilities for the management of specific priorities in the new ROP.

Examples of administrative procedures and/or capacity development measures which can be recommended as good practice The ex-post evaluation of the \u015al\u0105skie ROP included an analysis of its management and implementation capacity that produced several insights. Implementation arrangements were found to be flexible: staff could be transferred between units to adapt to changing circumstances and the emergence of unexpected issues. The ex-post evaluation found that a good system of training or staff development operated in both the Managing Authority and the Intermediate Body: at least once a year, the training needs of staff are addressed.

The development of the PA took place in parallel with the development of the OPs. The first hearing concerning the PA was held on 18 June 2013. The aim of this hearing was to discuss the overall priorities linked to the analysis of the PA. All comments received in relation to the PA, including those that emerged at the hearing, were then addressed in the Government Offices. The second and last hearing was held on 5 February 2014. The aim of this hearing was to discuss the entire PA. 78 At the time of writing, all the different elements of the PA, as well as the process of fulfilling the ex-ante conditionalities and their documentation, were close to being finalised. The PA was submitted to the European Commission on 17 April 2014. At the time of the interview, the submission had not yet taken place. Advantages and disadvantages of the new instrument The basic idea behind the PA is considered to be good. The coordination of funds is regarded as important in order to enable more effective programme implementation and provide better value for money. The process of developing the PA was time-consuming and compromises were necessary, but overall the exercise was viewed as useful and instructive. Stage of preparations for the thematic orientation of the PA The coverage of the different Thematic Objectives is considered to be clear in the PA. The PA addresses TOs 1-10thus all TOs with the exception of TO11. Institutional capacity, and the ROPs address TOs 1-4 (1. RTDI, 2. ICT, 3. SMEs, 4. Low-carbon economy) as well as TO7 (Transport). In comparison to 2007-2013, there is clearly more focus within the priorities and a greater concentration of resources within the ROPs. In addition, in comparison to the 2007-2013 programme period, there is a stronger focus on green investments with at least a fifth of the funds to be invested in the transition to a low-carbon economy, i.e. renewable energy and energy efficiency. 79 The concentration of resources on these Thematic Objectives did not take place without certain difficulties. Indeed, taking into consideration the earmarking of resources (e.g. green investments) as well as the needs and wishes of different regionswas a complex process. Experiences with any formal or informal consultation with the European Commission about the PA (and programmes) The dialogue with the European Commission was largely carried out by the Government Offices.

The authorities also consider that this simplifies implementation, in the sense that all the relevant actors are familiar with the structures, and as such the programmes are expected to start quicker. There are therefore no significant challenges ahead in terms of the programme architecture. The regional programmes that will be retained to the 2014-2020 programming period are as follows: \uf0b7 East Mid-Sweden; \uf0b7 Mid-North Sweden; \uf0b7 North Mid-Sweden; \uf0b7 North Sweden; \uf0b7 Sk\u00e5ne-Blekinge; \uf0b7 Sm\u00e5land and the Islands; \uf0b7 Stockholm; \uf0b7 West Sweden. The only significant change for the 2014-2020 programming period is that, in addition to the regional programmes, there will be a national programme co-funded by the ERDF. The national programme will have a strategic focus on promoting sectoral and programme coordination. It will contribute to developing cooperation and coordination between EU, macro-regional, national, regional and local levels. The programme aims to bring added value to the regional growth policy and to the implementation of Cohesion policy, which cannot be achieved within the framework of regional Structural Fund programmes. The national programme is linked to three of the 11 Thematic Objectives, namely TO1, TO3 and TO4. Funding to the programmes has been decided. Effectively, 85% of the resources are directed to the ROPs, which cover the entire country. The remaining 15% is allocated to the national programme, which was developed in dialogue with those who write the ROPs. 80 13.3 Operational Programme(s) Most programme elements were at an advanced stage of development (e.g. strategy) with drafted proposals (e.g. indicators and targets, financial tables) at the time of the interview. For instance, concerning the simplification measures, the Managing Authority was then exploring the practical issues of introducing the different simplification measures presented by the European Commission. Lessons from the 2007-2013 programming period were used as a basis for developing the programme for 2014-2020. 80 Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/17513/a/217042 .

        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 189 There are some changes from the 2007-2013 programming period. Most importantly, there is a greater focus and concentration of resources, as well as a clear shift towards green investments. As noted above, at least a fifth of the funds will be invested in the transition to a low-carbon economy, i.e. renewable energy and energy efficiency. 81 Moreover, with respect to the different programme elements such as indicators, the key changes from the 2007-2013 programming period are that there will be fewer indicators and there will be a clear distinction between output and result indicators. The starting point for the Managing Autority was to limit the common indicators as much as possible, and to supplement these with a few additional output indicators. Regarding the result indicators, the Managing Authority produced a comprehensive list of indicators, from which the individual programmes are able to choose the most appropriate indicators for their purposes. In Sweden, administrative issues are not a major concern, given the lack of any significant issues in the past. Issues such as the financial crisis or political instability have not affected administrative capacities to the extent that changes would have to be implemented.

Source: Interview conducted by Metis/EPRC, April 2014. 83 In the 2007-2013 programming period, Structural Funds partnerships were formed in every programme area. The partnerships were created jointly for the ERDF programmes and for the regional plan of the ESF programme. The key task of the Structural Funds partnerships is to prioritise projects, and to ensure that the ERDF OP and the regional plan for the ESF are implemented according to their respective strategic directions. The Structural Funds partnerships together with the MAs are also responsible for overseeing that the programmes are coordinated with other programmes implemented at the regional level (e.g. Regional Growth Programme and the rural programme).

However, interviewees provided no detail as to the reasons why evaluation has been particularly effective.

In terms of good practices, work with the various cluster initiatives in the field of innovation and with risk capital funds in the field of SMEs were regarded as particularly effective, although interviewees gave no concrete information on what had been done in practice. Capacity issues have been experienced particularly with human resources. There was some feeling that during 2007-2013 there was an insufficient number of people at the Managing Authority, and that on occasions they did not have the right expertise for carrying out the tasks. In addition, some difficulties were encountered with regard to the level of external experts' knowledge of Structural Funds. At the start of the programme period, there were also some institutional difficulties that were caused primarily by the lack of clarity in some programmes in terms of the roles played by the Structural Funds partnerships 84 and the Managing Authority. However, by 2010 the situation had improved considerably, and the overall view was that the implementation was working well, at least with respect to the organisations\u2019 basic functions. The experience with the Structural Funds partnerships and the Managing Authority largely related to the individuals involved, and it was considered that personal attributes played an important role in many instances. Sometimes just the fact that a new person became involved resulted in improvements. Over a period, however, dialogue and routines developed, as well as the personal relationships between the different actors. 85 Overall, given the limited challenges with capacities, there was nomajor change in administrative structures during 2007-2013. At present, it seems that the structures from 2007-2013 will be largely retained for the 2014-2020 programming period. The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth ( Tillv\u00e4xtverket) will remain the Managing Authority for the eight regional Structural Funds programmes. Tillv\u00e4xtverket has offices in each of the eight programme regions, and it is responsible for supporting the programming process and dialogue. For ESF, the Managing Authority functions continue to be carried out by the Swedish ESF Council, which is also located in each programme region alongside Tillv\u00e4xtverket . 13.5 Capacity changes for the future Although the overall programme structure is clear for the 2014-2020 programming period, there are still uncertainties concerning the exact actors and their responsibilities. As a result, the interviewees were unable to provide an assessment of the numbers and responsibilities of the actors involved in the different areas of the programme cycle. The only certainty at this stage concerned the introduction of some new actors, such as the Energy Authority. While the interviewees considered this to provide a number of new opportunities, they also expected it to bring along a number of teething problems (again, no concrete details were provided). 84 There are eight Structural Fund Partnerships established within each ERDF programme area at the NUTS 2 level and corresponding area for the regional plan of the national ESF OP. Before making decisions on allocating ESF and ERDF funds, the Managing Authorities have to consult with the programme\u2019s Structural Fund Partnership. SFPs are responsible for setting priorities among the approved projects. 85 Savb\u00e4ck U, Hedin S and B\u00f6hme K (2012) EU: sStrukturfonderiSverige 2014-2020, en genomf\u00f6randeorganisationf\u00f6r\u00f6katregionaltinflytande, SwecoEurofutures, Stockholm.

As concluded in the EC Position Paper, administrative arrangements in Sweden are generally considered as sound, effective and efficient. 87 The future focus of administration will follow the European Commission\u2019s recommendations, which underline the need to fine- tune the arrangements and further reduce the administrative burden for beneficiaries to ensure effective access to interventions. Furthermore, the European Commission has noted that adequate administrative arrangements and capacity should be ensured for the planning, tracking and reporting of climate-related expenditure.

CASE STUDY - UNITED KINGDOM 14.1 Partnership Agreement The UK PA is made up of separate chapters for England and each of the Devolved Administrations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). The UK\u2019s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills oversaw the process of developing the PA. The pace of development of the separate chapters differed across the UK. In one case, the development of the PA and OPs took place in parallel (Scotland), whereas in others the development of the OPs led and informed the development and content of the PA chapters (England and Wales). The content of the English national ERDF OP for 2014-2020 (and therefore the relevant PA chapter) was informed by the content of local-level strategic documents (the ESIF strategies of 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)), which had to be prepared and agreed before the PA/OP content could be finalised.The submission of the UK PA to the European Commission was made on 17 April 2014. Stage of preparations for the thematic orientation of the PA In terms of the coverage of Thematic Objectives, the Structural Funds represent a modest proportion of domestic expenditure in the UK, so some themes are expected to be addressed domestically rather than covered by the PA. In addition, the thematic concentration requirements are such that 80% of Structural Funds expenditure is already accounted for in \u2018ring-fencing\u2019 requirements. However, the emphasis on a narrower \u2018menu\u2019 of options is welcomed, as it is thought that this can deliver more impact than more diffused spending. With regard to content, the EC Position Paper has stated, and the UK accepts, that there is a lag in R&D spending in the UK, and this will therefore be a core theme in the England ERDF programme. There has also been a lag identified in carbon reduction/renewables; ring-fencing will apply to carbon reduction, but it is likely to be less emphasis on renewables. The European Commission\u2019s comments on intermediate skills are also accepted, and a greater proportion of ESF in England is likely to be spent on intermediate and higher-level skills (although the majority will still be spent on lower-level skills). Experiences with any formal or informal consultation with the European Commission about the PA (and programmes) The informal consultation process with the European Commission on the draft PA chapters and OPs was challenging. The European Commission was seen to be adhering very closely to the content of the Position Paper, and the main negotiating issues were around the Thematic Objectives (ICT infrastructure, transport, climate change measures to alleviate flooding) and how the 5% urban stipulation would be addressed. 14.2 Programme architecture Programme architecture and types of programmes The ESIF programme architecture in England will change for the 2014-2020 programming period, with consolidation of the number of OPs. The model in England for 2014-2020 is of a single ESIF Growth Programme, made up of one OP each for ERDF, ESF and EAFRD. In the 2007-2013 programming period, there were 10 sub-national ERDF OPs in England, and one for each of the other Funds. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 196 The changes have been made to streamline the management of ESIF in England, reduce the number of programmes and associated bureaucracy, and align local allocations from the funds with future sources of domestic funding. The focus of policy in England is now on the local rather than regional level, and the content of the new national OPs has been developed to take into account the content of local strategies drawn up by 39 LEPs in England. It is anticipated that the national OPs will allow the impact of ESIF to be demonstrated more clearly. The challenges stem from the fact that the LEPs are fairly new bodies and vary in terms of their resources and capacity, as well as their ability to engage with ESIF. However, there is continuity in terms of programme management arrangements, with LEPs working with sub- national Growth Delivery Teams to deliver the programmes. These Growth Delivery Teams comprise representatives of the Managing Authority departments and are located sub- nationally. They are comparable to the ERDF Managing Authority\u2019s Programme Delivery Teams, which implemented the regional programmes in the second half of the 2007-2013 programme period, after abolition of the regional development agencies. Allocation of funding The indicative breakdown of 2014-2020 ESIFunding between the constituent parts of the UK was announced by the UK Government in March 2013. This amended the EU formula for allocating Structural Funds, agreed by the European Council in February, as it was considered that it would not have resulted in a fair distribution across the UK, and it would have resulted in \u2018sudden and significant cutbacks in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales\u2019. The allocations announced were as follows: \uf0b7 Northern Ireland \u2013 a total allocation of around \u20ac457 million, an uplift of \u20ac181 million compared to the amount that Northern Ireland would receive under the EU formula for allocation of the Funds to the UK; \uf0b7 Scotland \u2013 total funding of around \u20ac795 million, representing an uplift of \u20ac228 million compared to the amount that Scotland would receive under the EU formula for allocation of the Funds to the UK; \uf0b7 Wales \u2013 total allocation of around \u20ac2.145 billion. This represents an uplift of \u20ac375million compared to the amount that Wales would receive under the EU formula for allocation of the Funds to the UK; \uf0b7 England - a total allocation of \u20ac6.174 billion. This decision means that each Devolved Administration is only subject to an equal percentage cut of around 5% in funding compared to the 2007-2013 levels. A written Ministerial Statement to the UK Parliament in June 2013 announced the breakdowns within the Devolved Administrations and at local level in England. The announcement stated that the element retained by government for central programmes in England had been \u2018dramatically reduced\u2019 from around 50% to under 5%, so that maximum funds would go to local areas. Each of the 39 LEPs in England has been given an allocation, made up of funds from ERDF and ESF. ",

The institutional framework changed mid-way through the programming period with the abolition of the RDAs in England in 2010. The RDAs had delegated responsibilities for programme implementation and acted as Intermediate Bodies. After their abolition by the incoming Coalition Government, responsibility for programme implementation was transferred over 2010-2011 to the Managing Authority. Many of the ERDF teams that had worked within the RDAs in the regions (around 250 people) were subsequently employed by the Managing Authority within new sub-nationally located Programme Delivery Teams (now known as Growth Delivery Teams). This transfer of management and implementation arrangements was considered to have worked well, 88 and indeed all English ERDF programmes met their 2011 spending targets. Some specialist \u2018wrap-around\u2019 support that had been available within the RDAs was lost to the programmes (e.g. each RDA had its own legal and procurement experts), but numerous specialists were retained within the Growth Delivery Teams and thus some pooling of resources took place. 88 House of Commons Communities and Local Government Select Committee report into the European Regional Development Fund (2012) http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/communities-and-local- government-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/erdf/ ",

Thus, programme management and implementation in 2014-2020 will include some elements of continuity and some of change. In terms of continuity, programme management and delivery at sub-national level will continue to be the responsibility of Growth Delivery Teams, which comprise representatives of the Managing Authority departments. In terms of change, the role of the LEPs will be a new feature. The LEPs are partnerships between local authorities and businesses thatwere involved in the programme preparation process for 2014-2020, through the submission of ESIF strategies that fed in to the preparation of the OPs. The LEPs will also have a role in programme implementation, by facilitating and supporting project preparation and submission in their local areas. Project proposals will then be assessed and approved by sub-committees of the Local Management Committees. The UK Government issued guidance in spring and summer 2013 and also held workshops to assist the LEPs in the development of their ESIF investment strategies.

Source: Interview conducted by Metis/EPRC, April 2014. Positive implications for administrative capacity and anticipated future capacity issues A further aspect of programme implementation going forward, which is expected to have a positive impact on administrative capacity, is the strengthening of links between ERDF and ESF within the Managing Authority. The management of the two funds will be more closely aligned in future, potentially also including co-location within one department. This is expected to have a major positive impact on programme management in 2014-2020, as there will be potential cross-fertilisation of skills and expertise. The responsibility of LEPs to include both ERDF and ESF within their local strategies will bring both challenges and opportunities, and there will be a need for continued engagement with the LEPs and on- going support from the Managing Authority. The Managing Authority is confident that they have sufficient resources to support programme delivery. The process of approving the LEP ESIF strategies allowed relationships to be built up and provided an overview of where resources may be needed in future. There were regular workshops with the LEPs at the time of writing, and a joint ERDF/ESF event was planned with a range of partners to launch the consultation on the draft ERDF and ESF OPs. ",
        "Implementation of Cohesion policy 2014-2020: Preparations and administrative capacity of Member States 202 Learning from the 2007-2013 programming period will result in major emphasis being placed on reducing the risk of programme interruptions and building this aspect into programme management processes. A dedicated team has been put in place within the Growth Delivery Teams network, managed centrally by the Managing Authority, to examine audit requirements and ensure compliance in the 2014-2020 programme. The intention is to build compliance into all processes from the programme start.
