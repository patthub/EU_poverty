        "Market Surveillance Introduction 1. Believes that the current legislative framework for market surveillance does not provide enough coherence and should therefore be reviewed and further coordinated; 2. Proposes that the Commission establish a common European framework for market surveillance, concerning all products on the internal market or entering the EU market; calls on the Commission to play a more active role in coordinating the activities of the European market surveillance authorities, the customs authorities and the competent authorities of the Member States; 3. Calls on Member States and the Commission to deploy adequate resources for efficient market surveillance activities; emphasises that failing market surveillance systems could generate a distortion of competition, jeopardise consumers\u2019 safety and undermine citizens\u2019 trust in the internal market; points out the importance of securing the external borders of the single market, in particular the major sea ports, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to take measures against illegal products from third countries; suggests that the Commission undertake a full assessment of the points of entry of products into the EU market, including an assessment of the resources needed to guarantee adequate control; 4. Calls on Member States to introduce in a coordinated manner penalties, including heavy fines, for economic operators who deliberately introduce dangerous or non-compliant products into the single market; proposes that product bans should be made public as often as possible in order to increase the visibility of border controls and market surveillance and to deter criminal market operators; 5. Calls on the Commission with the participation of market surveillance authorities and of the customs authorities to co-fund further joint market surveillance actions; 6. Emphasises the necessity of sharing best practices among the Member States; calls for joint cooper\u00ad ation, pooling of know-how and sharing of best practices among market surveillance authorities; recalls the importance of cooperation between customs and market surveillance authorities at the external borders to carry out appropriate checks on products entering the Community; recognises the important contribution made today by PROSAFE as regards the coordination of joint market surveillance actions and the exchange of tried and tested practices in the framework of the GPSD; therefore calls on the Commission to consider under what conditions PROSAFE could serve as platform for an extended coordination between Member States for harmonised and non-harmonised products; considers it necessary to establish a legal basis and to allocate sufficient resources to PROSAFE to carry out this task; points out that coordination through PROSAFE today is restricted by limited resources and its informal structure; 7. Calls upon the EU Member States to share product safety related inquiries and studies with other Member States; considers that the reference numbers of the products concerned should be included to facilitate product identification by other authorities, who could benefit from translating and using the information provided in the studies; calls upon Member States to allow their competent authorities to take market surveillance measures on the basis of test results or studies including those delivered by other Member States, in order to avoid duplication of work; 8. Suggests establishing offices for education on product safety e.g. in the framework of the Product Contact Points, that can facilitate training and transfer information across industries; 9. Urges the Commission to establish a public Consumer Product Safety Information Database, including a platform for complaints, if possible based on already existing regional and national systems in the Member States; takes the view that this will raise awareness of dangerous products across borders in the internal market and allow consumers to notify the competent authorities electronically of dangerous products; believes that the database could be formed by developing existing databases such as the European Market Surveillance System (ICSMS) or the Injury Database (IDB); stresses the need for the database to have a legal basis, and for reporting from the Member States to be mandatory; calls for the establishment of an accident statistics system founded on this database, from which mandatory annual reports will be published; calls for the database to be publicly accessible, while ensuring the necessary confidentiality for businesses; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/3 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "10. Points out that globalisation, increased outsourcing and the growth in international trade mean that more products are being traded on markets across the world; considers that close cooperation between global regulators and other stakeholders in the area of consumer product safety is key to addressing the challenges posed by complex supply chains and the higher volume of trade; 11. Calls on the Commission to intensify international cooperation in the international Consumer Product Safety Caucus so as to exchange tried and tested practices and jointly to prevent the production in third countries of dangerous substances intended for export to the European single market; Revision of the GPSD Alignment of GPSD and NLF - a new General Product Safety and Market Surveillance Regulation 12. Supports the revision of the GPSD and of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 with regard to definitions and obligations for economic operators as defined in Decision No 768/2008/EC, while avoiding the creation of unnecessary administrative burdens, especially for SMEs; considers that having one single regulation is the only way to have one single market surveillance system for all products; therefore urges the Commission to establish a single market surveillance system for all products, based on one legislative act covering both the GPSD and Regulation (EC) No 765/2008; considers that this new legislative act should be created to achieve a high level of product safety and market surveillance, clarifying the legal basis and taking into account the provisions developed more fully in the two existing legislative acts; 13. Calls for alignment between traceability requirements in the GPSD and the NLF so as to guarantee a coherent traceability system avoiding the creation of new red tape; 14. Requests the Commission to consider developing more precise criteria for evaluating safety and risks stemming from the non-compliance of products with EU legislation; Additional specific changes to the GPSD 15. Regards it as problematic that products operated by service providers are not covered by the current GPSD, i.e. that general safety requirements apply when the product is handled by consumer on the premises of the service provider, but not if the same product is operated by the service provider; stresses the need to rectify this legal loophole; 16. Calls for the simplification of European product safety legislation, in particular as regards the Commission objectives \u2018better law-making\u2019 and \u2018think small first\u2019 as set out in the Communication \u2018Towards a Single Market Act\u2019, and urges that the provisions on Food-Imitating Products be included in the revised proposal; 17. Calls, in order to ensure the safety of the widest range of particularly vulnerable consumers, for the introduction of a reference to people with disabilities (along with the references to children and elderly people that are already present); 18. Calls on the Commission to include an obligation for manufacturers to carry out a risk analysis in their design phase; urges that if any risks are identified they should be documented and made available to the public authorities; Emergency Community measures 19. Stresses the need for a more effective regulatory framework, allowing quick interventions and reliable long-term solutions, without delegating political decisions to the standardisation bodies or to the Commission in the absence of a clear set of essential policy requirements such as exists for harmonised legislation; EN C 199 E/4 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "Traceability 20. Stresses that products posing serious risks must be permanently withdrawn or recalled from the market as quickly as possible and that traceability throughout the supply chain must be ensured, which calls for sufficient resources for the market surveillance authorities; 21. Underlines the importance of ensuring reliable traceability throughout all stages of the life of a product, while making sure that this does not lead to increased administrative burdens; 22. Underlines the importance of product traceability and tracking labels for determining the country of origin of the product and the manufacturer responsible; 23. Insists on effective enforcement of the identification procedures that are already in place; encourages the Commission to make assessments and evaluations on the use of new technologies, while considering that the usage of new technologies should be proportionate and should not endanger the privacy, security and safety of the consumer; 24. Stresses however, that no single technical solution should be imposed as the official traceability system/method within the EU market; and calls for overall proportionality; 25. Emphasises the need to improve and further strengthen RAPEX exchanges of information in respect of dangerous products from third countries (such as China and India) and for its latest studies to be evaluated; RAPEX 26. Acknowledges that RAPEX is a useful and efficient tool for disseminating information among the Member States about the measures taken with regard to dangerous products, but believes that this tool can be further improved; 27. Calls on the Commission to allow product safety professionals, producers, trade and consumer organisations and national authorities to have access to all relevant information while ensuring the necessary confidentiality; calls on the Commission to improve awareness of RAPEX and the EU recall systems outside the EU; 28. Welcomes the new RAPEX guidelines which contribute to the improvement of the operation of RAPEX; invites the Commission to streamline the new risk assessment method with those in place for harmonised products to assist market surveillance authorities in their work; 29. Calls on the Commission to explain the classification of products as a \u2018serious risk\u2019 in RAPEX notifications; 30. Notes that consumer products placed on the European internal market are coming increasingly from third countries; is particularly concerned that each year there is an increase in RAPEX notifications relating to products of Chinese origin, accounting for more than half of RAPEX notifications, and that in 20 % of cases it appears that it is not possible to identify the manufacturers of those products; therefore calls for enhanced efforts to be made internationally and welcomes EU-China-US cooperation on product traceability strategies; welcomes any support, training and seminars organised by EU and Chinese authorities to improve product safety; underlines that there is a need for multiannual programmes to face these challenges; 31. Calls on the Commission to consider the usefulness of setting up a system similar to RAPEX \u2013 CHINA for other trading partners, in particular those whose products have been notified in the RAPEX system; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/5 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "32. Requests the Commission to incorporate into RAPEX, or any other appropriate system at EU level, penalties for infringements by the Member States, in order to ensure transparency and incentives for all stakeholders; Online selling and customs 33. Is concerned about the difficulties faced by market surveillance authorities when taking action against dangerous products sold online; 34. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s project C2013 in the area of product safety which will produce guidelines for customs controls in the EU; urges the Commission to deliver specific tools for customs authorities to tackle the challenges of adequate controls on imported products; calls for further enhanced co-operation between enforcement authorities; 35. Recognises the increase in the number of products from third countries bought online by consumers which do not comply with European standards, thus endangering the safety and health of consumers; calls on the Commission to step up and standardise customs checks on products bought on the internet and to carry out market surveillance, paying special attention to products which can cause direct harm to consumers, such as pharmaceutical and food products; urges the Commission to study possible solutions to that problem in order to strengthen consumers\u2019 confidence in e-commerce; 36. Calls on the Commission and Member States\u2019 authorities to ensure proper training of officers so as to ensure better detection of products presenting a risk; urges better cooperation between customs and market surveillance authorities before products are released on to the market, which calls for a multiannual programme here as well; 37. Calls on the Commission and national competent authorities to further develop awareness-raising campaigns targeting consumers to inform them about the risk of buying counterfeited products, especially online; Standardisation 38. Stresses the need for the market surveillance authorities to systematically participate in the process of security-relevant standard development, as this is an appropriate means of ensuring that their knowledge informs the standardisation process and of generating greater understanding for standards, thereby ensuring that the voluntary application of standards will contribute to increased consumer safety and health as well as to legal certainty by allowing the correct interpretation and application of European Standards by Member States\u2019 authorities; 39. Calls on the Commission to increase the clarity of mandates for standards and to consider other evolutionary ways to improve and integrate national and European standardisation systems in the non- harmonised area, with the emphasis on SME participation, while retaining the main elements of the current structure; 40. Urges that the currently applicable Commission procedures for establishing mandates for the devel\u00ad opment of European standards be improved so as to guarantee timely reaction to new or emerging risks in a more efficient manner; emphasises, however, that new or amended procedures should also be subject to Parliament\u2019s scrutiny; stresses that Parliament should also be entitled to scrutinise the procedures for taking over or applying international, non-European and other standards; 41. Calls for the European standardisation organisations and the Commission to investigate all systems potentially capable of speeding up the process of standards development, while ensuring the proper involvement of all relevant stakeholders, such as the introduction of a fast-track procedure or the possibility for the Commission of publishing references to existing European or ISO standards developed outside a Commission mandate, if such standards are deemed to provide a high level of consumer protection or to address a specific risk, as an interim measure until a permanent solution becomes available; EN C 199 E/6 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "42. Calls for the Commission\u2019s mandates for standardisation to be improved in order to allow the European standardisation organisations to develop European Standards fulfilling the technical requirements for which compliance with a political decision is achieved or evaluated; in this respect, considers that there is a need for better involvement and cooperation between the European Commission and the European standardisation organisations in the drafting process; bearing in mind that these organisations work on the basis of consensus, considers it crucial for the proper functioning of the system that political issues are dealt with at the policy-making level and not delegated to the European Commission, the standardisation bodies or any enforcement administrations; 43. Calls for the introduction of a procedure for formal objection to a standard, such as in Decision No 768/2008/EC, to be included in the GPSD; considers that the use of this procedure should be possible even before a standard is cited in the Official Journal of the EU, but should not be a substitute for Member States significantly increasing the involvement of their market surveillance authorities in the standardisation system; 44. Calls on the Commission and all stakeholders to guarantee the financial sustainability of the European standardisation system, including through public-private partnerships and through multiannual financial planning, since this is essential to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency; 45. Calls for the Commission to take further steps in coherence with the new legislative framework, so that the necessary revisions can be enhanced; * * * 46.

        "C. whereas the phases of a global pandemic are determined in accordance with the provisions of the IHR and in consultation with other organisations and institutions and with the Member States affected, D. whereas the criteria for defining a \u2018pandemic\u2019, as revised by the WHO in 2009, are based solely on the spread of the virus while disregarding the severity of the illness caused by it, E. whereas Member States, the European Commission and external bodies such as the WHO should take into account the virulence of a future influenza outbreak as well as the propagation of the virus when making public health decisions which may affect public health and social policies in Member States, F. considering the high degree of unforeseeability regarding the pandemic\u2019s severity and how it was going to unfold, and the possibility that the pandemic might worsen in Europe, as it did in 1918 and 1968, G. whereas, on the basis of the WHO pandemic alert and subsequent recommendations, the Member States responded rapidly, in line with the precautionary principle, using what resources they had available to implement public health action plans; whereas the move to the highest level of alert, indicating the presence of a pandemic, gave rise in some cases to public health decisions that were disproportionate, H. whereas the WHO called an end to the state of alert concerning H1N1 influenza only in August 2010 (statement by the WHO Director-General of 10 August 2010 ( 1 ), I. whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the preparation for and reaction to health risks in the European Union fall within the competence of the Member States; whereas the Treaty of Lisbon exhorts the Member States to strengthen cooperation, sharing of information and good practices within the framework of the WHO and the existing structures of the EU; whereas stronger coordination measures by the Commission, with the support of the ECDC and the EMEA within the framework of the International Health Regulation, reinforce the effectiveness of national measures, J. whereas the pharmaceutical industry had to respond to a sudden, pressing and exponential demand for the supply of vaccines by the Member States; whereas the industry had to develop with very great urgency a new vaccine likely to be effective against the virus, K. whereas the costs arising from the management of this crisis in the Member States were significant and could perhaps have been reduced by better cooperation between the Member States and better coor\u00ad dination between the Member States and ECDC, L. whereas the expenditure committed by certain Member States to the response plans drawn up relates mainly to the purchase of vast quantities of vaccines and antiviral treatments, and whereas purchasing procedures led to concerns regarding compliance with rules on public procurement and transparency in some Member States, M. whereas there were significant price disparities among the Member States that had prior purchase agreements for vaccines, based, among other factors, on the differentiated liability conditions of each agreement, N. whereas lawsuits were taken in various Member States, alleging corruption and conspiracy on the part of civil servants in relation to contracts signed in summer 2009 between ministries of public health and manufacturers of H1N1 influenza vaccines, EN C 199 E/10 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 ( 1 ) http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2010/h1n1_vpc_20100810/en/print.html Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "O. whereas, according to the Commission the reluctance of vaccine suppliers to bear full product liability may have contributed to reducing citizens\u2019 trust in vaccine safety; whereas confidence in vaccines against H1N1 influenza was also undermined by incomplete and contradictory communication on the benefits and risks of vaccination and the potential risks of H1N1 influenza to the public, P. whereas the differing recommendations made within the EU and the Member States on the subject of the priority groups targeted for vaccination illustrate the significant uncertainties and diverging views surrounding the appropriate response to H1N1 influenza, Q. whereas pandemic influenza preparedness planning relies to a great extent on vaccination strategies; whereas vaccination strategies should rely on three conditions to be successful: efficacy of the vaccine, a positive benefit-risk balance for the vaccine, and targeting of risk groups, R. whereas there needs to be transparency about the fulfilment of these conditions, S. whereas the vaccines\u2019 benefit-risk ratio has now been demonstrated in tolerance and immunogenicity studies based on actual use, T. whereas there is a need for studies on vaccines and antiviral medications that are independent from pharmaceutical companies so as to have a balance between private and publicly funded studies, U. whereas, in the event of a future influenza pandemic, more work needs to be done to improve the performance of influenza vaccines, especially for high risk groups and against drifted variants, V. whereas, due to the early acquisition of vaccines and systematic vaccination strategies, especially among the most vulnerable groups, the EU was the best prepared region in the world; whereas, however, considerable differences emerged between the preparedness of EU Member States and the lack of genuine cooperation weakened the EU\u2019s overall preparedness, W. whereas the limited cooperation among Member States, especially the lack of joint public procurement of vaccines, the lack of joint stockpiles, the lack of a solidarity and brokerage mechanism between Member States, and the absence of prior purchase agreements in several Member States were the main factors undermining the EU\u2019s better preparedness, X. whereas despite the repeated requests made by the European Ombudsman to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the documents held by the EMA relating to research protocols, clinical trials and the undesirable effects of medicinal products submitted to it for assessment are not always accessible to the public, Y. whereas the information and communication concerning H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 in the EU have demonstrated the crucial role played by the media in relaying public health precautions and recommendations, but also in emphasising selected aspects of the outbreak and its consequences, thus potentially altering public opinion perceptions and the public authorities\u2019 responses, Cooperation 1. Calls for the prevention plans established in the EU and its Member States for future influenza pandemics to be revised in order to gain in effectiveness and coherence and to make them sufficiently autonomous and flexible to be adapted as swiftly as possible and on a case-by-case basis to the actual risk, based on up-to date relevant information; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/11 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Requests clarification, and if necessary review, of the roles, duties, remits, limits, relationships and responsibilities of the key actors and structures at EU level for the management of medical threats \u2013 the European Commission, the ECDC, the EMA and the Member States, as well as more informal entities such as the Health Security Committee, the HEOF and the \u2018public health\u2019 group, composed of senior officials able to intervene in the decision-making process regarding the management of a health crisis \u2013 and calls for that information to be made publicly available; 3. Welcomes the fact that the Commission has committed itself to studying the possibility of a revision and a long-term reinforcement of the legal basis of the Health Security Committee; 4. Requests that special attention be paid to preparation between sectors within the framework of co- operation between Member States on the Health Security Committee; 5. Emphasises the need to reinforce cooperation between Member States, and coordination of Member States with the ECDC, so as to ensure coherent risk management in response to a pandemic in compliance with the International Health Regulation; 6. Calls for the continuation and improvement of cooperation and coordination among Member States, institutions and international and regional organisations, particularly in the early stages of a virus outbreak, in order to determine its severity and make appropriate management decisions; 7. Considers it advisable to reinforce the mandate of the Committee of Public Health, the action and role of which should be improved to provide better support for the Member States in achieving a coherent approach to preparedness for and response to public health threats and emergencies of international concern as defined in the IHR; 8. Urges the WHO to revise the definition of a pandemic, taking into consideration not only its geographical spread but also its severity; 9. Calls on the Member States to involve health professionals more closely at every stage in the preparation and application of strategies for preventing and combating pandemics; 10. Urges the European Union to allocate more resources to research and development regarding preventive measures in the field of public health care while conforming to its stated objective of allocating 3 % of European GDP to R&D; more specifically, calls for an increase in the investments dedicated to a better evaluation and anticipation of the impact of an influenza virus both between pandemics and at the beginning of a pandemic; 11. Calls for continued investment in national epidemiological, serological and virological surveillance centres; 12. Expresses its approval for the introduction of a procedure enabling the Member States to make group purchases of anti-viral vaccines and medicinal products on a voluntary basis, in order to obtain, for a given product, inter alia , equitable access, advantageous rates and flexibility for the order; 13. Recalls that according to current Union legislation on medicinal products, liability for the quality, safety and efficacy concerning the authorised indications of a medicinal product rests with the manufacturer, and calls for full application of this rule by Member States in all contracts for the procurement of vaccines, as an important factor in maintaining/regaining citizens\u2019 trust in vaccine safety; 14. Requests, within the framework of the common and responsible management of the supply of vaccines, that consideration be given to the possibility of easing access for developing countries to vaccine products in the event of a pandemic; EN C 199 E/12 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "Independence 15. Takes the view that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has to exercise its powers as an independent agency to assess and communicate the severity of infection risk and be given adequate means for all its tasks; 16. Invites the ECDC, with input from the WHO, to contribute to reviewing best practice on national influenza preparedness plans, and to make recommendations on best practice in areas such as crisis management techniques, vaccination and communication strategies; 17. Demands that increased vigilance and complete transparency be assured with regard to the evaluation of, and reporting on, medicinal products recommended in the event of health emergencies, and more particularly in genuine pandemic situations; 18. Underscores the need for studies independent of the pharmaceutical companies on vaccines and antiviral medications, including with regard to the monitoring of vaccination coverage; 19. Wishes to ensure that scientific experts have no financial or other interests in the pharmaceutical industry that could affect their impartiality; requests the development of a European code of conduct relating to the exercise of the function of a scientific expert in any European authority in charge of safety and of the management and anticipation of risks; requires that each expert subscribe to the ethical principles of this code of conduct before taking up his or her duties; 20. Asks that experts who are involved in the pharmaceutical sector, while they may be consulted, should be excluded from decision-making; 21. Calls in particular on the European Commission, with the support of the EMA, to improve the accelerated authorisation procedures for the placing on the market of medicinal products designed to respond to a health crisis - inter alia by making them suitable for different influenza strains varying levels of severity and differences in target groups - in such a way that proper clinical trials are carried out before a pandemic occurs, in order to ensure a full assessment of the risk-benefit balance associated with the use of those medicinal products for the relevant target groups and to come up with corresponding legislative proposals where necessary; Transparency 22. Calls for an assessment of the influenza vaccination strategies recommended in the EU and applied in Member States, covering the efficacy of the vaccines, their risk-benefit balance and the different target groups recommended, with a view to safe and effective use; 23. Calls on Member States to report the following information to the Commission before 8 September 2011: a) on different vaccines and anti-viral treatments, respectively: (i) the number of doses purchased, (ii) the total expenditure for the purchase, (iii) the number of doses actually used, (iv) the number of doses placed in storage, sent back to the manufacturer and reimbursed, or sold to other Member States or third countries, EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/13 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Commission, with the support of ECDC and EMA, to make a summary report about the information referred to in paragraph 23, broken down by Member State, before 8 March 2012 and to make it publicly available as an important contribution to the review of the current pandemic influenza preparedness plans; 25. Reminds the EMA of the regulatory requirement to make access available to all the documents relating to clinical trials, research protocols and undesirable effects of the medicinal products evaluated by its experts, including the vaccines and anti-viral drugs recommended as a means of combating H1N1 influenza; welcomes the new rules on access to documents adopted by the EMA in October 2010; 26. Recognises that conflicts of interest among experts who advise European public health authorities lead to suspicions of undue influence and harm the overall credibility of these public health authorities and their recommendations; considers that all conflicts of interest must be avoided; 27. Requests the adoption of a definition common to all European public health authorities of what constitutes a conflict of interest; 28. Calls for such conflicts of interest to be brought to Parliament\u2019s attention by means of an internal investigation carried out by the Committee on Budgetary Control with a view to determining whether payments to the aforementioned experts were made in a correct and transparent manner and whether the procedures normally employed by the European institutions to forestall such conflicts of interest were followed; 29. Calls for the declarations of interest of all experts who advise the European public health authorities to be published, including those of members of informal groups; 30. Is aware of the need to communicate risks and benefits more clearly and transparently to the public; underlines the necessity to arrive at a coherent message to the citizens as soon as a health hazard is evaluated; insists on the importance of consistent communication by the Member States regarding the informative contents of the message (e.g. the nature of the virus, the nature of the risk, how best to prevent it and the risks and benefits of prevention and/or treatment); 31. Calls for a global European strategic approach for the so-called \u2018at-risk\u2019 groups on how to reach them and communicate with them in case of pandemics; 32. Calls for the building of relationships of trust with the media concerned with disseminating public health messages; requests the setting-up of a select group of available experts to answer questions from journalists at all times, as well as the availability of a spokesperson; 33. Stresses the need for accountability of information professionals and the prudence required in the processing of health information messages, a fortiori in the context of a pandemic; 34.

        "C. whereas the spectacular rise in the volume of financial transactions in the global economy within the last decade \u2013 a volume which in 2007 reached a level 73,5 times higher than nominal world GDP, mainly owing to the boom on the derivatives market - illustrates the growing disconnection between financial transactions and the needs of the real economy, D. whereas the financial sector is heavily reliant on trading patterns, such as high-frequency trade (HFT), which are mainly targeted on short-term profits and are exposed to a high degree of leverage, which was one of the main causes of the financial crisis; whereas this has caused excessive price volatility and persistent deviations of stock and commodity prices from their fundamental levels, E. whereas the ability of businesses, governments and individuals to borrow and lend to one another is a crucial factor for the global economy; whereas the financial crisis has provided examples of unfortunate features of the international capital market; whereas for that reason it is necessary to strike a balance between the need to take steps that help to preserve financial stability and the need to maintain banks\u2019 ability to provide credit to the economy, F. whereas at the G20 summits held in Washington in 2008 and in Pittsburgh in 2009 an agreement was reached to implement reforms to strengthen financial-market regulatory regimes and surveillance in order to make financial institutions assume their fair share of responsibility for the turmoil, G. whereas the main costs of the crisis have been borne thus far by taxpayers, whose money governments in many parts of the world have used to bail out private banks and other financial institutions; whereas there are growing calls for financial institutions and stakeholders, which have enjoyed years of excessive returns on equities and excessive annual bonus payouts and accounted for the majority of global corporate profits, to contribute their fair share to meeting the costs, H. whereas in the EU in particular the cost of the bail-outs has worsened and accelerated the onset of a fiscal and debt crisis that has placed an unexpected burden on public budgets and severely endangered job creation, welfare state provision and the achievement of climate and environmental goals, I. whereas short-termism and speculation on the European government bond market were important aggravating factors in the eurozone sovereign deficit crisis in 2009-2010 and have exposed the close links between the drawbacks of the financial sector and the problems in guaranteeing the sustainability of public finances at times of excessive budgetary deficits and growing public and private debt, J. whereas the ineffectiveness of the Stability and Growth Pact in its present form and the disparities in competitiveness between Member States prompted the current debate on European economic governance, key components of which should be measures to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, mainly its preventive provisions, launch without any further delay unavoidable structural reforms and coordinate taxation policies and the fight against tax avoidance, fraud and evasion in order to safeguard tax justice, while gradually shifting the tax burden from labour towards capital and activities with strong negative externalities, K. whereas the crisis has highlighted the need to raise new, broad-based, fair and sustainable revenues and to enforce existing laws on tax evasion and improve their effectiveness in order to ensure that fiscal consolidation is effectively combined with long-term economic recovery and the sustainability of public finances, job creation and social inclusion, which are key priorities of the EU 2020 agenda, L. whereas the serious budget constraints resulting from the recent crisis come at a time when the EU has entered into highly important commitments at global level, mainly relating to climate-change targets, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and development aid, in particular for climate change adaptation and mitigation for developing countries, EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/17 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "M. whereas on 17 June 2010 the European Council stated that the EU should lead efforts to establish a global approach to the introduction of systems of levies and taxes on financial institutions and called for the issue of the introduction of a global financial transaction tax (FTT) to be explored and further developed, N. whereas it has already asked the Commission to carry out an impact assessment and provide an analysis of the positive merits of an FTT; resolving, therefore, to wait for this analysis before taking further action, 1. Takes note of the work carried out so far by the Commission to respond to the call made by Parliament in its resolution of 10 March 2010 for a feasibility study on financial transaction taxes at global and EU level; stresses the need for a comprehensive impact assessment and calls for the result of the impact assessment and possible concrete proposals to be made public by summer 2011, as announced in the Commission\u2019s communication on Taxation of the Financial Sector; emphasises that a balanced and thorough feasibility study on an EU FTT should be the basis on which the procedure for introducing such a tax is implemented; 2. Emphasises that an increase in the rates and the scope of existing taxation tools and further cuts in public expenditure can be neither a sufficient nor a sustainable solution to address the main challenges ahead at European and global level; stresses that, when addressing these challenges and discussing new systems of financing, one of the main priorities should be creating means to strengthen the European competitiveness and economic growth; 3. Stresses that a properly functioning single market is the EU\u2019s most valuable tool in a global and competitive world and the main driver of European growth; stresses that the focus should be on strengthening the internal market and on finding ways to spend national and European resources more intelligently by taking a holistic view of budget reform, covering both the expenditure and the revenue side of the budget; points out that spending needs to be delivered in a way which is designed to bring results and new financial instruments for budget delivery must be smart, integrated and flexible; 4. Emphasises that removing the remaining barriers within the internal market is the best way to promote real growth policies that deliver; notes that studies show that as much as EUR 200 to 300 billion could be saved annually if all barriers to the four freedoms were removed; 5. Stresses the importance of the relaunch of the Single Market and emphasises that the EU must draw up and effectively implement common rules to enable the internal market to serve as a relay for structural growth; stresses that efforts must focus on the driving force of the European economy: Europe\u2019s 20 million businesses, especially the small and medium-sized ones run by entrepreneurs and other creative spirits; 6. Emphasises that one of the European Union\u2019s greatest assets is its scale and that this asset must be used to the full by exploiting the potential of the Single Market and by using funds from the EU budget to bring added value to the public sector\u2019s efforts to stimulate the drivers of growth; 7. Stresses that the Commission should adopt a common strategic framework, outlining a comprehensive investment strategy which translates Europe 2020\u2019s targets and objectives into investment priorities and indentifies investment needs in relation to headline targets and flagship projects and the reforms needed to maximise the impact of investment supported by cohesion policy; 8. Stresses that one of the main advantages of innovative financing tools is that they can bring a double dividend, as they can at the same time contribute to the achievement of important policy goals, such as financial market stability and transparency, and offer significant revenue potential; stresses, in this context, that the effects of these tools on the negative externalities produced by the financial sector should also be taken into account; EN C 199 E/18 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "Taxation of the financial sector 9. Recalls that the financial damage caused by tax evasion and tax fraud in Europe is estimated at between EUR 200 and 250 billion every year; considers, therefore, that reducing tax fraud levels would help to reduce public deficits without increasing taxes; points out, against this background, that innovative financing should reinvigorate efforts by the Member States, the EU and the international community to combat tax avoidance and fraud as well as other forms of illicit capital flight which have a significant budgetary impact; 10. Stresses that in the aftermath of the crisis the EU needs to convince its citizens that it has the will and the tools to go forward with a balanced combination of a fiscal consolidation strategy and stimulus policies in order to safeguard a long-term economic recovery; 11. Considers that, while major progress has been achieved recently both on the regulatory and the supervisory fronts, tax policy is the missing dimension in the EU approach to the financial sector; 12. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s recognition that the financial sector is under-taxed, in particular because no VAT is levied on most financial services, and calls for innovative financing measures to raise more from this sector and contribute to shifting the burden of taxation away from working people; 13. Considers that the introduction of an FTT could help to tackle the highly damaging trading patterns in financial markets, such as some short-term and automated HFT transactions, and curb speculation; stresses that an FTT would thus have the potential to improve market efficiency, increase transparency, reduce excessive price volatility and create incentives for the financial sector to make long-term investments with added value for the real economy; 14. Emphasises the current revenue estimates for a low-rate FTT, which could, with its large tax base, yield nearly EUR 200 billion per year at EU level and $650 billion at global level; considers that this could constitute a substantial contribution by the financial sector to the cost of the crisis and to public finance sustainability; 15. Notes the developments in the debate concerning the FTT and the differing views concerning the feasibility, efficiency and effectiveness of such a tax, as well as the emerging discussion concerning a Financial Activities Tax (FAT), but notes that the G20 has so far been unable to promote meaningful joint initiatives on this matter; calls on the G20 leaders to speed up the negotiations for an agreement on the minimum common elements of a global FTT and to provide guidance on the desired future of these various kinds of taxation; 16. Favours the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, which would improve the functioning of the market by reducing speculation and help to finance global public goods and reduce public deficits; considers that the introduction of a tax on financial transactions ought to be as broadly based as possible and that the EU should promote the introduction of an FTT at global level, failing which, the EU should implement an FTT at European level as a first step; calls on the Commission swiftly to produce a feasibility study, taking into account the need for a global level playing field, and to come forward with concrete legislative proposals; 17. Points out that when examining options for the taxation of the financial sector at global and EU level the lessons learned from the introduction of sectoral transaction taxes at Member State level should be taken into account; 18. Stresses, further, that the flow of merely speculative transactions to other jurisdictions would have few detrimental effects, but could also have the potential to contribute to increased market efficiency; also stresses that not all actions deemed to be speculative are to be condemned, since certain forms of risk-taking can enhance the stability of EU financial markets; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/19 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "19. Stresses that within the centralised European central market clearing and settlement services could facilitate the introduction of an EU FTT, making it cheap in administrative terms and simple to implement; recalls, however, that the global and interconnected nature of the financial industry must be taken into account when the technical aspects of the FTT are designed; 20. Notes the recent Commission Communication as a first step in getting to grips with this topic; considers that the burden of proof regarding the possible advantages and/or drawbacks of the introduction of an FTT at EU level lies with the Commission and its impact assessment; 21. Notes that the recent Commission Communication announced an impact assessment of various options for the taxation of the financial sector and calls on the Commission also to address in its feasibility study the geographical asymmetry of transactions and revenues and the possibility of a graded or differ\u00ad entiated rate on the basis of the asset category, the tax incidence, the nature of the actor involved or the short-term and speculative nature of some types of transactions; asks the Commission to draw on all available research; 22. Calls on the Commission to analyse in its feasibility study the various possible options for an EU FTT and their impacts, including the benefits for the economy and society of reducing the scale of speculative financial transactions, which currently cause severe market distortions; 23. Stresses that an FTT should have the broadest base possible so as to guarantee a level playing field in the financial markets and not drive transactions to less transparent vehicles; considers, therefore, that the Commission\u2019s feasibility study should look into all transactions with financial assets, such as exchange- traded spot and derivatives transactions carried out on markets and Over-The-Counter (OTC); points out that the grading of an FTT, with differentiated rates across trading venues, could further enhance market stability by creating positive incentives for financial actors to move transactions away from OTC vehicles to more transparent and well-regulated venues; 24. Welcomes, in that context, the recent Commission proposals on OTC derivatives and short selling which impose explicit central clearing and trading repository requirements on all OTC derivatives trans\u00ad actions, thus making the implementation of this broad-based EU FTT technically feasible; 25. Insists on determining who will ultimately be paying the tax, as the burden usually falls on the consumer, who in this case would be retail investors and individuals; stresses the need for comprehensive rules on exemptions and thresholds, in order to prevent this; 26. Welcomes the recent proposals from the IMF, supported by the Commission, for a tax on bank assets to allow every country to levy between 2 and 4 % of GDP to finance future crisis-resolution mech\u00ad anisms; believes that bank levies should be proportionate to the systemic significance of the credit insti\u00ad tution concerned and to the level of risk involved in an activity; 27. Notes that bank levies, an FAT and an FTT each serve different economic objectives and have different revenue-raising potential; emphasises that, since they are based on balance-sheet positions, bank levies cannot take on the role of curbing financial speculation and further regulating shadow banking; in that connection, stresses, moreover, the importance of financial supervisory mechanisms and transparency in enhancing the resilience and stability of the financial system; 28. Notes the IMF proposal on a FAT and the Commission\u2019s recent commitment to conduct a compre\u00ad hensive impact assessment of its potential; stresses that an FAT is mainly a revenue-oriented tax tool that targets the financial sector, making it possible to tax economic rents and profits from excessive risk-taking, and as such could provide a solution to the current VAT exemption of the financial sector; EN C 199 E/20 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "29. Is aware of different options for the management of the additional revenues generated by the taxation of the financial sector at both national and European level; stresses that, the question regarding the purpose for which the revenues raised by an FTT should be used needs to be resolved and that, in order to give taxpayers a proper picture of the rationale behind additional financial sector taxation, the assessment of and prioritisation among different options should be seen as an essential element in the overall debate on innovative financing; stresses that, owing to its global nature, the revenue raised by a global FTT should be used to provide financing for global policy goals, such as development and poverty reduction in developing countries and the fight against climate change; notes the Commission\u2019s aim to increase the volume of the EU budget through the use of innovative financial instruments; is convinced that in order to safeguard the European added value of the aforementioned innovative financing tools a part of those revenues could be allocated to finance EU projects and policies; recalls that the Commission\u2019s recent Communication on a review of the EU budget regards EU taxation of the financial sector as a possible source of own resources; calls for a broad debate involving the EU institutions, national parliaments, EU stakeholders and civil society representatives on the choices available regarding those policies, the shares of revenue to be allocated at EU and national level and the various ways of achieving this; notes, with regard to the management of the share of the revenue allocated at national level, that all possible options should be evaluated, including the allocation of revenue to consolidate public finances; 30. Emphasises that the possible introduction of these new taxation tools in the financial sector should be analysed in the context of the existing tax environment in that sector, taking into account secondary effects and keeping a special focus on identifying synergies between old and new taxes; 31. Notes the Commission\u2019s aim to increase the volume of the EU budget through the use of innovative financial instruments and recognises the potential benefits of leveraging private sector funding with public money; is aware, however, that the use of special purpose vehicles for financing projects can result in increased contingent liabilities; believes, therefore, that such measures should be accompanied by fully transparent disclosure combined with appropriate investment guidelines, risk management, exposure limits and scrutiny and surveillance procedures, all to be established in a democratically accountable manner; Eurobonds and European project bonds 32. Notes that Eurobonds are increasingly referred to as a common debt management instrument; notes all recent proposals and initiatives to that effect; calls on the European Council and the Commission to provide an immediate response to call Parliament made in its resolution of 16 December 2010 ( 1 ) on the permanent crisis mechanism for the necessary political signal to be given for a Commission investigation into a future system of Eurobonds, with a view to determining the conditions under which such a system would be beneficial to all participating Member States and to the eurozone as a whole; 33. Supports the idea of issuing common European project bonds to finance Europe\u2019s significant infra\u00ad structure needs and structural projects in the framework of the EU 2020 agenda, anticipated new EU strategies, such as the new Strategy on Energy Infrastructure Development, and other large-scale projects; believes that EU project bonds would secure the investment required and create sufficient confidence to enable major investment projects to attract the support they need and would thus become an important mechanism for maximum leverage of public support; recalls that, if Europe is to be put on a sustainable footing, these projects must also contribute to the ecological transformation of our economies, paving the way for the zero-carbon economy; 34. Emphasises that greater use should be made of the EU budget to leverage investment; stresses that the norm for projects with long-term commercial potential should be that EU funds are used in partnership with the private banking sector, in particular via the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD); 35. Calls on the Commission and the European Central Bank to investigate the moral hazard impli\u00ad cations for Member States of financing critical infrastructure projects via EU project bonds or Eurobonds, especially where such infrastructure projects are transnational in scope; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/21 ( 1 ) Texts adopted, P7_TA(2010)0491. Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "Carbon tax 36. Stresses that the current taxation model should fully embrace the polluter-pays principle by using appropriate innovative financing tools in order gradually to shift the tax burden on to activities which pollute the environment, create significant greenhouse-gas emissions or use considerable volumes of resources; 37. Supports, therefore, a strengthening of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and a comprehensive revision of the energy taxation directive to make CO 2 emissions and energy content basic criteria for the taxation of energy products; 38. Stresses that both tools have a strong double dividend, providing major incentives to shift towards carbon-free and sustainable and renewable energy sources, on the one hand, and significant additional revenue, on the other; recalls, however, that the main motive for introducing a carbon tax is to change behaviour and production structures, since the expected revenue will diminish when production patterns shift towards sustainable and renewable energy sources; 39. Believes that a carbon tax and the revision of the energy taxation directive should set the minimum mandatory requirements for all Member States, leaving it to up to each Member State to go further on if it sees fit; 40. Emphasises that adequate transitional periods should be laid down in order to avoid carbon leakages and to prevent overwhelming burdens being shifted to low-income consumers; considers it useful, moreover, to provide for specific targeted measures in favour of low-income households and to enhance investment in public-sector infrastructure and in household energy efficiency; 41. Considers, however, that the scope for a global agreement at G20 level or within the WTO should be fully explored before such a tax is imposed on foreign imports into the EU in order to ensure that this border taxation adjustment tool does not give rise to a shortage of raw materials, on the one hand, and retaliatory measures by third countries against EU exports, on the other; 42. Draws attention, bearing in mind the rising energy demand in emerging countries, to the EU\u2019s imperative need to come up with adequate investments in the areas of energy supply and efficiency that will strengthen its energy infrastructure and reduce as much as possible its vulnerability to market fluctu\u00ad ations which could have negative consequences for the EU economy and the EU 2020 objectives; 43. Calls on the Member States to consider allocating revenues from climate-change taxation to finance R&D and measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions and combating global warming, stimulating energy efficiency, tackling energy poverty and improving energy infrastructure in the EU and in developing coun\u00ad tries; recalls, in this context, that under the ETS Directive at least 50 % of revenues from carbon dioxide emissions auctioning under the EU ETS should be earmarked for measures to combat climate change, including in the developing countries; 44. Notes that revolving financial instruments for energy efficiency measures represent an innovative way of financing climate-friendly projects; welcomes the creation of a dedicated financial facility, which could also attract private investors (in the framework of public-private partnerships (PPPs)), which would use uncommitted funds from the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) Regulation to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives; asks the Commission to assess carefully the effectiveness of this instrument and to analyse the potential for applying a similar approach, including initiatives on energy, energy efficiency and raw materials, to future unspent funds in the EU budget; 45. Notes the importance of energy efficiency and therefore urges the Commission and Member States to make effective use of the Structural Funds to increase energy efficiency in buildings, in particular residences; calls for the effective use of funding by the EIB and other public funding bodies, as well as coordination between EU and national funds and other forms of assistance which could leverage investment in energy efficiency with a view to achieving EU objectives; EN C 199 E/22 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "46. Reminds Member States of the possibility of applying reduced rates of VAT to services offering home improvement and enhanced energy efficiency; 47. Considers, also, that the thrifty use of resources and innovation in green technologies are of major importance in terms of competitiveness; 48. Stresses the need, as new, innovative taxation is developed and ultimately introduced, for an overall, cross-border and cross-sectoral assessment of different types of existing and planned financing, taxation and subsidies for environment and climate activities, what might be termed a \u2018de Larosi\u00e8re process for environment financing\u2019, in order to target these new tools more effectively and eliminate the possibility of overlapping and/or conflicting policies; 49. Acknowledges that a carbon tax would be an instrument to reduce emissions rather than a long-term source of income, as this source would eventually dry up should that instrument be effective; Financing for development 50. Calls for a re-affirmation by the Member States of their pledge to earmark 0,7 % of their gross national income GNI to official development assistance (ODA); deplores the fact that while all EU Member States have accepted this 0,7 % GNI target for spending, only Sweden, Luxembourg, Denmark and the Netherlands reached or exceeded this goal in 2008; 51. Recalls that, despite the global crisis, the European Union as a whole, including its Member States, remains the leading development aid donor, accounting for 56 % of the worldwide total, worth EUR 49 billion in 2009, which is confirmed by the EU governments\u2019 collective pledge to earmark 0,56 % and 0,70 % of GNI to ODA by 2010 and 2015 respectively; 52. Stresses the paramount importance of sound financial management in respect of all EU development and humanitarian aid, in particular because the European institutions involved in the decision-making and implementation of this aid must be fully accountable to European citizens and taxpayers; 53. Emphasises that innovative financing for development can complement traditional development aid mechanisms and so help them to achieve their goals on time; recalls that innovative financing instruments should be additional to the UN goal of 0,7 % of GDP devoted to development cooperation; stresses that innovative financing for development should be characterised by diversity of funding, in order to reach maximum revenue potential, but also be fully tailored to each country\u2019s priorities, with strong country ownership; emphasises, at the same time, the need for developing countries to step up their own efforts in the area of taxation, mainly as regards tax collection and the fight against tax evasion, which are crucial to achieving a sound fiscal policy; 54. Stresses that effective, high-quality development aid delivery calls for a particular effort in terms of donor coordination and governance arrangements; believes that tackling the problem of fragmentation in European development aid, which causes inefficiencies which have both financial and political consequences, would bring efficiency gains estimated at up to EUR 6 billion a year for Member States and also facilitate the work of partner country administrations; 55. Recalls that USD 300 billion will be needed in order to achieve the MDG objectives by 2015; deplores the fact that, despite their recent declaration at the UN\u2019s High Level Summit on the MDGs in September 2010, a majority of developed nations have not yet honoured their 2005 commitment to increase development aid and points out that a much more concerted effort has to be made; emphasises that it is not acceptable that innovative financing mechanisms (IFMs) might be seen as encouraging certain countries to renounce official development assistance (ODA); stresses that ODA commitments and inno\u00ad vative financing mechanisms must be seen as essential and complementary in the fight against poverty; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/23 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "56. Stresses that public supervision and transparency of innovative financing systems are a sine qua non for their introduction, reflecting the lessons of the recent financial and food crises; 57. Stresses the urgent need to improve EU coordination of wealth-creation measures in local markets and that promoting innovative financing for development should not focus only on increasing taxation but should also explore other paths, such as enhancing domestic revenue, which can be best achieved through the recognition and protection of property rights, land mapping, and improving the business and investment environment in developing countries; 58. Recalls that major pandemic diseases \u2013 AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria \u2013 which strike developing countries, and sub-Saharan Africa in particular, constitute a major obstacle to achieving the MDGs; recalls, in this context, that a solidarity contribution levied on air tickets is an important financial tool in addressing health problems and one that needs to be further developed; calls, in particular, on the Commission to examine further financing mechanisms to address global health issues, and to facilitate access to medicines in poor countries; 59. Points out that climate change will affect developing countries in particular and takes the view that funding measures to alleviate the effects of climate change and reduce energy poverty will contribute to achieving the MDGs; 60. Welcomes the fact that the Final Declaration of the UN Summit on the MDGs, adopted on 22 September 2010, refers, for the first time, specifically to the role of innovative financing in achieving the MDGs; 61. Underlines the success of innovative financing mechanisms to date, in particular the UNITAID international facility for the purchase of drugs, the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) and the advance market commitment (AMC) for vaccination against pneumococcal disease, which have to date raised over USD 2 billion; notes that other innovative financing mechanisms have also proved effective, for example debt-for-nature or debt-for-health swaps or bunker fuel taxes; 62. Recalls the firm support given by a number of European Heads of State or Government to the implementation of a tax on financial transactions at the UN Summit on the MDGs in September 2010 and expects decisive action from them in support of this commitment; 63. Calls on the Member States which have not yet done so to join the pilot group on innovative financing mechanisms set up in 2006 and participate in all existing mechanisms, including the solidarity contribution on airline tickets; 64. Urges the Commission to propose the implementation of innovative development financing mech\u00ad anisms at EU level; 65. Calls on the institutions and EU governments to examine closely the possibility of creating a worldwide lottery to fund measures to combat hunger, as proposed by the World Food Programme, along the lines of the Food Project; 66. Takes the view that ODA will fail to eradicate poverty if the G20, the EU and financial institutions do not take a determined stance in opposing corrupt administrations in recipient countries; stresses, therefore, the need to upgrade the EU\u2019s assistance in the area of the strengthening of tax authorities, the judiciary and anti-corruption agencies in developing countries; urges the EU Member States to combat bribery committed by companies which are domiciled in their jurisdictions, but which have operations in developing countries; EN C 199 E/24 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "67. Recalls that an estimated EUR 800 billion, i.e. 10 times the amount of ODA, is lost annually from developing countries through illicit practices such as unlawful capital flows and tax evasion, the prevention and reduction of which could prove decisive in achieving the MDGs; urges the EU and its Member States to place the fight against tax havens, corruption and harmful tax structures at the top of the agenda in all international fora so as to enable developing countries to increase their domestic revenues; 68. Recalls the collective responsibility of the G20 to mitigate the impact of the crisis on developing countries, which have been hard hit by its indirect effects; 69. Urges that, in order to achieve transparency in ODA, accountability should be promoted through the strengthening of national control mechanisms and parliamentary scrutiny of aid; calls on the EU and the G20 to pursue their agenda of cracking down on tax havens and tax secrecy, promoting country-by-country reporting; 70. Calls on the Council and the Commission to promote and work towards the implementation of innovative financing instruments for development, such as an international financial transaction tax, transport levies, measures to combat illicit capital flows and the reduction or alleviation of remittance costs; 71. Notes that the economic and financial crisis will throw many developing countries into a new debt crisis, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to renew their efforts to alleviate the debt burden on developing countries; 72. Recalls that developing countries are the least well-equipped to deal with climate change, and are, generally speaking, likely to be the principal victims of this phenomenon; calls for the implementation of the EU financial pledge given under the Copenhagen Accord and in the context of the Global Climate Change Alliance; urges the EU to assume a pivotal role in joint initiatives by the industrialised countries to make a larger and more specific contribution to supporting development in the third world, to which they have a historic responsibility; * * * 73.

        "L. whereas the Commission has noted that there is a social gradient in health status in all the EU Member States (Commission Communication of 20 October 2010 entitled \u2018Solidarity in Health: Reducing Health Inequalities in the EU\u2019); and whereas the World Health Organisation defines this social gradient as being the link between socioeconomic inequalities and inequalities in the areas of health and access to healthcare, M. whereas numerous projects and studies have confirmed that the onset of overweight and obesity in particular is characterised by early disparities linked to the socioeconomic environment and that the highest incidence rates of overweight and obesity are registered in lower socioeconomic groups; whereas this situation could lead to even greater health and socioeconomic inequalities owing to the increased risk of obesity-related diseases, N. whereas despite the socioeconomic and environmental progress that has led to an overall improvement in people\u2019s health status over long periods, a number of factors, such as hygiene, living and working conditions, malnutrition, education, income, alcohol consumption and smoking, are still having a direct impact on health inequalities, O. whereas climate change is expected to result in a number of potential health impacts through increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and floods, through changing patterns of infectious disease, and via increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation; whereas not all EU countries are equally prepared to address these challenges, P. whereas health inequalities are not only the result of a host of economic, environmental and lifestyle- related factors, but also of problems relating to access to healthcare, Q. whereas health inequalities are also linked to problems in accessing healthcare, both for economic reasons (not so much for major treatment, which is dealt with correctly by the Member States, but rather for everyday treatment, such as dental and eye care) and as a result of poor distribution of medical resources in certain areas of the EU, R. whereas the dearth of medical professionals in certain parts of the EU and the fact that they can easily move to other parts of the EU is a real problem, and whereas this situation is resulting in major inequalities in terms of access to healthcare and patient safety, S. whereas people living in remote and island areas continue to have limited access to prompt and high-quality healthcare, T. whereas patients living with chronic diseases or conditions form a specific group which suffers inequalities in access to diagnosis and care, social and other support services, and disadvantages including financial strain, poor access to employment, social discrimination and stigma, U. whereas violence against women is a widespread phenomenon in all countries and among all social classes and has a dramatic effect on the physical and emotional health of women and children, V. whereas infertility is a medical condition recognised by the World Health Organisation which has a particular impact on women\u2019s health, and whereas the UK National Awareness Survey has shown that over 94 % of women suffering from infertility also suffer from forms of depression, W. whereas there are wide disparities between Member States in terms of access to fertility treatment, EN C 199 E/28 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "X. whereas, according to Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical office, unemployment across the 27 EU Member States reached 9,6 % in September 2010, and whereas the Council of the European Union\u2019s Social Protection Committee, in its opinion of 20 May 2010, expressed concern that the present economic and financial crisis will adversely affect people\u2019s access to healthcare and Member States\u2019 health budgets, Y. whereas the current economic and financial crisis may have a severe impact on the healthcare sector in several EU Member States, on both the supply and the demand sides, Z. whereas the restrictions due to the current economic and financial crisis, combined with the consequences of the forthcoming demographic challenge that the Union will have to face, could seriously undermine the financial and organisational sustainability of Member States\u2019 healthcare systems, thus hindering equal access to care on their territories, AA. whereas the combination of poverty and other forms of vulnerability, such as childhood or old age, disability or minority background, further increases the risks of health inequalities, and whereas, vice versa, ill health can lead to poverty and/or social exclusion, AB. whereas early years have lifelong effects on many aspects of health and well-being \u2013 from obesity, heart disease and mental health, to education, professional achievement, economic status and quality of life, AC. whereas health inequalities have significant economic implications for the EU and for Member States; whereas losses linked to health inequalities have been estimated to cost around 1,4 % of GDP, AD. whereas in many EU countries equitable access to healthcare is not guaranteed, either in practice or in law, for undocumented migrants, AE. whereas cases still arise in the Member States of members of various social groups (for example, people with disabilities) being faced with obstacles to equal admission to healthcare establishments, which limits their access to health services, AF. whereas, with their ageing populations, the Member States are having to deal with problems relating to dependency and an increasing need for geriatric care and treatment; whereas a change in the approach to organising healthcare is therefore needed; and whereas inequalities relating to access to healthcare for elderly people are on the increase, 1. Welcomes the key suggestions made by the Commission in its Communication entitled \u2018Solidarity in health: reducing health inequalities in the EU\u2019: (1) making a more equitable distribution of health part of our overall goals for social and economic development; (2) improving the data and knowledge bases (including measuring, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting); (3) building commitment across society for reducing health inequalities; (4) meeting the needs of vulnerable groups; and (5) developing the contribution of EU policies to the reduction of health inequalities; 2. Stresses the importance of healthcare services being provided in a manner consistent with fundamental rights; points to the need to maintain and improve universal access to healthcare systems and to affordable healthcare; 3. Points to the importance of improving access to disease prevention, health promotion and primary and specialised healthcare services, and reducing the inequalities between different social and age groups, and emphasises that these objectives could be achieved by optimising public spending on preventive and curative healthcare and targeted programmes for vulnerable groups; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/29 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "4. Calls on the Commission and Member States to press ahead with their efforts to tackle socio- economic inequalities, which would ultimately make it possible to reduce some of the inequalities relating to healthcare; furthermore, on the basis of the universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity, calls on the Commission and Member States to focus on the needs of vulnerable groups, including disadvantaged migrant groups and people belonging to ethnic minorities, children and adolescents, people with disabilities, with a special focus on mental illness, patients diagnosed with chronic diseases or conditions, older people, people living in poverty, and people affected by alcoholism and drug addiction; 5. Calls on the Member States to ensure that the most vulnerable groups, including undocumented migrants, are entitled to and are provided with equitable access to healthcare; calls on the Member States to assess the feasibility of supporting healthcare for irregular migrants by providing a definition based on common principles for basic elements of healthcare as defined in their national legislation; 6. Calls on the Member States to take account of the specific health protection needs of immigrant women, with particular reference to the guaranteed provision by health systems of appropriate language mediation services; those systems should develop training initiatives enabling doctors and other profes\u00ad sionals to adopt an intercultural approach based on recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the sensitivities of people from different geographical regions; priority must also be given to measures and information campaigns to combat female genital mutilation, including severe penalties for those who practise it; 7. Calls on the EU and the Member States rapidly to find ways of combating ethnic discrimination, particularly in certain Member States where Council Directive 2000/43/EC has not been implemented and where women from ethnic minorities have little or no social protection or access to healthcare; 8. Calls on the Member States to promote access to high-quality legal advice and information in coor\u00ad dination with civil society organisations to help ordinary members of the public, including undocumented migrants, to learn more about their individual rights; 9. Emphasises that the economic and financial crisis and the austerity measures taken by Member States, in particular on the supply side, may lead to a reduction in the level of funding for public health and health promotion, disease prevention and long-term care services as a result of budget cuts and lower tax revenues, while the demand for health and long-term care services may increase as a result of a combination of factors that contribute to the deterioration of the health status of the general population; 10. Stresses that health inequalities in the EU represent a substantial burden to Member States and their healthcare systems and that the effective functioning of the internal market and strong and, if possible, coordinated public policies on prevention can contribute to improvements in this field; 11. Stresses that countering socio-economic factors such as obesity, smoking, etc., the accessibility of healthcare systems (jeopardised by the non-reimbursement of the cost of care and of medicines, inadequate prevention and the fragmentation of medical demography) and effective diagnosis should be considered key aspects of measures to combat health inequality and that, in addition, the accessibility and affordability of pharmaceutical treatments should also be regarded as a key aspect of individual people\u2019s health; therefore calls on Member States to ensure that the Transparency Directive (89/105/EEC) is being properly imple\u00ad mented and that the conclusions from the 2008 Commission Communication on the Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry are being appropriately addressed; 12. Stresses that healthcare is not and should not be regarded as a general good or service; EN C 199 E/30 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "13. Calls on the Council and the Member States to evaluate and implement new measures to improve the effectiveness of their health expenditure, in particular by investing in preventive healthcare so as to reduce future longer-term costs and social burdens, and to restructure healthcare systems in order to provide equitable access to high-quality healthcare (in particular basic medical care) without discrimination throughout the EU, and encourages the Commission to study the use of existing European funds in order to further promote investment in health infrastructure, research and training and to promote and step up disease prevention; 14. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that equitable access to healthcare and treatment options for older patients are included in their health policies and programmes and to make adequate access to healthcare and treatments for older people a priority for \u20182012 European Year for Active Ageing and Intergenerational Solidarity\u2019; calls on the Member States to promote initiatives in order to tackle social isolation in elderly patients as it has a significant impact on patients\u2019 longer-term health; stresses the need for the European Union and its Member States to anticipate, through an appropriate long-term strategy, the social and economic impact of the ageing of the European population, in order to guarantee the financial and organisational sustainability of healthcare systems, as well as equal and continued delivery of care for patients; 15. Calls on the Member States to improve their capacity to monitor closely, at national, regional and local levels, the health and social impact of the crisis; 16. Calls on the Commission to foster the pooling of experience in connection with health education, healthy lifestyle promotion, prevention, early diagnosis and appropriate treatments, in particular in relation to drinking, smoking, diet and obesity and drugs; calls on Member States to promote physical activity, good nutrition and \u2018Healthy Schools\u2019 programmes targeted at children, in particular in more disadvantaged areas, and to improve levels of personal, social and health education, with view to promoting healthier behaviour and encouraging positive lifestyle-related behaviour; 17. Encourages all the Member States to invest in social, educational, environmental and health infra\u00ad structure in line with the principle of \u2018health in all policies\u2019,while coordinating measures concerning the qualification, training and mobility of health professionals, thus guaranteeing the capacity and sustainability of the health infrastructure and workforce at both EU and national level; 18. Emphasises that health inequalities in the Union will not be overcome without a common and overall strategy for the European health workforce, including coordinated policies for resource management, education and training, minimum quality and safety standards, and registration of professionals; 19. Calls on the Member States to ensure that information on health, healthy lifestyles, healthcare, prevention opportunities, early diagnosis of diseases and suitable treatments is available in a form and in languages that everyone can understand, using new information and communication technologies, with particular reference to online health services; 20. Calls on the Member States to promote the introduction of telemedicine technologies, which can significantly reduce geographical disparities in access to certain types of healthcare, with particular reference to specialist care, in particular in border regions; 21. Calls on the Member States to promote public policies aimed at ensuring healthy life conditions for all infants, children and adolescents, including pre-conception care, maternal care and measures to support parents and, more particularly, pregnant and breast-feeding women, in order to ensure a healthy start to life for all newborns and avoid further health inequalities, thereby recognising the importance of investing in early child development and life course approaches; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/31 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "22. Calls on the Member States to ensure that all pregnant women and children, irrespective of their status, are entitled to and actually receive social protection as defined in their national legislation; 23. Recalls the EU\u2019s obligation, under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to guarantee the right of persons with disabilities to the highest attainable standard of health without discrimi\u00ad nation on the grounds of disability; insists that the inclusion of disability in all relevant health measurement indicators is a key step towards meeting this obligation; 24. Calls on the EU and the Member States to include the health status of women and the question of ageing (older women) as factors in gender mainstreaming and to use gender budgeting in their health policies, programmes and research, from the development and design stage through to impact assessment; calls on the EU-funded framework research programmes and public funding agencies to include a gender impact assessment in their policies and to provide for the compilation and analysis of gender- and age- specific data with a view to identifying key differences between women and men in relation to health, in order to support policy change, and to introduce and collate epidemiological tools to analyse the causes of the life-expectancy gap between men and women; 25. Considers that the EU and the Member States should guarantee women easy access to methods of contraception and the right to safe abortion; 26. Calls on the Commission to provide the Member States with examples of good and best practices to encourage more uniform access to fertility treatment; 27. Urges the EU and the Member States to focus on women\u2019s human rights, in particular by preventing, banning and prosecuting those guilty of the forced sterilisation of women and female genital mutilation; 28. Calls on the EU and the Member States to recognise male violence against women as a public health issue, whatever form it takes; 29. Calls on the EU and the Member States to take the necessary measures, in relation to access to assisted reproductive technologies (ART), to eliminate discrimination against women on the grounds of marital status, sexual orientation or ethnic or cultural origins; 30. Calls on the Member States to follow the World Health Organisation in recognising obesity as a chronic disease and thus to provide access to obesity-prevention programmes and guarantee access to treatment with proven evidence of a positive medical outcome for persons suffering from obesity who require medical treatment, also with a view to preventing the onset of further diseases; 31. Calls on the EU and the Member States to mainstream gender into tobacco control, as recommended by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and to introduce anti-smoking campaigns targeting young girls and women; 32. Calls on the Member States to encourage and support medical and pharmaceutical research into illnesses that primarily affect women, with reference to all phases of their lives and not only their repro\u00ad ductive years; 33. Calls on the Member States to solve problems of inequality in access to healthcare that affect people\u2019s everyday lives, for example in the areas of dentistry and ophthalmology; EN C 199 E/32 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "34. Suggests that the EU and the Member States introduce coherent policies and supportive measures aimed at women who do not work or who hold jobs in sectors where they are not covered by personal health insurance and seek ways of providing such women with insurance; 35. Urges the Commission, in the context of its collaboration with the competent authorities of the Member States, to promote best practices on pricing and reimbursement of the cost of medicines, including workable models for pharmaceutical price differentiation so as to optimise affordability and reduce inequalities in access to medicines; 36. Recalls that the adoption of a European patent, with appropriate language arrangements and a unified dispute-settlement system, is crucial for the revitalisation of the European economy; 37. Notes that the work already done in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection with regard to product safety and advertising, among other subjects, has helped to address certain aspects of health inequality in the EU, and, in that connection, stresses the importance of closely monitoring the information which pharmaceuticals firms provide to patients, particularly the most vulnerable and least well- informed groups, and the need for an effective and independent system of pharmacovigilance; 38. Calls on the Member States to adapt their health systems to the needs of the most disadvantaged by developing methods for setting the fees charged by healthcare professionals which guarantee access to care for all patients; 39. Urges the Commission to do its utmost to encourage Member States to offer reimbursements to patients and to do everything necessary to reduce inequalities in access to medication for the treatment of those conditions or illnesses, such as post-menopausal osteoporosis and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, which are not reimbursable in certain Member States, and to do so as a matter of urgency; 40. Emphasises that, in addition to national governments, in many countries regional authorities play an important role in public health, health promotion, disease prevention and the provision of health services and thus need to be actively involved; points out that regional and local governments and other stake\u00ad holders also have a vital contribution to make, including within workplaces and schools; in particular as regards health education, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, effective disease prevention and early screening and diagnosis of diseases; 41. Calls on the Member States to support a \u2018local care approach\u2019 and to provide integrated healthcare, accessible at local or regional level, enabling patients to be better supported in their own local and social environment; 42. Encourage all the Member States to re-evaluate their policies on matters which have a significant impact on health inequalities, such as tobacco, alcohol, food, pharmaceuticals and public health and healthcare delivery; 43. Encourages the Member States to develop partnerships in border regions in order to share the cost of infrastructure and personnel and reduce inequalities with regard to health, particularly in respect of access to state-of-the-art equipment; 44. Asks the Commission to study the effects of decisions based on national and regional assessments of the effectiveness of medicines and medical devices on the internal market, including in terms of patient access, innovation in new products and medical practices, which are some of the main elements affecting health equality; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/33 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "45. Considers that the implementation of Directive 2011/24/EU on Patients\u2019 Rights in Cross-Border Healthcare should be followed by impact assessments in order to measure as accurately as possible its effectiveness in combating health inequalities and to ensure that it maintains an adequate level of public protection and safeguards patient safety, particularly in terms of the geographical allocation of medical resources, both human and material; 46. Notes that high-quality and efficient cross-border healthcare calls for increased transparency of information for the public, patients, regulators and healthcare providers on a wide range of issues, including patients\u2019 rights, access to redress and the regulation of healthcare professionals; 47. Deplores the fact that the directive on cross-border healthcare was not accompanied by a legislative proposal on the mobility of healthcare professionals, taking into account the risk of a \u2018brain drain\u2019 within the EU, which would dangerously increase the geographical inequalities in certain Member States, and calls on the Commission to remedy this failure, possibly in the context of the future revision of the directive on professional qualifications (2005/36/EC); 48. Urges the Member States to implement fully the existing Professional Qualifications Directive (2005/36/EC); with regard to the complexity of medical qualifications, encourages the Commission, in its evaluation and review of the directive, to address some of the regulatory gaps that have the potential to leave patients vulnerable to harm and compromise their right to safe treatment; invites the Commission, further, to consider whether to make registration with the IMI System mandatory for competent authorities and improve the extent to which competent authorities can proactively share disciplinary information about healthcare professionals by creating an appropriate alert mechanism; 49. Urges the Commission, in its forthcoming legislative proposal on professional qualifications, to move towards a strengthened mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in the Member States; 50. Points out that increased innovation often leads to greater accessibility of treatment, which is particularly relevant for isolated or rural communities; 51. Calls on the Commission to foster, in conjunction with the Member States, the development of telemedicine services as a means of reducing geographical disparities in healthcare provision at both regional and local levels; 52. Calls on the Council and the Commission to give greater recognition within the Europe 2020 strategy to the fact that physical and mental health and well-being are key to fighting exclusion, to include comparative indicators stratified by socio-economic status and the state of public health in the procedures for monitoring the Europe 2020 strategy, and to take account of age-based discrimination, in particular in relation to clinical trials for treatments better suited to the needs of elderly people; 53. Considers that the EU and the Member States must support civil-society and women\u2019s organisations that promote women\u2019s human rights, including their sexual and reproductive rights, the right to a healthy lifestyle and the right to work, with a view to ensuring that women have a voice on European and national health policy issues; 54. Encourages all the Member States to foster and build capacity and international exchanges and cooperation between all relevant multi-sectoral stakeholders in developing and implementing policies that reduce health inequalities; EN C 199 E/34 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Member States to support and implement a joined-up approach to policy-making at local, regional and national level, thereby striving towards a Health in All Policies Approach (HiAP); 56. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop a common set of indicators to monitor health inequalities by age, sex, socio-economic status and geographic location and the risks resulting from alcoholism and drug addiction, and to establish a methodology for auditing the health situation in Member States with the aim of identifying and prioritising areas in need of improvement and best practices; 57. Stresses that health inequalities are rooted in social inequalities in terms of living conditions and models of social behaviour linked to gender, race, educational standards, employment and the unequal distribution not only of income but also of medical assistance, sickness prevention and health promotion services; 58. Stresses that health risks to members of disadvantaged (poorer) social categories are what is behind the problem of health inequalities, bearing in mind that these risks are being aggravated by a combination of poverty and other vulnerabilities; 59. Calls on the Commission to ensure that the tasks of reducing health inequalities and improving access to physical and mental health services are fully addressed and integrated into its current initiatives, such as the Partnership on Healthy and Active Ageing and the EU Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, and into future initiatives on early childhood development and youth policies focusing on education, training and employment; 60. Calls for better coordination between the EU agencies which have a major role to play in combating health inequalities, in particular between the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work; 61. Calls on the Commission to assist Member States in making better use of the Open Method of Coordination in order to support projects to address factors underlying health inequalities; 62. Calls on the Commission to develop ways to engage and involve all the relevant stakeholders at European level in promoting the uptake and dissemination of good practice in the public health sphere; 63. Draws attention to the particular importance, among the various health determinants, of a varied, high-quality diet, and, in that connection, urges the Commission to make greater use of the effective programmes established under the CAP (free distribution of milk and fruit in schools and of food to the most deprived groups); 64. Calls on the Member States to create a network of specific social, health and counselling services, with dedicated telephone helplines, for women, couples and families, with the aim of preventing domestic violence and providing qualified professional help and support for those needing it, in cooperation with the other bodies in the field; 65. Calls on the Commission to assist Member States in making better use of EU cohesion policy and structural funds in order to support projects that contribute to addressing the social determinants of health and reducing health inequalities; calls, further, on the Commission to help Member States make better use of the PROGRESS programme; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/35 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Commission to mainstream an approach based on the economic and environmental determinants of health and on \u2018equity and health in all policies\u2019 when developing all internal and external EU policies, especially with a view to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and in particular good maternal health; 68. Urge all the Member States to recognise the importance of health for society and to look beyond a GDP-based approach when measuring societal, community and individual development; 69. Calls on the Council to promote efforts to tackle health inequalities as a policy priority in all Member States, taking into account the social determinants of health and lifestyle-related risk factors, such as alcohol, tobacco and nutrition, by means of actions in policy areas such as consumer policy, employment, housing, social policy, the environment, agriculture and food, education, living and working conditions and research, in keeping with the \u2018health in all policies\u2019 principle; 70. Calls on the Commission to support actions financed under the current and future Public Health Action Plans to address the social determinants of health; 71. Calls on the Commission to draw up guidelines to improve the mechanisms to monitor inequalities in health across the EU (between and within Member States) by enhancing data collection by compiling more systematic and comparable information that complements existing data on health inequalities and by means of regular monitoring and analysis; 72. Asks the Commission to consider drafting a proposal for a Council recommendation, or any other appropriate Community initiative, aimed at encouraging and supporting the development by Member States of integrated national or regional strategies to reduce health inequalities; 73.

Calls on the Commission to apply the HiAP approach to EU-level policy-making and carry out effective impact assessments that take health equity outcomes into account; 75. Argues that open, competitive and properly functioning markets can stimulate innovation, investment and research in the healthcare sector, and recognises that this must be accompanied by strong financial support for public research in order to further develop sustainable and effective healthcare models and to promote the development of new technologies and their applications in this field (e.g. telemedicine), and by a common health technology assessment methodology, all of which should benefit every individual, including those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, whilst taking into account the ageing of the population; 76. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to support public information and awareness- raising programmes and step up dialogue with civil society, the social partners and NGOs regarding health and medical services; 77.

        "J. whereas the \u2018mapping survey\u2019 led by the ITC demonstrates that further donor coordination is needed in the area of taxation and development, K. whereas the existence of a large informal sector in the economy is holding back the mobilisation of domestic resources, L. whereas many developing countries are missing out on the commodity boom by failing to receive a decent share of mineral royalties which are justified, M. whereas many developing countries do not even attain a minimum tax level which would be necessary to fund public services and international commitments like poverty reduction, N. whereas tax provides a source of income that is potentially more stable and sustainable than aid flows and fosters the ownership of the respective countries in a better way, O. whereas reporting on a consolidated basis often makes it difficult to identify companies to be taxed and to determine the right tax level due to their complex corporate structures and the distribution of economic activity between them, P. whereas so-called vulture funds, often based in tax havens, increasingly buy up the debt of developing countries at a huge discount and afterwards sue for the original amount of debt (frequently with interest and penalty fees) and in doing so, restrict to a substantial degree the extent to which developing countries can act thanks to their additional tax revenues, Q. whereas there are no laws that cap the amount of profits that a vulture fund can collect through litigating against developing countries to collect default debt and whereas there are no regulatory structures that disclose who vulture funds are and also how much they paid for this debt that was previously considered worthless, R. whereas in many developing countries there exist multiple corporate income tax rates based not only on income and dividends, but also on business sectors, meaning that the sectoral allocation of resources is distorted by differences in tax rates, S. whereas tax compliance should be defined as seeking to pay at the right place, at the right time, where \u2018right\u2019 means that the economic substance of the transactions undertaken coincides with the place and form in which they are reported for taxation purposes, The importance of taxation for meeting the MDGs 1. Agrees with the Commission that efficient and fair tax systems are crucial for poverty reduction, good governance and state-building; 2. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s initiative to strengthen the capacities of good tax governance for devel\u00ad opment and sees the need for a regulatory framework designed to support international tax cooperation, transparency, public and private sector development and economic growth; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/39 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "3. Highlights that tax-to-GDP ratios in developing countries range between 10 and 20 %, as opposed to between 25 and 40 % in developed countries; regrets that too little support has been given so far by donors to tax-related assistance; in this context, welcomes the Commission\u2019s proposal to provide enhanced support for assisting developing countries in tax reforms and strengthening tax administrations regarding EDF for ACP States, the Development Cooperation Instrument and the ENP and Partnership Instrument, and support for national supervisory bodies, parliaments and non-state actors; 4. Notes that more emphasis should be placed on efforts to undertake capacity building within developing countries in order to help them make effective use of the exchange of information and effec\u00ad tively counter tax evasion with their own, internal, legislation; Difficulties encountered by developing countries in raising tax revenues 5. Notes with concern that the tax system in many poor countries remains characterised by extremely narrow tax bases, tax exemptions for the elite, corporate tax holidays providing a strong incentive for tax avoidance, as taxed enterprises can enter into economic relationships with exempt ones to shift their profits, massive revenues from natural resources going unaccounted for, and large illicit capital flows related to massive tax evasion; 6. Stresses that tax revenue must not be regarded as an alternative to foreign aid, but rather as an integral part of public revenue facilitating these countries\u2019 development; 7. Points out that efficient, progressive and equitable taxation systems are crucial for development as they contribute to financing the provision of public goods and to state building and good governance, that the goal of poor countries must be to replace foreign aid dependency with tax self-sufficiency, and that tax evasion and avoidance are, however, hampering these goals in development; 8. Deplores the fact that tax havens weaken democratic governance, make economic crime more profitable, encourage rent-seeking and increase the inequitable distribution of tax revenues; urges the EU to make the fight against tax havens and corruption a top priority of the agenda in international finance and development institutions; 9. Points out that tax evasion represents a considerable financial loss for developing countries, and that measures to combat tax havens and tax evasion are one of the priorities for the EU with a view to providing developing countries with effective help in gaining access to their tax revenues; recalls the need to take the appropriate measures in that respect at European and international level, in accordance with the commitments given, in particular, by the G20; 10. Recalls that, while the positive impact of EPAs will be felt only in the medium to long term, losses of revenue are an immediate consequence of reductions in customs tariffs; 11. Underlines that further attention should be paid to difficulties encountered by developing countries in raising domestic revenues in a globalised context, multiple exemptions being granted to large domestic and foreign companies in order to attract investments; calls on the EU to help developing countries in building up tax systems that allow them to benefit from the process of globalisation; 12. Stresses that the poorest countries are having difficulties in compensating for the decline in trade taxes resulting from the current global context of trade liberalisation, by replacing them with other types of domestic resources, since at best about 30 % of lost trade taxes have been replaced; EN C 199 E/40 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "13. Stresses that tax havens, by increasing competition for mobile capital, encroach upon the sovereignty of developing countries to tax income from capital as a means to widen the tax base, while they already have a narrower tax base than rich countries; 14. Recalls that asymmetry of information, which results from tax havens\u2019 secrecy rules, reduces the efficiency of international financial markets, since it has led to higher risk premiums and thereby increased borrowing costs for both rich and poor countries; 15. Recognises that the qualitative and quantitative improvement in developing countries\u2019 domestic revenue mobilisation will bear fruit over the long term; calls on the European Union to maintain its offer of assistance in all its forms for as long as the developing countries consider it necessary for the financing of their own development; Supporting effective, efficient, fair and sustainable tax systems 16. Reiterates that good governance and the quality of institutions represent the most important driver for economic prosperity; accordingly, urges the Commission to assist the tax authorities, the judiciary and the anticorruption agencies in developing countries in their efforts to build up a progressive and sustainable tax system that will eventually bring a \u2018governance dividend\u2019 through increased legitimacy and account\u00ad ability, and to effectively integrate the principles of good governance in tax matters into the programming, implementation and monitoring of country and regional strategy papers; urges Member States to implement their commitments regarding their aid for tax and to combat bribery committed by companies domiciled in their jurisdictions but which have operations in developing countries; recommends that the Commission include national parliaments of the developing countries in the budgetary process, thereby fostering a harmonious relationship and promoting greater transparency in this process; 17. Points out that good governance in tax matters cannot be exported or imposed from outside, and that it is up to each of the countries to decide its own tax policy; in that context, calls on the Commission and the national governments not to hamper, and to cooperate with, any countries which opt, consistently and fairly, for an increase in taxation that affects foreign undertakings present on their territory, particularly those operating in the field of extraction of primary resources, which is an important source of wealth in developing countries; 18. Calls on the Commission to include a tax governance clause, including monitoring of its implemen\u00ad tation, in relevant agreements between the EU and third countries; 19. Points out that the decline in customs resources brought about in particular by Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union is having a negative impact on the financial resources immediately available to developing countries; in that context, and to compensate for those losses, calls on the Commission to encourage developing countries, as part of any assistance given to improve their national tax systems, to give priority to progressive direct taxes over indirect taxes, particularly those levied on consumption, which, by their nature, hit low-income population groups harder; 20. Calls for the systematic implementation, in the framework of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), of measures to support tax reforms, in the form of both material assistance (IT systems) and organisational assistance (legal and tax training for tax authority staff), if requested by a developing country; emphasises the need to make a special effort with African countries, which still do not receive long-term assistance on taxation matters; 21. Reaffirms the need to enhance the degree of coherence between the European Union\u2019s development policy and its trade policy; recalls that, while the crisis may have exacerbated the volatility of commodity prices and caused a decrease in capital flows to developing countries, the European Union as a whole, including its Member States, remains the leading development aid donor, accounting for 56 % of the worldwide total, worth EUR 49 billion in 2009; stresses that, in this context, it ought to be a priority for developing countries to put in place an efficient tax system so as to reduce their dependence on foreign aid and other, unpredictable, external financial flows; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/41 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "22. Calls for coherence between EU financial support and the provision of access to EU markets for particular countries and for their level of cooperation with regard to the principles of good governance in the area of taxation to be enforced; 23. Welcomes the regional initiative on tax cooperation to enable developing countries to discuss the role of taxation in state-building and capacity development and to share best practices on tax adminis\u00ad tration; 24. Recalls that the main challenge for poor countries is to broaden the tax base; points out that among other factors the decline of trade taxes has led to the introduction of consumption taxes (VAT or energy taxes); considers that even if VAT can enable the widening of the tax base in economies with large informal sectors, the non-discriminatory nature of VAT hits poor people the hardest; believes that EU development assistance should prioritise initiatives to improve the effectiveness and transparency of tax systems, e.g. by investigating ways in which developing countries can broaden their tax base/tax revenue stream through direct and indirect taxation; 25. Recalls that the objective of expanding trade with the developing countries must be to promote the sustainable economic growth and the development of these countries; notes that the abolition of customs duties will inevitably entail a loss of customs revenue and must therefore be subject to tighter supervision, be more gradual and go hand in hand with the implementation of tax reforms which harness alternative forms of revenue to make up the shortfall (VAT, property tax, income tax); 26. Notes with concern that billions of dollars per year left the African continent between 1991 and 2004; in particular, underlines that these outflows are estimated at 7,6 % of the annual GDP of the region, which makes African countries net creditors of donor countries; considers that ODA and debt relief provided by developed countries will only be effective if concrete measures are taken equally by the G20, the OECD and the EU to ensure that the potential tax base of developing countries is not undermined through tax evasion; encourages in this context the UN and the OECD, in close cooperation with the African Tax Administration Forum, to pursue their work in this area; 27. Insists that the appropriate means of devising alternative sources of revenue collection should be supportive of and not discourage innovation, entrepreneurship and the creation of SMEs, strengthening ownership and local development; 28. Underlines that the administrative costs, especially for a multiple-rate VAT system, might be to too high for developing countries whose tax authorities are not equipped with the necessary financial and human resources, and should therefore be carefully scrutinised; believes that in such cases excise duties should be highly selective, narrowly targeting a few goods mainly on the grounds that their consumption entails negative externalities on society, demand for which is usually inelastic (tobacco, alcohol etc.); calls in case of limitation also for the identification and taxation of those companies which may account for increased tax revenue (for example those engaged in the extraction of raw materials); 29. Stresses that an important requirement to increase direct taxation should be bringing the informal sector into the formal economy and improving the business environment; 30. Underlines that, in the global context of tax competition, developing countries derive a larger part of their tax revenues from capital and have little possibility to collect alternative taxes; notes that the decline in tax revenues because of that competition should be addressed by broadening the tax base or by abstaining from that competition altogether if convenient and if other factors like good governance, legal security and avoidance of nationalisation are jeopardised in the competition process for FDI; points out that low-income countries need the capacity to effectively negotiate with multinational corporations in order to secure an equitable share of corporations\u2019 profits and recalls that they should have adequate policy space to impose capital controls as the right to collect and redistribute tax revenues is a key criterion for the sovereignty and legitimacy of states and therefore a prerequisite for good governance; EN C 199 E/42 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "31. Points out that the French Government has commissioned research on the topic of political incentives for taxation, but more is needed; therefore asks the Commission to study whether different approaches to transferring aid, e.g. grants versus loans, could help to limit or offset the potentially negative effects of aid on revenue raising and whether budget support and related improvements in trans\u00ad parency and effectiveness of public expenditure management contribute over the longer term to increased willingness of citizens to pay tax; 32. Notes that too little attention has been paid to how governments can use tax policies to reduce inequalities in income and well-being by minimising existing gender differences in tax liabilities; 33. Calls for concentration on the principles of neutrality, equality and simplicity with regard to tax systems in developing countries, which should be achieved by: (a) a tax that does not take up a greater share of poor people's income but a greater proportion of the taxpayer's income or wealth as it increases; (b) a tax that does not discriminate on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, type of household, citizenship or civil status; (c) a clear, simple and transparent tax system which excludes different types of undesirable interpretation of tax laws with the aim of gaining massive tax reductions at the expense of social spending; (d) identical treatment for tax purposes of true gains and true losses from any given source of income, meaning that the gains are taxable and the losses deductible; (e) a level of taxation that is robustly linked to different stages of economic development; (f) the unification of multiple corporate income tax rates by calculating income tax rates on the basis of business volume rather than business sectors; 34. Considers it necessary for the OECD to draw up new guidelines on transfer pricing, an essential way of preventing certain multinationals from transferring their profits to the countries with the most favourable tax regimes and ensuring that they pay their taxes in the countries \u2013 including developing countries \u2013 where they have actually generated their profits; 35. Considers that a system of low-rate taxation of low and medium incomes founded on a broader tax base and excluding all discretionary tax exemptions and preferences, including for the extractive industries, is indispensable; emphasises the need for public investment in projects with a positive local impact in economic, social and environmental terms, whilst not creating any opportunities for any form of fiscal dumping; Working towards a transparent, cooperative and fair international tax environment Trade mispricing 36. Stresses that trade mispricing is one of the most prominent drivers of illicit financial outflows; calls on the Commission to contribute to enhancing public expertise on such issues in developing countries, and to work upon concrete proposals to ensure that the G20, the OECD, the UN and the WTO consider a broader set of indicators and methods for tackling trade mispricing, among which are the US \u2018comparable profit methods\u2019 that have shown promise in determining the incorrect pricing of transactions; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/43 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "37. Calls for action against illegitimate transfer price manipulation (TPM) and for a review of global tax rules which go beyond the comparable profits method, in case there are other more promising alternatives which address the problem of mispricing more effectively; stresses that the EU, the G20, the EU and the WTO in general should concentrate their efforts on approaches that rely on the so-called arm\u2019s length principle (ALP), stating that tax-relevant transactions must be subject to the same conditions as those which would be made between independent enterprises; 38. Urges the EU to defend within the G20 and OECD the principle of the automatic exchange of information on tax matters along the lines of the EU Savings Tax Directive, as a way to curb illicit financial flows in secrecy jurisdictions; 39. Calls for the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, the revenue from which would improve the functioning of the market by reducing speculation and help to finance global public goods such as development and the fight against climate change, and reduce public deficits; calls on the Commission to swiftly produce a feasibility study taking into account the global level playing field and, if appropriate, to come forward with concrete legislative proposals; 40. Proposes the inclusion of a specific provision related to good tax governance in the review of the Cotonou Agreement; 41. Calls on the EU Member States, under their bilateral assistance programmes, to take similar measures; Extractive industries 42. Urges the development of initiatives to promote greater transparency in natural resource rents, inter alia through the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative; welcomes the adoption of the Congo Conflict Minerals and Transparency Amendments to the Financial Regulatory Reform Bill and asks the Commission to propose a legislative initiative along the same lines without diminishing the responsibility of governments in the developing world, and without placing an undue bureaucratic burden on companies, as that has already been criticised by stakeholders in the developing world and could prove counterproductive; 43. Stresses that exploitation of natural resources should be pursued in order to help a country meet its broader social and economic goals, which, for governments in developing countries, means outlining a vision, if so desired together with international stakeholders and expertise, of how the resource sector fits into the country\u2019s economic future; considers that for some countries the best use of resource endowments may be to leave them in the ground for future use while for others, it may be to extract rapidly, as an intermediary source of domestic revenue, in order to generate revenues to sustain the investment necessary for growth and to meet urgent human needs; 44. Points out that developing countries should be equal partners in the discussion and adoption of new initiatives in the sector of resource extraction; stresses that new arrangements in this field should take the form of generalised international standards in order to avoid the creation of another patchwork of regu\u00ad lations which would be counterproductive from the point of view of governments, tax administration and international companies; 45. Stresses that the proposals of the Commission and non-governmental transparency initiatives for the sector of extractive industries, e.g. the Natural Resource Charter, the Equator Principles and the Guidelines for Investors and Companies by \u2018Critical Resource\u2019, are in effect pro-business; they produce legal security and sustainable long-term partnerships and act as safeguards against renationalisation, reopening of negotiations or expulsion; notes that there are problems to be addressed as well, for instance the fact that businesses may have to disclose commercially sensitive information which puts them at a competitive disadvantage, or that some agreements with governments are based on information being kept secret; EN C 199 E/44 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "46. Notes that resource rents should always be seen as an intermediary means to increase domestic revenue; points out that success in taxation of resources often brings advances in direct taxes, such as corporate income taxes, and non-tax revenues, such as royalty fees; 47. Points out that a large number of rentier states, which benefit from abundant resource rents, particularly those from oil and minerals, have little incentive to be accountable, responsive or efficient; reiterates that strong institutional and democratic control mechanisms are crucial for combating economic crime; in particular, calls on the Commission to step up its development assistance on the formulation of contracts between multinational companies and developing countries on resource exploitation issues; 48. Calls on the Commission and the Council to engage more with the Extractive Industries Trans\u00ad parency Initiative, through provision of finance and participation in its governing body; 49. Recalls that the quality of financial reporting is crucial to combat tax evasion effectively; considers that country-by-country reporting is of the utmost importance for extractive industries, but recalls that it would equally be beneficial for investors in all sectors, thereby contributing to good governance globally; therefore asks the Commission to promote the inclusion of a requirement within the International Financial Reporting Standard of the IASB that multinational corporations report their income and tax paid on a country-by-country basis; recalls that this request is consistent with the need to improve the corporate social responsibility of multinational enterprises; calls on the Commission to integrate country-by-country reporting in its reform of accounting directives; 50. Calls for the introduction of country-by-country financial reporting obligations for cross-border companies, including pre- and post-tax profits, with the aim of enhancing transparency and access to relevant data for tax administrations; takes the view that, in order to ensure that all sectors and all companies are uniformly covered, the EU should introduce the principle as part of the upcoming revisions of the transparency directive and the EU accounting directives, while at the international level the Commission should exert pressure on the IASB swiftly to develop the corresponding comprehensive standard; calls once again on the Commission to report back to Parliament on the outcome of its public consultation and on its discussions with the IASB within the next six months; 51. Underlines the importance of country-by-country reporting and requests that negotiations in this field be intensified: (a) governments and international groupings (including the G20 and United Nations) should support a country-by-country financial reporting standard, and formally request the International Accounting Standards Board to adopt it; (b) the OECD should continue its feasibility study of country-by-country reporting, and report back to both the G20 and the UN during 2011; (c) the International Accounting Standards Board should adopt a new standard that includes country-by- country reporting; (d) civil society and the media should in future make use of the information disclosed under country-by- country reporting to hold governments and multinational companies to account; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/45 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "Improving donor coordination 52. Takes note of the finding of the ITC \u2018Mapping Survey\u2019 that further donor coordination in the area of taxation and development is needed; encourages the Commission to take initiatives along these lines and to step up its support for multilateral and regional initiatives, such as the African Tax Administration Forum and the Inter-American Centre of Tax Administrations; Improving the international architecture to combat tax havens 53. Stresses that conventional ODA will fail to eradicate global poverty if no ambitious measures are taken within the G20, the OECD and the EU to clamp down on tax havens and harmful tax structures; 54. Notes that, since the G20 Summit of 2 April 2009, offshore financial centres have committed to OECD standards on transparency and exchange of information; notes however that the harmful structures of tax havens still prevail; calls once more for action beyond the OECD framework to combat tax havens in view of their various shortcomings; in this respect, reiterates its concerns about the fact that the OECD international standards require exchange of information on request but that there is no automatic exchange of information along the lines of the Savings Tax Directive; likewise criticises the fact that the OECD allows governments to escape its blacklist merely by promising to adhere to the information exchange principles, without ensuring that these principles are effectively put into practice; considers also that the requirement to conclude agreements with 12 other countries in order to be removed from the backlist is arbitrary as it does not refer to any qualitative indicators for an objective assessment of compliance with good governance practices; 55. Highlights that as much as EUR 800 billion is lost each year from developing countries to tax havens and illicit financial flows; notes that greater transparency in the financial process could be a decisive step towards poverty alleviation and significant wealth creation; 56. Considers that automatic information exchange should take place in all circumstances; welcomes in this respect the Commission\u2019s proposal on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation in order to extend cooperation between the Member States to cover taxes of any kind, abolish banking secrecy and establish the automatic exchange of information as a general rule; 57. Welcomes the fact that some Member States are signatories of the Council of Europe-OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, and urges the 17 Member States that have not done so to sign the Convention; 58. Calls on the EU to step up its action and to take concrete measures, such as sanctions, against tax evasion and illicit capital flight; calls on the Council to examine the possibility of a multilateral mechanism for automatic tax information exchange in close collaboration with the UN Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters; 59. Calls on the Commission to adopt more stringent criteria for the identification of tax havens and to work towards an internationally binding multilateral automatic tax-information exchange agreement, including for trusts and foundations, envisaging countermeasures in the event of non-compliance; calls on the Commission to support developing countries in their fight against illicit outflows and capital flight, as these are identified as a major obstacle to mobilisation of domestic revenue for development; draws the Commission\u2019s attention in particular to the European Parliament position of 24 April 2009 on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments ( 1 ) and to the recommended measures for combating tax havens; EN C 199 E/46 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 ( 1 ) OJ C 184 E, 8.7.2010, p. 488.

        "60. Expresses its concern about the unfortunate effect of tax treaties on the distribution of tax revenues; notes that the method of assigning the right to tax based on the domicile principle rather than the source country helps to make tax havens a more favourable location; deems that tax treaties should be reviewed for fairness, which implies the possibility of granting the primary right to tax in the source country where real activities are pursued; 61. Deplores the fact that the G20 has not yet proposed a clear timetable and concrete sanction mechanism to make effective the fight against tax havens; calls for the adoption of an international convention with the purpose of eliminating harmful tax structures that would include sanctions both for non-cooperative jurisdictions and for financial institutions that operate with tax havens; urges the EU to adopt measures similar to the US Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act and to consider the possibility of withdrawing banking licences from financial institutions that operate with tax havens; 62.

Considers that the EU agricultural sector has a clear added value for the European economy and a strategic role to play in the EU 2020 strategy towards tackling the economic, social and environmental challenges that the EU is facing; underlines the need to ensure policy coherence between the EU\u2019s agricul\u00ad tural, trade and development policies; 2. Stresses that external trade policy must not jeopardise the EU\u2019s ability to maintain a strong agricultural sector and to ensure food security against a background of increased market volatility; calls on the Commission to defend, in all fora, and in the WTO in particular, the multifunctional role of EU agriculture, including the vital role it plays in providing employment and in sustaining the vitality of rural areas, and the European agri-food model, which is a strategic component of Europe\u2019s economy; 3. Condemns the Commission\u2019s approach, which far too often makes concessions on agriculture in order to obtain enhanced market access in third countries for industrial products and services; calls on the Commission to stop putting agricultural interests behind the interests of the industrial and services sector; 4. Calls on the Commission to propose an approach that strikes a balance between domestic production and imports, taking into account, for each agricultural sector, the development of multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations, as well as EU environmental, social, animal welfare and safety standards and respect for human rights; 5. Stresses that, in relation to the agricultural sector, the Commission must conduct impact assessments which must be made public before the commencement of negotiations and proposed updates to take account of new positions arising in the negotiations; emphasises the need for a proper and transparent process for consulting all interested parties, particularly in Parliament and the Commission; recalls that a domestic advisory council was included in the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and South Korea and notes that this could be a precedent for the involvement of interested parties and stakeholders in future trade agreements; 6. Underlines that impact assessments must look at the specificities of each commodity, such as the beef market, taking market segmentation into account; highlights the fact that previous impact assessments have provided only global figures; urges the Commission therefore to provide detailed impact assessments taking into account the effects on specific segments of the market arising from the opening up of EU agricultural markets to the Mercosur trade bloc; 7. Takes the view that decisions to further open up the EU market to imports of agricultural goods should not be taken without ensuring that EU farmers can be compensated for their losses; 8. Underlines the fact that financial compensation cannot offset the negative impacts of the discon\u00ad tinuation of EU agricultural production, which guarantees food safety and quality and is essential for the prosperity of EU rural areas and the protection of rural landscapes against the threat of land abandonment and rural depopulation; emphasises, therefore, the need to maintain the conditions necessary for EU farmers to remain viable and receive a fair income in all Member States, thus clearing the way for the revitalisation of farming in Europe, in the light of the key role played by the CAP in the EU setup; EN C 199 E/52 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Recalls that EU producers are obliged to meet the highest standards in terms of quality, product hygiene, sustainable production methods, plant health, animal health and welfare, traceability, pesticide residue control, veterinary medicine and additives; 10. Is adamant that third-country production methods for export to the EU must provide European consumers with the same guarantees in terms of health, food safety, animal welfare, sustainable devel\u00ad opment and minimum social standards as those required of EU producers; underlines that this is the only way to ensure that EU producers can compete on a level playing field with third countries, and insists on the need for tighter import controls at borders and for checks on production and marketing conditions carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office in countries exporting to the EU to be stepped up, so that compliance with EU standards is guaranteed; 11. Stresses the need, in relation to imports, for strict compliance with origin rules and mechanisms for the prevention of triangular trade; 12. Urges the Commission proactively to promote the EU\u2019s offensive agricultural interests and to make it easier for EU products to gain access to third-country markets, given the vast export and world market stabilisation potential of the EU\u2019s high quality agri-food products; underlines, inter alia , the need to step up promotion programmes; notes that these measures are WTO-compatible, falling as they do into the \u2018green box\u2019; 13. Notes that the outermost regions (ORs) are an integral part of the EU and that trade agreements apply in their entirety to such regions; stresses that lower customs tariffs pose a threat to the fragile economies of ORs, which are based mainly on farming and produce goods similar to those produced by, among others, Latin American partner countries; points out that, under Article 349 of the TFEU, EU policies may be tailored to the specific geographical and economic circumstances of such regions; calls accordingly on the Commission to take account, during negotiations, of the specific situation of ORs, so as to ensure that their development is not undermined; Agriculture in the multilateral trading system Doha Development Agenda (DDA) 14. Considers that, in a bid to secure a successful outcome to the DDA, the EU made an extremely generous offer on agriculture, which cannot be increased, but this has not, to date, been reciprocated by an equivalent level of ambition from other developed and advanced developing countries; 15. Recalls that the 2003 CAP reform and the 2008 \u2018Health Check\u2019 have demonstrated the seriousness of the EU\u2019s reform commitments by anticipating the likely results of the Doha round, while equivalent concessions are still expected from the EU\u2019s trading partners; 16. Calls on the Commission to comply strictly with its negotiating mandate from the Council, which sets the most recent reform of the CAP as the limit of its action, provided that equivalent concessions are obtained from its trading partners; asks it to refrain from making any proposals that would predetermine the decisions to be made on the future of the CAP post-2013; 17. Emphasises the role of non-trade concerns (NTC) in the Doha Development Agenda; takes the view that, in the agriculture sector negotiations, a balance needs to be struck between the economic dimension of trade and non-economic values, such as social values, environmental concerns, human health and animal health and welfare; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/53 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "18. Deplores the absence of progress on the establishment of a multilateral register for wines and spirits as well as on the extension of the protection of geographical indications to all agricultural products; recalls that these elements are sine qua non for a balanced outcome to the agricultural negotiations; emphasises the need for the principles underpinning the EU\u2019s agricultural product quality policy to be promoted more widely at multilateral and bilateral level; 19. Recalls that the EU has already significantly reduced its trade-distorting domestic support and asks for firm commitments to do the same from other trading partners; 20. Recalls the commitment made by the WTO members during the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Conference to achieving the elimination of all forms of export subsidies in full parallelism with the imposition of disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect, notably export credits, agricultural state trading enterprises and the regulation of food aid; 21. Considers that the general reduction in customs tariffs should be assessed in the light of the EU offer concerning the domestic support and export competition pillars, and should depend on the possibility of keeping the Special Safeguard clause, on a specific exemption from tariff simplification disciplines and on adequate flexibility in the formula for tariff cuts and in the designation of sensitive products; is of the opinion that the proposed mechanism for designating sensitive products is fatally undermined by the obligation to achieve a significant tariff quota expansion; 22. Stresses the need for the \u2018single undertaking\u2019 principle to be upheld in the WTO\u2019s DDA negotiations; points out that, for some time now, there has been a tendency for the negotiations to focus on a limited range of negotiating areas, including agriculture, in which the EU has major defensive interests, with relatively less progress being made in other negotiating areas, and this is threatening to undermine the EU\u2019s negotiating position; points out, in addition, that this is making it difficult to take stock of the Round as a whole; 23. Reaffirms that developing countries should legitimately be allowed to enact policies which create domestic added value; 24. Stresses that the volatility of prices has aggravated malnutrition problems worldwide, as the FAO observes, and that greater liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, which has been encouraged by WTO agreements, has not so far made it possible to curb the threat of hunger in the world; stresses that the EU also has a duty to contribute to world food security; WTO dispute settlement 25. Notes the fact that the agreement on trade in bananas settles 20 years of the most technically complex, politically sensitive and significant WTO-dispute, constitutes an important step towards the consolidation of a rule-based multilateral trading system, and at the same time could make a decisive contribution to the resolution of issues relating to tropical products and preferences in WTO negotiations; 26. Calls on the Commission to ensure that the settlement of the \u2018beef hormones\u2019 dispute will allow for the suspension of the sanctions on EU products, while guaranteeing that beef imports to the EU will be in line with EU requirements; 27. Considers, with regard to the \u2018chlorinated poultry\u2019 dispute, that the importation of such products into the EU would be contrary to the public demand in the EU for safe products and to the principles under\u00ad pinning the European food model; 28.

        "Agriculture in plurilateral, inter-regional and bilateral trade relations 29. Believes that the conclusion of multilateral negotiations is a priority to be pursued by the EU; believes that bilateral trade agreements must complement multilateral processes in the form of respect for equal working conditions, common environmental rules and food safety standards already in force in the European Union and avoid the fostering solely of sustainable development programmes; recalls that the EU has substantial offensive interests in agriculture, in particular as regards high- quality processed products; believes that bilateral trade agreements with major trade partners can successfully promote the export interests of the EU agro-food industry, providing substantial economic benefits; 30. Calls for agricultural imports into the EU to provide European consumers with the same guarantees in terms of consumer protection, animal welfare, environmental protection and minimum social standards as those provided by European production methods, and draws attention to Parliament\u2019s firm position on this matter; calls on the Commission to include clauses in bilateral trade agreements that oblige third countries to comply with the same sanitary and phytosanitary conditions that are imposed on European producers; considers that such agreements must provide at least for compliance with international obligations and standards; 31. Stresses that in order to avoid \u2018paying twice\u2019\u2013 first at bilateral and then at multilateral level \u2013 the concept of a \u2018single pocket agreement\u2019 must be supported, under which concessions in bilateral agreements will be linked to the final outcome of the Doha negotiations; 32. Emphasises the importance of strict implementation of the preferential rules of origin; calls for a review of all trade preferences given to emerging countries which are members of the G-20 by the European Union; 33. Takes the view that curbs should be put in place to prevent irregular practices in agri-food trade, such as triangular trade, when a country exports its production to the EU, taking advantage of EU market access preferences, and then meets its own needs by importing the products from abroad; considers that, in order to prevent such irregularities, EU market access concessions offered by the EU in trade agreements concluded with third countries should not exceed the actual production and export capabilities of the countries concerned; 34. Calls on the Commission strongly to defend the inclusion of geographical indications (GIs) as an essential part of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA); regrets that, in the framework of recently concluded or ongoing trade negotiations, only a \u2018short list\u2019 of EU GIs is to be protected by our trading partners; points out that, in line with the Global Europe strategy, bilateral agreements must secure enhanced international protection for geographical indications through WTO+ provisions; emphasises the need for a proper and transparent process for consulting all interested parties, particularly in Parliament and the Commission; 35. Recalls that the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea allowed significant numbers of GIs to be recognised; calls for further efforts to be made to provide for this in future trade agreements; notes that the protection and recognition of GIs in third countries is potentially of great value to the EU\u2019s agri-food sector; 36. Notes that, according to the Commission, the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA) would relieve EU exporters of the burden of EUR 380 million in duties annually, by eliminating duties on 99 % of EU agricultural exports; 37. Asks the Commission to ensure that trade agreements do not undermine the EU system of entry prices for fruit and vegetables, while maintaining the current import schedules; urges the Commission, nevertheless, to make the changes necessary to improve the system\u2019s functioning as soon as possible; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/55 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Stresses, in particular, that the complex system of entry prices that applies to tomato imports from Morocco is causing problems; calls, therefore, on the Commission to make the relevant changes without delay; 39. Expresses its strong concern about the EU-Morocco agreement; points out that, while European markets have opened up almost completely to imports from Morocco, some agricultural products are still subject to quotas on exports from the EU, including important products such as pomaceous fruits; 40. Regrets that, in the negotiations on the agricultural chapter of the association agreement with Morocco, no guarantees were given in respect of compliance with the preferential import quotas or the entry prices applying to Moroccan exports; 41. Calls on the Commission to abide by its commitments regarding the EU sugar sector and to end systematic concessions on sugar in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations; notes in this context the initiatives of the sugar sector, which have increased its competiveness while improving its environmental sustainability and contributing to the EU development agenda via the preferences granted to ACP countries and LDCs; 42. Points out that any additional bilateral EU sugar market access concessions granted to third countries (for example Latin American countries and Ukraine) will be destabilising for the EU sugar market and will cause preference erosion for LDCs and ACP countries; is all the more concerned by the fact that such concessions, when granted to net importing countries, encourage swap mechanisms; calls on the Commission to continue to exclude sugar and sugar-derived products, including ethanol, from the scope of bilateral negotiations; 43. Calls on the Commission to guard against the circumvention of import duties on ethanol, since growing quantities of ethanol are now entering the EU in the form of mixtures with a very low import duty; 44. Calls on the Commission to ensure that there are symmetrical tariff concessions in free trade area agreements concluded by the EU with countries with significant agricultural production and export capa\u00ad bilities, e.g. Mercosur; 45. Notes the resumption of negotiations on the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement \u2013 an agreement of the utmost importance, which would affect 700 million people and would be the world\u2019s most ambitious bi-regional agreement \u2013 and therefore stresses that the European Parliament should be closely involved at all stages of the negotiations; 46. Considers it unacceptable that the Commission resumed negotiations with Mercosur without making publicly available a detailed impact assessment and without engaging in a proper political debate with the Council and Parliament; calls for a study into the impact of these negotiations on European agricultural sectors and regions to be produced and discussed before any tariff proposals are exchanged between the EU and Mercosur; points out that, given the agricultural implications of the negotiations, a link with the Doha Round must necessarily be established; calls accordingly on the Commission not to conclude the negoti\u00ad ations with Mercosur until the WTO round has been brought to a close, as stipulated in its mandate; calls on the Commission to keep the Council and Parliament duly informed of developments in the negotiations with Mercosur and in future to inform Council and Parliament before such trade negotiations commence; 47. Is deeply concerned about the impacts on the EU agricultural sector as a whole of a possible association agreement with Mercosur, given the request made by Mercosur in March 2006 for access to the EU agricultural market, which went considerably further than the already substantial offer made by the EU in 2004; considers it is necessary, therefore, to review the concessions so as to protect our farmers\u2019 interests; EN C 199 E/56 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Considers that the position of the new Member States has not been taken into account in the negotiations between the EU and Mercosur, based on the mandate agreed by the Council in 1999; 49. Notes that farm businesses in Mercosur countries have much lower production costs, including land, labour and other capital costs, and that Mercosur producers do not have to meet the same standards as EU producers, with regard to the environment, animal welfare, food safety and phytosanitary measures; emphasises that a balanced outcome for both parties must be achieved by making sure that the negotiations take full account of consequences and impacts, in particular on environmental and social challenges; calls on the Commission to carry out an impact assessment on the consequences of such an agreement for the agricultural sector; 50. Is of the opinion that the level of market integration in the Mercosur customs union is currently insufficient to guarantee an adequate circulation of imported goods within the region; takes the view that an agreement would not yield any real dividends in the absence of provisions ensuring full and effective circulation of goods within the Mercosur area; 51. Regrets the tariff concessions recently granted by the Commission to the countries that export bananas to the EU; calls for a review of the aid received by European producers under aid programmes for the outermost regions (POSEI) in order to compensate these producers for the effects that this cut in tariffs will have on prices in the EU market; believes that the interests of Community producers and ACP producers must be taken into consideration in similar future negotiations, so that these sectors, which provide numerous jobs, are not weakened; 52. Underlines the fact that a series of reports from the Food and Veterinary Office highlights the ongoing failure of Brazilian beef to meet EU producer and consumer standards on food safety, animal identification and traceability, animal health and disease controls; 53. Urges the Commission to study the various reports published by the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) on the widespread use in Brazil of pesticides that are banned in the EU and most other parts of the world, which highlight the grave health risks stemming from this practice; 54. Expresses its strong concern about the policy that Argentina is implementing, in violation of its WTO obligations, with a view to restricting imports of food products competing with domestic production; points out that those measures come on top of the Argentine non-automatic import licensing system, which is already having an adverse impact on EU exports; calls on the Commission to take all necessary action to ensure that those measures, which go against the spirit of negotiating an EU-Mercosur agreement, are effectively discontinued; 55. Is concerned about concessions made on fruit and vegetables within the Euro-Mediterranean agree\u00ad ments; maintains, in this connection, that the complementarity between the growing seasons in southern and northern Mediterranean countries should continue to be a guiding factor in the liberalisation of agricultural trade within the Union for the Mediterranean; 56. Stresses that, while tobacco products must be governed by a strict regulatory framework, the regulation of ingredients in tobacco products at EU and international level must follow a proportionate, risk-based approach reflecting scientific evidence; warns against any non-science-based ban on any ingredient, which would effectively lead to the banning of European traditional blended tobacco products, as this would have severe socio-economic repercussions for EU tobacco growers (of oriental and burley varieties) without yielding any public health benefits; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/57 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "57. Calls on the Commission, in negotiations on EU trade agreements, including those with Canada and Ukraine, to take account of the interests of EU citizens, to maintain openness and to inform Parliament regularly about the progress of the negotiations; regrets that the Commission has not yet informed Parliament about the negotiations for a free trade agreement between the EU and Canada, even though these negotiations commenced in October 2009; calls on the Commission to provide Parliament and the committees responsible with detailed information on each further round of negotiations; is also concerned at possible concessions by the Commission in the negotiations, particularly in the areas of the opening up of markets, GMOs, milk, protection of intellectual property and origin labelling, and calls on the Commission not to make any concessions that might have a negative impact on European agriculture; 58. Is concerned at the prospect of concessions on cereals in the negotiations with Ukraine, in view of the fact that Ukrainian production is highly competitive and that Ukraine is already the main user of reduced-tariff cereal quotas (wheat and barley) offered to third countries; calls, therefore, on the Commission to limit its offer in this sector; 59. Reaffirms the importance of agricultural trade for economic development and poverty alleviation in developing countries; calls on the EU to help ACP countries to adapt to the increasing global competition; 60. Calls on the Commission to take due account of this resolution when drafting and implementing its future trade strategy; * * * 61.

        "C. whereas, historically, this significant deficit in protein crop production goes back to previously estab\u00ad lished international trade agreements, especially with the United States, which allowed the EU to protect its cereal production and in return allowed duty-free imports of protein crops and oilseeds into the EU (GATT and 1992 Blair House Agreement); whereas this was accompanied by significant progress in the efficiency of protein crop production and the use of new technologies outside the EU, leading to a competitive disadvantage for EU farmers who find protein crop production economically unattractive, D. whereas 70 % (42 million tonnes in 2009) of the raw materials rich in plant proteins consumed, especially soy flour, are imported, mainly from Brazil, Argentina and the USA; whereas approx. 60 % of these imports (26 million tonnes) are by-products derived from vegetable oil production and are used as meals, especially soymeal, for animal feed, E. whereas, because the volumes produced are so low, the European compound food industry only uses 2 million tonnes of protein crops each year but estimates that it would be able to use nearly 20 million tonnes per year, F. whereas these imports represent the equivalent of 20 million hectares cultivated outside the EU, or more than 10 % of the EU\u2019s arable land, and whereas these producers are not subject to the same environ\u00ad mental, health and GMO regulatory constraints as European producers, G. whereas the emergence of new customers for South American suppliers, notably China, who are not as demanding as the European Union in regard to production conditions and whose supply strategy is rather opaque, may in the long run weaken the stability of the markets and the EU supply chain, H. whereas the EU livestock sector is vulnerable to price volatility and trade distortions, and depends on affordable and high quality protein imports; whereas the sector's competitiveness is undermined by the additional costs of protein imports for feed incurred by the lack of an EU technical solution to the current zero tolerance policy on low level presence of unapproved GMOs, I. whereas shortages of soya and maize imports impose an additional cost burden on the EU livestock and feedstuffs sectors, and put the economic viability of domestic meat production at risk, J. whereas, as a consequence of the small volume of leguminous fodder crops (lucerne, clover, sainfoin, etc.) and seed crops (pea, soja, lupin, horse bean, vetch, etc.) produced in the EU, the number of plant protein research programmes in the EU has dropped from 50 in 1980 to 15 in 2010, and training and the acquisition of practical experience in domestic protein crop production have been neglected, leading to a low level of innovation and regionally adapted seed production in the EU, K. whereas the EU is highly dependent on soya beans and maize imported from third countries and any interruption of the supply of these products due to a minute presence of unauthorised GMOs has a very costly impact on the European feed industry, L. whereas a research policy is only likely to prove successful if it is covered by medium- to long-term commitments, which is not the case at present for protein crops, M. whereas farmers\u2019 knowledge of sustainable practices which link crop and livestock production through balanced crop rotation and adequate use of grassland areas could be lost, and whereas moreover domestic protein crop quality does not offer the quality of compound feed needed in the various animal production sectors, EN C 199 E/60 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "N. whereas for protein crops to become a sustainable element in cropping patterns, income from these crops must be increased in the short term, notably through specific CAP support, Basic statements on the advantages of reducing the protein deficit O. whereas rebalancing the supply and consumption of cereals, proteins and oilseeds in the EU could have major economic benefits for farmers and the food and feed industry, as well as improving the variety of healthy, high-quality food for consumers, if the political framework for the upcoming CAP reform fully addressed the new challenges highlighted in the Commission\u2019s communication, P. whereas all opportunities afforded by the various promotion measures should be used to promote human consumption of cereals, protein crops and oilseeds, which should be further protected under an agricultural product quality scheme for protection of geographical or traditional products, thereby helping to preserve local and regional foods made from these commodities, Q. whereas, in the context of climate change, the production of protein crops can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the assimilation and fixation of nitrogen in the soil (amounting to up to 100 kg N/ha per month) and the consequent reduction in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser, which contains nitrous oxide, whose warming potential is 310 times higher than that of carbon dioxide, R. whereas the EU\u2019s \u2018GL-pro\u2019 programme has demonstrated that introducing protein crops into crop rotation once every four years results in a significant drop in CO 2 emissions of approximately 10 % to 15 % and reduced ozone production, S. whereas, in terms of soil fertility, a higher proportion of protein crops cultivated on arable land as part of increased crop rotation systems and blocking plans contributes to more balanced nutrient storage, reduced soil acidification, enhanced disease resistance, better soil structure (including increased energy efficiency for soil treatment), less use of herbicides and greater biodiversity, assisting pollination, T. whereas the number of crops being rotated is a factor in reducing the likelihood of disease and propagation of weeds, and consequently the need for plant protection treatments, and whereas increasing the proportion of protein crops cultivated on arable land may help cut energy consumption by 10 %, U. whereas, in terms of water management, in particular the use in animal feed production of leguminous crops \u2013 such as permanent grass-clover mixtures or mixtures of cereals and protein crops \u2013 and permanent soil coverage can substantially reduce the run-off of nutrients, especially nitrates and phosphates, into groundwater, V. whereas, in terms of agricultural biodiversity, the extended use of protein crops that are adapted to European climatic conditions, such as beans, soya, peas, lentils, lupins, chick peas, alfalfa/lucerne, clover, Phacelia spp, Lotus corniculatus and sainfoin, will substantially stabilise and enhance diversity within the production system, W. whereas, in terms of protein production and global food security, a better balance needs to be achieved between crop and animal protein production, especially as regards the amount of energy, water and external inputs currently consumed for intensive animal protein production as opposed to protein crop production for human consumption, with the world food balance always the main focus, X. whereas several EU policies have an impact on the EU\u2019s protein deficit, and whereas the Commission must also analyse the issues of GMO production inside and outside the EU\u2019s territory, the development of biofuels and the reappraisal of the total ban on animal proteins in animal feed, EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/61 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "Y. whereas, besides using native protein crops, the quality of non-imported compound feed can also be improved through the use of by-products of oilseeds such as soya, sunflower and rapeseed, Z. whereas using leguminous fodder crops or seed crops in place of imported proteins \u2013 primarily soya cake \u2013 may bring about significant changes in stock-breeding methods and thus play a part in improving the quality of agricultural products (from standard products to certified products with alterations to specifications) and producers\u2019 incomes, AA. whereas the ban on the use of animal protein in animal feed was introduced following the BSE crisis so as to prevent any contamination with TSE; whereas this ban should only be lifted based on scientific facts and sufficient measures of precaution and control; whereas based on these conditions processed animal proteins from slaughter offal for the production of feed for monogastric animals (pork and poultry) should be considered, provided that the ingredients stem from meat which was approved for human consumption, and that the ban on intra-species recycling and forced cannibalism is fully implemented and controlled, Basic statements in response to the Commission's communication: preparing the ground for recommen\u00ad dations and demands AB. whereas the Commission communication of 17 November 2010 clearly highlights the need to enhance protein crop production within a more integrated crop rotation system, AC. whereas various studies carried out by the FAO, the Commission and competent authorities within the Member States have pointed out that improved use of protein crops in EU agriculture has the potential to make the supply of animal feed more reliable by making use of agro-environmental measures, AD. whereas it is advantageous for farmers to grow protein crops in several areas: on-farm animal feed production using mixed crops such as cereals and beans; protein production for human consumption; and all kinds of sustainable agriculture, AE. whereas at present Member States may provide specific support for protein crop production as part of agro-environmental programmes and the \u2018Article 68\u2019 measures to improve the quality of production systems and of food, AF. whereas, besides cereal and maize cultivation for feed and energy production, the use of extended crop rotation systems, on-farm mixed cropping and grass-clover mixtures, which can have major environ\u00ad mental and agronomic benefits, should be encouraged, since the growing of leguminous crops as part of a rotation system can prevent diseases, regenerate the soil, have a beneficial effect on the population of pollinators and protect the climate, AG. whereas increased cereal yields in central Europe will free up farming land across Europe and make it possible for the cultivation of crops, and particularly protein crops, to be relocated to all parts of Europe, AH. whereas the recent increase of volatility in agricultural commodity prices has raised major concerns about the competitiveness of the European livestock sector and its high dependence on protein crop imports; whereas the EU needs a genuine strategic development plan for plant proteins and their specific role in responding to the new challenges of the CAP (climate change, better management of natural resources); whereas reducing the protein deficit also needs major efforts in improved research and breeding, as well as measures which enhance adequate infrastructure for protein crop production, storage and processing; whereas also by-products of oilseed and agrofuels production could be considered for animal feed, provided that strict rules are met to ensure that the precautionary principle is fully applied and that there are no risks to animal and human health, EN C 199 E/62 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "AI. whereas the problem of zero tolerance for imports of feed must be debated further and approaches leading to practical solutions must be devised, AJ. whereas agricultural and industrial product-paths are connected in many respects and certain by- products of biofuel production are suitable for use as feed, 1. Calls on the Commission to take a medium- to long-term view in reviewing its policy on proteins, ensuring that its legislative proposals for CAP reform include adequate and reliable new measures and instruments which support farmers in improving crop rotation systems so as to substantially reduce the current protein deficit and price volatility; 2. Calls on the Commission swiftly to submit to Parliament and to the Council a report on the possibilities and options for increasing domestic protein crop production in the EU by means of new policy instruments (also taking into account the use of oil seeds and their by-products and the potential extent for substituting imports), the potential effect on farmers\u2019 revenues, the contribution it would make to climate change mitigation, the effect on biodiversity and soil fertility, and the potential for reducing the necessary external input of mineral fertilisers and pesticides; 3. Calls on the Commission to report on the impact of the zero tolerance rule for the presence in imported feed of GMOs which are not authorised in Europe, giving particular consideration to the possi\u00ad bility of introducing limit values and their practical application; 4. Calls on the Commission to maintain the common organisation of the market in dried fodder in place until 2013 so as to ensure the continued survival of this key sector, which is vitally important in the production of feed proteins for the livestock sector; 5. Calls on the Commission to support research into breeding and supply of protein crop seeds in the EU, including their contribution to disease control, and to make proposals for research and development on ways to improve extension services and under the heading of rural development on services training farmers in the use of crop rotation, mixed cropping and technical facilities for on-farm feed production; 6. Calls on the Commission, in the context of promoting rural development, to bring forward measures to promote an increase in the number of animals with biological material of high value and productive potential, and the dissemination of good practices in connection with the introduction of optimum feeding patterns, with a view to ensuring that the most efficient use possible is made of protein crops grown as animal feed; 7. Calls on the Commission to propose a framework for rural development measures which introduce improved, decentralised facilities for the production of animal feed, based on local and regional crop varieties, the storage of those varieties and seed selection and development; 8. Calls on the Commission to carry out an appraisal evaluating the effects of current import tariffs and trade agreements on the various oilseed and protein crops and to submit to Parliament and the Council a detailed legal study on the current scope of the Blair House agreements on the production of protein crops in Europe; 9. Calls on the Commission to ensure an unhindered supply of soya to the EU market by providing a technical solution regarding the low-level presence of GMOs in protein crops for food and feed imported into the EU; recalls that shortages of soya imports impose an additional cost burden on the EU livestock and feedstuffs sectors, and puts the economic viability of domestic meat production at risk; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/63 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to consider including in its legislative proposals for a reformed CAP and beyond this the promotion of crop rotation with protein crops as a precautionary measure against crop disease and a contribution to improved agricultural practices and new challenges such as food security, climate change and management of resources etc; 11. Calls on the Commission to adopt suitable measures creating market conditions that favour local production as compared to imported products, and that meet the requirements of the feedstuffs industry, including the introduction of models for GMO-free short supply chains and certified production; recognises that local and proximity farming are of greater benefit to the environment; 12. Calls on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to Parliament and the Council which authorises the use of processed animal proteins from slaughter offal for the production of feed for mono\u00ad gastric animals (pigs and poultry), provided that the ingredients stem from meat which was approved for human consumption, and that the ban on intra-species recycling and forced cannibalism is fully imple\u00ad mented and controlled; 13. Calls on the Commission to introduce a specific framework programme for decentralised agricultural and rural development research and to improve European and international cooperation, including on-farm training programmes on improved breeding of locally adapted protein plants, making this an innovative area in the various Member States; 14. Calls on the Commission to propose a coherent overall political approach to the application of the agro-environmental rules to food products sold within the Union with regard to the importation of genetically modified protein crops; 15. Calls on the Commission to establish a monitoring mechanism on the origin of protein crops imported into the European Union, revealing especially the sustainability of applied farming practices in the country of origin, such as land use change, sustainability of water use and the use of agricultural technologies; underlines that regular on-site checks are also necessary to this end; 16. Calls on the Commission to consider including in its legislative proposals on CAP reform the provision of support for farmers cultivating protein crops in crop rotation systems which contribute to the reduction of GHGs and the EU\u2019s crop protein deficit and improve disease control and soil fertility; 17.

Points out that male-dominated sectors, such as construction and manufacturing, were the first to be hit by the crisis but that the crisis has since spread to more gender-mixed sectors, thus leading to greater female unemployment; stresses that pay has declined most in female-dominated service sectors and in sectors funded by State budgets where most employees are women, and, consequently, women receive smaller pensions, which results in a higher level of poverty among elderly women; 2. Notes that in countries where equal treatment of men and women in the employment market has been achieved, it has had positive repercussions for economic and social development, and that equality policies should not therefore be abandoned in times of crisis, and that, despite the stated intention of the Member States and the Commission, consistently equal conditions have not yet been achieved; stresses that the recession has worsened what has been a constant trend over the last decade, namely the reduction of women to poverty, unemployment or insecure employment in far greater numbers than men, thus inten\u00ad sifying the feminisation of poverty in the EU; 3. Stresses that the Lisbon Strategy aims to integrate 60 % of women able to work into the labour market, while efforts at the demographic level should strive to promote a rise in the birth rate with a view to meeting the challenges of the future; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/69 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "4. Stresses that the presence of women on the labour market is positive from the point of view of economic growth; notes that, according to OECD statistics, the female component contributed to a quarter of annual growth between 1995 and 2008; 5. Stresses that, in the event of loss of employment, the risk of not being re-employed is higher for women; 6. Calls for targets to be set for women to be included in activities or sectors, or at levels, from which they have previously been excluded and in which they are still under-represented, by means of measures to inform and motivate employers to recruit and promote women, especially in the sectors and categories mentioned; 7. Stresses that is it necessary to pay much more attention to the adequacy of women\u2019s pensions, since working women interrupt their careers more often than men in order to care for children and sick or elderly family members, and as a result of their family commitments are more inclined than men to work part-time or undertake precarious work; 8. Calls for the impact of the crisis on women to be quantified by the drawing up of precise statistics with gender-disaggregated indicators, which are regularly updated and reassessed; adds that such statistics should make possible a more targeted response to cyclical and structural employment problems with a view to overcoming the crisis and fostering the spread of good practices; 9. Criticises the fact that economic recovery plans are focused on male-dominated labour sectors; high\u00ad lights the fact that preferential support for the working future of men over that of women is increasing rather than reducing gender inequality; stresses the need to integrate gender equality policies in the national, European and international economic recovery plans to tackle the crisis; 10. Points out that employment rates for both men and women are lower in rural areas and that this places those living in the countryside at a disadvantage in terms of the lack of availability of quality jobs; in addition, many women are not part of the official labour market and therefore do not count as registered unemployed, and are thus faced with financial and legal problems in terms of maternity rights, sick leave and acquisition of pension rights; 11. Stresses that the present economic crisis has had an adverse impact on workers; notes that, although the level of education among women has increased considerably in recent years, and women now outnumber men among university graduates, many women are still compelled to take on secondary roles which are less well paid; 12. Stresses that women are overrepresented in precarious work, in involuntary part-time work and among people experiencing poverty, and therefore calls on Member States to ensure that policies to achieve the EU-2020 target with regard to poverty and social inclusion are aimed at women in proportion to the share of people experiencing poverty that they represent; 13. Points out that gender inequalities remain despite the increasing participation of women in the labour market; stresses that the economic and financial crisis should be seen as a chance to put forward new and innovative proposals on employment, remuneration, working hours and the filling of positions of responsibility; 14. Stresses the positive effect that equality between women and men has on economic growth; points out that several studies have calculated that, if women\u2019s employment, part-time employment and produc\u00ad tivity rates were similar to men\u2019s, GDP would increase by 30 %; EN C 199 E/70 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "15. Points out that the emergence of new sectors with a strong potential for job creation, such as ecology, the environment and new technologies, needs to be taken into consideration when employment policies are being formulated; stresses in this connection that women have an important role to play in these sectors; calls on the Member States to encourage girls not to neglect these types of sector; encourages the Commission to issue regular communications on these new perspectives; 16. Calls on the Member States, with the assistance of the Commission, to encourage women \u2013 by stepping up existing measures \u2013 to participate in vocational training in the context of lifelong learning, in response to the switch towards a sustainable economy, with the emphasis on SMEs, thereby enhancing the employability of female workers; 17. Calls for promotion of women\u2019s access to wider opportunities in education, vocational training and employment in non-traditional sectors and at higher levels of responsibility; 18. Calls on the Commission to encourage dialogue with the social partners on issues such as trans\u00ad parency of pay, part-time and fixed-term contract conditions for women, and encouraging women\u2019s partici\u00ad pation in \u2018green\u2019 and innovative sectors; 19. Points out that organisations active in the social economy (foundations, mutual associations and cooperatives) can play a key role in economic recovery and that their employees are chiefly women; calls on the Member States to consider such organisations seriously when drawing up economic recovery policies; 20. Stresses the importance of developing the legal concept of shared ownership to ensure full recog\u00ad nition of women\u2019s rights in the agricultural sector, appropriate protection in terms of social security and recognition of their work, and also the need to amend the Regulation on the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) so that, as with the European Social Fund (ESF), positive action can be taken for women in the future programming period 2014-2020, which was possible in previous periods but not in the current period, as these measures will be very beneficial in terms of female employment in the rural environment; 21. Stresses that eliminating the pay gap is a priority, and therefore regrets the fact that the Commission has not done enough to relaunch this debate at European level, particularly by revising the existing legis\u00ad lation applying the principle of equal pay for men and women, as Parliament requested in its resolution of 18 November 2009; 22. Calls on the Member States to increase their efforts to prevent segregation of job markets by gender and to counter the trend for many women to work in worse-paid occupations, by interesting boys and girls at school in the whole spectrum of possible occupations, and broadening training opportunities for women so as to enable them to adapt to changes in the labour market during their careers; is deeply concerned at the unfair situation whereby, after more than half a century in which the Community treaties have included the principle of equal pay for equal work, a female citizen in the EU has on average to work 418 calendar days to earn what a man earns in a calendar year; 23. Insists on the need for urgent action to fight wage discrimination, by measures such as revising the existing directive, drawing up phased sectoral plans with specific objectives, which could include reducing the pay gap to 0,5 % by 2020, the aim being to put an end to direct and indirect discrimination, or encouraging collective bargaining, training of equality counsellors, action on the issue of gender inequality in unpaid work, and the introduction of equality plans in companies and other workplaces; believes that transparency in wage determination should become the rule, so as to strengthen the bargaining position of women workers; 24. Calls on the European Commission and the Member States to introduce measures aimed at solving the current paradox in which women, despite being better educated, are still less well paid than men; stresses that, for optimum economic growth and genuinely sustainable development, women\u2019s career potential needs to be fully exploited; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/71 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "25. Stresses that separate income and high-quality paid employment for women form the key to their economic independence and to greater equality between women and men in society as a whole; 26. Calls on the Member States to apply the principle of gender equality to national pension systems as concerns both age and pay; 27. Calls on the EU Member States to implement legislation on equal pay for equal work properly, and calls on the Commission for the application of sanctions for non-compliant Member States; 28. Stresses that gender equality is not only a question of diversity and social justice: it is also a precondition for meeting the objectives of sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion set forth in the EU-2020 strategy; calls therefore upon the Commission to strengthen the gender dimension in all parts of the EU-2020 strategy, taking particular account of gender specificities, and devise specific measures and targets for gender equality in all measures to improve the European Employment Strategy; 29. Calls on the Commission, the Council and Member States to favour binding proposals instead of non-binding strategies and policy documents in the field of gender equality; 30. Believes that the Commission and the Member States should develop training and implementation tools so that all stakeholders take due account, in their respective fields of competence, of the perspective based on equal opportunities for women and men, including assessing the specific impact of policies on women and men; 31. Stresses the importance of developing quantitative and qualitative indicators and gender-based stat\u00ad istics that are reliable, comparable and available when needed, which must be used to monitor the main\u00ad streaming of gender equality in all policies; 32. Believes that one priority should be the fight to eradicate poverty, by revising the macroeconomic, monetary, social and labour policies that are at its root, in order to ensure economic and social justice for women; believes that the methods used to determine poverty rates should be re-examined and that strategies should be developed to promote a fair distribution of income, guarantee minimum income, pay and decent pensions, create more high-quality jobs with rights for women, ensure access to high-quality public services for all women and young girls, and improve social welfare and respective local services, particularly cr\u00e8ches, nurseries, day centres, community and leisure centres, and family support services; 33. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s launch of an EU-wide campaign to help tackle the gender pay gap; notes, however, that the pay gap between men and women remains, and therefore calls for a Europe-wide debate to combat stereotypes linked to the respective roles of men and women; stresses, therefore, the importance of organising awareness-raising campaigns in schools, workplaces and the media to combat persistent gender stereotypes and degrading images in particular; points out that campaigns should stress the role of men in ensuring a fair distribution of family responsibilities and a good work-life balance; 34. Takes the view that demographic change makes it necessary to realise the potential of women, and to increase their employment in order to reach the target employment rate of 75 % for women and men aged between 20 and 64, as stated in the EU-2020 strategy; believes at the same time that people should have a free choice to have children and that a fair work-life balance is a key condition to boost women's participation in the labour market; 35. Asks for concrete proposals with a view to achieving a better work-life balance, particularly with regard to help with care of dependent persons and child care; EN C 199 E/72 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "36. Emphasises that the Commission and the Member States need to promote, support and reinforce the role of women in the social economy, in the light of the high level of female employment in that sector and the importance of the services it offers for the promotion of a fair work-life balance; 37. Asks the Commission to ensure that the various European rules on work-life balance are correctly transposed by the Member States by adapting working conditions between men and women; 38. Observes that part-time employment can have an adverse impact on the individual concerned, for example by placing obstacles in the way of careers and leading to poverty in old age, or alternatively that they may, on account of smaller incomes, require supplementary State assistance for purposes of subsistence or in the event of illness or unemployment; 39. Stresses the importance of communication campaigns to ensure the gender neutrality of traditionally male or female trades or activities; in the same respect, calls on the Member States to start a debate on the role of language in the persistence of stereotypes, particularly due to the feminisation or masculinisation of certain trade names; 40. Calls on public and private establishments to introduce equality plans in their internal rules and regulations, together with strict short-, medium- and long-term objectives, and to evaluate annually the achievement of these objectives; 41. Asks for concrete proposals with a view to achieving a better balance between work, family and private life, by fostering greater sharing of occupational, family and social responsibilities between men and women, particularly with regard to help with care for dependent persons and child care; 42. Calls on the Member States to support employment for the disadvantaged category of \u2018pregnant women or mothers performing domestic tasks on their own\u2019, encouraging the provision of jobs for this group that are decent, stable and compatible with a proper work-life balance; 43. Believes that in order to better combine working and caring; it is necessary to improve child-related leave, calls therefore on the Council for speedy adoption of a common position on the Parliament\u2019s position of 20 October 2010 ( 1 ) on the revision of Council Directive 92/85/EEC; 44. Calls on the Member States to encourage the setting up or improvement of childcare facilities such as cr\u00e8ches and nurseries, and facilities for the elderly and other dependants with a view to providing good- quality, affordable services at times compatible with full-time working hours for as many people as possible; believes that these facilities offer huge support to parents and would make it easier for them to enter the workforce; 45. Emphasises that the family is a cornerstone of our society and is inherently associated with the transmission of values and with cooperation in a spirit of solidarity; underlines that introducing flexible working hours and providing teleworking opportunities, as well as extending child care and professiona\u00ad lising home help for the elderly, represent an important step towards making it possible to combine work and family life and to enhance equal participation of women and men in the labour market and in education and training; regrets the fact that the lack of adequate leave schemes, parental leave schemes and flexible working arrangements for both parents often prevents women from participating actively in the labour market or from working full time; considers that this also requires a change in corporate cultures with regard to the appointment and employment of women; calls therefore on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to prevent cuts in benefits or social services in the field of childcare, care of the elderly and vulnerable people as a result of the economic and financial crisis; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/73 ( 1 ) Texts adopted, P7_TA(2010)0373.

Reminds the Commission and the Member States of the need to adopt positive measures for both women and men, notably in order to facilitate returning to work after a period devoted to the family (bringing up children and/or caring for a sick or disabled relative), to promote policies for (re)integration in the labour market and, hence, recovery of financial independence; 47. Stresses that education plays a key role in inculcating in children the importance of gender equality as early as possible and in the acceptance of different cultures and an understanding of the impact of discrimination and prejudice; calls on the Member States to establish education programmes, as well as information and awareness-raising programmes on the values of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly Article 23 thereof, for pupils throughout their school career; 48. Stresses the need for young people to be free to make their own career choices; points out, therefore, that teachers should not automatically guide pupils towards specific sectors for purposes of conforming to sexist stereotypes and that the full range of job opportunities should be highlighted; 49. Calls on the Member States to ensure, through awareness programmes within the education sector, that girls are not steered automatically in the direction of traditionally feminised sectors and careers; 50. Stresses the need to step up efforts at European level to increase women\u2019s representation in politics; advocates, therefore, greater participation for women in all European institutions, particularly in positions of responsibility; stresses that further efforts must be made at national, regional and municipal level; calls for binding targets to ensure equal representation of women and men; notes in this regard the positive effects of the use of quotas on representation of women; points out, therefore, that the use of electoral quotas has positive effects on women\u2019s representation; 51. Points out that only 3 % of major companies are chaired by a woman; stresses, therefore, the example of Norway, which since 2003 has successfully applied a quota policy to ensure parity on the management boards of companies, with this example now being followed by Spain and France; calls on the Member States to take effective measures, such as quotas, to ensure greater representation for women in major listed companies and on the management boards of companies in general, especially those with public participation; 52. Stresses that equality plans for businesses or sectors should be established, on a statutory basis, to combat gender injustice in employment in the Member States, which should be initiated and their imple\u00ad mentation monitored by the two sides of industry; 53. Stresses the need for the Member States to take steps, particularly through legislation, to set binding targets to guarantee parity between men and women in positions of responsibility in companies, public administrations and political bodies; 54. Calls on the Member States to identify companies which promote gender equality and a good balance between work, family and private life and to spread good practices extensively, in particular via chambers of commerce; 55. Welcomes the general debate on increasing the proportion of women in management positions in industry and suggests introducing a voluntary quota for this in businesses, which should be based on the gender ratio within the work force; EN C 199 E/74 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Calls for action to be taken at national and European level to promote entrepreneurship among women by creating training and professional and legal advice structures and by facilitating access to public and private finance; 57. Encourages a regular exchange of information and experiences between stakeholders promoting gender equality, with a view to implementing good practices throughout society, at European, national, regional and local level and in both the private and the public sectors; 58. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to pay particular attention to vulnerable groups of women: disabled, elderly, immigrant, lesbian, bisexual and transgender, and minority women and women who have little or no training and are responsible for dependants, all of these being specific groups in need of measures tailored to their circumstances; calls on the Commission to broaden the scope of the European Year of Volunteering 2011 to include promotion of gender equality; 59. Calls on the Commission to support the Member States in increasing the employment prospects of disadvantaged women, such as female immigrants, women from ethnic minorities, women with disabilities, and single mothers, thus increasing their chance of leading an economically independent life, by improving their access to education and vocational training; draws attention to the multiple discrimination affecting immigrant women on grounds of their gender, ethnic or racial origin and, in many cases, age; 60. Calls on national, regional and local bodies responsible for equality to adopt integrated approaches improving their response to and handling of cases of multiple discrimination; also stresses that these bodies should offer training to judges, juries and general staff so that they can identify, anticipate and handle situations of multiple discrimination; 61. Points out that women with disabilities are often discriminated against in social, cultural, political and professional life; calls on the Commission and the Member States to make concrete proposals with a view to improving their situation; 62. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to pay particular attention to Roma women in the implementation of the EU strategy on Roma inclusion; 63. Notes that transgender people remain a highly marginalised and victimised group facing a high degree of stigmatisation, exclusion and violence, as reported by the Fundamental Rights Agency; strongly encourages the Commission and the Member States to follow the Agency\u2019s recommendations for stronger and clearer protection against discrimination on grounds of gender identity; 64. Advocates access for women and men to adequate information and support on reproductive health, and stresses that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men to avail themselves of services in this area; stresses that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, particularly through easy access to contraception and abortion; calls on the Member States and the Commission to adopt measures and actions raising awareness among men about their responsibilities in sexual and reproductive matters; 65. Points out that violence against women is a major hindrance to gender equality; calls on the Commission to start drawing up a proposal for a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women \u2013 whether physical, sexual or psychological \u2013, including trafficking; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/75 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",

Welcomes efforts made at EU and national level to combat violence against women, but stresses that this remains a serious, unresolved problem and urges the Member States to take measures to ensure access to support services aimed at preventing gender-based violence and protecting women from such violence regardless of their legal status, race, age, sexual orientation, ethnic origin or religion; welcomes the resumption of debate on this form of violence, notably via the establishment of a European protection order and the Directive on Human Trafficking; calls on present and future EU presidencies to make further progress; stresses the need for the Council and Commission to accept the agreement reached in the European Parliament on the European protection order so that the Directive can enter into force as soon as possible; 67. Calls again on the Commission to create, within the next four years, a European Year to combat violence against women; points out in this regard that this will raise awareness among European citizens and mobilise governments to fight violence against women; 68. Stresses the need to conduct a wide-ranging survey covering all the EU countries and using a common methodology to determine the real scope of the problem; points to the important work to be carried out in this area by the European Observatory on Gender Violence, which will provide high-quality statistics to support political measures combating this social scourge; 69. Calls on the Member States to ensure better training for, and cooperation between, staff in the health sector, social services, the police and the judiciary, and to set up structures capable of dealing with all forms of violence against women, including rare forms of serious physical and psychological violence such as acid attacks; 70. Stresses the importance of the Member States and regional and local authorities taking action to aid reintegration into the labour market for women who have suffered gender violence, using instruments such as the ESF or the PROGRESS programme; 71. Points out that schemes helping women\u2019s organisations and civil society in general to collaborate with and participate in processes to integrate the gender perspective must be improved; 72. Stresses the need to integrate the gender perspective and the fight against gender violence in the external and development cooperation policy of the European Union; 73. Calls on the European Commission to encourage the Member States to promote, in the media in general and in advertising and promotional material in particular, a representation of the female image that is respectful of the dignity, role diversity and identity of women; 74. Calls on the Commission and the budgetary authority to comply with gender budgeting criteria when drawing up budgets and their new EU multiannual financial framework; encourages Member States to follow this example when drawing up national public budgets; 75.

        "J. whereas there are considerable age and gender disparities in the amount of time spent on unpaid work and daily involvement in caring activities; whereas women in particular experience the greatest unpaid workload; K. whereas universal access and affordable, high quality support services such as childcare facilities, facilities for the elderly and other dependants is important for equal participation of women and men in the labour market and as a means to prevent and reduce poverty, L. whereas elderly people face a higher risk of poverty than the general population, reaching a rate of around 19 % of those aged 65 years and over in 2008 in the EU-27; whereas older women are in a particularly precarious position as their right to a pension income is often derived from their marital status (spousal or survivor benefits) and they rarely have adequate pension rights of their own due to career breaks, pay gap and other factors and as a result, women are more affected than men by persistent and extreme poverty (22 % of women aged 65 and over are at risk of poverty compared to 16 % of men), M. whereas women, in particular in rural areas, are more often part of the informal economy than men, not being registered on the official labour market, or have short-term working contracts, which generates particular problems as regards women\u2019s social rights, including rights during pregnancy, maternity leave and breastfeeding, the acquisition of pension rights and access to social security, N. whereas poverty is a factor associated with an increased risk of gender-based violence, which is a major barrier to gender equality; whereas, since domestic violence frequently leads to job loss, poor health and homelessness, it can also push women into a cycle of poverty; whereas, in addition, trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery that affects women and girls on a large scale and constitutes a significant factor that is both driven by and contributes to poverty, O. whereas violence against women, in all its forms, is one of the most widespread human rights viol\u00ad ations, knowing no geographical, economic, or social limits; whereas it is a severe problem in the Union, where some 20-25 % of women suffer physical violence, and more than 10 % sexual violence, in the course of their adult lives, P. whereas disabled women suffer discrimination within the family environment and in education, their employment opportunities are restricted and the social benefits they receive do not in most cases lift them out of poverty; whereas Member States should, therefore, provide disabled women with the specialised care they need in order to enjoy their rights and should propose measures to facilitate their integration through additional support programmes, Q. whereas women are increasingly bearing the burden of poverty, being at risk of poverty, in particular categories of women with special needs, such as disabled women, elderly women and parents bringing up a child without a partner (especially single mothers and widows with dependent children) and groups most vulnerable to exclusion, such as Roma women, under whose traditions domestic and care work are assigned exclusively to women, removing them prematurely from education and employment, and immigrant women; whereas there is a need for proper working conditions, including the protection of rights such as a decent wage, maternity leave and a working environment free from discrimination, which are essential for these women, R. whereas the Progress programme is intended to support the effective implementation of the principle of gender equality and promote gender mainstreaming in EU policies; whereas this programme is a tool of utmost importance in combating the feminisation of poverty, S. whereas the life expectancy for women is about six years longer than for men, with statistics for the EU-27 in 2007 showing men living to 76 years old and women to 82 years old; whereas this has important implications for female poverty, particularly as women have greater difficulty than men in accessing social security and pension systems, EN C 199 E/80 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "Feminisation of poverty 1. Considers that preventing and reducing women\u2019s poverty is an important component of the funda\u00ad mental principle of social solidarity to which the European Union is committed as provided in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union, implying equality between women and men, social justice and protection and combating social exclusion and discrimination; 2. Recognises that \u2018the feminisation of poverty\u2019 means that women have a higher incidence of poverty than men, that their poverty is more severe than that of men and that poverty among women is on the increase; 3. Points out that, according to the Eurostat \u2018at-risk-of poverty\u2019 indicator, nearly 85 million persons in the European Union were at risk of poverty in 2008, and that according to the \u2018material deprivation\u2019 indicator it is estimated that the figure would rise to 120 million; considers that the Council\u2019s decision on poverty indicators may give rise to ambiguities concerning the overall reduction target of lifting 20 million persons out of poverty and exclusion by 2020 (reduction of 23,5 % according to Eurostat\u2019s \u2018at-risk-of poverty indicator\u2019, but only 16,7 % according to the \u2018material deprivation\u2019 indicator); stresses that those living in poverty are for the most part women, a situation brought about by unemployment, casual labour, low wages, pensions below the minimum subsistence level, and the widespread difficulty of obtaining access to good public services; 4. Stresses that gender inequality hinders poverty reduction and endangers the prospects of economic and human development; 5. Calls on the Member States to mainstream the concept of gender equality in all employment policies and special measures so as to improve access to employment, avoid over-representation of women in precarious employment, increase sustainable participation and promote the progress of women in the employment sector, as well as to reduce gender segregation in the labour market by tackling the direct and indirect causes; 6. Indicates that female poverty is not only the result of the recent economic crisis but the consequence of various factors including stereotypes, existing gender pay gaps, barriers caused by the lack of recon\u00ad ciliation between family and work life, the longer life expectancy of women and, in general, the various types of gender discrimination, victimising mostly women; 7. Recalls that the Commission has designated 2010 as European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, in order to reaffirm and strengthen the Union\u2019s political commitment to achieving a decisive advance in the fight against poverty and recognise the fundamental right of those living in poverty and social exclusion to live a decent life and participate fully in society; 8. Recalls that the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion 2010 was supposed to be not only a media campaign, but an initiative to further stimulate multidimensional policies against poverty and more advanced poverty indicators; therefore asks the Commission to give a critical overview of new measures undertaken by Member States to overcome poverty and social exclusion in this context; 9. Suggests that it is necessary to maintain, at both European and national level, a firm commitment to making further progress towards gender equality, by means of strategies furthering the Commission\u2019s guidelines on parity between women and men, the European Pact for Gender Equality adopted by the Council of Europe, and the framework of action on gender equality concluded by the European social partners; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/81 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "10. Stresses that gender equality is one of the prerequisites for sustainable growth, employment, competi\u00ad tiveness and social cohesion; 11. Invites the Commission and the Council to take due account of Parliament\u2019s demands raised in its resolutions of 15 November 2007 on social reality stocktaking ( 1 ), of 9 October 2008 on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, in the EU ( 2 ), of 6 May 2009 on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market and of 20 October 2010 on the role of minimum income in combating poverty and promoting an inclusive society in Europe ( 3 ) when designing policies and measures for the next stage of the OMC on Social Inclusion and Social Protection, the Social Inclusion Strategy and the \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 flagship initiative on combating poverty and social exclusion, involving all stakeholders in a participatory process; 12. Takes note of the Commission Communication on the Strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015; calls on the European Commission and Member States to adopt a gender-specific perspective as a key component of all common policies and national programmes to eradicate poverty and combat social exclusion; 13. Welcomes the Commission initiative on a \u2018European platform against poverty\u2019; calls on the Commission and Member States to promote the gender dimension in this platform; 14. Calls on the Commission to strengthen the European strategy on social inclusion and protection, in accordance with the abovementioned \u2018European platform against poverty\u2019 initiative, and to step up efforts to improve the situation of single parents in particular, to allow them to live with dignity; 15. Points out that, as a consequence of the economic crisis, unemployment and social hardship are still increasing in a number of Member States and affect young and old people, men and women and their families differently, and therefore calls on the European Union and Member States to reinforce their commitment and take specific measures to eradicate poverty and combat social exclusion, particularly poverty among women and its direct impact on family life, as poverty and social exclusion constitute a violation of human rights and affect at least one in six European citizens; calls on the Commission and the Member States to put specific emphasis on the most vulnerable groups (single-parent households, families with three or more children, disabled people, ethnic minorities, especially the Roma, people living in the most disadvantaged microregions, people with decreased work capacity and young people without work experience); believes that access to education and the labour market and participation in society are needed for a decent life; calls on the European Union and Member States to ensure that measures are taken to eradicate child poverty and that all children have equal opportunities in life; 16. Points out that women\u2019s integration into the labour market in recent decades indicates not only a greater direct impact of the recession on women themselves but also on households, where incomes will be significantly affected by female job losses; stresses that female unemployment can be expected to rise disproportionately as public sector budget cuts are announced, since women are disproportionately employed in education, health and social services; 17. Encourages the Commission and the Member States to implement the indicators in respect of women and poverty developed in connection with the Beijing Platform for Action as a tool to monitor the impact of broader social, economic and employment policies on reducing poverty; calls on the Member States to find more appropriate methods of measuring poverty among women; 18. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide systematic gender-disaggregated data and information in national reporting and in the annual Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion; EN C 199 E/82 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 ( 1 ) OJ C 282 E, 6.11.2008, p. 463.

        "19. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to introduce new individual indicators in respect of women and poverty as a tool to monitor the impact of broader social, economic and employment policies on women and poverty; 20. Stresses the necessity to agree upon a follow up to the Women\u2019s Charter, with the wide consultation of the European Parliament, and taking into account the views of the social partners and civil society, in order to promote mechanisms to achieve gender equality in all aspects of social, economic and political life; 21. Draws particular attention to the necessity to continue further with the researches and analyses regarding the phenomenon of \u2018feminisation of poverty\u2019; calls on the Commission and Eurofound to cooperate with the European Institute for Gender Equality and to initiate targeted research in order to assess, inter alia, the effects of the global crisis on women; 22. Urges the Member States to ensure that all individuals, especially the young and the elderly, have access to basic care; 23. Urges the Member States to ensure that elderly women with diseases typical of their age have access to preventive and diagnostic medicine, as a tool for combating social exclusion and poverty; 24. Calls on the Member States to facilitate access to medical care for immigrant women for diseases resulting from different eating habits and ritual practices; calls on the Commission and the Member States, accordingly, to frame health policies with a view to combating and preventing practices that are hazardous to women\u2019s health and are also a cause of social exclusion and poverty; 25. Calls on the Member States to ensure that gender policies and EU principles are applied at all levels, locally and nationally; 26. Recalls that the fight against poverty and social exclusion is to be pursued both within the European Union and externally, in order to fulfil the commitment by the European Union and Member States to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals by 2015; Combating women\u2019s poverty through labour policies and social protection 27. Calls on the Member States for specific programmes to promote the active inclusion or reintegration of women on the labour market and for specific opportunities for life-long training with a view to providing the skills and qualifications, such as empowerment, confidence building and capacity building, needed in the light of the EU 2020 Strategy which puts an emphasis on projects and programmes on ecological transformation, i.e. the renewable sector, science and technology-intensive green jobs for a new sustainable economy; calls, in the interests of not adding to the insecurity experienced by women on the employment market, for family responsibilities to be taken into account when selecting employees for dismissal, bearing in mind that in many situations women have custody of children; 28. Points to the considerable differences between residents in rural and urban areas as regards access to training, employment and quality of work; attaches considerable importance to the right of all these residents, particularly the youngest and most vulnerable, to receive a proper education, with vocational training and university studies, and therefore calls on the Member States and the Commission to support these groups through an effective system of active policies and appropriate training measures so as to enable them to adjust swiftly to job market requirements; 29. Points out that social protection, labour market policies and social policy make important contributions to lessening the depth and duration of the recession by stabilising labour markets and consumption, and that the social protection system is a stabiliser on both the revenue and the expenditure side; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/83 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "30. Considers active employment policy (e.g. in-work training, vocational education and training) very important in preventing poverty and a process in which social partners play an essential role; deems moreover that proactive employment policy (e.g. work experience for the young, sheltered workshops and workplaces) is also crucial in ensuring the balance of, and increasing accessibility to, the labour market, and maintaining employment for disadvantaged groups; 31. Stresses the need to establish a transparent regulatory framework for atypical forms of employment in order to ensure proper working conditions and decent pay, given that finding employment is a motor for combating poverty; 32. Considers that integration of women into the labour market is a key to fighting poverty and social exclusion; stresses the importance of supporting the creation of new jobs, facilitating additional training and education for women living at risk of poverty and strengthening job placement; 33. Recognises the direct link between economic inequality and female dependency, as well as the inequalities still existing between men and women in terms of access to education, family responsibilities and the general upkeep of a family, and expresses its regret that the pay gap between the two genders continue to be present and produce negative effects; 34. Stresses that in case of unemployment the risk of not being re-employed is higher for women, and that they are also more likely to be at a disadvantage in recruitment, since more women are employed on insecure or part-time contracts without having so chosen or because unequal pay continues to affect women; 35. Points out that according to the Eurobarometer Special Survey \u2018Gender equality in the EU in 2009\u2019 the need to reduce the pay gap between men and women is widely recognised in Europe; 36. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary measures to eliminate gender inequalities in employment as part of the EU 2020 Strategy; strongly encourages establishing as an objective the reduction of the gender pay gap by 1 % each year, in order to achieve a target of 10 % reduction by 2020 and ensure full pay for women during statutory maternity leave as recommended by its position of 20 October 2010 ( 1 ) on this matter, as this will contribute to eliminating gender inequalities in employment; stresses, moreover, the need for positive action to increase female representation in political, economic and corporate decision-making bodies; 37. Notes that women entrepreneurs\u2019 access to credit is limited, which is a major obstacle to their professional development and economic independence, and which conflicts with the principle of equal treatment; 38. Calls on the policy makers, both at EU and national level, to build their policy responses aiming to limit the negative repercussions of the economic crisis on a gender-sensitive analysis of the labour market as well as systematic gender impact assessments and evaluations; 39. Calls on the Commission to continue with initiatives aimed at recognising the informal economy and quantifying the \u2018economics of life\u2019, using gender-specific approaches in accordance with the \u2018Beyond GDP\u2019 project launched by the Commission; calls on the Member States to provide appropriate social benefits for women and men who take care of elderly, sick or disabled relatives, and for elderly women, who receive particularly small pensions; EN C 199 E/84 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 ( 1 ) European Parliament position of 20 October 2010 on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding (P7_TA(2010)0373).

Calls on the Commission to revise the existing legislation relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women as requested by Parliament in its resolution of 18 November 2008 ( 1 ) (a legislative initiative requesting the Commission to submit an appropriate proposal by the end of 2009); 41. Stresses the crucial importance of reforming macroeconomic, social and labour-market policies in order to guarantee economic and social justice for women, to reconsider the methods used to determine the poverty rate and to develop strategies to promote the fair distribution of wealth, to guarantee a minimum income and decent wages and pensions, to create more high-quality jobs for women, coupled with rights, to enable women and girls to benefit from public services of a high standard, and to improve welfare provision and neighbourhood services, including cr\u00e8ches, kindergartens and other forms of pre-school education, day centres, community leisure and family support centres and intergenerational centres, which should be made affordable and accessible to women and men and younger and older people alike and should be compatible with full-time working hours; 42. Calls on the Member States to set up counselling centres to identify and combat the exploitation of women workers, which is one of the main causes of poverty and social exclusion; 43. Calls on the Member States to consider reviewing social protection systems with a view to individ\u00ad ualising rights in pensions and social security schemes in order to eliminate the \u2018breadwinner advantage\u2019, guaranteeing equal pension rights; 44. Emphasises the positive effect which equality between men and women has on economic growth; points out that various studies estimate that if employment, part-time employment and productivity rates for women were similar to those for men, GDP would increase by 30 %, which would not only benefit the economy as a whole but also reduce the risk run by many women of falling into poverty; 45. Calls on the Commission and Council to develop and implement as a matter of urgency a strategy to halve child poverty by 2012 and break the spiral of poverty in general, given the high risk that persistent poverty is transmitted from parents to their children, which might considerably disadvantage their children\u2019s chances of a better life; thus emphasises the need to mainstream individual children\u2019s rights in all EU policies and measures to monitor and evaluate steps undertaken to end child poverty, to identify and develop priority actions, to enhance data collection and to further develop common indicators at EU level; believes that in this context it is essential to facilitate single parents\u2019 entry into and return to the labour market, as well as welfare arrangements for single-parent families in the light of the problems faced by them, while also ensuring concrete support for large families; considers that children from poor households in which no one works must receive special attention and support, in order to prevent poverty in future; 46. Asks the relevant national authorities to review their immigration policies in order to dismantle structural obstacles to full labour market participation by migrants, to compile data on progress in relation to discrimination against vulnerable groups and to assess the impact of expenditure cuts related to access to health, education and social protection; 47. Takes note of the Council\u2019s decision of 17 June 2010 to leave it up to Member States to set, in cooperation with the regions, their national targets for reducing the number of people at risk of poverty and exclusion on the basis of one or several of the three indicators agreed upon by the Council; considers that Member States using only the \u2018jobless household\u2019 indicator may systematically neglect problems such as in- work poverty, energy poverty, the poverty of single parents, child poverty and social exclusion; urges Member States not to abuse the freedom to choose their indicator to achieve less ambitious anti-poverty targets; draws attention to the problems faced by millions of European pensioners whose pensions are inadequate in making ends meet and covering the particular needs associated with age, owing especially to the high cost of medicines and medical treatment; stresses that school and university education for the most vulnerable groups must be a priority target in connection with which each Member State must set targets; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/85 ( 1 ) OJ C 16 E, 22.1.2010, p. 21.

Points out that, since equal and full participation in economic, political and social life should be considered an individual right, active social inclusion policies should use a holistic approach to eradicating poverty and social exclusion, especially by ensuring full access to quality social services and services of general (economic) interest for all; 49. Stresses the need to develop appropriate employment integration and training policies at national level, together with special tax arrangements for one-parent families, as part of the fight against poverty, child poverty and social exclusion; 50. Stresses the need for measures to be taken at national and European level to combat discrimination as regards job market opportunities and wages policies; 51. Calls on the Commission to closely examine obstacles to social participation such as energy poverty, financial exclusion and obstacles to accessing information and communication technology (ICT); 52. Stresses the importance of coordinating policies to fight unemployment and social exclusion at all levels of government in order to combat poverty effectively; 53. Calls on the Member States to facilitate access to education and training programmes for immigrants and ethnic minorities, which will facilitate their participation in the labour market; Reconciliation of family life and work by women who live in poverty or are exposed to the risk of poverty 54. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary measures to promote the reconciliation of work and private life, in order to enable women who are exposed to the risk of poverty to pursue their careers in full time work, or to provide access to part time work and other flexible work arrangements, including by means of reversible part-time work arrangements during periods spent as carers. 55. Stresses that one-third of single-parent families in Europe are living in poverty; 56. Calls on the Member States, in the context of the abovementioned procedure of amending Council Directive 92/85/EEC, to take the measures necessary to prevent the dismissal of workers during pregnancy and motherhood; calls on the Member States to take active measures to prevent discrimination against pregnant women on the labour market, as well as measures to ensure that motherhood does not affect the right of women workers to pensions and that the scale of those pensions is not affected by the fact they have taken maternity leave; 57. Reminds the Member States that the provision of adequate childcare is a fundamental part of gender equality on the labour market; regrets that the 2002 Barcelona European Council targets on pre-school childcare provision for at least 90 % of children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33 % of children under 3 years, which set objectives up to 2010, are far from being met; calls on the Council and the Member States to renew and fulfil their commitments related to the Barcelona targets for the provision of accessible, affordable and high quality child care and to develop new targets for the care of dependent persons; calls therefore on the Member States to improve accessibility, in particular through financial support for childcare, and to improve public childcare facilities and provide firms with incentives to set up in-house facilities; 58. Calls on the Member States to take targeted action to ensure that women in a disadvantaged environment have fair access to public health systems - in particular to primary health care (including the protection of mothers and children) as defined by the World Health Organisation - and also to gynaecological and obstetric health care, decent housing, justice, education, training, life-long learning, sport and culture, to prevent the premature abandonment of schooling and facilitate a smooth transition from school to the labour market; EN C 199 E/86 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "59. Calls on the Member States to develop appropriate measures to support teenage mothers, who often have difficulty finding jobs and live in poverty owing to their frequently low level of education and to social prejudices; Combating poverty among older women 60. Stresses that the risk of falling into poverty is greater for women than for men, particularly in old age, where social security systems are based on the principle of continuous remunerated employment; points out that, in some cases, women do not fulfil this requirement because of interruptions to their work and that they are penalised because of discrimination on the labour market, in particular because of the wage gap, maternity leave and part-time work, or as a result of taking a break from or stopping work to take on family responsibilities, or of having worked in their husband\u2019s business, particularly in the commercial and agriculture sectors, without remuneration and without social security affiliation; calls on the Member State governments to give recognition to the bringing up of children and ensure that this period counts towards a pension, thereby enabling women to benefit from full pensions; recommends that Member States ensure the provision of adequate pensions for women; 61. Calls on the Member States to take action to ensure fair access for women to social security and pension systems, taking into account the higher life expectancy of women, and to ensure that the principle of equal treatment between women and men is applied consistently in pension insurance schemes in order to reduce the gender pensions gap; 62. Calls on the Member States to provide adequate social security for the women responsible for the care of sick, elderly or disabled members of their families, and for elderly women who receive a particularly low pension; Impact of gender based violence on the risk of poverty 63. Points out that violence against women, which affects victims and perpetrators irrespective of age, education, income or social position, is still a major problem at European Union level, has an increasing impact on the risk of marginalisation, poverty and social exclusion and can be an obstacle to women\u2019s financial independence, health and access to the labour market and education; once again calls on the Commission to establish a European Year for combating violence against women; 64. Calls on the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure the due recording, analysis and study of the factors which lead to domestic violence so that policies can be developed immediately to prevent and deal with the consequences of such violence, such as providing shelter for homeless women who are victims of domestic violence; 65. Stresses the necessity to step up European efforts to eradicate human trafficking and sexual exploi\u00ad tation through closer judicial and police cooperation; urges the Member States to take the necessary measures to eliminate customary or traditional harmful attitudes and practices, including female genital mutilation, early and forced marriages, and honour crimes; 66. Calls on the Member States to establish national plans to combat all forms of violence against women where such plans are not already in existence, to ensure ongoing and systematic monitoring to measure progress, to ensure the highest standards of legislation with regard to combating male violence against women and to provide adequate funding for the support and protection of victims of violence, as a way to prevent and reduce poverty; 67. Recognises, in addition, that finding meaningful solutions to tackling female poverty may be one way of reducing gender-based violence, since women in poverty are at greater risk of abuse; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/87 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "68. Emphasises the importance of the Member States and regional and local authorities taking action to aid reintegration into the labour market for women who have suffered gender based violence, using instruments such as the European Social Fund (ESF) or the PROGRESS programme; 69. Calls on Member States to take gender-specific measures to address issues which are not only linked to income poverty, but which relate to culture, social and political participation and social networks; Social dialogue and civil society in fighting women\u2019s poverty 70. Stresses the importance of a structured social dialogue in fighting women\u2019s poverty; points, in this regard, to the need to improve systems for taking part in, and collaborating with, women\u2019s organisations, other NGOs and relevant stakeholders and civil society in general; 71. Considers that a genuine dialogue should aim to enable the members of the most disadvantaged groups, together with the national and EU administration, to share viewpoints and to contribute to over\u00ad coming extreme poverty, providing a concrete example of the very best practice at European level in this area; 72. Calls on the Commission to maintain the financial allocation that may be used among civil society organisations in fighting and curbing the effects of women\u2019s poverty; Ensuring funding as a means to combat poverty 73. Emphasises the importance of the structural funds, in particular the European Social Fund, as a key tool for assisting Member States to combat poverty and social exclusion; calls on the Member States for more co-funded actions to give greater support to services such as care facilities for children and for elderly and dependent persons, including by testing new forms of public-private organisational and financial cooperation and new arrangements for such cooperation; calls on the Member States to ensure that the resources allocated are used fairly and properly; 74. Emphasises the importance of developing the legal construct of shared ownership with the aim of ensuring that women\u2019s rights in the agricultural sector are fully recognised, that they receive appropriate social security protection and that their work is recognised; stresses, moreover, the need for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) Regulation ( 1 ) to be amended to enable, as with the European Social Fund (ESF), proactive measures to be taken in support of women in the 2014-2020 programming period, which was feasible in previous periods but not in the current one, and which will have very beneficial effects on female employment in rural areas; 75. Welcomes the establishment of a European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion; calls in this framework for specifically tailored actions, in particular technical assistance and back-up measures, oriented towards ensuring increased access and availability of microfinance for women who face difficulties entering the labour market or want to establish themselves as self-employed workers or launch their own micro-enterprises; * * * 76.

Calls on the Commission and Council to increase political pressure on Canada in order to set the earliest possible date for abolishing the visa regime for Czech citizens as well as ending other breaches of visa reciprocity towards citizens of Bulgaria and Romania; 2. Emphasises that unless this breach of reciprocity is resolved soon, equivalent retaliatory measures by the EU are likely to follow; 3. Calls on the Commission to establish, rather than bilateral arrangements, a new mechanism that guarantees full visa reciprocity for all Member States while ensuring that if a non-EU country breaches that visa reciprocity, all Member States will immediately restore the visa requirement for nationals of that country; 4.

        "F. whereas the impact of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on heading 5 should stabilise in 2012, although, for instance, the EEAS will have an impact which is still difficult to quantify at this moment, G. whereas, with Croatia\u2019s accession scheduled for 2013, enlargement will have an impact on the budget for 2012, particularly as regards resources for the new Members and staff recruitment, H. whereas in past years the budgetary authority has agreed to take a prudent approach on administrative expenditure, thus leaving significant margins under the heading 5 ceiling, I. whereas the ceiling for heading 5 of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the EU\u2019s budget in 2012 is EUR 8 754 million (representing an increase of EUR 340 million, or 4 %, compared to 2011, including 2 % for inflation), J. whereas in its capacity as colegislator Parliament has decided to find a reasonable match between its human resources and its new competences following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty (19,67 % of the heading 5 total in 2009, 19,99 % in 2010 and 20,03 % in 2011), K. whereas it is essential to monitor movements in heading 5 spending throughout 2011, in order to develop an appropriate forecast for the forthcoming budgets, L. whereas by decision of 24 March 2010 the Bureau adopted Parliament\u2019s medium-term buildings strategy, which sets out some key parameters for its future property policy; whereas as part of that strategy Parliament has decided to continue to give priority to the purchase of buildings (where reasonable), focusing on geographical concentration in its places of work; whereas early payment, with a view to reducing financing costs, remains one of the key priorities for the future, General framework and priorities for the 2012 budget 1. Underlines the difficult situation with respect to the heading 5 expenditure ceiling for 2012, and is fully aware of the fact that the institutions may encounter problems in meeting all financing requirements while maintaining budgetary discipline and self- restraint in order to comply with the multiannual financial framework; 2. Sets the principle of legislative excellence, as a priority, to ensure an appropriate response to the current political challenges, which requires the consolidation of the resources needed to address the new institutional framework resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty; takes the view that the budget of Parliament and the other institutions for 2012 should be a budget of consolidation, not least because it may also serve as a reference for the next multiannual financial framework; 3. Points out that this consolidation effort should not prevent investments (e.g. in technology) which would result in future long-term savings; 4. Views as another priority the principles of good management (Article 27 of the Financial Regulation), namely economy, efficiency and effectiveness; takes the view that these principles should be clearly reflected, in the spirit of accountability in the budgets of Parliament and the other institutions, as well as in their organisational cultures; believes, accordingly, that in the implementation of the various policies the results achieved must be taken into account and that variable expenses should, whenever possible and when their scale so demands, be made subject to regular cost-benefit evaluations; 5. Believes that, as a result of implementation of these principles, institutions should submit cost cutting plans; takes the view, in this connection, that thought should be given to the advantages of centralisation, so as to generate economies of scale (e.g.: centralised procurement, shared services between the institutions), as well as to what should remain, or be, decentralised; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/91 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Believes that accuracy, simplicity, clarity and transparency must be the result of the implementation of the principles of good management; requests, in this connection, the submission of an organisation chart for each institution, together with the respective cost of each constituent unit; requests, moreover, that each expense be clearly specified and justified, with a clear distinction between fixed and variable expenses in order to fulfil the principles of a zero-based budget; 7. Considers that, at the latest starting from the next multiannual financial framework, Parliament\u2019s budget and the budgets of the other institutions should be the result of multiannual planning covering the duration of that framework; 8. Points out that the necessary preparations should be made at interinstitutional level in order to accommodate staff from Croatia with a view to a possible enlargement of the EU; 9. Takes the view that Parliament and the other institutions should submit biannual reports on the implementation of their own budgets, giving details of the implementation of each budget line; 10. Takes the view that environmental policy and EMAS ( 1 ) should be part of Parliament\u2019s and the other institutions\u2019 cultures and that, for that purpose, measures for the reduction of paper consumption, energy, water and emissions should be submitted; 11. Reiterates that interinstitutional cooperation, whenever possible and appropriate, is essential in order to exchange best practices that favour effectiveness and allow for savings; considers that interinstitutional cooperation should be improved as regards translation, interpretation, recruitment (EPSO) and EMAS and should be extended to other areas; requests that there should be a thorough review of freelance translation and the role of the translation centre; 12. Recalls the need for a fully integrated knowledge management system; welcomes the information provided by the Administration regarding the knowledge management system; calls for a progress report on the multitude of information sources/systems available to Members; calls for a clear timetable to be established for the design of a prototype; stresses the need for speedy implementation of a classification and indexing policy; requests information on how this system can be made easily accessible to European citizens; 13. Stresses that it is important for the European Parliament and the other institutions to adopt an ambitious and far-reaching digital strategy with regard to the Web 2.0 tools and social networks in particular, to strengthen the link between Europe and its citizens; further considers that Parliament and the other institutions should develop an electronic governance strategy; calls for teleworking to be used where appropriate; calls on the Bureau to consider the introduction of a cloud computing system to reduce the operating costs of the computer system, improve its performance and bring greater mobility to Parliament\u2019s work; 14. Stresses that financial statements and similar types of cost analyses are of the highest importance for decision-making within the institution; insists that these should be used systematically and should identify the recurrent and one-off costs (i.e. fixed costs and variable costs) directly linked to each specific measure; 15. Asks for use to be made of staff redeployment and of retraining in order to enhance mobility; recommends that new staff only be recruited after internal redeployment and training procedures have failed and where the option of buying in external services is not appropriate; EN C 199 E/92 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 ( 1 ) Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2001 allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) (OJ L 114, 24.4.2001, p. 1).

Takes the view that a joint and coordinated strategy for budgetary implementation should be agreed between all the institutions affected by the accession of Croatia; requests an estimate to be made of the implications for heading 5; 17. Believes that all the institutions should have active non-discrimination policies and should adapt their buildings and human resources policies to ensure easier access for people with disabilities; 18. Emphasises that in a context of economic crisis, the heavy burden of public debt and restraint in times of ongoing national budgetary consolidation efforts, the European Parliament and the other insti\u00ad tutions should show budgetary responsibility and self-restraint; Parliament 19. Takes the view that Parliament\u2019s goal should be to develop legislative excellence and that all the necessary resources should be available for this purpose, while respecting budgetary constraints; 20. Believes that Parliament should show budgetary responsibility and self-restraint by staying around the inflation rate; following the interinstitutional line, enlargement-related needs are to be integrated either by an amending letter or amending budget; the needs for the 18 new MEPs following the Lisbon Treaty will be also integrated by an amending letter or amending budget; 21. Considers that the additional staffing resources allocated to Parliament\u2019s Administration to face the new challenges arising from the Lisbon Treaty should now enter a consolidation phase; insists that organi\u00ad sational structures should be such that they foster the creation of synergies by drawing on the respective expertise of existing specialised units; 22. Points out that Parliament\u2019s budget for 2011 amounts to EUR 1 685 m., representing 20,03 % of heading 5; 23. Expects the Bureau to submit realistic requests when presenting the estimates; is ready to examine its proposals on a fully needs-based and prudent basis in order to ensure appropriate and efficient functioning of the institution; stresses that the purpose of the amending letter presented by the Bureau to the Committee on Budgets in September is to take into account needs unforeseen at the time the estimates were drawn up, and stresses that it should not be seen as an opportunity to renew estimates previously agreed; following the interinstitutional line, the enlargement-related needs shall be integrated either in an amending letter or amending budget; the needs for the 18 new MEPs following the Lisbon Treaty will be also integrated by an amending letter or amending budget; 24. Requests a detailed and clear overview of those budget lines that were under-implemented in 2010 and looks forward to analysing the reasons for this; also wishes to receive an account of all carry-overs and their use in 2010, as well as an update on the final assigned revenues compared to the amounts that were budgeted; 25. Considers that Members must be given access to quality services in order to be able to perform their duties on an equal footing; stresses, therefore, the importance of equal treatment of Members of all nationalities and languages in terms of possibility for them to carry out the duties and political activity incumbent upon them in their own language if they so choose; finds, for instance, the absence of inter\u00ad pretation in committee meetings to be unacceptable; believes that the principle of sound financial management needs to apply to interpretation and translation as well; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/93 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Is also of the opinion that all means must be sought to increase the flexibility of interpretation as a crucial step in ensuring good working practices and notes that, in many instances, problems and financial wastage could be avoided if there were a possibility to swap languages at short notice depending on the actual attendance at meetings rather than the planned attendance; 27. Urges that a thorough review should be implemented as to whether the right of freedom of access for European citizens to meet with their European representatives could be more effectively matched with the urgent need to provide security for those who work in the institutions; asks the Secretary-General to submit such a report by 30 June 2011; 28. Takes the view that, as already decided, a fully functioning wifi service must be implemented so as to enable the goal of reducing the use of paper to be met; considers that the use of videoconferencing for meetings should be encouraged, as should the use of new environmentally friendly technologies; requests a cost-benefit analysis of such measures; 29. Points out, as regards buildings policy, that Parliament is striving to rationalise the allocation of its existing space and to realise cost savings and economies of scale; points out that the KAD extension project currently under way, the cost of which is estimated at about EUR 549,6 million (at 2016 prices), will allow the geographical concentration of Parliament\u2019s Administration in Luxembourg, and that all other buildings currently rented in Luxembourg will be gradually vacated, thus enabling substantial savings to be made once the project is completed; draws attention to the fact that the financing of this building project might require the setting up of specialised legal structures (a special-purpose vehicle), as the Financial Regulation prohibits direct borrowing, and that cost savings could be achieved if this project were to be financed directly from the budget or by means of a direct loan, which clearly shows the need for adjustments to be made to the Financial Regulation in order to guarantee more transparent and more direct implementation of future building projects; 30. Welcomes the decisions taken by the Bureau on 24 March 2010; reiterates its call for the devel\u00ad opment of a medium- and long-term buildings strategy; takes the view that this strategy should seek to find the best solution, taking into account the principles of good management and the need to assess various options and alternative financing possibilities; draws attention to the proposal in the abovementioned decision to use assigned revenues from the Belgian governement to invest in infrastructure for new office space for MEPs\u2019 assistants; requests additional information regarding the use of these assigned revenues for such a purpose, and detailed information on alternative options before any decision is taken; 31. Underlines the need for further information regarding the House of European History; in particular, calls for a detailed business plan to be submitted to the Committee on Budgets; reiterates the need to receive information concerning the global cost of this project as well as the future financial and legal implications for the EP and requests further information regarding the architectural design competition which has been ongoing since 2009; stresses that all decisions relating to the project are subject to standard parliamentary procedure; 32. Believes that, as is the case for all big organisations, an independent external viewpoint on how resources are used and how work is organised is sometimes necessary and can only be beneficial if handled correctly; while stressing that a political European institution such as Parliament is unique in character, considers that, in the long term, consideration should be given to carrying out such an external analysis of its organisation and management; believes that in 2012 some specific sector(s) could be identified and examined in this way; 33. Points out that Parliament\u2019s information and communication policy is important and should reach all European citizens and improve citizens\u2019 ability to interact directly with Parliament, and therefore requests that the results attained with this policy be evaluated; 34.

Is concerned about the proposal to create a European Added Value Assessment Unit to measure the cost of non-Europe; questions whether such an office is necessary; requests more detailed information regarding the creation of this office; Other institutions 38. Calls for realistic and cost-based budget requests from the other institutions which take full account of the need to manage scarce resources in an optimal way; welcomes the establishment of a new Section X in the EU budget for the European External Action Service, with an allocation of EUR 464 m., and is ready to examine the EEAS\u2019s needs as regards both real estate and personnel and determined to closely monitor its impact on heading 5, as its creation was intended to be budget-neutral; is not prepared to jeopardise the needs of the existing institutions; 39. Believes that the establishment of a new Section X in the EU budget for the European External Action Service responds to the need to provide the European Union with an institutional framework which, together with the new CFSP/CSDP provisions, can support the EU\u2019s ambitions in foreign policy; * * * 40.

Stresses that the major added value of EU macro-regional strategies is seen in multi-level cooperation, coordination and better strategic investment of available funding, not in additional allocation of resources; underlines the conclusions of the Swedish Presidency regarding no new institutions, no new legislation, no new budgets; 4. Calls for this strategy to be opened to all EU regions along the Atlantic coast, including Macaronesia outermost regions; 5. Believes that the external dimension of this strategy may be reinforced due to the geo-strategic position of Atlantic regions, in particular in the fields of maritime safety and surveillance and in the sphere of international trade relations; is of the opinion that international cooperation and triangular cooperation initiatives also need to be addressed; EN C 199 E/96 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Calls for this strategy to be well-connected to EU regional policy and integrated maritime policy and is of the opinion that it should also facilitate synergies with other EU policies such as trans-European transport networks, the common fisheries policy, climate and environment actions, the research and development framework programme, the energy policy, etc.; 8. Believes that the territorial dimension of this strategy is essential and will contribute to EU territorial cohesion; is of the opinion that this territorial dimension will have to address especially opening up, interconnection of transport and energy networks and development of marine energy, development of urban and rural areas and intensification of land-sea ties and of sea-interior waters ties; 9.

Recalls that the maritime dimension is a priority of this strategy, particularly through a maritime basins approach; 11. Strongly commends the promotion and support by the European Commission of the planning and setting up of maritime roads in the Atlantic region, such as the Gijon-Nantes maritime road, as an innovative way to improve and diversify the trans-European transport networks, to influence international trade relations, to stimulate the harbours\u2019 economic activity and strengthen tourism, and to contribute to the reduction in CO 2 emissions; 12. Is of the opinion that this strategy would address the following issues of common interest: marine energy, environment and climate change, including the prevention and fighting of marine pollution by ships, transport and accessibility, safety, security and surveillance, research, innovation, creative industries, culture, leisure and tourism, marine services and training, and fisheries and the seafood sector; 13. Believes that this strategy must develop synergies between relevant EU, national, regional and local policies and is therefore of the opinion that a renewed multi-level governance based on a closer involvement of EU, national, regional and local authorities is required; 14. Wishes for this strategy to work following a bottom-up approach, starting from local authorities and involving all stakeholders; insists on the necessity of associating regional and local public authorities, Member States, the European Union, private stakeholders and civil society organisations (including inter\u00ad regional networks and organisations concerned) in the design and the implementation of this strategy; 15. Insists that cooperation within the framework of this strategy should first and foremost be based on the needs of the stakeholders concerned and is thus of the opinion that the political priorities addressed have to be decided through a consensus; 16. Is of the opinion that the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) could be an inter\u00ad esting tool to facilitate cooperation within the framework of an EU strategy for the Atlantic region; 17. Is of the opinion that this strategy should be implemented from 2014 onwards and be coordinated with the next multiannual financial framework, and that it should go together with an action plan defined at European level and including a list of structuring projects; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/97 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Commission to draw up a European crisis map which identifies, measures and surveys those micro-regions within the EU where the inhabitants are hardest hit by poverty, social exclusion and discrimination, at least on the basis of the following attributes: \u2014 accessibility of workplaces, \u2014 distance from city centres or problematic over-concentration close to the city centres, \u2014 high rate of unemployment, \u2014 inadequate public services, \u2014 inappropriate environmental conditions, \u2014 lack of nearby companies, \u2014 lack of proper infrastructure, \u2014 low income, \u2014 low level of education, \u2014 low-level human resources, \u2014 poor/expensive transport infrastructure, \u2014 social tensions, \u2014 capacity of the local public administration to manage poverty, \u2014 situations of serious violations of human rights, discrimination, evictions, expulsions, racism, targeting of the Roma population by local or regional authorities or third parties; 44. Calls for the involvement of the Member States in providing data regarding the socio-economic situation of the Roma (mainly regarding their education, health, housing and employment) and invites international organisations (e.g. the ILO and the OECD) to elaborate on these issues as part of their general surveys, and to help set specific targets concerning, for example, the percentage of the Roma community who complete secondary and tertiary education, are employed in public administration or are represented in different sectors of social and political life, and asks the European Commission to help set up a clear and viable EU strategy on Roma inclusion with the help of these data; 45. Calls therefore on the Commission to bring specific support, including financial support, to these micro-regions and directly develop pilot projects that include the participation of mediators in line with the Council of Europe programme and a specific follow-up of the evolution of the implementation of the Strategy; 46. Calls on the Commission to encourage, within the Strategy, the Member States, relevant international and European institutions, NGOs, Roma communities, other stakeholders and the public to use the terms \u2018Roma\u2019 / \u2018Roma and Sinti\u2019 whenever referring to this minority; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/125 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Commission and the Council to allocate dedicated funding in the Cohesion Policy within the next Multiannual Financial Framework explicitly to support the Strategy by creating a performance reserve for the EU Strategy on Roma; 48. Takes the view that current EU fund absorption rates are too low; calls therefore on the Commission to analyse the reasons for this phenomenon and to elaborate a more efficient approach to monitoring the absorption of EU funds, in particular those funds specifically intended for marginalised groups; above all, calls urgently for the collection of data \u2013 with due consideration for the data protection directives \u2013 on the effectiveness of EU funds, in order to develop evidence-based policies; 49. Highlights the fact that the social exclusion of the Roma has a very strong territorial dimension of poverty and marginalisation which is concentrated in underdeveloped micro-regions that severely lack the financial resources required to make their own contribution to the Community funding for which they are eligible and which generally lack the administrative capacity and human resources to make good use of the funding; emphasises the need for specific efforts to be focused on these micro-regions that are often peripheral intra-regional areas and for the substantial simplification of bureaucratic red tape so that the maximum possible allocation of resources can be achieved under the umbrella of the Cohesion Policy; 50. Deems that there is also a need for new regulations on the allocation of the Structural Funds to set conditionality concerning the elimination of segregation and the assurance of equal access of the Roma to public services; takes the view that equal opportunity and anti-segregation plans should also be prepared at local level, based on measurable indicators and concrete actions; 51. Urges the Commission to provide appropriate instruments to guide the Member States in securing complementarity among the ESF, the ERDF, and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and invites the Member States to utilise other programmes, such as the PROGRESS programme, the Lifelong Learning programme, the Culture programme (2007-2013) and the Health programme (2008-2013) in the interests of Roma inclusion; 52. Calls for delegating EU development support bodies under the supervision and control of the Roma Task Force, in order to: \u2014 secure development-oriented EU funding in support of good local initiatives, \u2014 identify and report misuse of funds in time, \u2014 perform regular checks on the consistency and efficiency of the use of funding in relation to the expected result, including for the purposes for which funding is allocated under the Strategy, \u2014 serve as advisor by capitalising on the complex EU-wide knowledge, elaborating on indicators, impact assessment etc., and \u2014 provide targeted support of local initiatives, projects and complex programmes best fulfilling the objectives of the Strategy and generating efficient solutions to the concrete problems of Roma commu\u00ad nities; 53. Calls on the Commission and Member States to apply both participatory monitoring evaluation which involves Roma communities and helps to develop the capacity of the stakeholders on the one hand and external expertise in order to gain a realistic and objective view of the overall success or failure of different measures and instruments on the other; furthermore requests that the Commission provide Parliament with a list of projects financed by the Commission benefitting Roma since 2000, presenting indications about the results achieved; EN C 199 E/126 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Member States to implement the horizontal priority \u2018Marginalised Communities\u2019 within the framework of the EU Structural Funds and to participate in the EU-Roma network working on the good implementation of structural funds for Roma social inclusion; underlines that existing measures, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms must be significantly improved; stresses furthermore that agencies and organi\u00ad sations implementing projects co-financed by the Structural Funds and targeting Roma directly or bene\u00ad fitting Roma indirectly must be held accountable and implement actions in a transparent manner; furthermore, calls for an ongoing cost-benefit analysis of the proportion of funds dedicated to and spent on the actual programmes and running expenses; 55. Calls on the Commission and the Council to extend the scope of EU funding so that, besides development, the provision of quality public services also becomes eligible; stresses furthermore that co- financing should be reviewed and possibly differentiated to better reflect the diversity of actions and beneficiaries, and thus projects targeting Roma could be required to have a lesser share of co-financing from the country, with a higher share from the EU; 56. Stresses that coordination among related EU policies must be significantly improved in order to foster synergies and complementarities; bureaucratic and implementation rules must be substantially simplified and all barriers between the various funds must be eliminated so that the maximum possible allocation of resources can be achieved by all the instruments; 57. Emphasises the need for the Structural Funds to combine national and local approaches by acting through programmes that operate concurrently with a national strategy and provide local responses to specific needs; stresses, furthermore, the need to create synergies between the implementation of the Structural Funds and government strategies for Roma, as well as between the managing authorities of the European Social Fund and the specialised Roma units or coordination structures dealing with Roma issues; 58. Calls on the Commission and the Council to improve access to EU funds of local governments and NGOs working on Roma inclusion by simplifying the application process and rules; 59. Calls on the Commission to introduce in the Strategy a mechanism which promotes the hiring of Roma in public administration at both EU and national level, and calls on the Member States to hire Roma staff in public administration, especially in institutions participating in the programming and implemen\u00ad tation of EU and nationally-funded programmes for Roma inclusion; 60. Stresses the importance for the Member States to sign and ratify the European Convention of Nationality, which clearly states that no discrimination shall exist in a state\u2019s internal nationality law on the grounds of sex, religion, national or ethnic origin; 61. Underlines, in this context, the need to continue EU programmes, such as the Progress Programme to combat discrimination and JASMINE, which promotes investment in capacity building, and calls for such programmes to be further developed beyond 2013; 62. Welcomes the opportunity created through the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 437/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010, providing up to 3 % of the ERDF allocation to specific programmes or 2 % of the overall allocated budget for the rehabilitation of housing for the benefit of marginalised communities; regrets that no operational plans have so far been changed to reprioritise housing of the Roma population; calls on Member States to make quick and full use of this new oppor\u00ad tunity within the framework of the Structural Funds in order to strengthen the prospects of effective social inclusion; calls on the Commission to come forward with a specific action plan on this Regulation to speed up the use of the funds and recommends the preparation of a Commission report on their utilisation; furthermore, calls on the Member States to make effective use of the potential for interaction between the ERDF, the ESF and EAFRD in developing programmes for Roma integration; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/127 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Recognises that Roma communities are extremely heterogeneous groups, with the consequence that there can be no single strategy; recommends therefore that the local and regional authorities of the Member States propose effective integration policies that should differ according to their specific backgrounds (geographical, economic, social, cultural); recommends that the Commission make use of the experience acquired by those authorities which have actively contributed to the integration of Roma communities and encourages the use of best practices and recipes for success, with a view to achieving their social inclusion; 64. Recalls that the main prerequisite of successful integration is a joint effort made by both mainstream society and the Roma community; calls therefore on the Member States to help improve the housing and employment situation of the Roma people and recommends that Member States and regional and local public authorities integrate \u2013 in accordance with the regulation governing the European Regional Devel\u00ad opment Fund \u2013 the allocation of new housing to marginalised communities into a broader, more complex policy framework of mutual and two-way social commitment, such as community building, which includes the participation of Roma in the process of building the new establishments and mutual efforts to enhance school attendance for children and substantially reduce unemployment; the Member States can thus signifi\u00ad cantly contribute towards a concrete solution for the location needs of marginalised groups living in poor housing conditions; also urges the Member States to make use of the EU Roma network in order to encourage an exchange of best practices; 65. Calls on the Commission and the Council to make maximum use of the programmes within the European Territorial Cooperation objective, such as cross-border cooperation programmes, transnational cooperation programmes and interregional cooperation programmes, and to exploit the possibilities provided by the European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation; 66. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to analyse and eliminate the barriers to (re)entering the labour market and self-employment of Roma women and furthermore to place proper emphasis on the role of women in the economic empowerment of marginalised Roma and launching businesses; furthermore calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure the involvement of Roma women in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the EU Strategy on Roma Inclusion; 67. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to include as a horizontal objective the capacity building and empowerment of Roma women in all the priority areas of the EU Strategy on Roma Inclusion; 68. Calls on the Commission and the Council to include the promotion of gender equality among the objectives of the Strategy as well as combating multiple and intersectional discrimination; 69. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to collect, analyse and publish reliable statistical data disaggregated by gender so as to be able to properly evaluate and update the Strategy as well as measure the impacts of the Strategy\u2019s projects and interventions on Roma women; 70. Calls for the inclusion in the Strategy of a mechanism of cooperation, exchange of information and monitoring, not only at EU but also at national level, together with the Fundamental Rights Agency, the Council of Europe, other relevant international and European institutions, NGOs, Roma communities and other stakeholders, in order to address problems and find solutions and to ensure that the Strategy is correctly and fully implemented both at EU and national level by those responsible for it, thereby ensuring the success of the Strategy; 71. Calls on the Commission to offer the technical support needed to improve the administrative capacities of bodies involved in the administration of the Structural Funds, and calls on the Member States to provide advice and administrative assistance, e.g. by organising training and by helping with aid applications and explanations, to make it easier for Roma to obtain information concerning European and national funding programmes in support of entrepreneurship and employment and to submit the relevant applications; EN C 199 E/128 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Believes that a better future for the Roma people can be ensured through education and that investing in the education of Roma children and youth is therefore essential; emphasises that schooling is not only a right but also a duty and expresses its support for activities aimed at enhancing the participation of Roma students in schools, including via the active involvement of their families; 74. Believes that promoting knowledge of Romani culture across Europe will facilitate mutual under\u00ad standing between Roma and non-Roma in Europe while also boosting European intercultural dialogue; 75. Takes the view that the future strategy for the Roma minority should focus on education as the core instrument for promoting social inclusion; 76. Believes that support mechanisms such as scholarships and mentoring arrangements should be established for young Roma in order to inspire them not only to obtain diplomas but also to enrol in higher education and improve their qualifications; 77. Takes the view that a new type of scholarship programme should be developed to ensure the highest-quality instruction for Roma students in order to educate a new generation of Roma leaders; 78. Believes that educational institutions whose underprivileged students win places at higher-level institutions, or whose percentage of students graduating is above average, should be rewarded, and calls on the Commission to develop projects in this area; 79. Stresses that it is crucial that the Member States promote the integration of Roma into the community and cultural life of the places and countries in which they live, and ensure their long-term participation and representation therein, including through measures designed to promote vocational education and training (VET) and lifelong learning programmes aimed at the Roma community, taking into account the cultural heritage and way of life of the various Roma groups in Europe; points out, for instance, that efforts could be made to offer special training for school staff, to promote the hiring of Roma schoolteachers, to foster close cooperation with Roma families and organisations and to provide after-school support and scholarships; notes that this process should actively involve local authorities in the Member States and send a signal to the non-profit sector that its activities should include programmes designed to integrate Roma people into society; 80. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to combat every form of social and educational exclusion of the Roma and to encourage all programmes that invest in education for Roma people; 81. Believes that local governments must take responsibility for reintegrating students who drop out of the school system before reaching the age at which education ceases to be compulsory; notes that, to this end, educational institutions must provide local governments with information about school-leavers; 82. Calls on the Commission to support further initiatives designed to provide early childhood education opportunities and care for Roma children and youth; 83. Believes that kindergartens and/or alternative forms of pre-school care and education should be established in communities where none exist and expanded where there is a lack of places; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/129 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Commission to support initiatives which have proved effective in preventing any form of segregation and prioritise inclusive projects that promote educational success and involve the partici\u00ad pation of Roma families; 85. Expresses its concern at the high rate of illiteracy among the Roma people and deems it essential that programmes are designed and developed which ensure quality primary, secondary and tertiary education for Roma girls and women, including strategies to facilitate their transition from primary to secondary school and promote, throughout the whole process, greater understanding of Roma cultural heritage, history and values among Roma and non-Roma people; 86. Emphasises that low school attendance, high absenteeism rates and low educational achievement may indicate that pupils and parents are not always aware of the importance of school; other relevant factors may include insufficient resources, health problems, lack of quality education on site or of accessible transportation to school, substandard housing and clothing that make school attendance impossible, a non-inclusive school climate and segregated schools that fail to provide adequate preparation with a view to competitiveness on the job market; underlines, therefore, the importance of action aimed at promoting school participation by Roma students and of ongoing, regular dialogue on educational matters with those students\u2019 families, the Roma community and all stakeholders; 87. Emphasises the vital role that grass roots and performance sports can play in the process of ensuring the inclusion of the ethnic Roma population; 88. Supports the promotion of teacher training programmes that enhance teachers\u2019 ability to engage with children and youth with a Roma background, as well as with their parents and people employed as Roma mediators, particularly in primary schools, as a way to promote regular school attendance by Roma; 89. Suggests that different approaches to educational integration be adapted both to children from Roma families wishing to settle in one place \u2013 by monitoring children\u2019s regular school attendance, for instance \u2013 and to those from families wishing to continue their nomadic way of life \u2013 through measures facilitating school attendance inside Roma camps, for example; 90. Stresses the importance of mobility, lifelong learning, vocational training and continuing training programmes with a view to ensuring the inclusion of young people and adults from Roma communities and enhancing their potential to enter the employment market; 91. Believes that the workplace training system must be expanded so as to allow the large-scale acquisition of the necessary skills and abilities; 92. Believes that it is necessary to harmonise the supply of training with labour market demand and calls, therefore, for medium-term national and regional forecasts of expected labour demand; 93. Calls on the Commission to develop and implement joint monitoring systems involving the EU institutions, the Member States and Roma community leaders, in respect of the programmes and projects put into practice within the Member States; 94. Views the Roma culture as an integral part of Europe\u2019s cultural mosaic; points out that a key means of understanding the Roma people and their way of life is to increase other Europeans\u2019 awareness of the heritage, traditions and language of the Roma and of contemporary Roma culture; strongly supports the promotion and preservation of their creative activities as an essential component of intercultural dialogue; EN C 199 E/130 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Commission to promote best practices and positive models and experiences arising from implemented programmes and Roma self-initiatives, with a view to improving the perception and image of Roma within non-Roma communities and boosting active participation by Roma communities and creative collaboration between those communities and the EU, the Member States and local programmes; 98. Calls for better identification and use, at all levels of government, of the existing EU funds available to promote the employment, education and culture of Roma peoples; 99. Recommends that future EU policies for the Roma minority should be based on a differentiated approach, tailored to the specific features of the different Member States and the particular nature of the communities involved; 100. Draws attention to the importance of conducting stricter checks on the use of EU funding for Roma inclusion; 101. Believes that exchanges of experience and good practices between Member States having achieved good results in the area of Roma inclusion and those still faced with this issue would be useful; 102. Recognises that the complexity of paperwork may constitute an obstacle to project organisers; stresses the need to step up work on simplifying grant procedures; stresses the under-utilisation of European funding in this field; 103.

Stresses that a new, sustainable industrial policy can achieve success only via an integrated, cross- sectoral approach underpinned by practical horizontal and sectoral initiatives based on objective economic argumentation, focused on common issues with major implications for a number of sectors and bringing tangible results for both business and consumers at European, national, regional and local level; 12. Emphasises how important sectors like energy and transport are within the cost structure of European industry; takes the view that the competitiveness of these sectors needs to be further improved via privatisation; with this in mind, is convinced of the need to restrict the level of public funding in companies operating in liberalised markets and to take steps with a view to the freedom to provide services in all modes of transport; 13. Believes that macro-economic framework conditions in which European industry can thrive must be established, taking due account of the reality of resources scarcity and depletion; in this context, considers that Europe must aim not only at promoting today's competitiveness but above all at securing future competitiveness; 14. Takes the view that the EU\u2019s industrial strategy should identify strategic fields to invest in and calls on the Commission and the Member States to reflect these priorities in the future financial perspective, in the annual budgets and in EU policies; 15. Considers it important to adopt an integrated industrial policy under which European initiatives in all areas are complementary and not contradictory to the common goal of development; 16. Urges the Commission to make haste with the completion of the EU single market, this being a precondition for competitive industry and innovation; 17. Highlights the fact that fair competition together with open markets are crucial for the emergence of new and dynamic industries; 18. Is convinced that not only the public sector but mostly the private sector will have an essential role to play in investing in the restructuring and the development of new industrial sectors, ensuring both the creation of jobs and the transition to a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy; considers it essential, therefore, for the right framework to be in place to stimulate these private investments; 19. Emphasises that the new, integrated approach calls for extremely effective collaboration within the Commission and coherence amongst the different Commission policies; to this end, calls on the Commission to set up a permanent industrial policy task force which will be responsible for coordinating and adapting the direction and the measures under the current new and integrated European industrial policy strategy and for monitoring their implementation; 20. Calls on the Commission to focus more on competitiveness aspects during the impact assessment process (\u2018Competitiveness Proofing\u2019) and in ex-ante/ex-post evaluation (\u2018Fitness Checks\u2019), and to implement this essential part of smart regulation as fast as possible across all Commission services; stresses the fact that sustainability is essential for continuous competitiveness and for a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy; 21. Stresses that the European Union could create the most competitive industry in the world by means of, inter alia: \u2014 new standards of quality and effectiveness, \u2014 shortening the time-to-market for new products with the help of advanced ICT analytical, design, manufacturing and maintenance tools, methods and processes, EN C 199 E/136 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",
        "\u2014 facilitating the development of SMEs and the equipment sector within the supply chain, \u2014 making more determined efforts to match the synergies between civil and military research; 22. Supports the Commission\u2019s initiative at Point 3 of its Communication consistently to analyse the industrial policy implications of future legislation and to assess the implementation of this legislation, and stresses that the social partners must be included and there must be the greatest possible transparency; 23. Stresses that a new, sustainable EU industrial policy can only be effective if it is pursued in close coordination with the industrial policies of the Member States, and therefore calls on the Commission to take in 2011 the initiatives that are possible under Article 173(2) of the Lisbon Treaty, in the form of guidelines, indicators, exchange and dissemination of best available practices and technologies, monitoring and evaluation procedures; 24. Calls on the Commission to develop, together with the European Parliament and the Council, a new framework that will permit and encourage companies from different Member States to work together more effectively in setting and achieving their industrial priorities; believes that this will strengthen the competi\u00ad tiveness of European-made products and improve responses to changing global market conditions; 25. Is convinced that the success of a new, sustainable industrial policy depends on the involvement of all stakeholders, including the social partners, regional and local authorities, representatives of SMEs and civil society; notes that the Commission is required to embed a clear partnership principle in all areas and measures, part of which consists in joint monitoring and evaluation of anticipated measures, including assessment of strategies/measures/programmes; 26. Considers that an \u2018EU industrial policy for the globalised era\u2019 can achieve its aims only if it deals with the extent to which Community policies are adapted to future challenges that European regions and their local industries are facing and will face in the coming years, insofar as the EU policies concerned lead to an increase in the efficiency and competitiveness of SMEs, the prime movers of European industry; in this regard, stresses that the impact of economic, demographic, climate and energy changes needs to be further analysed with respect to their regional dimension, taking into consideration the potential regional disparities that these challenges will generate, thus affecting the homogeneous growth of EU industries; emphasises the leading role played by regions in promoting the greening of industry and the development of renewable energies; 27. Notes that industrial policy depends to a large extent on protecting EU industry against unfair competition from third countries; 28. Calls on the Commission to draw up without delay a detailed time frame for monitoring imple\u00ad mentation of this strategy and to present an annual progress report; considers, furthermore, that the Commission should reassess every year the effectiveness of these guidelines and initiatives in order to identify any problems that have arisen during their implementation, and should lay down additional objectives with a view to ensuring that EU industrial policy is always at the forefront of progress; 29. Points out that internationalisation is a key factor in the competitiveness of businesses, and therefore calls on the Commission to step up efforts to promote as much as possible the knowledge gained across the spectrum of business support networks so that companies that are in the process of internationalisation can make use of it; 30. Stresses that pan-European structures and infrastructures that aim at joining sources and resources could launch a pan-European industrial model capable of competing on the global market; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/137 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",
        "Funding 31. Calls for ambitious funding for industrial policy and for infrastructure facilities (in particular research and energy, telecommunications and transport (TEN) infrastructure) \u2013 the \u2018public utilities\u2019 that make up the corporate environment; considers it essential, to this end, for EU bonds (Eurobonds or project bond) to be issued with a view to enabling the Union to fund innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation; Innovation 32. Stresses that innovation is the main driving force behind industrial policy and growth, and that all initiatives in support of innovation: \u2014 must be based on a comprehensive definition of innovation which embraces products and producing systems, services, training, processes, organisation, quality, management, dissemination and protection, \u2014 must take account of policies implemented in third countries and make suitable adjustments to some of our internal policies, such as those governing state aids for research, development and innovation, \u2014 must, in particular, cover the design, production and composition of products and services along the whole chain of processes and added value, through the provision of support right up to the product pre- marketing stages, \u2014 must be technology-neutral, \u2014 must first aim at providing a favourable environment for companies to invest in R&D and innovation through efficient financing schemes and greater cooperation between actors inside and between different industries and within the value chains, research institutes and universities, \u2014 must focus on the role that production plays in the innovation phase; if all industrial production is relocated to other parts of the world, knowledge production will lose its base in Europe and also relocate because ideas produced on the drawing board cannot be tested immediately in practice, \u2014 must promote creativity and employee-driven innovation within public and private organisations; 33. Stresses the need to distinguish more clearly between research and innovation as activities which, while closely linked, have different objectives, means, instruments of intervention and working methods: research, carried out by enterprises in the interests of their own growth, should create new knowledge and should, by its nature, be exploratory, independent and risk-taking; innovation, by contrast, has the objective of creating new products, new services and new processes having a direct impact on the market, on society and on the life of enterprises as such; 34. Believes that in particular the setting of benchmarks and standards has proven to be a strong driver for promoting innovation and sustainable competitiveness in several industrial sectors; calls for a reinforcement of the European Standardisation System through measures promoting simplification, trans\u00ad parency, cost reduction and involvement of stakeholders; 35. Draws attention to the need for better coordination between Member States and closer cooperation between businesses through business clusters, networks and centres of excellence; 36. Stresses that the competitiveness of the EU is very much dependent on innovation capacity, on research and development facilities and on the linkage between innovation and the manufacturing process; EN C 199 E/138 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",
        "37. Calls for research expenditure for the upcoming programming period from 2013 (8th RDP) to be significantly increased (EU target: 3 % of GDP for research and development, 1 % of GDP in public funding) as a matter of priority, so that European industry remains at the forefront of technology and globally competitive, thus putting private investment to effective use; notes that, alongside a strong focus on research into innovative processes, management, organisation and employee involvement in innovation, research in basic generic technologies is needed; stresses, furthermore, the need for the administrative procedures and procedures for gaining access to funding to be simplified; 38. Points out that the increase in regional disparities in terms of research and development potential is a challenge that has to be addressed not only in the framework of cohesion policy but also through research and innovation policy; in this respect, calls, in addition to research funding, for a reallocation of funding within the same operational programmes in order to support innovation and to enhance the deployment of research into marketed solutions for society; 39. Notes that a significant increase in R&D investment, both private and public, is essential for EU industry to remain a technology leader and retain global competitiveness in areas such as renewable energy and transport efficiency; notes that to support increased private R&D investment, functioning markets for innovative products and a stable investment environment are necessary; takes the view that increased public funding of R&D is necessary to leverage private investment and encourage collaboration, and that simplifi\u00ad cation of public funding procedures, especially in the EU Framework Programmes, is a prerequisite for increased industry participation; 40. Recognises, however, that for Europe to reach the investment levels needed for innovation to be the driving force behind economic growth, the private sector needs to increase its R&D funding; therefore calls on the Commission to examine the barriers preventing Europe\u2019s businesses from investing at equivalent levels to their international counterparts, e.g. the US, and to take appropriate measures, legislative as well as non-legislative, as deemed necessary; 41. Considers Joint Technology Initiatives (such as Clean Sky) to be an extremely useful means of marshalling funding from States, the EU and the private sector for innovative projects with a strong knock-on effect; calls for funding to continue to be provided for existing projects, so that they may be completed, and considers it essential for new projects to be developed in promising sectors (such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, space, renewable energy, new means of transport and new materials); 42. Calls for the consistent use and reinforcement of available scientific and technological competencies in the Member States, particularly in key enabling technologies (KETs); 43. Welcomes the deployment of a high-level group of experts to draw up a common longer-term strategy and an action plan for KETs, so that their potential can be fully realised; 44. Stresses the success of the Risk Sharing Financial Facility (RSFF) as an important way of providing R&D and innovation funding via the EIB; strongly encourages the Commission to make significantly more funds available, including through revolving innovation funds from ERDF sources, and to promote direct private investments and innovative financing mechanisms for high-risk innovative projects and those in which suitable SMEs participate; also stresses the importance of making innovation programmes more accessible for SMEs by decreasing bureaucratic burdens; 45. Is concerned about firms\u2019 limited uptake of structural funding for the purpose of financing innovative projects; takes the view that managing authorities should focus on raising firms\u2019 awareness of the oper\u00ad ational programmes and providing them with whatever help they need to launch their projects; 46. Calls on the Commission to draw up an inventory of the best practices of existing and planned funding mechanisms, fiscal measures and financial incentives to promote innovation, and calls for an annual update and review of the measures\u2019 effectiveness; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/139 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",
        "47. Calls for thought to be given to introducing new, alternative mechanisms to address the shortage of funding for EU businesses, in particular SMEs; considers that such mechanisms must \u2014 be based on public-private partnerships that share the risks between private and public investors, \u2014 ensure that public investment has the best possible leverage effect, thus generating substantial private investment, \u2014 take account of the specific needs of innovative SMEs, which do not have the equity or assets required in order to raise funds through loans, \u2014 foster the commercialisation of European research findings, as well as technology transfers to SMEs, and \u2014 support action by the European Investment Bank; and must take the form of the following instruments: \u2014 a European Innovation Financing Fund (EIFF), the role of which would be to invest in the start-up and development phases, on a risk-capital basis, \u2014 a European patents fund to facilitate technology transfers between research centres and businesses, in particular innovative SMEs, \u2014 loans on more favourable terms than those obtainable on the market; 48. Acknowledges the EU\u2019s problem of having fewer young leading innovators in high R&D-intensity sectors, especially biotech and internet; stresses, therefore, the need to encourage their development by tackling the specific barriers they face in new sectors and by closely monitoring emerging innovative markets, adapting the mix of policy instruments to their specific needs; 49. Calls on the Commission to create an environment favourable to enterprises at the start-up and spin- off phases, by means of dedicated services enabling young entrepreneurs to overcome the barriers which have traditionally stood in the way of embarking on new productive activities (infrastructural barriers, access to information, cost of services, management of intellectual property); 50. Calls lastly for the EU to respond to the fragmentation of the European risk-capital market by bringing forward an EU scheme to establish pan-European funds; 51. Underlines the fact that investment in R&D and innovation could be made through national tax incentives and access to specialised finance, for instance venture capital; 52. Calls for further stimulation of technologies for sustainable development as begun in the ETAP action plan with the cross-linking of research, environmental and economic strategies, calls for an ambitious ETAP follow-up plan, where research, education, training and industry will join their efforts, and calls for allo\u00ad cation of adequate financial resources for its implementation; stresses the need to increase funding for the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan); EN C 199 E/140 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Calls for industry to be involved in eco-innovation to boost its employment potential; notes, in this regard, that informing entrepreneurs \u2013 by demonstrating new business opportunities \u2013 will be crucial to the success of a strategy aimed at developing resource-efficient economies and sustainable industries; 54. Suggests that thought also be given to other forms of funding to support the development of innovative technologies by bringing together various stakeholders at different levels (European, national and local), as well as to making use of a range of tools including public-private partnerships and risk capital; 55. Calls for particular attention to be paid to support for innovation in effective and sustainable use of raw materials; 56. Recalls that, representing as it does an annual 17 % of GDP in the EU, public procurement plays an important role for the European single market and for stimulating innovation; points out that competitors such as China and the USA have set ambitious targets for public procurement of innovative and environ\u00ad mental products; calls on the Member States and the Commission to simplify and improve national and EU procurement rules where necessary and in line with the rules of transparency, fairness and non-discrimi\u00ad nation; calls on the Commission to provide information about existing possibilities of involving innovative and sustainable criteria in tenders under current EU procurement rules in line with the Europe 2020 Strategy and to promote the use of these possibilities; stresses that it is essential to ensure reciprocity of access to external public procurement markets, so as to enable EU businesses to compete on fair terms internationally; 57. Notes that pre-commercial public procurement can give a decisive initial push to new markets for innovative and green technologies, while also improving the quality and effectiveness of public services; calls on the Commission and the Member States to improve communication with public authorities about existing possibilities for pre-commercial procurement; 58. Considers that the importance of public procurement in stimulating an innovative industrial base should not be underestimated; calls in this regard on the EU Member States to exploit the full potential of pre-commercial procurement as a driver of innovation and as a tool for improving SME participation in public procurement, with the effect of identifying and effectively stimulating lead markets for European business; 59. Calls on the Commission to increase its efforts to prevent knowledge being transferred from the EU all over the world, particularly to China, which does not often reciprocate; Resources 60. Considers that economic growth can and should be decoupled from increased use of resources; 61. Is convinced that the clear increase in resourcing efficiency as regards raw and auxiliary materials and supplies is strengthening the global competitive position of European industry, and therefore calls on the Commission to propose, building on its Communication on a resources strategy (COM(2005)0670), an ambitious EU resource efficiency policy as a priority, by means of an action plan or, if need be, in a Directive on resource efficiency; considers that this means: \u2014 drawing up a clear definition of resources in all their facets, \u2014 developing clear cradle-to-cradle indicators for monitoring resource productivity and, if necessary, further developing corresponding standards, guidelines and prototype development of new approaches, EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/141 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Takes the view that an industry policy needs, first and foremost, to rebalance energy actions in favour of a demand-driven policy, empowering consumers and decoupling economic growth from energy use; considers in particular that the transport and construction industries must pursue an active energy savings policy and diversify towards sustainable, non-polluting and safe energy sources, and that an industry policy should help create market conditions which stimulate higher energy savings and energy efficiency investments, to exploit a wide range of renewable energies as well as key technologies for energy storage mobility (notably public transport); 64. Is convinced that, in order to ensure security of investment, industry needs an ambitious but realistic long-term energy policy which: guarantees competitive energy prices and security of EU supply, reduces dependence on fossil fuels, encourages efficiency and savings in production and consumption, allows manufacturing to take place with as few damaging emissions as possible, and prevents energy poverty and carbon leakage; points out that legal certainty, stable framework conditions, appropriate investment and further harmonisation of the internal energy market are key to switching to low-carbon production and supply and reducing industry costs; stresses that the infrastructure for a trans-European energy network, which includes heating and also takes advantage of the digital and transport network infrastructures, must therefore be renewed and extended in a timely and cost-efficient manner, and smart grids and metering promoted, particularly with the aid of funding from the European Investment Bank; 65. Emphasises the importance to the European automobile sector of taking the lead in the further development and production of electric cars; calls on the European Commission in this respect to ensure, at the latest by mid-2011, framework conditions for the development of electric vehicles, notably concerning standardisation of infrastructures and charging technologies which will guarantee interoperability and safety of infrastructures; calls furthermore on the Commission to set up harmonised requirements for the approval of electric vehicles, with specific regard to health and safety for both workers and end-users; EN 7.7.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 199 E/143 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Recalls the huge job creation potential and cost reduction benefits that energy efficiency improvements are expected to yield; considers that the adoption of measures including targets, standards and benchmarking mechanisms that ensure energy efficiency improvement must therefore underpin initiatives in all industrial sectors; 67. Calls for innovations in health care and the social sector so that industries will not face workforce shortages and higher labour costs in the next decades; 68. Draws attention to the energy-saving potential of smart technologies; 69. Believes that a policy of improving sustainability of transport systems and infrastructure through such measures as more efficient technologies, interoperability and innovative mobility solutions but also local sourcing policies is needed to ensure that supply chains can function with more sustainable logistics systems and at reduced operating costs; 70. Believes that modern ICT technologies provide a large potential for innovations in support of sustainability and eco-efficiency, e.g. integration of technologies by putting additional intelligence layers on top of physical layers to achieve more efficiency management of systems (such as water supply, trans\u00ad portation systems); stresses the need to have open ICT standards available for such solutions; therefore urges the Commission to require open standards and stakeholders to drive the development of suitable open standards in support of resource efficiency; 71. Draws attention to the need for sufficient technical and skilled personnel; considers therefore that more investment is needed in the field of education and training; insists that every effort be made to redress skills shortages at all levels in order to promote the qualifications of the workforce and interest young graduates more in industry, by means inter alia of: \u2014 an institutionalised dialogue between the relevant authorities, representatives of businesses and the social partners with a view to reviewing syllabuses, so as to include the entrepreneurial spirit and increase awareness of business, and devising effective ways of completing the transition between education and profession, particularly encouraging the promotion of individual mobility programmes such as \u2018Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs\u2019 and \u2018Erasmus for Apprentices\u2019, \u2014 both strengthening work-based learning throughout Europe in order to link vocational training systems more closely to the labour market, and enhancing the appeal of vocational training throughout Europe with higher education permeability for vocational training graduates, \u2014 securing the right to lifelong learning for all citizens, who must be given the opportunity to retrain during their working life, which is crucial for equality and solidarity but also for competitiveness in times of economic difficulties, \u2014 innovative training of young students as future employees ready to confront the forecast technological movements and closer relations between universities, research institutes and industry, \u2014 improvement of and wider access at all levels to education and training, especially in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), by means of coordinated initiatives and the exchange of best practice in education, training, and innovative measures to reconcile work and family life and to promote gender and social justice, \u2014 coordinated activities to improve teaching and raise awareness of the economic role of European industrial sectors and the necessity of their innovative transformation within a low-carbon and resource efficient economy, EN C 199 E/144 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Takes the view that, to consolidate European industry and, in particular, improve the competitiveness of companies within the world economy, it is necessary to introduce European provisions regarding origin marking (Made In); considers that this would make it possible for the public and for consumers to make informed choices and would encourage production within the European Union, which is in many cases preceded by a reputation for quality and high production standards; 80. Considers that a multilateral climate agreement would be the best instrument for reducing the negative impacts of CO 2 on the environment, but that there is a risk that such an agreement will not be concluded in the near future; takes the view, therefore, that the EU should continue to look into the possibility of putting in place, for those industries that are actually exposed to carbon leakage, appropriate environmental instruments in addition to the auctioning of CO 2 quotas under the EU\u2019s emissions trading scheme, in particular a \u2018carbon inclusion mechanism\u2019 that complies with WTO rules, as such a mechanism would make it possible to combat the risk of CO 2 emissions being transferred to third countries; 81. Insists that the EU should examine the economic practices of third countries before drawing up its own policies, and calls in particular on the Commission to assess as a criterion the international competitive position of European businesses when monitoring State aid; A sustainable culture for industry 82. Stresses the importance of creating the right framework for industry to remain in Europe and to further improve its global competitiveness; believes, therefore, that EU policies should be based on robust impact assessments which analyse all angles of the economic, societal and environmental benefits of EU policies; 83. Calls for EU initiatives that identify what drives growth, innovation and competitiveness in different sectors and then bring forward stronger, coordinated technology-neutral and market-based EU policy responses and instruments for those sectors, of which full use should be made; considers that, for these purposes, product-specific legislation such as the eco-design directive should be developed further in a cost- efficient way, the energy efficiency labelling directive should be fully implemented, and industry-stimulating initiatives such as the \u2018green car initiative\u2019 put in place; calls, in this context, for a long-term campaign on sustainable consumption to raise awareness and change behaviour and thus support new innovative products and designs; 84.

Stresses the importance of taking into account aspects which are currently not covered by European patent law, such as \u2018business secrets\u2019, so as to enable European industry to reap the benefits of genuine protection of intellectual property rights relating to products and procedures, following the example of the USA and Japan; 95. Recalls that, in order to increase the competitiveness and technological leadership of European industry, it is desirable to: \u2014 take as a basis the European Standardisation System (ESS), the advantages of which have been demon\u00ad strated, and consolidate it so that it meets the needs of innovative undertakings as effectively as possible, particularly those of SMEs, \u2014 increase the participation of undertakings, especially SMEs, in the standardisation process and ensure a high degree of promotion of standards; 96.

Calls for improvement in the development of public-private partnerships; 107. Takes the view that in order to achieve Europe 2020 objectives and climate and energy targets by 2020, sectoral aid policy should not only be seen in the context of competition law, but must, in the interests of Europe, be used proactively, transparently and with clear rules to strengthen innovation, competitiveness and the roll-out of sustainable products, and in connection with industrial restructuring operations; opposes specific national State aid schemes that do not abide by the rules and therefore create unequal terms of competition; 108. Takes the view that competition policy must respond to the needs of an ambitious industrial policy, while respecting the rules of the internal market; 109. Emphasises that sustainable and fair development in the industrial sector can be better achieved by Member States through the principle of reciprocity of commercial policies; notes that regional network structures and competitive clusters should not be adversely affected by dissimilar commercial rules and provisions which have a particular impact on SMEs; 110. Stresses, as highlighted in many recent studies, that sectoral aid stimulates growth where it is compatible with the preservation of competition in the sectors concerned, and where its provision is coupled with mechanisms to ensure that projects which prove ineffective do not receive further funding; urges that the granting of such aid be systematically made subject to a requirement that the activities supported remain within the EU for at least five years, and at least 10 years in the case of R&D activities; 111. Notes in this connection that European business locations must be internationally competitive, especially in the field of key enabling technologies; 112. Believes that free trade remains a key cornerstone for Europe\u2019s economic growth and therefore calls for future multilateral and bilateral trade agreements to be drawn up in such a way that they form part of an industrial strategy based on fair global competition and reciprocity by European trading partners; takes the view that, in order to take into account the principle of sustainable development, social and environ\u00ad mental concerns and relevant standards should be incorporated in free trade agreements; considers that steps must be taken to ensure that European industries are not endangered by unfair practices, as is currently happening in the solar energy industry; recalls that regulatory dialogues with key trading partners must be strengthened to prevent and remove barriers to trade; calls on the Commission to strictly monitor the environmental legislation, exchange rate policies, state aid rules and other support programmes adopted by third countries competing with the EU; calls for the consideration of an EU foreign direct investment strategy in emerging markets to enable better access in new markets and building up of local production; EN C 199 E/150 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Wednesday 9 March 2011 ",

Calls on the Commission to respect the roadmaps and conclusions developed in industry-specific approaches; believes that these roadmaps provide industry with long-term planning certainty and are a valuable tool for remaining competitive; Responsibility 134. Takes the view that European industry and stakeholders should step up their investments, corporate, social and environmental engagements and cooperate closely to develop favourable framework conditions; believes that industry should maintain investment and production in Europe, sustain its own research efforts, and strive towards sustainable growth, innovation and fairly-paid employment; believes that industry has a role to play in developing a new culture of qualifications offering good opportunities for high quality training and even more innovative, sustainable products and processes, and should enter wherever possible into strategic partnerships in Europe; 135.

Underlines that democratic change cannot be imposed from outside or even by military means but has to be achieved through a peaceful democratic process; expresses its admiration for the courage of the tens of thousands of Iranians who continue to risk their professional careers and lives by calling for greater freedom and more democratic rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran; 3. Points out that, although President Ahmadinejad was elected in 2005 on a platform of social justice and economic populism, Iran\u2019s domestic problems have continued to worsen despite burgeoning oil prices; deplores, therefore, Mr Ahmadinejad\u2019s aim of shoring up his political position at home by embracing a radical international agenda with the expectation that a stridently anti-Western, anti-Israeli stance will enhance Iran\u2019s leadership position in the Muslim world; 4. Observes that previous Iranian mass movements were based on a dual quest for welfare and liberty, and that these remain unfulfilled promises of the 1979 revolution; points out that economic shortcomings such as inflation, corruption, high unemployment, energy shortages, an inefficient state sector and the waste of public funds have increased drastically over the last years; 5.

Insists on the safeguarding and strengthening of the Special Procedures and on the guaranteeing of the possibility for the UNHRC to address specific human rights violations through country resolutions and country mandates; stresses the importance of the indivisibility of human rights, whether social, economic, cultural, civil or political; notes with concern that the Complaints Mechanism, a unique universal victim- oriented mechanism, has produced little in the way of outcome in relation to the large number of submissions it has received; underlines the need to address this issue in the UNHRC review; Universal Periodic Review (UPR) 25. Recognises the added value of the UPR as a shared experience for all governments, which submits all UN members to equal treatment and scrutiny despite the fact that the countries have to voluntarily accept to be submitted and to follow up the recommendations; points out that by December 2011 all United Nations Member States will have been reviewed under this mechanism; 26. Insists that it is essential to maintain a space for civil society in the UNHRC in order to enhance civil society participation in the dialogue, opening up new opportunities for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to enter into dialogue within particular States; 27. Supports further involvement of NGOs in the UPR by allowing the submission of written recom\u00ad mendations for consideration by the Working Group and participation in its deliberations; 28. Takes note of the possibility the UPR offers for States to commit to implementing their human rights obligations, and following up on the conclusions of treaty bodies and Special Procedures; 29.

Calls on EU Member States to continue to engage in the review of the UNHRC, to ensure there is no gap between the first and second cycles of the UPR, and to ensure the second cycle focuses on the implementation and follow-up of recommendations; supports the view that States submitted to the UPR should provide clear responses to each recommendation and timetables for implementation of the Working Group\u2019s recommendations; notes that the submission of a mid-term report on the status of implementation may contribute to this process; Special Procedures 32. Restates that Special Procedures lie at the core of the UN human rights machinery, and that the credibility and effectiveness of the UNHRC in the protection of human rights rests on cooperation with Special Procedures and their full implementation; stresses, in this context, that strengthening the inde\u00ad pendence and interactivity of the Special Procedures with the Council is fundamental; 33. Condemns attempts to undermine the independence of Special Procedures by putting governments in an oversight position over the Special Procedures; stresses that any sort of control would politicise and damage the effectiveness of the system; 34. Reiterates that the Special Procedures on country situations are an essential instrument for improving human rights on the ground; stresses that due to crucial elements like their periodicity and the expertise they are based on, country mandates cannot be replaced by the UPR; 35. Calls on EU Member States to defend the integrity and accountability of the UNHRC in the review by supporting the establishment of a follow up-mechanism on the implementation of recommendations of Special Procedures, in addition to the adoption of selection criteria and a more transparent appointments process based on the background, skills, qualifications and experience of nominees; endorses the proposal by NGOs to strengthen the early warning capacity of Special Procedures through a mechanism that allows them to trigger the automatic consideration of a situation by the UNHRC; EU involvement 36. Welcomes the participation of the EU HR/VP in the UNHRC 16th session; 37. Insists on the EEAS, and notably the EU delegations in Geneva and New York, increasing the coherence, visibility and credibility of the EU\u2019s action in the UNHRC by further developing cross-regional outreach and cooperation and especially on lobbying the moderate states in all groups; 38. Reiterates in this regard its position concerning the concept of \u2018defamation of religions\u2019 and, while recognising the need to address fully the problem of discrimination against religious minorities, considers that the inclusion of this concept in the Protocol on complementary standards on racism, racial discrimi\u00ad nation, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination is not appropriate; welcomes the side event organised by the EU delegation to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; requests the EU to engage with the main sponsors of the resolution and other players to find an alternative to the resolution on defamation that will be presented; 39.

Notes with concern that the EU has been unable to exercise influence effectively within the wider UN system; stresses the need for the EU to make the HRC a priority and to coordinate better among the Member States, and calls on the Council to adopt guidelines in order to facilitate coordination and decision- making in this context, and to seek to build coalitions/allegiances with key regional partners and all moderate states in an effort to overcome the logic of blocs within the HRC; 45. Draws attention, on a practical level, to the importance of having a larger, well-resourced EU Delegation in Geneva and New York; stresses that what happens in Geneva and New York must be an integral part of EU foreign policy, with a focus on improving internal coordination, and stresses, too, the need for good interplay between the bilateral and multilateral levels; 46. Deplores the fact that the resolution tabled by the EU for the UN General Assembly in September 2010 with the aim of reinforcing its \u2018status\u2019 in order to be consistent with the new institutional arrangements arising from the Lisbon Treaty has been postponed; points out that this enhanced status would give the EU the possibility of being represented by a constant figure (the President of the European Council and/or the High Representative) and of speaking with one voice, and would raise the visibility and influence of the EU as a global actor; insists on the need to continue efforts made by the EEAS \u2018special task force\u2019 to promote the adoption of the resolution in close cooperation with the EU Member States; 47. Mandates its delegation to the 16th Session of the UNHRC to voice the concerns expressed in this resolution; calls on the delegation to report to the Subcommittee on Human Rights regarding its visit, and considers it indispensable to continue sending a European Parliament delegation to relevant sessions of the UNHRC; 48. Reiterates its call on the EU Member States to ensure that human rights are respected in their own internal policies in order to avoid double standards and in view of the current accession process of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), as failure to do so fundamentally could weaken the EU\u2019s position in the UNHRC; * * * 49.

(2) The GFCM Agreement provides an appropriate framework for multilateral cooperation to promote the development, conservation, rational management and best utilisation of stocks of living aquatic resources in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea at levels which are considered sustainable and at low risk of collapse. (3) The European Union , as well as Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Romania and Slovenia are Contracting Parties to the GFCM. [Amendment 6] (4) Recommendations adopted by GFCM are binding on its Contracting Parties. As the Union is a contracting party to the GFCM, these recommendations are binding on the Union and should therefore be transposed into Union law, where their content is not already covered thereby . [Amendment 7] (5) At its Annual Sessions in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, the GFCM adopted a number of recom\u00ad mendations and resolutions for certain fisheries in the GFCM Agreement area which have been temporarily transposed into Union law by the annual regulations on fishing opportunities ( 4 ) or, in the case of GFCM recommendations 2005/1 and 2005/2, by Articles 4(3) and 24 of Council Regu\u00ad lation (EC) No 1967/2006 of 21 December 2006 concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea ( 5 ).

        "(6) For reasons of clarity, simplification and legal certainty, and since the permanent character of recom\u00ad mendations requires also a permanent legal instrument for their transposition into Union law, it is appropriate to transpose these recommendations via a single legislative act, to which future recom\u00ad mendations can be added by way of amendments. [Amendment 9] (7) GFCM recommendations apply to the entire GFCM Agreement area, notably the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and connecting waters, as referred to in Annex II to Decision 98/416/EC, and, therefore, in order to ensure the clarity of Union legislation, they should be transposed in a single separate regulation rather than through amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006, which only covers the Mediterranean Sea. [Amendment 10] (8) Certain provisions contained in Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 should apply not only in the Medi\u00ad terranean Sea but in the entire GFCM Agreement area. Those provisions should therefore be deleted from Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 and included in this Regulation. (9) The \u2018Fisheries Restricted Areas\u2019 established by GFCM recommendations for spatial management measures are equivalent in effect to the \u2018Fishing Protected Areas\u2019 as used in Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006. (10) At its Annual Session of 23-27 March 2009 the GFCM adopted a recommendation on the estab\u00ad lishment of a fisheries restricted area in the Gulf of Lions on the basis of scientific advice by Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), as contained in the report of its 11th session (FAO report n o 890). It is appropriate to implement this measure by means of an effort management system. (11) The selectivity of some fishing gears cannot go beyond a certain level in Mediterranean mixed fisheries and, in addition to the control and limitation of fishing effort, it is fundamental to limit fishing effort in areas where adults of important stocks aggregate in order to have a low risk of reproduction impairment, thus allowing for their sustainable exploitation. It is therefore advisable to first limit the fishing effort in the area examined by the SAC to previous levels and not to allow any increase of that level. (12) The advice on which management measures are based should be based on the scientific use of relevant data on fleet capacity and activity, on the biological status of exploited resources and on the social and economic situation of fisheries; these data need to be collected and submitted in time to allow the subsidiary bodies of GFCM to prepare their advice. (13) At its Annual Session in 2008 the GFCM adopted a recommendation on a regional scheme of Port State measures to combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the GFCM Agreement area. While Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing ( 1 ) covers generally the content of this recommendation and applies from 1 January 2010, there are, nevertheless, some aspects such as the frequency, coverage and procedure for port inspections which need to be referred to in this Regulation in order to adapt the measure to the specificities of the GFCM Agreement area. [Amendment 11] (14) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation , implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers, which should be without prejudice to the provisions of this Regulation relating to delegated acts and which should not apply to provisions of this Regulation on Port state measures and Port state inspection procedures, should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers ( 2 ) \u2590 .

        "ANNEX II Port state inspection procedures for vessels (1) Vessel identification The port inspector(s) shall: a) verify that the official documentation onboard is valid, if necessary, through appropriate contacts with the flag State or international records of vessels; b) where necessary, arrange for an official translation of the documentation; c) be assured that the vessel\u2019s name, flag, any external identification number and markings (and International Maritime Organization (IMO) ship identification number when available) and the international radio call sign are correct; d) to the extent possible, examine whether the vessel has changed name and/or flag and, if so, note the previous name(s) and flag(s); e) note the port of registration, name and address of the owner (and operator and beneficial owner if different from the owner), agent, and master of the vessel, including the unique ID for company and registered owner if available; and f) note name(s) and address(es) of previous owner(s), if any, during the past five years. (2) Authorisation(s) The port inspector(s) shall verify that the authorisation(s) to fish or transport fish and fishery products are compatible with the information obtained under paragraph 1 and examine the duration of the authorisation(s) and their application to areas, species and fishing gear. (3) Other documentation The port inspector(s) shall review all relevant documentation, including documents in electronic format. Relevant docu\u00ad mentation may include logbooks, in particular the fishing logbook, as well as the crew list, stowage plans and drawings or descriptions of fish holds if available. Such holds or areas may be inspected in order to verify whether their size and composition correspond to these drawings or descriptions and whether the stowage is in accordance with the stowage plans. Where appropriate, this documentation shall also include catch documents or trade documents issued by any regional fisheries management organisation. (4) Fishing gear a) The port inspector(s) shall verify that the fishing gear on board is in conformity with the conditions of the auth\u00ad orisation(s). The gear may also be checked to ensure that features such as, inter alia, the mesh size(s) (and possible devices), length of nets, hook sizes conform with applicable regulations and that identification marks of the gear correspond to those authorised for the vessel. b) The port inspector(s) may also search the vessel for any fishing gear stowed out of sight and for fishing gear that is otherwise illegal. (5) Fish and fishery products (a) The port inspector(s) shall, to the greatest extent possible, examine whether the fish and fishery products on board were harvested in accordance with the conditions set out in the applicable authorisation(s). In doing so, the port inspector(s) shall examine the fishing logbook, reports submitted, including those transmitted by a vessel monitoring system (VMS), as appropriate. (b) In order to determine the quantities and species on board, the port inspector(s) may examine the fish in the hold or during the landing. In doing so, the port inspector(s) may open cartons where the fish has been pre-packed and move the fish or cartons to ascertain the integrity of fish holds. EN C 199 E/212 Official Journal of the European Union 7.7.2012 Tuesday 8 March 2011 ",
        "(c) If the vessel is unloading, the port inspector(s) may verify the species and quantities landed. Such verification may include product type, live weight (quantities determined from the logbook) and the conversion factor used for calculating processed weight to live weight. The port inspector(s) may also examine any possible quantities retained onboard. (d) The port inspector(s) may review the quantity and composition of all catch onboard, including by sampling. (6) Verification of IUU fishing Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 applies. (7) Report A written report shall be prepared and signed by the inspector on completion of the inspection and a copy provided to the master of the vessel. (8) Results of Port State Inspections Results of port State inspections shall include at least the following information: 1. Inspection references \u2014 Inspecting authority (name of inspecting authority or the alternate body nominated by the authority); \u2014 Name of inspector; \u2014 Date and time of inspection; \u2014 Port of inspection (place where the vessel is inspected); and \u2014 Date (date the report is completed). 2.
