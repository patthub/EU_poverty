        "II (Non-legislative acts) REGULATIONS COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 377/2012 of 3 May 2012 concerning restrictive measures directed against certain persons, entities and bodies threatening the peace, security or stability of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 215(2) thereof, Having regard to Council Decision 2012/237/CFSP of 3 May 2012 concerning restrictive measures directed against certain persons, entities and bodies threatening the peace, security or stability of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau ( 1 ), Having regard to the joint proposal of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and of the European Commission, Whereas: (1) Decision 2012/237/CFSP provides for the adoption of restrictive measures against certain persons, entities and bodies who seek to prevent or block a peaceful political process, or who take action that undermines stability in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. This concerns in particular those who played a leading role in the mutiny of 1 April 2010 and the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 12 April 2012 and whose actions continue to be aimed at undermining the rule of law and the primacy of civilian power. These measures include the freezing of funds and economic resources of the natural or legal persons, entities and bodies listed in the Annex to that Decision. (2) These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, therefore, in particular with a view to ensuring their uniform appli\u00ad cation by economic operators in all Member States, regu\u00ad latory action at the level of the Union is necessary in order to implement them. (3) This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and notably the right to an effective remedy, the right to a fair trial and the right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation should be applied in accordance with those rights and principles. (4) The power to amend the list in Annex I to this Regu\u00ad lation should be exercised by the Council, in view of the specific threat to international peace and security posed by the situation in Guinea-Bissau and in order to ensure consistency with the procedure for amending and reviewing the Annex to Decision 2012/237/CFSP. (5) The procedure for amending the list in Annex I to this Regulation should include providing designated natural or legal persons, entities or bodies with the grounds for the listing so as to give them an opportunity to submit observations. Where observations are submitted, or substantial new evidence is presented, the Council should review its decision in the light of those obser\u00ad vations and inform the person, entity or body concerned accordingly. (6) For the implementation of this Regulation, and in order to create maximum legal certainty within the Union, the names and other relevant data concerning natural and legal persons, entities and bodies whose funds and economic resources are to be frozen in accordance with this Regulation should be made public. Any processing of personal data should respect Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data ( 2 ) and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of indi\u00ad viduals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 3 ).

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 also provides that appli\u00ad cations for authorisations of health claims may be submitted by food business operators to the national competent authority of a Member State. The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as ' the Authority ' . (3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission thereof, and to deliver an opinion on the health claim concerned. (4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority. (5) Following an application from SVUS Pharma a.s, submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of ProteQuine\u00ae, a mixture of free amino acids, oligopeptides and nucleotides on increase of suppressed concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A (ScIgA) and reduction of the risk of influenza and common cold (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-397) ( 2 ). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \" Prote\u00ad Quine\u00ae elevates/maintains the level of ScIgA on mucous membranes. Decreased or insufficient level of ScIgA is a risk factor in the development of common cold or influenza \" . (6) On the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded in its opinion received by the Commission and the Member States on 13 April 2011 that a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of ProteQuine\u00ae and increasing suppressed concentrations of ScIgA and reducing the risk of common cold and influenza. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be auth\u00ad orised. (7) Following an application from SVUS Pharma a.s, submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of ProteQuine\u00ae, a mixture of free amino acids, oligopeptides and nucleotides, and bovine lactoferrin on increase of suppressed concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A (ScIgA) and reduction of the risk of common cold with sore throat (Question No EFSA-Q- 2008-398) ( 3 ). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \" ProteQuine\u00ae in combination with bovine lactoferrin elevates/maintains the level of ScIgA on mucous membranes. Decreased or insufficient level of ScIgA is a risk factor in the development of common cold with sore throat and combination of ProteQuine\u00ae with bovine lactoferrin reduces the risk of the development of sore throat \" . (8) On the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded in its opinion received by the Commission and the Member States on 13 April 2011 that a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of ProteQuine\u00ae and bovine lactoferrin and increasing suppressed concentrations of ScIgA and reduction of the risk of common cold with sore throat. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised. (9) Following an application from CSL - Centro Sperimentale del Latte S.p.A., submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of a combination of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain AY/CSL (LMG P-17224) and Streptococcus thermophilus strain 9Y/CSL (LMG P-17225) on beneficial modulation of intestinal microflora (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-273) ( 4 ).

        "(10) On the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded in its opinion received by the Commission and the Member States on 20 July 2011 that a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of the combination of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain AY/CSL (LMG P-17224) and S. thermophilus strain 9Y/CSL (LMG P-17225) and a beneficial physiological effect related to the claimed effect. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised. (11) Following an application from the European Dietetic Food Industry Association (IDACE), submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of beta-palmitate on increased calcium absorption (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-172) ( 1 ). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded, inter alia , as follows: \" Beta palmitate enrichment contributes to increase calcium absorption \" . (12) On the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded in its opinion received by the Commission and the Member States on 28 July 2011 that the evidence provided was insufficient to establish a cause and effect relationship between the consumption of beta-palmitate and the claimed effect. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be auth\u00ad orised. (13) In accordance with Article 28(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, health claims referred to in its Article 14(1)(b) and not authorised by a decision pursuant to Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 may continue to be used for six months after the adoption of this Regulation, provided an application was made before 19 January 2008. Accordingly, the transition period laid down in that Article is applicable to the health claim relevant to beta-palmitate listed in the Annex of this Regulation. (14) As the health claim application relevant to Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain AY/CSL (LMG P-17224) and Streptococcus thermophilus strain 9Y/CSL (LMG P-17225) was not made before 19 January 2008, the requirement provided for in Article 28(6)(b) is not fulfilled, and the transition period laid down in that Article is not applicable. (15) However, in order to ensure that this Regulation is fully complied with, both food business operators and the national competent authorities should take the necessary actions to ensure that, at the latest six months following the entry into force of this Regulation, the health claims listed in its Annex that have been submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 are no longer used.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 also provides that appli\u00ad cations for authorisations of health claims may be submitted by food business operators to the national competent authority of a Member State. The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Authority\u2019. (3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission thereof and to deliver an opinion on the health claim concerned. (4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority. (5) Following an application from Valio Ltd, submitted pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of Lacto\u00ad bacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on maintenance of defence against pathogenic gastrointestinal micro-organisms (Question No EFSA-Q-2010-01028) ( 2 ). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018 Lac\u00ad tobacillus GG helps to maintain defence against intestinal pathogens\u2019. (6) On 1 June 2010, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and the claimed effect. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised. (7) Following an application from Gelita AG, submitted pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of collagen hydrolysate on maintenance of joints (Question No EFSA-Q-2011-00201) ( 3 ). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: \u2018Char\u00ad acteristic collagen peptide mixture (collagen hydrolysate) having a beneficial physiological effect on the main\u00ad tenance of joint health in physically active people\u2019. (8) On 20 July 2011, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of collagen hydrolysate and the claimed effect. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised. (9) The health claims subject to this Regulation are health claims as referred to in point (a) of Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and may benefit from the transitional period laid down in Article 28(5) of that Regulation. As the Authority concluded that cause and effect relationships have not been established between the foods and the claimed effects, the claims do not comply with Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and therefore they may not benefit from the transitional period provided for in that Article.

        "COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 380/2012 of 3 May 2012 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the conditions of use and the use levels for aluminium-containing food additives (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives ( 1 ), and in particular Article 10(3) thereof, Whereas: (1) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use. (2) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in its opinion of 22 May 2008 ( 2 ) recommended to lower the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for aluminium to 1 mg/kg body weight/week. In addition, EFSA considers that the revised TWI is generally exceeded for high consumers, especially children, in a significant part of the Union. (3) EFSA considers that the major route of exposure to aluminium compounds for the general population is through food, both as a consequence of the natural occurrence of aluminium in food and the use of aluminium compounds in food processing, including food additives. However, EFSA is not able to quantify the respective role of each source due to the design of the human dietary studies and the analytical methods used, which only determine the total aluminium content in food. (4) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 authorises the use of aluminium-containing food additives in a wide number of foodstuffs, often at very high maximum permitted levels or without any indication of the maximum concentration levels ( Quantum satis ). (5) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) authorise the use of some colours that may contain aluminium in the form of lakes in a wide number of foodstuffs, in general without any indication of the maximum concen\u00ad tration levels of aluminium in the lakes. (6) It is therefore appropriate to amend the current conditions of use and reduce the use levels for aluminium-containing food additives, including alumi- nium lakes, to ensure that the revised TWI is not exceeded. (7) Since manufacturing practices using higher amounts of food additives have been applied since decades, a transi\u00ad tional period should be provided to allow the food business operators to adapt to the new requirements laid down in this Regulation for the uses of aluminium-containing food additives others than lakes. (8) Labelling of aluminium content in aluminium lakes not intended for sale to the final consumer is currently optional. It should become mandatory within 12 months from the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow food manufacturers using aluminium lakes to adapt to the proposed maximum limits for such lakes. Therefore a longer transitional period than 12 months should be provided to allow the food business operators to adapt to the new requirements laid down in this Regulation. (9) Annex II as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 ( 4 ) is in principle applicable from 1 June 2013. In order to facilitate the effective implementation of Annex II, it is appropriate to insert in the Annex the periods of application that do not start on 1 June 2013 and are posterior to the entry into force of this Regu\u00ad lation. (10) The aluminium containing carrier bentonite, E 558 is not used any more according to information submitted by food manufacturers. Therefore, it is not included in Part 1 of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and should also be deleted from the list of all additives in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. (11) The aluminium containing food additives calcium aluminium silicate E 556 and aluminium silicate (kaolin) E 559 should be deleted from the list of all additives in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, since these substances can be replaced by other food additives.

(2) The Europe 2020 Strategy proposed by the Commission enables the Union to turn its economy towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, accompanied by high level employment, productivity and social cohesion. On 13 July 2010, the Council adopted its Recommendation on broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union ( 3 ). Furthermore, on 21 October 2010, the Council adopted its Decision 2010/707/EU on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States ( 4 ) (the \u2018employment guide\u00ad lines\u2019). Those sets of guidelines form the integrated guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 Strategy. Five headline targets, listed under the relevant integrated guidelines, constitute shared objectives which guide the action of the Member States, taking into account their relative starting positions and national circumstances as well as the positions and circumstances of the Union. The European Employment Strategy plays the leading role in the implementation of the employment and labour market objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy. In 2011, the employment guidelines were maintained. (3) The integrated guidelines are in line with the conclusions of the European Council of 17 June 2010. They give precise guidance to the Member States on defining their national reform programmes and on implementing reforms, reflecting interdependence and being in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. The employment guidelines should form the basis for any country- specific recommendations that the Council may address to the Member States under Article 148(4) of the TFEU, in parallel with the country-specific recommendations addressed to the Member States under Article 121(2) of the TFEU. The employment guidelines should also form the basis for the establishment of the Joint Employment Report sent annually by the Council and the Commission to the European Council. (4) The examination of the Member States\u2019 draft national reform programmes, contained in the Joint Employment Report adopted by the Council on 17 February 2012, shows that Member States should continue to make every effort to address the following priorities: increasing labour market participation and reducing structural unemployment; developing a skilled workforce responding to labour market needs and promoting job quality and lifelong learning; improving the performance of education and training systems at all levels and increasing participation in tertiary education; promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. (5) The employment guidelines adopted in 2010 should remain stable until 2014 to ensure a focus on their implementation. In the intermediate years, until the end of 2014, their updating should remain strictly limited. (6) Member States should explore the use of the European Social Fund when implementing the employment guide\u00ad lines, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 The guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, as set out in the Annex to Decision 2010/707/EU, are hereby maintained for 2012 and shall be taken into account by the Member States in their employment policies.

(2) Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the keeping of accounts by the paying agencies, declarations of expenditure and revenue and the conditions for reimbursing expenditure under the EAGF and the EAFRD ( 2 ), account is taken for the 2011 financial year of expenditure incurred by the Member States between 16 October 2010 and 15 October 2011. (3) The first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regu\u00ad lation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD ( 3 ) lays down that the amounts that are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(1) of the said Regulation, shall be determined by deducting the monthly payments in respect of the financial year in question, i.e. 2011, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with paragraph 1. The Commission shall deduct that amount from or add it to the monthly payment relating to the expen\u00ad diture effected in the second month following that in which the accounts clearance decision is taken. (4) The Commission has checked the information submitted by the Member States and it has communicated to the Member States before 31 March 2012 the results of its verifications, along with the necessary amendments. (5) The annual accounts and the accompanying documents permit the Commission to take, for certain paying agencies, a decision on the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the annual accounts submitted. Annex I lists the amounts cleared by Member State and the amounts to be recovered from or paid to the Member States. (6) The information submitted by certain other paying agencies requires additional inquiries and their accounts cannot be cleared in this Decision. Annex II lists the paying agencies concerned. (7) Under Article 9(4) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006, any overrun of deadlines during August, September and October is to be taken into account in the clearance of accounts decision. Some of the expenditure declared by certain Member States during these months in the year 2011 was effected after the applicable deadlines. This Decision should therefore fix the relevant reductions. (8) The Commission, in accordance with Article 17 of Regu\u00ad lation (EC) No 1290/2005 and Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006, has already reduced or suspended a number of monthly payments on entry into the accounts of expenditure for the 2011 financial year. In order to avoid any premature, or temporary, reimbursement of the amounts in question, they should not be recognised in this Decision and they should be further examined under the conformity clearance procedure pursuant to Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. (9) Pursuant to Article 32(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, 50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities shall be borne by the Member State concerned if the recovery of those irregu\u00ad larities has not taken place within four years of the primary administrative or judicial finding, or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts.

On the basis of the tables completed by the Member States, the Commission should decide on the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregu\u00ad larities older than four or eight years respectively. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. (10) Pursuant to Article 32(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. Such a decision may only be taken if the costs already and likely to be incurred total more than the amount to be recovered or if the recovery proves impossible owing to the insolvency, recorded and recognised under national law, of the debtor or the persons legally responsible for the irregularity. If that decision has been taken within four years of the primary administrative or judicial finding or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts, 100 % of the financial consequences of the non-recovery should be borne by the EU budget.
