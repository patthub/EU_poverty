EU approach to evaluation of RD programmes In recent years the evaluation of EU co- founded programmes was assigned particular importance. After the administrative reform of the European Community (Agenda 2000) a periodic evaluation has been extended to all EU policies (Toulemonde et. al., 2002) and recognized as a crucial component of policy development. At the same time evaluation practice became an integral part of EU programming at all levels, e.g. EU, national, and territorial, etc. (Vanhove, 1999; Ederveen, 2003; EC, 1999, 2001, 2002a, 2002b). According to EU definition, programme evaluation is a process that culminates in a judgment (or assessment) of policy interventions according to their results, impacts and the needs they aim to satisfy 1 . In case of structural and rural development (RD) programmes EU regulations distinguish between ex-ante, mid-term, ex-post and on-going evaluations. Ex-ante evaluations aim at the optimisation of the allocation of the budgetary resources\u2019 and the improvement of the quality of programming by answering the question: what impacts can be expected from a newly designed policy intervention?, the main purpose of mid-term and ex-post evaluations of EU programmes is to examine the effects (i.e. results/impacts) of a given programme and to learn about: \u2022 The programme\u2019s effectiveness, i.e. the degree to which a program produced the desired outcome (the assessment of a programme\u2019s effectiveness implies a pre- definition of operationally defined objectives and their achievement criteria ), and 1 See: Evaluating EU activities \u2013 A practical guide for the Commission Services, DG Budget, July 2004. \u2022 The programme\u2019s efficiency, i.e. the degree to which overall program benefits relate to its costs. Evaluation literature defines impacts as direct/indirect and intended/unintended effects (economic, social, environmental and others) of a given policy intervention (e.g. development project, programme, policy measure, policy) occurred at various levels , i.e. individual, collective or societal and/or local, regional, country, global, etc (i.e. at all possible levels of a \u201cresult chain\u201d). 2 In contrast, EU evaluation methodology strictly differentiates between programme outputs (physical units), programme results (effects occurred at a micro- level) and programme impacts , whereby the last are defined as: medium/long-term effects of intervention beyond the immediate effects on direct beneficiaries of the programme that can be observed at local community, regional- or macro- economic, country (programme area) or global levels 3,4 . Following the EU definition, impacts are summative programme outcomes consisting of: a) direct effects on programme beneficiaries (including deadweight loss and leverage effects), and b) indirect programme effects (e.g. substitution, displacement, multiplier, etc.) that occurred at regional, programme area or national levels. From a policy point of view, impact assessment of a given policy intervention is important as: 2 While analysis of impacts usually distinguishes direct, indirect and induced impacts, definition of impacts differs according to EU terminology vs. World Bank, general evaluation or NONIE terminologies. 3 Rural Development 2007-2013. Handbook on common monitoring and evaluation framework, Guidelines note N. Glossary of terms, EC, 2006 4 In contrast, World Bank, NONIE and other general evaluation guidelines define \u201dimpact\u201d broader, by including also direct effects of a given policy intervention at beneficiary level.

It also provides information about the sustainability of effects of a given policy intervention. \u2022 A comparison of a policy intervention\u2019s results with target values provides information on the effectiveness of a given policy intervention and on the achievability of more general societal goals (e.g. concerning growth or development) using this specific policy instrument. \u2022 It helps to re-design a policy intervention (programme) to make it more effective and efficient (by taking into consideration costs of intervention). \u2022 It provides arguments for continuation or discontinuation of policies/programmes by comparing social benefits with costs of specific policy interventions. \u2022 It helps to learn about the functioning of economic, social and environmental processes. \u2022 It improves institutional capacities of organisations involved in impact evaluations. \u2022 It improves decision making at all levels. \u2022 It provides some information regarding accountability of institutions involved in the formulation and implementation of policies. As the evidence for impacts is usually provided on the basis of impact indicators, any appropriate impact assessment should reveal the extent to which observed changes in pre-selected impact indicators (computed at the regional- or macro-levels) came about due to programme activities. Keeping this in mind, the key challenges of an effective impact assessment of RD programmes carried out at the regional or macro-levels are: Firstly , determining true causation 5 , i.e. verifying that an observed change (at micro- or regional levels) of a certain phenomenon (impact indicator) that might be theoretically (!) associated with a given policy (whole or in part) can indeed be attributed (as a whole or partly) to (or is caused by) this policy intervention. In order to verify the above supposition, effects of other intervening factors, (i.e. exogenously determined) which may also influence an observable phenomenon (impact indicator) have to be separated (\u201cnetted out\u201d) from the effects of this given policy intervention 6. Such a separation of programme effects from other factors requires a construction of an appropriate counterfactual base-line scenario (a situation without the programme in place). Secondly , aggregation of various effects of a programme. A summative evaluation of an RD programme\u2019s impact should ideally embrace all important programme effects in economic, social, environmental, etc., RD domains and not focus on some programme outcomes only, in form of selected impact indicators (e.g. value added, employment, etc). This can be done by: a) carefully stating the hypothesized effects; b) identifying various possible intended and unintended; direct and indirect; or positive and negative effects that might be caused by a RD programme; c) defining respective measurement criteria; d) defining appropriate time periods to be analysed; and e) systematically monitoring programme implementation. Furthermore, the aggregation of overall programme effects can only be carried out once a consistent weighting system (for individual 5 Causation cannot be proved through a simple correlation analysis. 6 In some evaluations of policy intervention, \u201cimpacts\u201d are \u201cidentified\u201d as a degree to which certain policy/societal goals (usually pre-defined prior to a policy intervention) have been achieved, after policy intervention. This approach is however not defendable. In fact, certain policy/ general societal goals can be achieved without a specific policy intervention via other (policy independent) factors. In this example, an objective of an impact analysis would be inter alia a verification of causality between a degree to which policy goals were achieved (and measured by specific impact indicators) and a given policy intervention ",

Thirdly , a comprehensive quantitative programme impact evaluation should involve a cost-benefit analysis (including an assessment of the programme\u2019s private and social costs and benefits) to be carried out via aggregation and weighting of all partial benefits and costs linked to a given programme. In order to facilitate evaluations of RD programmes (and ensure a standardized evaluation approach) a common evaluation framework to EU RD programmes was developed by EC (DG-AGRI) 7 . The core element of the EC evaluation framework are Common Evaluation Questions (CEQ) (pre-defined by EC) and programme specific questions (defined by national programme authorities), both to be answered by external programme evaluators. Answering the EC common evaluation questions (CEQ) requires using the concept of \u201cintervention logic,\u201d pre-defined by EC, i.e. differentiating between programme inputs, outputs, results, and impacts (by moving from a micro-level to regional- or country levels). Among dozens of various evaluation questions included in the evaluation guidelines for EU RD programmes implemented in the years 2000-2006 important CEQs concerned an overall effect of implemented policies (e.g. impact on the quality of life) 8 . While impacts of RD programmes at a regional/macro level can occur at various RD 7 European Commission Agriculture Directorate-General, \u201cGuidelines for the Mid-Term Evaluations of Rural Development Programmes 2000-2006 Supported from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund,\u201d 2002; European Commission DG AGRI, \u201cGuidelines for the mid-term evaluation of rural development programmes funded by SAPARD 2000-2006,\u201d 2002.; EC, \u201cRural Development 2007-2013.

The answer to this and other CEQ are to be provided in quantitative terms. domains (economic, social or environmental) programme evaluators were asked to: \u2022 derive their findings using various partial indicators describing the potential programme\u2019s impact at various RD domains (e.g. economic, environment, etc.) and, \u2022 assess programme net effects by comparing these indicators with respective common indicators/performance standards. The above guidelines have been followed in all evaluation studies of RD programmes implemented during 2000-2006. Yet, many empirical impact evaluations, due to their methodological weaknesses, appeared to be insufficiently rigorous and stringent to serve as a guide to policies. Clearly, application of inadequate methodologies (e.g. naive methods or absence of control group assessments) for evaluations of programme impacts may lead a number of negative consequences: \u2022 Obtained evaluation results may be heavily biased in both directions (negative or positive). In an extreme situation, results obtained from programme evaluations may substantially differ from real programme impacts (a qualitative difference!). \u2022 Lack of appropriate knowledge about the real impacts of the programme may encourage implementation programmes which, due to their low effectiveness/efficiency, should be discontinued or substantially re-designed. \u2022 Indirect effects of a programme in question may have a decisive impact on the sign of calculated programme net effects.

Lack of knowledge about real programme impacts may reinforce those negative developments. \u2022 Insufficient learning about the real programme effects may call into question the credibility of EU evaluations and the institutions involved (conclusions of evaluation reports can be used selectively to support the interest of particular groups or can be contested where the evaluation does not conclude in their favour).

The main methodological problems in evaluation studies carried out at macro- and/or regional levels Numerous ex-post evaluation studies carried out at the regional and macro-levels confirm the existence of huge methodological difficulties faced by evaluators of RD programmes when attempting to: i) Provide an empirical evidence of a true cause-and-effect link between the change in selected impact indicators and the RD programme; ii) Disentangle for each separate impact indicator (economic, social or environmental) the effect of the RD programme from other exogenously determined factors; iii) Aggregate and measure the overall effect of an RD programme; and iv) Perform cost-benefit analysis of the programme. The major causes of the above difficulties are: \u2022 Extensive use of traditional evaluation techniques . Typically, the changes in selected impact indicators (collected at a regional- or macro-level) observed by programme evaluators depend on a number of other (i.e. programme independent) factors (e.g. economy-wide factors, community and household characteristics, social and physical infrastructure activities carried out and supported by other programmes). In this context, calculation of the net effect of a given RD programme, i.e. disentangling the effect of a program support from other exogenously determined factors at the regional/macro level definitely cannot be carried out using traditional \u201cna\u00efve\u201d evaluation techniques (e.g. after- before methods). As programme effects cannot be directly observed (see: Chapter 3.1 below) the calculation of a programme impact at a regional- or macro-level requires the application of rigid modern evaluation methodologies and an obligatory construction of appropriate counterfactuals (i.e. base-line scenario) (an area which until recently was almost completely ignored by evaluators of RD programmes). \u2022 Aggregation problems and unclear interpretation in case of opposite or dissimilar effects . In the majority of cases, effects of a given RD programme in a rural region are multidimensional, i.e. even a single programme measure (e.g. investment in agricultural holdings) can simultaneously affect various RD domains, e.g. production, income, investment, employment, competitiveness, environment, technical and social infrastructure, etc. Additionally, many RD programme measures can have both intended (usually expected by policy makers) and unintended effects . For example, investments in rural infrastructure or in processing facilities, along with some positive effects (e.g. increase of labour productivity), may bring about negative environmental impacts, including potential loss of land supporting biodiversity, protected habitats and/or species, deterioration of soil, water environment and air quality, etc. Similarly, support of local food processors may lead to negative effects in the form of strengthening local monopolies (e.g. large processors), causing breakdown of other local food processing businesses, and therefore a decrease of employment and income in non-supported local enterprises, an increase of out-migration, etc.; some investments in irrigation may cause depletion of water ",
        "11 C o u n t e r f a c t u a l i m p a c t e v a l u a t i o n o f E U r u r a l d e v e l o p m e n t p r o g r a m m e s - P r o p e n s i t y S c o r e M a t c h i n g m e t h o d o l o g y . . . resources in other areas, etc.; support provided to certain type of agricultural producers may have negative effects on on- supported population, etc. In all these cases an assessment of an overall impact using pre-selected common impact indicators may be (even for a single RD measure!) rather unmanageable as various effects (positive and negative, expressed in the form of partial indicators) can only with difficulty be compared and/or aggregated (social weights of individual effects in various RD domains e.g. economic, social and environmental are usually unknown). In this context, the partial impact indicators (7 common and 15 additional impact indicators) proposed in the new EC evaluation guidelines for the assessment of an overall net-impact of a RD programme seems to be problematic. \u2022 Use of average performance standards . If programme impacts are the main objects of policy concern, reliance on average (regional or country\u2019s) performance indicators/ standards as proxy for the functioning of a programme control group can be very problematic. Numerous studies showed that a country\u2019s average common performance measures (e.g. average employment rates, growth of income etc.) may not adequately represent a counterfactual situation (i.e. a situation without the programme in place). The evaluation literature suggests that performance standards cannot substitute an econometric impact evaluation based on a comparable control group. \u2022 Ineffective monitoring system . The use of various indicators targeting potential effects of specific measures is in practice not possible without having an effective monitoring system (which has to be set up prior to the programme). Yet, the learning about the overall programme effects depends upon which (of the possible many) partial indicators are pre-selected and included into the monitoring system. By not including certain indicators, many important impacts (positive/ negative) can be overseen. In order to avoid such situation, a right and timely pre-selection of various partial monitoring indicators and institutional capacity building of monitoring institutions are of crucial importance. \u2022 Increasing complexity of RD policies , both in terms of the number of programmes as well as number of applied measures, obviously calls for a multi-dimensionality of evaluation exercise. Given this complexity, estimation of an overall effect of all programme measures (e.g. the effect of the programme support on the quality of life of the beneficiary population) that may simultaneously influence economic, social and environmental domains of rural development requires combination of rigid evaluation methodologies with techniques allowing for a consistent aggregation of impacts by all measures. Obviously, the key issue in evaluation of programme impacts (as well as results) is a construction of an appropriate counterfactual. Taking this as a basic criterion, methods used in programme impact evaluations can be divided in four groups (Baker, World Bank 2000; Kapoor, World Bank 2002): 1. Approaches with no counterfactual (e.g. qualitative studies that assess effects of the programme before, during, and after policies are implemented through focus groups, interviews, and other qualitative techniques; \u201cBefore and After,\u201d methods which compare the performance of key variables during and after a program with those prior to the programme.) 2. Approaches that generate counterfactuals through multiple assumptions (e.g. Computable general equilibrium models (CGEs), regional econometric models, or regional input-output models that attempt to contrast outcomes in treatment and ",

While all of these approaches have numerous weaknesses CGE models can produce outcomes for the counterfactual. 3. \u201cNaive\u201d approaches which compare the observed changes in selected performance indicators in a sample of programme areas with arbitrary selected comparison groups. 4. Statistical/econometric methods that control for the differences in initial conditions and policies (both at micro- as well as macro/ regional levels). Unfortunately, in the majority of studies concerned with the quantitative assessment of socio-economic impacts of RD programmes in EU countries (programming period 2000- 2006) \u201cna\u00efve\u201d approaches were employed as a basic evaluation methodology. While in some evaluation studies the authors attempted to build on counterfactuals, in most cases comparisons between supported and non-supported units or areas were done without any consideration for appropriate matching. Usually, comparison groups were selected arbitrarily, leading to quantitative results that were statistically biased (i.e. selection bias). In the majority of qualitative evaluations, knowledge about a specific programme\u2019s indirect effects (e.g. substitution, displacement, multiplier, etc.) was \u201cimputed\u201d on the basis of anecdotal evidence or ad hoc surveys of a group of beneficiaries, opinions of administrative officials, etc. 9 Furthermore, in approximately 75% of Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) studies submitted to European Commission by the end of 2010 the impacts of EU RD programmes were assessed without any reference to a counterfactual situation (see: EC, European Commission, 2011). 9 .See CEAS, 2003. These techniques, in a combination with the most popular \u201cna\u00efve\u201d approach to answering CEQ questions (e.g. the before and after approach) appear as particularly problematic. Taking into consideration that in the programming period of 2007-2013 in each individual EU rural region: \u2022 The number of potentially applicable RD measures under an RD programme can be very large (currently up to 42 RD measures can be applied); \u2022 Specific RD measures implemented under specific RD programme will probably affect a wide range of various rural development domains (e.g. economic, environmental, social, etc.); and \u2022 Only seven common partial impact indicators have been proposed to be used for the analysis of impacts of RD programmes (e.g. no common environmental impact indicators are proposed to be used in evaluations of RD measures under Axis 1 and Axis 3; no common economic impact indicators are proposed to be used in evaluations of RD measures under Axis 2); it is understandable that the assessment of an overall impact of an RD programme at regional or macro-levels requires an application of a more comprehensive and rigid methodological approaches.

Advanced empirical approaches Concerning the use of methodological approaches for impact-analyses of RD/structural programmes that enable construction of counterfactuals , the practical possibilities are as follows: 1. The first possibility is to integrate a micro- economic approach (e.g. micro economic individual behaviour or household models) into various local or regional models (e.g. Input-output, Social Accounting Matrix or CGE) and assess the impact of a programme on the base of these combined models (e.g. micro-simulation models with local/regional CGE, village CGE, etc.). The main advantage from the use of these models is a theoretical possibility to estimate both anticipated as well as non-anticipated effects; direct effects (at the beneficiary level) and indirect effects (generated from supply of materials, goods and services attributable to other linked and not directly benefiting units and/or industries located in the same area as well as induced effects (i.e. multiplier effects) of a given programme generated through direct and indirect activities (including consumption, taxes, etc.) of a given policy in question (above models are subject to consistency checks through micro-macro consistency equations). The main disadvantages of these models are: i) input-output models assume that technological/ economic relationships are fixed over time and do not respond to price/cost changes; ii) while input-output tables are normally available at relatively high aggregation levels their rescaling to a local level requires a usage of various (often non-transparent) procedures which can be divided in three main categories: \u201csurvey\u201d, \u201cnon-survey\u201d and \u201chybrid\u201d approaches, e.g. location quotient approach (Del Corpo, et. Al, 2008); iii) commonly applied CGE models usually do not show a detailed enough level of sector disaggregation (a major problem in evaluating RD policies) and are usually static (by contrast, multi-sector and regional dynamic CGE models are much more complex and time consuming in their construction and are therefore very rarely applied to policy evaluations at regional levels); iv) empirical CGE modelling at regional level often is often impossible due to the lack of relevant statistical data at the local or regional level; v) in CGE modelling a heterogeneity of firm behaviour is largely ignored. Despite these deficiencies, micro-macro models are increasingly applied to policy analysis and include a whole array of respective techniques, starting with the simpler macro models that use representative household groups to link macro economic policies and microeconomic data, to more complex top-down modelling frameworks that combine (top) macro models and (down) micro-simulation models (Bourguignon, et al. 2008). 2. The second possibility is to use standard regional input-output econometric models (e.g. REMI, IMPLAN, RIMS II or EMSI) in regional policy analysis to estimate direct, indirect and induced effects of a given policy. For example, the REMI model, that has been in a continuous development since the 1980s integrates input-output, CGE and economic geography methodologies. It consists of thousands of simultaneous equations and its structure consists of five major interrelated blocks: (1) Output, (2) Labor and Capital Demand, (3) Population and Labor Supply, (4) Wages, Prices, and Costs, and (5) Market Shares. The REMI model was applied in numerous studies of economic development in the US and Europe, e.g. for the evaluation of land use and growth controls, impact of investments in energy sectors, transportation, ",

A d v a n c e d e m p i r i c a l a p p r o a c h e s etc; for the evaluation of regional economic effects of investments in the EU (Treyz F. and G, Treyz, 2002); and recently for an ex-ante evaluation of RDP in Tuscany until 2020 (REMI-IRPET) (Felici, et. al, 2008). The recently extensively used IMPLAN model (the computer software and data-package is available from the Minnesota IMPLAN Group, Inc.) is a computer software package that consists of procedures for estimating local input-output models and associated databases. A Description of the EMSI model is available in: Galloway, H. EMSI\u2019s Input- Output Model Multipliers: A Brief Overview and Comparison with Other Major Models, www.economicmodeling.com. Extensive comparison of multipliers used in the REMI, IMPLANT and RIMS II models is available in: Rickman and Schwer, 1995. Yet, the applicability of these models the context of EU policies evaluation raises several concerns. Firstly, it is not quite clear how a number of US economic parameters used in these models can be applied to the EU reality, given different economic and social context in both economies (including problems with data classification and consistency) (comp. Wilson R. in: OECD, 2004); Secondly, modification of these models to reflect local circumstances is usually a considerable and highly time consuming effort that cannot be undertaken by a few external evaluators alone, but requires a great dose of cooperation with local authorities and local stakeholders; Thirdly, the complexity of use for models like REMI or LEFM undoubtedly requires a certain minimum level of expertise; Fourthly, problems with timeliness of the key data incl. input-output tables raises questions regarding forecasting validity. 3. The third possibility to learn about an effect of the programme at the regional- or macro- level is to use a micro- approach and to aggregate direct and indirect impacts computed at the micro-level by drawing on the principles of controlled experimentation (e.g. quasi-experimental approach). This can be done by measuring an individual response (individuals, households, farms, or areas) in controlled settings. Because the supported groups and the comparison groups may differ in observed and unobserved variables that determine programme outcomes, a simple comparison of outcomes between supported and arbitrary selected non-supported units will not reflect the true effect of the programme. To enable such comparisons various techniques can be applied to find adequate controls (e.g. matching; for details see propensity score techniques below). The next step is to derive some meaningful micro-based policy parameters using available data on units in a given sample, e.g. SATE (sample average treatment effect), SATT (sample average treatment on treated), STNT (sample effect on non-treated) and then (by drawing on probability distributions) estimate aggregated impacts for the population at large, e.g. PATE (population average treatment effect), PATT (population average treatment effect on treated), or ATNT (average treatment effect on non-treated), (see: Imbens and Wooldridge, 2007). In many cases, PATE combined with additional information on general equilibrium effects (including substitution and replacement effects) and programme costs (e.g. administrative costs and social costs) can be helpful in answering the policy question regarding the net programme gain to the region, programme area or economy. 4. The fourth possibility is to use an evaluation technique that is based on the matched comparison of regional units (van de Walle, D., and D. Cratty. 2002; Lokshin and Yemtsov, 2005; Michalek, 2008). Given numerous pros and cons of alternative evaluation methods, it can be particularly advantageous to apply quasi-experimental methods which basically draw on a micro- approach applying it to macro-units (Point 4), i.e. ",

Cratty. 2002; Lokshin and Yemtsov, 2005; Michalek, 2008). In our study we will follow this approach. The sequence of analytical steps is as follows: Firstly, the Rural Development Index (RDI) will be used as the main synthetic impact indicator (Michalek, 2008) - a proxy describing the overall quality of life in individual rural areas. The weights of economic, social and environmental domains entering the RDI are in our study derived empirically from the econometrically estimated intra- and inter- regional migration function after selecting the \u201cbest\u201d model from alternative model specifications (i.e. the panel estimate logistic regression nested error structure model, spatial effect models, etc). Secondly , the impact of RD measures implemented in specific rural regions is analysed by means of selected impact indicators in programme supported regions and control regions, prior to the programme and after it, by applying a combination of the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) (e.g. Kernel matching) and difference-in-differences (DID) methods. Evaluation of programme results at regional levels are performed on the basis of the estimated Average Treatment Effects (ATE), Average Treatment on Treated (ATT) and Average Treatment on Untreated (ATU) effects using the RDI as the main impact indicator. Thirdly , sensitivity analysis (Rosenbaum bounds) is carried out in order to assess a possible influence of unobservables on obtained results. Fourthly, given information on regional intensity of programme exposure (financial input flows) the overall impact of the programme support in a selected country is estimated by means of a dose-response function and some derivative dose-response functions under the framework of a generalized propensity score matching (GPS) (Imbens, 2002; Lechner, 2002; Imai and van Dyk, 2002; Hirano and Imbens, 2004). The proposed methodology permits testing a number of common stipulations, e.g. positive effect of a given programme on various indicators of regional performance, e.g. employment, labour productivity, environmental and social indicators, etc. ",

Applied methodologies for evaluation of programme impacts at a regional/macro level 4.1. Fundamental evaluation problem The main purpose of ex-post evaluation of EU RD programmes is to assess the impact of this policy intervention on regions or programme areas (i ), where the programme was implemented. Similarly as in the case of individuals, the effect of a given EU RD programme on a respective region (or programme area) i can be written as: \u03c4 i = Y i (1) \u2013 Y i (0) (1) Where: \u03c4 i = measures the effect of programme participation on region i, relative to effect of non- participation, on the basis of a response variable Y (impact indicator). Obviously, as \u03c4 i measures the effect of programme participation for a given region i , and i is not a subject to any experimental study, only one of the potential outcomes, i.e. either Y i (1) or Y i (0) can be empirically observed for each individual unit/region i . In another words, the fundamental evaluation problem or \u201cfundamental problem of causal inference\u201d arises from the fact that the main policy interest, i.e. the effect of the policy intervention on regions, programme areas, etc. affected by the programme cannot be directly observed in non-experimental evaluation studies (it is physically impossible to observe the value of the response variable ( Y ) for the same unit/ region i under two mutually exclusive states of nature, i.e. participation in the programme and non-participation (T he Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference (FPCI): Holland, 1986; Rubin 1974; Roy, 1951). While the FPCI makes observing causal effects impossible, this does not mean that causal inference is impossible . In fact, determining unobservable outcome in (eq.1) called counterfactual outcome is both possible and feasible (Rubin, 1974; 1975) . The literature has long recognized that impact evaluation is essentially a problem of missing data (Ravallion, 2005; Goldstein, 2007) and determining the counterfactual is widely considered the core of each evaluation design (!) 10 . 4.2. Policy evaluation indicators 4.2.1. Average Treatment Effects (ATE) The first indicator which can be applied for evaluation of RD programmes is the average treatment effect (ATE ). This indicator is simply the difference between the expected outcomes after participation in the RD programme and the outcomes of non-participation conditional on X (Heckman, 1996; Imbens, 2003; Imbens and Wooldridge, 2007). \u0394 ATE (x) = E ( \u0394 |X = x) (2) 10 Generally speaking, there are two major methods to determine the counterfactuals, i.e. experimental design and quasi-experimental design. In the experimental design that is generally viewed as the most robust evaluation approach (Burtless, 1995) one would have to create a control group of units which are randomly denied access to a programme. In this random assignment a control group would comprise of firms/units/individuals with identical distribution of observable and unobservable characteristics to those in the supported group. In such an experiment the selection problem would be overcome because participation is randomly determined (see: Bryson, et. al, 2002). Yet, there is a vast literature showing that social experiments (except of in sociology, psychology, etc.) are often too expensive and may require the unethical coercion of subjects unwilling to follow the experimental protocol (see: Winship and Morgan, 1999). As experimental designs (randomization) in case of evaluation of RD programmes would be extremely cumbersome (for ethical and political reasons) a non-random method (quasi- experimental) will be used in this study. The basic idea behind quasi-experimental methods is that they generate comparison groups that are akin to the group of programme participants by using techniques described above. ",

ATE is the effect of assigning participation randomly to every region i of type X (assuming full compliance and ignoring general equilibrium effects) and describes an expected gain from participating in the RD programme for a randomly selected region i from the joined sub-groups/ regions that participated and those that did not participate in a given RD programme. This policy indicator averages the effect of the programme over all units in the population, including both programme participants and non-participants. The major disadvantage of these indicators is the fact that ATE includes the effect on regions j for which the programme was never intended/ designed (it may include impact on regions that may even be programme ineligible). 4.2.2. Average Treatment on Treated (ATT) The most common policy indicator used for evaluation of programme effects is the average treatment on the treated effect (ATT), i.e. in our case showing the average impact of a given RD programme on those regions i where the programme was implemented. ATT effect can be described as: \u0394 ATT (x) = E ( \u0394 |X=x, D=1) (3) which is equivalent to: E (Y1-Y0|D=1) = E (Y1| D =1)\u2013E (Y0|D =1) (3a) ATT can also be defined conditional on P(Z): where P is a probability distribution of observed covariances Z (see: Chapter: 4.3.1.1). \u0394 ATT (x) = E( \u0394 |X=x, P(Z)=p, D=1) (3b) As (3a) and (3b) are equivalent, the latter formulation will be applied in our study for calculating effects of a given RD programme. 4.2.3. Average Treatment on the Untreated (ATU) Information about an eventual extension of a given programme to those that were formerly excluded from the programme can be derived on the basis of an average effect on the untreated (ATU) as defined in (3c). E(Y1-Y0|D=0) = E (Y1| D =0)\u2013E (Y0|D =0) (3c) 4.3. Construction of control groups As performance of regions (i) supported by a RD programme cannot be directly observed in a \u201cnon-support\u201d situation (a given region cannot simultaneously be subject and not be subject to the same programme) economic performance of RD supported regions in a \u201cnon-support\u201d situation has to be simulated, using more advanced techniques. Construction of an appropriate base-line should provide us with an answer to the question: \u201cwhat would have been a given outcome for regions supported by an RD programme if the programme had not been implemented?\u201d. By comparing outcomes of the performance of supported regions with a control group of regions in two data points; i.e. at the time of support inititaion and after support, we can straightforwardly answer two questions: Q1). What was the effect of exogenously determined factors 11 on the performance of regions which in reality were supported by the programme?, and Q2). What was the effect of the programme support? Obviously, in the context of empirical non- experimental studies the counterfactuals cannot be estimated directly, in a manner analogous to the one based on randomization. The underlying 11 All factors which influence performance of supported and non-supported regions and are not considered as RD programme related can be called exogenous. ",

One of the difficulties commonly faced during formulation of a relevant base-line is the problem of a perfect comparability (ideally, in case of rural development programmes, the same regions which participated in the programme should also be used for simulation of their performance without the programme). As this is however not feasible, it is important to make comparisons in a manner which guarantees that all basic characteristics of regions in which the RD programme was implemented are as much as possible identical with the characteristics of those regions that did not participate (i.e. the statistical probability of receiving support from RD programmes should be the same for supported and non-supported regions in each comparison group 12 ). 4.3.1. Matching Matching is a method of sampling from a large number of potential controls to produce a control group of modest size in which the distribution of covariates is similar to their distribution in the group of participants. Matching is based on the identifying assumption that conditional on some covariates X, the outcome Y is independent of D. Application of matching to the consistent evaluation of programme effects makes the following two assumptions crucial: 1. Unconfoundedness assumption: Y 0 , Y 1 \u2534 D |X 12 See: Part VI: Application of propensity score Where: \u2534 denotes independence Unconfoundedness - to yield consistent estimates of the programme impact matching methods assume that the outcome in the counterfactual state is independent of participation, given observable characteristics. This assumption implies, that selection is based solely on observable characteristics and that all variables that influence participation and potential outcomes are observed by the researcher (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). 2. Overlap assumption : 0 < Pr (D =1|X <1 The overlap assumption prevents X from being a perfect predictor in the sense that it is possible to find a counterpart in the non- participant group for each programme participant and vice versa (Caliendo and Hujer, 2005). If there are regions where the support of X does not overlap for the participants and non-participants, matching has to be performed over the common support only (i.e. to avoid a situation of lack of comparable units, one can restrict matching and hence estimation of the effect of programme participation to the region of common support, equivalent to an overlap condition). The overlap condition not only rules out the phenomenon of perfect predictability of D given X but also ensures that units with the same X values have positive probabilities of being both participants and non- participants (see: Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005; Heckman, LaLonde and Smith, 1999). A weaker version of the overlap assumption implies the possible existence of a non-participant similar to each participant 13 . 13 Following Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1998), the importance of overlap assumption can be illustrated on example of a situation where for some values of x we have either p(x) =0 or p(x)=1, i.e. in which one would find some units i with covariates implying that those units either always participate or never participate in the programme. If they always participated there would not have counterparts in the comparison group (non-participants). On the other hand, had they never participated, they would never had counterparts in the group of programme participants. ",

Conditional on the observables Z, outcomes for the regions which did not participate in a RD programme represent what participating regions would have experienced had they not participated in the RD programme (under the assumption that selection into the RD programme is based entirely on observable characteristics). Various empirical studies show that traditional matching may be rather difficult if the set of conditioning variables Z is large, due to the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d of the conditioning problem 14 . Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) showed that the dimensionality of the conditioning problem can be reduced by implementing matching methods through the use of so-called balancing scores b(Z), i.e. functions of the relevant observed covariates Z such that the conditional distribution of Z given b(Z) is independent of assignment into treatment. One possible balancing score is the propensity score, i.e. the probability of participating in a programme given observed characteristics Z. 4.3.1.1. Propensity score matching Propensity score matching (PSM) (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983) is used in our study to predict the probability of receiving support on the basis of observed covariates for both supported and non-supported regions. The method balances the observed covariates between the supported group and a control group based on similarity of their predicted probabilities of receiving support, e.g. from the RD programme. The aim of PSM matching is to find a comparison group of regions from a sample of non-supported regions that is closest (in terms of observed characteristics) to the sample of those regions where an RD programme was implemented. 14 In case Z is if high dimension it is very difficult to find an appropriate match. For example, with just 20 binary covariates, there are 220 or about a million covariate patterns (Rosenbaum, 2004). For random variables Y and Z and for discrete variable D, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) defined the propensity score as a conditional probability of participating in a programme given pre- programme characteristics Z: p(Z) \u2261 Pr (D=1|Z) = E(D|Z) where Z is a multidimensional vector of pre-programme characteristics. Rosenbaum and Rubin showed that if the participation in programme is random conditional on Z, it is also random conditional on p(Z): E(D|Y, Pr(D=1|Z)) = E(E(D|Y, Z)|Y, Pr(D=1|Z)) (4a) so that E(D|Y,Z)=E(D|Z)=Pr(D=1|Z) implies E(D|Y, Pr(D=1)|Z))=E(D|Pr(D=1|Z)) (4b) Where: Pr (D=1|Z) is a propensity score In other words when Y0 outcomes are independent from programme participation conditional on Z, they are also independent from participation conditional on the propensity score, Pr (D=1|Z). Conditional independence remains therefore valid if we use the propensity score p(Z) instead of covariates Z or its subset (X). 4.3.2. Matching algorithms As the probability of observing two units with exactly the same value of the propensity score is in principle zero (since p(Z) is a continuous variable) the estimation of desirable programme effects (see below) requires the use of appropriate matching algorithms which define the measure of proximity in order to define programme non- participants who are acceptably close (e.g. in terms of the propensity score) to any given programme participant. The most commonly used matching algorithms are: Nearest Neighbour Matching, ",

Nearest neighbour matching In this matching method the region j (non- participant) with the value of Pj that is closest to participanting region Pi is selected as the match. C (P i ) = min j |P i - P j | , j \u0454 I 0 ( 5 ) Where: P is a propensity score The most prominent variants of nearest matching are i) matching with replacement , i.e. the unit, which did not participate in the programme, can be used more than once as a match; and ii) matching without replacement where respective programme non-participants can match only once. The biggest disadvantage of the nearest neighbour method is that it can result in bad matches if the closest neighbour (the control unit) is placed far away (in terms of the propensity score) from a supported unit. 4.3.2.2. Caliper matching This method is to be considered as a variation of nearest neighbour matching. A match for a firm i is selected only if: | P i \u2013 P j | < \u0454 , j \u0454 I 0 ( 6 ) Where \u03b5 is pre-specified tolerance By using caliper matching bad matches can be avoided by imposing a tolerance level on the maximum propensity score distance. The disadvantage of this method is the difficulty to know a priori what tolerance level is reasonable (Smith and Todd, 2005). 4.3.2.3. Kernel matching Kernel matching is defined as: (7) Where: W = weights for i and j G = a kernel function an = the bandwidth. Various kernel functions can be used in applied work, such as the Gaussian, the Epanechnikow, biweight (quartic), triweight or the cosine functions. This non-parametric matching estimator (kernel) is especially interesting as it allows for a match of each programme participant with multiple units in a control group with weights which depend on the distance between the participant observation for which a counterfactual is being constructed and each comparison group observation. In this method weights are inversely proportional to the distance between the propensity scores of participants and controls within the common support level (the further away a comparison unit is from the participant unit, the lower the weight it receives in the computation of the counterfactual outcome). The main advantage of this method is that a lower variance is achieved because more information is used 15 . Another useful property of applying this method is the possibility of using standard bootstrap techniques for estimation of standard errors for matching estimators that generally should not be applied when using nearest neighbour matching (Abadie and Imbens, 2004; Todd, 2006). 15 For systematical analysis of the finite-sample properties of various propensity score matching and weighting estimators through Monte Carlo simulation see: Fr\u00f6lich, 2004b.

Local linear weighting function The local linear weighting function (Heckman, Ichimura and Todd, 1997; Smith and Todd, 2003)) can be defined as: W ( i , j ) = (8) Where: W = weights The difference between kernel matching and local linear matching is that the latter includes in addition to the intercept a linear term in the propensity score of a unit i that participated in the programme. This is an advantage whenever comparison group observations are distributed asymmetrically around the treated observation, e.g. at boundary points, or when there are gaps in the propensity score distribution (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). Obviously, the specification of a matching algorithm hinges on the two basics factors, i.e. definition of proximity (in the space of the propensity score) and determination of weights (weighting function) (Essama-Nssah, 2006). In some empirical studies 1-to-1 or 1-to-n nearest neighbour with calliper matching methods are used as a standard application. In others, the kernel matching is favoured. Empirical comparison of matching methods suggests that their performance can vary case-by-case thus no one method fits all circumstances and is therefore always preferable (Zhao, 2004; Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). Though asymptotically all PSM estimators should yield the same results (Smith, 2000), in small samples the choice of matching algorithm can be important (Heckman, Ichimura and Todd, 1997). 4.3.3. Matching selection criteria Among many methods allowing to assess the matching quality the most popular approaches are: i) standardized bias (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); ii) t\u2013test (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); iii) joint significance and pseudo R\u00b2 (Sianesi, 2004); or iv) stratification tests (Dehejia and Wahba 1999, 2002). If the quality indicators are not satisfactory, some reasons might be misspecification of the propensity score model (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005) or failure of the CIA (Smith and Todd, 2005). 4.4. Difference-in-differences estimator (DID) DID is a traditional evaluation estimator for cases where the outcome data on programme participants and non-participants is available for both \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d periods (t\u2019 and t, respectively), under assumption that the effect of \u201cunobservables\u201d is time invariant. The DID measures the impact of the RD programme by using the differences between programme participants (D=1) and non-participants (D=0) in the before-after situations (i.e. it compares the before-after change of regions which participated in a programme with before-after change of those control regions which did not participate). The simplified notation for the DID calculation can be described as follows: DID = { \u03a3 (Yit | (D=1) \u2013 Yit | (D=0)) \u2013 \u03a3 (Yit\u2019 | (D=1) \u2013 Yit\u2019 | (D=0))}/n (9) Where: (Yit | (D=1) \u2013 Yit | (D=0)) is the difference in mean outcomes between the n participants and the m matched comparison units after the access to the RD programme and ",

Yet, the DID method fails if the impact of unobservables is not time-invariant so that a group of programme participants (i.e. regions which participated in a given RD programme) and a control group (regions which did not participate) are on different development trajectories . The probability of having different development trajectories increases if already from the beginning of the programme the observed heterogeneity of both groups (and therefore selection bias) is large. While propensity score matching can be applied as a control for the selection bias on observables at the beginning of the programme, a combination of PSM with DID methods (conditional DID estimator \u2013 see 3.5. below) allows for a better controlling of the selection bias in both observables and unobservables. 4.5. Combined PSM and Difference-in- differences estimator (conditional DID estimator) The conditional DID estimator (Heckman, Ichimura and Todd, 1997; Heckman, Ichimura, Smith and Todd, 1998; Smith and Todd, 2005) is highly applicable in case the outcome data on programme participants (i.e. regions which participated in a given RD programme) and non- participants (appropriately constructed control group) is available both \u201c before \u201d and \u201c after \u201d periods ( t\u2019 and t , respectively). In our study, the PSM-DID measures the impact of the RD programme by using the differences in selected outcome indicators (ATE, or ATT) between programme participants regions (D=1) and comparable non-participants regions (D=0 ) in the before-after situations. The conditional PSM-DID estimator can be defined as follows: PSM-DID = { \u03a3 (Y it | (D=1) \u2013 Y it | (D=0)) \u2013 \u03a3 (Y it\u2019 | (D=1) \u2013 Y it\u2019 | (D=0))}/n (10) Where: (Yit | (D=1) \u2013 Yit | (D=0)) is the difference in mean outcomes between regions participating in the RD programme and the PSM matched control units after implementation of a given RD programme and (Yit\u2019 | (D=1) \u2013 Yit\u2019 | (D=0)) is the difference in mean outcomes between regions participating in the RD programme and PSM matched control units at date 0 (prior to the beginning of a given RD programme). Given ATE, ATT or ATU computed in periods: t and t\u2019 the PSM-DID estimator can be expressed as: PSM-DID = ATt \u2013 AT t\u2019 (11) Where: AT = ATE or ATT or ATU A decisive advantage of the conditional PSM- DID estimator, compared with a standard DID estimator, is that by applying this methodology, initial conditions regarding observable heterogeneity of both groups of regions (programme participants and non-participants) that could influence subsequent changes over time are controlled for. 4.6. Sensitivity analysis 4.6.1. Rosenbaum bounding approach The unconfoundeness assumption about the treatment assignment merely asserts that all variables that simultaneously affect the participation decision and outcome are observed by the researcher. Yet, if there are unobserved variables that simultaneously affect the participation decision and outcome, a hidden bias might arise to which matching estimators are not robust (Rosenbaum, 2002; Becker and ",
        "23 C o u n t e r f a c t u a l i m p a c t e v a l u a t i o n o f E U r u r a l d e v e l o p m e n t p r o g r a m m e s - P r o p e n s i t y S c o r e M a t c h i n g m e t h o d o l o g y . . . Caliendo, 2007). The approach proposed by (Rosenbaum, 2002) allows to determine how much hidden bias would need to be present to render plausible the null hypothesis of no effect, or in another words, how strongly an unmeasured variable must influence the selection process in order to undermine the implications of a standard propensity score matching analysis (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). The Rosenbaum bounding approach does not test the unconfoundedness assumption itself, because this would amount to testing that there are no unobserved variables that influence the selection into the programme; instead it provides evidence on the degree to which any significance results hinge on this untestable assumption (Becker and Caliendo, 2007). An extensive discussion of this sensitivity approach can be found in (Aakvik, 2001; Rosenbaum, 2002; Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005; Becker and Caliendo, 2007). Following these studies we define probability of participation as: P i = P(x i , u i ) = P (D i =1|x i , u i ) = F ( \u03b2 x i + \u03bb u i ) (12) Where: Di = equals 1 if an unit i participates in programme xi = are the observed characteristics for unit i ui = the unobserved variable \u03bb = is the effect of ui on the participation decision the study is free of hidden bias if \u03bb is zero and participation probability is determined entirely by effects of xi. However, in the presence of hidden bias two matched units (with the same observed covariates x) will have different chances of programme participation. While the odds that both units i and j will participate are given by P i /(1-P i ) and P j /(1-P j ) the odds ratio is equal to [exp ( \u03b2 x i + \u03bb u i )]/ [exp ( \u03b2 x j + \u03bb u j )] which in case of identical observed covariates (implied by matching) reduces (the vector x cancels out) to exp { \u03bb (u i -u j )}. Rosenbaum, 2002 showed that this implies the following bounds on the odds ratio so that either of the two matched units will participate: (13) If the odds ratio differs, i.e. departs from a value of 1 this can only be due to hidden bias. In this sense e \u03bb is a measure of the degree of departure from a study that is free of hidden bias (Rosenbaum, 2002; Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005; Becker and Caliendo, 2007). Sensitivity analysis means therefore examining the bounds on the odds ratio for programme participation that lie between 1/ e \u03bb and e \u03bb . 16 Sensitivity analysis, as described above, is applied in our study using formal (Mantel and Haenszel, 1959) test statistics suggested by (Aakvik, 2001) and described in (Becker and Caliendo, 2007). Applications of sensitivity analysis for evaluating social programmes can also be found in (Aakvik, 2001; DiPrete and Gangl, 2004; Caliendo, Hujer and Thomsen, 2005; Watson, 2005). 4.7. Generalized Propensity Score Method Clearly, propensity score matching described above is especially applicable in situations where an RD programme is implemented selectively (i.e. only in some regions, leaving others unaffected). While this situation (i.e. binary treatment) may be in practice limited to only some specific RD measures (e.g. investment in agricultural holdings, environmental measures, less favoured areas, etc.) the standard praxis is that a given 16 With increasing e \u03bb the bounds move apart reflecting uncertainty in test statistics in the presence of unobserved hidden bias.

In case the treatment (i.e. exposure to programme participation) is a continuous variable, the previous setting using a binary propensity score matching has to be extended. Propensity score techniques allowing for multi-valued and continuous treatment effects were proposed by (Imbens, 2002; Lechner, 2002; Imai and van Dyk, 2002; Hirano and Imbens, 2004). Hirano and Imbens (2004) extended the unconfoundedness assumption for binary treatment (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983) to multi-valued and continuous treatments and defined the generalized propensity score function (GPS) as the conditional density of the actual treatment given the observed covariates. Empirical applications of a GPS to the evaluation of public policies can be found in (Bia and Mattei, 2007; Kluve et. al, 2007). Hirano and Imbens, 2004 showed that in combination with the unconfoundedness assumption GPS has a balancing property similar to that of the standard propensity score and thus GPS can be used to eliminate any bias associated with differences in the covariates. In order to estimate a programme effect at various levels of treatment we will apply the GPS method by following an approach described in Hirano and Imbens, 2004. The approach consists of three main steps: 1. Estimation of the GPS as a conditional density of treatment given the covariates by: a. estimation of the parameters of the treatment function (conditional distribution of treatment) using maximum likelihood according to: (14) b. assessment of the validity of the assumed normal distribution model by appropriate tests (e.g. Kolomogorov- Smirnov, Shapiro-Francia, Shapiro- Wilk or skewness and kurtosis tests for normality) c. estimation of the GPS as: (15) where and are the estimated parameters in step a). d. testing the balancing property 2. Modelling the conditional expectation of the programme outcome as a flexible function (polynomial approximation) of Ti and Ri 3. Estimation the average potential outcome for each level of treatment and an entire dose- response function as: (16) where is the vector of the estimated parameters in the second stage. ",

Impact Indicators 5.1. Rural Development Index The main summative impact indicator used in this study of evaluation of RD programmes is the RDI. The methodology applied to construction of a synthetic index of the rural development (RDI) is described in Michalek and Zarnekow, 2011; and Michalek and Zarnekow, 2012. The RDI, as a composite indicator, was calculated according to eq. (17) on the base of regional characteristics Z i and individual weights \u03b2 k that were derived from the estimated migration function (see: eq. 18). In such a model, the estimated weights \u03b2 k represent the relative \u201cimportance\u201d or a \u201csocial value\u201d assigned by a society (composed of those who migrated and those who stayed) to each of characteristics Z k i representing various aspects of the quality of life in all origin and destination regions i . Formally the RDI in each individual region i can be expressed as a linear function of specific i- region characteristics Z k i and their weights \u03b2 k (see eq 17): RDI i = h ( \u03b2 k , Z ki ) = \u03a3 k \u03b2 k * Z ki (17) Where: RDI i = Rural development index (an equivalent of the quality of life index) in region i Z ki = Measurable characteristics k in a region i \u03b2 k = Weights for each characteristic k derived from the estimated migration function that can be both i -region and time t specific In our study Z ki is constructed empirically using factorization method applied to all relevant coefficients and variables V i available at the regional level. The latter are nested in Z ki (i.e. RD domains) and describe in detail various specific aspects of rural development in each individual region i (e.g. a number of enterprises, employment coefficients, water/air pollution coefficients, schools, health facilities, etc. available from regional secondary statistics). Weights \u03b2 k that enter the RDI are derived from a migration model (eq 18) where the probability distribution of migration log (m) is a dependent variable, and differences in regional characteristics \u2206 F IDKt' , and transaction costs (D) are explanatory variables. While weights \u03b2 k used to construct the RDI are only a subset of estimated coefficients within a migration model, this feature brings about a separation of the RDI from migration (due to transaction costs). The migration model applied for derivation of weights in the RDI was estimated as a panel regression in form of (18): (18) Where: log (m) = log mrate 1-mrate ( ) mrate = inflows from region i to j divided by ( population in i multiplied by population in j) D ID = distance between region i and j D 2 ID = squared distance between i and j \u2206 F IDKt = differences in factors k between regions i j v ID = random intercept at the pair wise ID level ",

Model 18 is thus estimated as a random effect linear regression model with a group variable at the level of i j (ID) by using the GLS random effects estimator (a matrix-weighted average of the between and within estimators) 17 . The most important pros and cons of selecting Model 18 as a base for derivation of weights used in calculation of the RDI in comparison with other alternative model specifications are provided in Michalek and Zarnekow, 2009. The major advantages from applying the RDI as an impact indicator to the evaluation of RD programmes are as follows: \u2022 The approach allows to consider all potential effects of a given RD programme (aggregated or separated by programme measures) on various rural development domains (economic, social, environmental, etc.) and on the overall quality of life of population living in individual rural areas. 17 The random effect estimator produces more efficient results than between estimator, albeit with unknown small sample properties. The between estimator is less efficient because it discards the over time information in data in favour of simple means; the random-effects estimator uses both the within and the between information (STATA, ver.10; Kennedy, 2003). \u2022 The approach allows to incorporate numerous general equilibrium effects of a programme, e.g. multiplier effects, substitution effects, into the analysis . \u2022 As an impact indicator the RDI is powerful both at the aggregated level (e.g. NUTS 2) and commune levels (NUTS 5) and even the village level (if data exists). \u2022 As an impact indicator the RDI is applicable both for analysis of RD programmes as well as analysis of structural programmes. \u2022 The RDI can also be used as an impact indicator for the evaluation of large projects implemented at low regional levels (e.g. NUTS 5). 5.2. Other partial impact indicators Beyond the RDI, other selected partial performance indicators available at regional level (e.g. employment coefficient, rate of rural unemployment, value added, etc.) were used as relevant impact indicators.

Synthesis of the methodological approach to the evaluation of the impact of RD programmes The evaluation techniques described above were applied to the assessment of the impact of an RD programme (SAPARD) in Slovakia and Poland. The following steps were carried out: Firstly, the RDI (as described above) was computed for all i-regions (i.e. where the RD programme was implemented and non- implemented) in a given country. Secondly, binary propensity score matching was applied to estimate the impact of individual SAPARD measures (in both countries individual SAPARD measures were implemented in some regions only (programme participants) and not throughout the whole country) using the RDI, and the unemployment rate as impact indicators. Propensity scores for individual regions in a given country were obtained from a standard logit-model with region- and time-specific characteristics (factors/principal components) computed prior to the beginning of the SAPARD programme (2002) as explanatory variables. Thirdly, some of regions were excluded from further comparisons because their propensity scores were outside the common support. Matched pairs of similar regions etc. were constructed on the basis of how close the estimated scores were across the two samples (supported vs. controls). Several weighting techniques (matching algorithms) were applied to calculate the average outcome indicator of the matched non-supported group, ranging from \u201cnearest neighbour\u201d weights to non-parametric weights (e.g. kernel functions of the differences in scores). The \u201cbest\u201d matching algorithm was selected using a minimum standardized bias as a main criterion (conditional on meeting other criteria, e.g. t-tests, ands pseudo R\u00b2 test). Fourthly, the mean value of the outcome indicator (i.e. RDI and other relevant partial outcome indicators, e.g. unemployment) for the nearest \u201cneighbours\u201d of the programme supported regions was computed using a selected matching algorithm (e.g. Kernel method). Fifthly, the conditional DID method (combination of PSM and DID) was applied to measure the impact of the RD programme on individual regions (2002-2005) 18 . Sixthly, a sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to find out: i) whether unobserved factors at the regional level could alter inference on effects of participation in SAPARD, and ii) how strongly an unmeasured variable would have to influence the selection process to undermine the implications of the matching analysis. An assessment of a possible influence of unobservable characteristics on procured results was obtained by applying the methodology described in (Rosenbaum, 2002). The approach \u201cRosenbaum bounds\u201d allows for testing the presence of unobserved heterogeneity (hidden bias) between supported and non-supported regions. The testing procedure is carried out on the basis of Mantel-Haenszel test statistics that give bound estimates of significance levels at given levels of hidden bias under the assumption of either systematic over- or underestimation of treatment effects. The sensitivity analysis was carried out using a syntax described in: Becker and Caliendo, 2007. 18 Specifically, the difference \u201cone\u201d is the difference in mean outcomes between those regions where programme was implemented and the matched comparison regions after implementation of the RD programme, the difference \u201ctwo\u201d is the difference in mean outcomes between those regions where programme was implemented and matched comparison regions prior to the RD programme, and the difference \u201cthree\u201d is the difference between difference \u201cone\u201d and difference \u201ctwo\u201d.

Eighthly, the net-impact of the whole RD programme (all measures-together) was estimated at various intensity levels of programme exposure (level of programme expenditures) using the RDI as a synthetic impact indicator and the local unemployment rate as an important partial indicator at regional level. A generalized propensity score methodology that allows for continuous treatment regimes was applied to derive the dose-response function and the derivative of the dose-response function. The above methodology was empirically applied for an estimation of the impact of SAPARD in Poland and Slovakia at the NUTS-4 level in the years 2002-2005. ",

Construction of the RDI as a programme impact indicator The RDI in Poland involving 991 regional indicators was calculated for all (314) rural NUTS-4 regions and the years 2002-2005 according to eq. 17. On the basis of the estimated RDIs rural regions were ranked in terms of their overall level of rural development. The ranking of NUTS-4 regions over the years 2002-2005 is shown in Figure 1. The geographical distribution of the RDI in Poland (the average of 2002 and 2005) is shown in Figure 2. The results of the RDI estimation confirm a clear typological division of Poland based on the performance of individual rural regions into a good performing western- and central part, and a badly performing eastern part (north- eastern and south-eastern),. The results also back up a general opinion that suburbs of the biggest cities (e.g. Warsaw, Poznan, Gdansk, Wroclaw, Lodz, Krakow) exhibit the highest quality of life (see Figure 2). The lowest RDIs (i.e. less than -0.08) were found in remote regions situated in south-eastern Poland, i.e. hrubieszowski (on the border with Ukraine), bierunsko-ledzinski (a former heavy industrial complex in south Poland), chelmski (on the border with Ukraine), bieszczadzki (a remote region bordering to Ukraine and Slovakia) for details see Table 1 in Annex).

        "32 8 . R e s u l t s The overview of the main factors/components is shown in Table 1. Due to its comprehensiveness, the RDI can be used as the impact indicator measuring the effects of various rural and structural programmes affecting rural areas. In our study, the RDI will be applied to evaluation of the overall impact of the pre-accession SAPARD programme (2002-2004). 8.2. Scope and regional distribution of the selected SAPARD measure The assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Poland was carried out by taking as an example a measure that was especially designed to improve the quality of life of the population living in rural areas (i.e. SAPARD measure 3 \u201cDevelopment and improvement of rural infrastructure\u201d). Of 6230 investment proposals submitted under this measure to the Polish Agency for Modernisation and Restructuring (SAPARD implementing agency) 4492 contracts (years 2002-2004) were signed and implemented in the following years amounting to approximately 2 bn PLN (approximately \u20ac547m), of which 1.520m PLN (\u20ac411m) were co-financed from the EU. The main beneficiaries of this measure were local administration units (gminas at NUTS-5 and poviats at NUTS-4 levels). The major financial allocations under Measure 3 concerned the development and modernisation of roads (41%), waste water disposal (41%), water supply to agricultural holdings (16%), solid waste management (0.41%), and the provision of renewable energy (0.35%). An impact assessment of a given RD programme (measure 3) requires some basic information about: 1. Which regions were supported by the given RD programme (measure 3)?; and 2. What was the local/regional intensity of this support? Although basic data on financial aspects linked to the implementation of Measure 3 under the SAPARD programme was generally available (e.g. total programme spending by measure and region) answering the above questions could create some problems because: a. In several regions (average NUTS-4 region, 81 000 population and 973 km\u00b2), funds from the SAPARD programme that were allocated during the years 2002-2004 to eligible infrastructural investments under measure 3 were almost negligible (e.g. total public support from this programme measure was less than \u20ac0.1m per region). In this situation, it would not be justifiable to classify these regions as supported from the programme; b. The intensity of the programme support can be measured using various indicators, e.g. total per region; per capita in region; or per km\u00b2 in region. While all of these indicators have both advantages and disadvantages, an objective appraisal of programme impact may require using of all three criteria. An analysis of the geographical allocation of funds under SAPARD Measure 3 shows that programme resources were not equally distributed across all NUTS-4 regions. The majority of available resources under SAPARD (Measure 3) were used to improve the rural infrastructure in eastern and south-eastern Poland (see graphs 2a-2c). These were also the areas where individual exposure/intensity (per region, per capita or km\u00b2) to the programme (measure 3) was the highest. Further analysis of allocation of funds under measure 3 shows a negative correlation of the programme intensity with the RDI (see Table 2) thus confirming that available resources from SAPARD (Measure 3) were primarily targeting less- and medium- developed rural regions.

Division of regions between supported and non-supported Considering that only five (out of 314) NUTS-4 regions did not receive any support from the SAPARD programme under Measure 3, and in a further 16 regions the support from the programme (Measure 3) was almost negligible (i.e. did not exceed \u20ac200,000 per region), an arbitrary threshold had to be imposed to differentiate between programme supported and non-supported regions. As a general rule, those regions where the programme intensity (Measure 3) was lower than 2/3 of the median were qualified as \u201cnot supported\u201d. The same rule (removed in Chapter 8.9) was applied to all programme intensity measures (i.e. M3 per region; M3 per capita; and M3 per km\u00b2) 19 . 19 While, the effectiveness of relatively small yet well designed investments (e.g. addressing point source environmental pollution) can be very high thus setting of a threshold above which amount a region can be considered as supported is always arbitrary.

Intensity of programme exposure per region basis (M3 per region) The application of an indicator \u201cM3 per region\u201d (and the setting of the above threshold) as the main criterion determining the status of an individual region (supported vs. non- supported) resulted in a division of 314 NUTS- 4 regions into two groups: i) programme participants (185 regions), if programme funds (measure 3) allocated to a respective region were above 4.1m PLN (\u20ac1.1m) per region; and ii) programme \u201cnon-participants\u201d (129 regions), if allocated funds per region were below this threshold 20 .

Indeed, in extreme situation some small regions (programme participants) could be assigned a status of \u201cnon-participants\u201d only due to the fact that allocated programme funds did not exceed the arbitrary threshold (as at region basis). In fact, by setting a threshold the interpretation of the programme impact may change by restricting it to effects of substantial programme allocations (above 1.1 Mill EUR). ",

R e s u l t s Where: F = endowments in factors/ RD components D = 1 (Group 1; i.e. programme participants) D = 0 (Group 2; i.e. programme non-participants RDI2002 = RDI in 2002 Unemplrur02 = rural unemployment rate (% of rural unemployment in total unemployment) We note that both groups of regions (Group1 = supported vs. Group2 = non-supported) differed considerably both in terms of their overall level of rural development (measured by the RDI) as well as in terms of other regional characteristics (factors 1-17, total unemployment, rural unemployment, etc.). For example, the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI prior to the SAPARD programme in year 2002) in the group of regions qualified here as programme participants (i.e. Group 1: less developed regions) was about half of the group of programme non-participants (i.e. Group 2: better developed regions). When compared with the level of rural unemployment (the percentage of rural unemployed in the total unemployed), the respective figures prior to the SAPARD programme were 62% in Group 1 compared with 52% in group 2. The analysis of individual factors characterizing other aspects of rural development prior to beginning of the SAPARD programme, e.g. f4 (percentage of the highest income groups and housing availability), f5 (subsidies and social expenditures), f8 (rural infrastructure, e.g. gas supply system) or f11 (Heating energy sector <pollution> and deaths) indicate significant differences between both groups of regions (see Table 3). It also indicates a much worse economic, social and environmental performance of Group 1 (later supported by SAPARD) compared with Group 2 (non-supported). Given the above, we therefore conclude that the allocation of SAPARD funds (Measure 3) was carefully targeted and determined by the actual economic, social and environmental situation of individual rural regions. Clearly, significant differences in individual characteristics (factor endowments) in both groups of regions prior to the SAPARD programme (2002) confirm the existence of a considerable selection bias and therefore a non-direct comparability of both groups of regions . In other words, a direct use of selected impact indicators (e.g. an RDI, added value, employment etc.) for assessment of the impact of SAPARD by performing a counterfactual analysis confined to a simple comparison of performance of these indicators in the above groups (e.g. using a traditional DID method) would not be appropriate. This could lead to biased results unless there is strong additional evidence that the hidden bias (unobserved by evaluators) remains time invariant. As this cannot normally be guaranteed, one should apply evaluation techniques that ensure the full comparability of programme participants and control groups of regions, e.g. by drawing on matching principles (e.g. propensity score matching). 8.4. Estimation of propensity score Given information about individual regional characteristics prior to the SAPARD programme (year 2002) and the status of each individual region (programme participants vs. programme non-participants), a logit function was estimated using factors (f1-f17) and unemployment coefficients as covariates. The results of the logit estimation are shown in Table 4 The results of this estimation were then used to derive the individual probability of programme participation (propensity scores) for all regions. Clearly, in order to ensure comparability, the estimated propensity scores of regions that participated in the SAPARD programme (measure 3) and their controls should be very similar. As the probability of observing two units with exactly the same value of the propensity score is in principle zero (since p(Z) is a continuous variable), the estimation of desirable programme effects (e.g. ATT, ATE, etc.) requires using appropriate matching algorithms. These set up the measure of proximity in order to define ",

Selection of a matching algorithm The most commonly used matching algorithms involving propensity score are: Nearest Neighbour Matching, Radius Matching, Stratification Matching and Kernel Matching (Cohran and Rubin, 1973; Dehejia and Wahba, 1999; Heckman, Ichimura and Todd. 1997, 1998; Heckman; Ichimura, Smith and Todd, 1998). While asymptotically all PSM matching techniques should yield the same results, the choice of matching method (or applied matching parameters e.g. number of nearest neighbours, radius magnitude, kernel type, etc.) can make a difference in small samples (Smith, 2000) 21 . As the quality of a given matching technique depends strongly on a dataset, the selection of a relevant matching technique in our study was carried out using three independent criteria: i) standardized bias (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); ii) t\u2013test (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); and iii) joint significance and pseudo R\u00b2 (Sianesi, 2004). We found that the best results were achieved by using an iterative procedure (e.g. linear 21 Description of trade-offs linked to each of matching algorithms can be found in (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005).

In all considered cases (various matching algorithms) 23 an optimal solution could easily be found due to local/global convexity of the objective function with respect to function parameters under each matching algorithm (e.g. radius magnitude in radius matching; or number of nearest neighbours in nearest neighbour matching). An overview of results obtained using different matching algorithms is provided in Table 5. In our example (314 total observations; participation criterion: M3 per region; impact indicator: RDI in 2002) the radius calliper matching (0.21) was selected as the best matching algorithm (see Table. 5). The imposition 22 The standardized bias is the difference of the sample means in the treated and non-treated (full or matched) sub-samples as a percentage of the square root of the average of the sample variances in the treated and non- treated groups (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985). 23 This does not apply to local linear weighting function matching which first smoothes the outcome and then performs nearest neighbor matching. In this case more controls are used to calculate the counterfactual outcome than the nearest neighbor only (Leuven and Sianesi, 2007). of a common support region resulted in dropping 19 programme supported and 9 programme non-supported regions (outside of common support) from a further analysis, thus selecting a comparable 166 programme participants regions (out of a total of 185) and 120 programme non-participants regions (out of a total of 129) as relevant counterparts. In the next step the balancing property tests (t-test) were carried out to verify statistically the comparability of selected groups of regions in terms of observable covariates (Table 6). The above tests show that the applied matching procedure (i.e. minimization of the standardized selection bias using calliper matching 0.21) considerably improved comparability of both groups of regions, making a counterfactual analysis more realistic. Indeed, previously existing significant differences (measured in terms of t-test) in variables between the group of regions supported from the SAPARD programme (D=1) and non-supported regions (D=0) before matching dropped after matching (differences became no more significant). This applies to all important variables determining both programme participation and outcomes, e.g. RDI 2002; unemployment rate, rural unemployment, Table 5: Poland: Comparison of matching algorithms (participation criterion: M3 per region; impact indicator: RDI in 2002) Matching method Matching parameters Estimated standardized bias (after matching) Nearest neighbours N (6) 9.59 N (7) 8.88 \u2192 min N (8) 9.73 Radius caliper (0.2) 7.57 (0.21) 7.41 \u2192 Selection Min {Min} (0.22) 7.47 Kernel normal (Gaussian) bandwidth (0.08) 7.64 bandwidth (0.09) 7.48 \u2192 min bandwidth (0.10) 7.57 Kernel biweight 7.92 Kernel epanechnikov bandwidth (0.25) 7.59 bandwidth (0.24) 7.58 \u2192 min bandwidth (0.23) 7.61 ",

Also other tests, e.g. pseudo R\u00b2 (pseudo R\u00b2 = 0.24 before matching and pseudo R\u00b2= 0. 07 after matching) confirmed the high quality of the selected matching procedure and thus applicability of the used approach. 8.5. Calculation of policy evaluation parameters (ATT, ATE, ATU) Comprehensive assessment of programme impact at a regional level requires separation of various important programme effects, e.g. effect on regions which participated in a given programme (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated - ATT); effect on an average region randomly selected from the pool of programme participants and non-participants (Average Treatment Effect \u2013 ATE) or an effect of the programme on the regions that did not participate (Average Treatment Effect on the Untreated \u2013 ATU). In our study, the above policy evaluation parameters (ATT, ATE, ATU) were calculated on the basis of estimated propensity scores using the following programme impact indicators: a. RDI b. Unemployment rate (general) c. Rural unemployment (percentage of rural unemployment in total unemployment) The results of ATT, ATE and ATU calculations are shown in Table 7. Given these parameters the programme impact is quantified using a conditional DID estimator , i.e. combining PSM (ATT, ATE, ATU) and difference in differences (DID) methods. 8.6. Combined PSM and DID estimator The application of the binary PSM method (including thresholds), and the conditional DID estimator to the assessment of the programme impact shows that the effect of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development in regions that participated in the programme (less developed regions) was almost negligible. Indeed, probably due to a low programme intensity and a short time horizon, the estimated impact of infrastructural measures (Measure 3) on the overall RDI in regions that participated in the programme (i.e. a difference between ATT in 2002 and ATT in 2005) was close to zero (the difference between the RDI in regions participating in the programme and regions non- supported remained almost constant over the years 2002-2005). In contrast, a slight positive impact of SAPARD (Measure 3) was found on rural unemployment. When measured in absolute values, between 2002 and 2005 rural unemployment stayed on average (all 314 regions) at a similar level (approximately 58% of total unemployment). Yet, during the same period in our comparable groups (matched regions supported by the programme and similar control group) rural unemployment increased, due to negative economic conditions characterising these regions. Interestingly, in the same time period rural unemployment in the control group of regions (non-participants) grew stronger (0.0095) compared with the group of programme participants (0.0061). Consequently, the estimated ATT dropped from 0.0148 in 2002 (difference between 0.599 for D=1 and 0.584 for D=0) to 0.0114 in 2005 (difference between 0.605 for D=1 and 0.594 for D=0) thus indicating a slight but positive 24 impact of SAPARD (Measure 3) on rural unemployment in those regions supported by the programme. 24 Due to a negative context of the impact indicator (unemployment) a positive change in ATT (difference between after and before) would indicate a negative impact of the programme.

Furthermore, we found that the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) would have a slight but positive impact on rural unemployment (i.e. decrease) both in: a. those regions that were previously excluded from the programme (a negative change in estimated ATU between 2002 and 2005), as well as b. any other region randomly selected from a total sample of both groups of regions (a negative difference in ATE between 2002 and 2005). From the policy point of view conclusions based on ATT parameters are especially important (i.e. impact on those regions which were supported from the programme). Concerning the conclusions (a) and (b) their relevance is restricted due to the fact that they include the effect on regions j for which the programme was never intended/ designed (from an administrative point of view these regions may be even programme ineligible). 8.7. Other programme intensity and participation criteria As the measurement of the intensity of a region\u2019s participation in the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on a per region basis (with a threshold) may appear problematic, especially in the case of small regions, two other alternative participation measures were applied: 1. programme exposure per capita; and 2. programme exposure per km\u00b2 As in the case of programme exposure per region respective participation thresholds were set at the level of 66% of the country\u2019s average. 8.7.1.

R e s u l t s combined with the application of the above thresholds (D=0 if regional programme exposure is below a 66% of regions\u2019 average; otherwise D=1) resulted in the following division of 314 NUTS-4 regions: 1. per capita: 188 regions supported and 126 regions non-supported, or 2. per km\u00b2: 178 regions supported and 136 region non-supported As in the case of \u201cprogramme exposure per region\u201d, in both settings (i.e. per capita and per km\u00b2) supported and non-supported regions were found to differ considerably in economic, social and environmental aspects of rural development. For example, when measuring the intensity of programme participation on per capita basis, the RDI (2002) in the group of regions supported from the programme (D=1) was as much as 2/3 lower compared with the group of programme non-participants (D=0); rural unemployment in 2002 in group 1 was much higher than in group 2 (64% compared with 48%); endowment with factor 4 (high income groups and housing availability) in group 1 was far below the country average (-0.18), whereas in group 2 it was far above (+0.16). Similar differences were also observable in the case of other partial indicators. Clearly, significant differences between both groups of regions in terms of individual regional characteristics (RDI, factor endowments, etc.) confirm (similarly to the case of \u201cprogramme intensity per region\u201d) the existence of a considerable selection bias preventing a direct comparability of both regional clusters within a counterfactual analysis. 8.7.1.1. Selection of appropriate matching algorithm As with programme exposure on a per region basis, the selection of the best matching algorithm on a per capita or km\u00b2 basis was carried out using the method described in Section 8.3.2.3. The application of the above technique resulted in the selection of a radius calliper 0.23 (for per capita setting); and Gaussian kernel (bandwidth 0.14) (for per km\u00b2 setting) as the matching algorithms that guaranteed the minimization of a standardized bias (after matching).

Combined PSM and ATT estimator (conditional DID estimator) The application of the conditional DID estimator to a measurement of the programme impact at regional level (using programme intensity per capita basis as a criterion for programme participation) during the period 2002-20005 shows, as in the case of the per region indicator, an almost negligible effect of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall quality of life (DID in ATT = -0.0011) and rural unemployment (DID in ATT = 0.0006) in regions supported from the programme (see Table 10). These results differ from results obtained by applying traditional evaluation techniques (e.g. DID using a group of non- participants or the country average as respective controls), which showed a positive effect on RDI (i.e. 0.0069 or 0.0077) and a slightly positive impact on rural unemployment (i.e. -0.0007 and -0.0003).

Sensitivity of obtained results The sensitivity of obtained results was estimated using the procedure proposed in Rosenbaum (2002). The approach allows the determination of how much hidden bias would need to be present to render the null hypothesis of no effect, or in another words, how strongly an unmeasured variable must influence the selection process in order to undermine the implications of a standard (binary) propensity score matching analysis (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2005). The procedure applied in this study calculates Rosenbaum bounds for average treatment effects on the programme supported regions in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity (hidden bias) between treatment and control cases 25 . 25 The procedure calculates Wilcoxon signrank tests that give upper and lower bound estimates of significance levels at given levels of hidden bias. Under the assumption of additive treatment effects, rbounds also provides Hodges- Lehmann point estimates and confidence intervals for the average treatment effect on the treated (Gangl, M., in STATA 10.1; 2007). In the case of a per region basis, sensitivity analysis shows that the estimated positive effect of SAPARD (Measure 3) on rural unemployment is rather sensitive to unobservable heterogeneity (i.e. sensitive to possible deviations from the identifying unconfoundedness assumption). Indeed, an increase of gamma by 10% to \u0393 = 1.1 would result in insignificance of obtained results at the 10% significance level (sig + = 0.14 in 2002 and sig + = 0.16 in 2005). Of course, this result does not mean that unobserved heterogeneity exists and there is no effect of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on rural unemployment. This result only states that the confidence interval for the effect would include zero if an unobservable variable caused the odds ratio between regions supported from the programme and the control group to be higher than 1.1. In the case of per capita and per km\u00b2, estimated results are less sensitive, i.e. only a hidden bias increasing gamma to 1.2 (1.4) would lead to an insignificance of obtained results.

        "46 8 . R e s u l t s 8.9. Application of a generalized propensity score matching to the assessment of SAPARD\u2019s impact at regional level An important problem linked to the evaluation of programme impact using the binary PSM method, in a situation where almost all regions received a support from the given programme, is the small size or a non-availability of a control group (D=0). Depending on data, this problem can be partly solved within a framework of binary treatment (i.e. using the binary PSM method) by applying a threshold and considering regions experiencing low programme intensity (below the threshold) as programme non-supported regions (see Chapter 8.3 above) . However, beyond some uncertainties as to the appropriateness of a given threshold level, the application of the \u201cthreshold approach\u201d in combination with a traditional (i.e. binary) PSM method to the assessment of programme impact, may also not be particularly efficient as this framework largely disregards information normally available about the programme intensity (measured per region, per capita or km\u00b2 basis). Indeed, in order to learn more about the effectiveness of a given programme\u2019s dependence on the level of programme exposure (effectiveness dynamics) a more sophisticated approach has to be applied. If the level of programme support (i.e. exposure to programme participation) is a continuous variable (e.g. programme financial allocation by regions, per capita or per km\u00b2 ) a generalized propensity score matching (GPSM) methodology is especially advantageous. Especially interesting here is the possibility of the estimation of the average and marginal potential outcomes that correspond to specific values of continuous programme doses (i.e. for each level of programme support ) by means of a dose-response and derivative dose-response functions. Application of the GPSM methodology to an analysis of the impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) in Poland was carried out using information on a per region basis as a respective measure of programme intensity. The analytical steps are described in Chapter 4.7. 8.9.1. Estimation of GPS and dose response function Given that for each region i we observe a vector of specific regional covariates (X= f1- f17), the level of support (T) from the SAPARD programme (Measure 3), and the potential outcome corresponding to a given programme intensity level (Y(T)= RDI, rural unemployment, etc.) our basic objective is to estimate the average and the derivative of the dose-response function (ADRF) = \u03bc(t) and DDRF = v (t), where: \u03bc(t) = E [Y(T)] = the average effect of the programme in dependence on programme intensity; v(t) = E[Y(T+1)- Y(T)] = derivative dose response function, in dependence on programme intensity. As shown in Hirano and Imbens (2004) the conditional density of the treatment given covariates, the Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) has a balancing property similar to the balancing property of the propensity score for binary treatments. Adjusting for the GPS therefore removes all bias associated with differences in region specific covariates. In our study, region specific GPS was estimated as a conditional density of treatment (T) given covariates describing individual characteristics of the region (factors f1-f17). The parameters of the treatment function (conditional distribution of treatment) were estimated using maximum likelihood. The major steps and results of generalized propensity score estimation (programme intensity per region ) are described below. 8.9.1.1.

Calculation of the GPS and testing the balancing property Given region specific information on Ti, Xi as well as estimated under 8.9.1.1. parameters ( ^ y and \u03c3 ^2 the value of the GPS was calculated (evaluated) for each region according to eq 15. Having estimated the GPS, similar to the case of binary treatment, it is crucial to investigate whether the GPS specification is adequate, i.e. whether it balances the covariates (Hirano and Imbens, 2004; Bia and Mattei, 2007; Kluve, et al. 2007). In order to implement the balancing property tests we divided the range of programme intensity into four treatment intervals (i.e. less than 5m PLN per regions; 5-10m per region; 10-20m per region; 20-43m per region), with 169 observations in the first group, 90 in the second, 45 in the third, and 10 in the last treatment interval. Respective tests were carried out on the conditional mean of the pre-treatment variables given the generalized propensity score is not different between regions that belong to a particular treatment interval and regions that belong to all other treatment intervals. The balancing tests were performed for each single variable included in the list of covariates and each mean treatment interval. According to a standard two-sided t-test we found that in all treatment intervals the balancing property was satisfied at a level lower than 0.01, thus the covariates in both groups of regions were not significantly different (t-test for each of the 17 covariates and each four groups of intervals are shown in Appendix 1). 8.9.2. Modelling the conditional expectation of the programme outcome Given Ti and the estimated GPS (R i ) for each NUTS-4 regions, the conditional expectation of the programme outcome measured in terms of RDI (Y = \u2206 RDI) was modelled as a flexible function of its two arguments (T i and R i ) according to eq 17 (polynomial quadratic function). Y = b 0 + b 1 T + b 2 T\u00b2 + b 3 GPS + b 4 GPS\u00b2 + b 5 T*GPS (17) The results of this estimation, with the outcome variable representing the change of the overall level of rural development (i.e. RDI2005- RDI2002) and Ti, Ti square, Ri and Ri square as independent variables are shown in Table 13.

Estimation the average potential outcome for each level of treatment (entire dose- response function) Given the estimated individual conditional expectations of the programme outcome at the individual (regional) programme intensity levels, the entire dose-response function (DRF) was computed as the average potential outcome for each level of treatment according to eq. 16. After averaging the dose-response over propensity score for each level of T, the marginal causal effects were computed in the form of the derivative dose-response function E[Y(T+1) - Y(T)]. In our study bootstrapping methods were used to obtain standard errors that take into consideration the estimation of GPS and parameters of the estimated conditional expectation function. 8.10. Impact of SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development The results of the above calculations, together with the estimates of the derivative dose-response function that provides information about the marginal effects of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI) are shown in Table 14. A graphical presentation of obtained results (i.e. impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development) is shown in Figure 4. The application of the GPS matching and the dose response function to the assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development in regions supported by the programme (a change of the RDI as an impact indicator), enables a more precise estimation of the effects of the SAPARD programme when compared with traditional evaluation techniques or methodologies based on binary PSM methods.

        "50 8 . R e s u l t s The main findings from the application of the GPS matching and DRF are as follows: 1. Results from the GPS and dose response function generally show a positive effect of SAPARD (Measure 3) on the overall level of rural development in supported regions. However, they also show that this positive impact was observable only for regions supported from the programme at a higher intensity level (i.e. above approximately 17m PLN per region). Negligible programme effects were mainly found in regions with a low programme intensity (this only applies to regions that received less than 40% of the maximum support level, i.e. or lower than 80% of the average programme intensity). 2. An increase of the intensity of programme support ( per region basis) was found to bring about a significant increase of returns (positive change in the overall level of rural development or the RDI). 3. The highest effects of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) were found in those regions which received the highest programme support (i.e. regions which obtained from the programme between 20- 43m PLN from the programme). 4. Not surprisingly, taking into consideration a generally low absolute level of programme support, the marginal effectiveness of SAPARD funds (Measure 3) was found to be highest in regions that received absolute support far above an average support level. This shows that an expected threshold of programme intensity (rural investments) causing diminishing returns was well above the obtained maximum (i.e. above 43m PLN per NUTS-4 region). 5. For some reason (probably due to high unit costs of the programme), the effectiveness of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) in regions that received the smallest absolute support (i.e. less than \u20ac100k per region) appeared to be negative . 6. While the estimated dose response function shows a plausible causality between SAPARD funds (Measure 3) and the overall rural development, the estimated Figure 4: Poland: Estimated dose response function, treatment effect function and 95% confidence bands for the impact of SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on the RDI (criterion: per region) in years 2002-2005 ",

Impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on rural unemployment Another important outcome (impact) indicator that may be used to assess the effects of the SAPARD programme in regions that received programme support is the change in rural unemployment. In principle, all steps to assess the impact of SAPARD on rural unemployment are similar to those carried out for the assessment of the programme on the overall level of rural development. The only difference is the selection of the outcome indicator (i.e. a change in rural unemployment ratio instead of a change in the RDI). The results of the application of GPS and a dose response function methodology (including derivative dose-response function) to the evaluation of SAPARD impact on rural unemployment are shown in Table 15. Graphical results of SAPARD impact on rural unemployment are presented in Figure 5. The main findings from the application of GPS matching and dose response (and derivative dose response) functions to the measurement of the effects of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on rural unemployment in Poland (years 2002- 2005) are as follows: 1. The SAPARD programme (Measure 3) was found to have a slight but positive effect on rural unemployment in NUTS-4 regions in Poland (years 2002-2005), i.e. rural unemployment was found to decrease slightly due to the SAPARD programme (the results of GPS were lower compared with the effects estimated by using a binary PSM method). 2. Also, as in the case of the RDI, the impact of the SAPARD programme (Measure 3) on rural unemployment was found to be highest in those regions that received the maximum programme support (above 20m PLN per region). 3. The impact of SAPARD (Measure 3) on rural unemployment in regions that received the lowest amount of funds from the programme was found to be almost zero (or negative). 4. With regard to marginal effects of the SAPARD programme on rural unemployment, these were positive at all programme intensity levels. Yet, the size of these effects was found to be relatively small and the estimated marginal effects remained almost constant along with the increase of programme intensity. 5. While the estimated dose response function shows a plausible causality between SAPARD funds (Measure 3) and the diminution of rural unemployment, the estimated 95% confidence intervals become wider along with the intensity of treatment (programme impacts become more uncertain).

Assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia 9.1. Rural Development Index as an impact outcome indicator An important impact indicator applied to the assessment of the overall impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia is the Rural Development Index (RDI). The RDI in Slovakia was calculated for all (72) rural NUTS-4 regions and the years 2002- 2005 according to eq 7, on the basis of 337 regional indicators (21 region- and time-specific factors) and weights obtained from the estimated migration function. Territorial distribution of the RDI in Slovakia (by NUTS-4 regions) over the period 2002-2005 is shown in Figure 6 (below). During the years 2002-2005, the estimated value of the RDI in Slovakia ranged from -0.51 to +0.91 (i.e. the regional discrepancies in the overall level of rural development were stronger in Slovakia than in Poland). As expected, the highest values of the RDI (i.e. highest development level of rural areas) were found in high performing regions located in West Slovakia (e.g. Senec, Pezinok, Dunajska Streda, Galanta, etc.). On the other hand the lowest RDI values (i.e. the lowest level of the overall rural development) were found in regions located in Eastern Slovakia and Central Slovakia (e.g. Gelnica, Stropkov, Namestovo, Kezmarok, Stara Lubovna). The results obtained therefore confirm a clear typographic division of Slovakia into western, central and eastern sub-areas based on the performance of individual regions, and reiterate a general opinion that the level of rural development in Slovakia decreases considerably from West to East.

Regional characteristics as the main covariates determining selection of the region to the SAPARD programme As mentioned before, the estimation of the RDI in Slovakia was carried out on the basis of 21 region- and time-specific factors , obtained by applying a principal component method to 337 regional specific coefficients describing various aspects of rural development. Application of the above methodology enabled the description of individual rural regions (a unique identification) in terms of their socio-economic and environmental characteristics (factors f1-f21). The overview of the main individual regional characteristics (factors) and their estimated social weights is shown in Table 16. In the case of EU rural development programmes, the decision to select a particular region to a given structural or rural development programme is normally taken by a respective national Programme Managing Authority; this decision is made on the basis of strengths and weaknesses analysis (SWOT 26 ). While SWOT analysis is a subjective assessment of a current situation in a given region, it draws upon regional data, including various partial socio-economic and environmental indicators. Here we apply a similar procedure in order to simulate a selection process of a given region to the SAPARD programme. I.e. by explaining a regional specificity and individual regional performance in terms of factors (f1-f21) we consider implicitly all important partial coefficients that are usually accounted for in a SWOT analysis. Following this approach, factors (f1-f21), representing individual regional characteristics in the years 2002-2005, are used later (i.e. in estimation of a logit model or within a framework of generalized propensity score matching) as the main covariates explaining differences in regional performance and the probability of selection of an individual region into a specific rural development programme (e.g. SAPARD programme). 26 SWOT is an acronym for Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threads analysis.

Scope and distribution of funds from the SAPARD programme in Slovakia Estimation of the impact of the SAPARD programme at regional basis requires information about regional distribution and intensity of total SAPARD funds (i.e. Measures 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) between the years 2002-2004. The implementation of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia resulted in the support of approximately 904 projects for a total amount of 4745m SKK funds (\u20ac111.5m). The majority of SAPARD funds were allocated to the Priority 1 \u201cImproving of agricultural production sector including food industry\u201d (61% of total SAPARD funds), e.g. investment projects in the agricultural and food industry sectors. This was followed by Priority 2 \u201cSustainable rural development\u201d (38%), e.g. diversification and investment in rural infrastructure; agro-tourism projects or environmental projects. Funds for priority 3 \u201cDevelopment of human activities\u201d, e.g. technical assistance (1%), were allocated last. A statistical analysis of SAPARD distribution by regions indicates a high variability of programme support intensity (see Table 17). While an average region (NUTS-4) in Slovakia received approx. 64.1m SKK from the SAPARD programme, some regions (e.g. Nitra region in West Slovakia) received more than 254m SKK (four times more than the country average). On the other hand, some other regions received only 0.1m SKK (\u20ac25k), e.g. the Poltar region in Middle Slovakia.

A s s e s s m e n t o f t h e i m p a c t o f t h e S A P A R D p r o g r a m m e i n S l o v a k i a The geographical distribution of SAPARD funds (per region basis) across NUTS-4 regions shows that, contrary to some expectations, the majority of available programme resources were allocated to the best developed regions of West Slovakia (55% of total funds or 95.8m SKK per region) followed by Middle Slovakia (24% of total funds or 45.1m SKK per region) and Eastern Slovakia (21% of total funds or 44.9m SKK per region). A similar picture was obtained when considering SAPARD intensity on a per capita basis, i.e. the highest programme intensity was measured in the best developed regions located in West Slovakia (1135 SKK per capita =100%), followed by Middle Slovakia (69%) and Eastern Slovakia (65%). An analysis of the geographical distribution of SAPARD therefore shows, that programme funds were merely used to reinforce the market position of relatively well performing Slovak enterprises (i.e. mostly large agricultural farms and food industry companies) located in relatively well developed regions 27 . While the most developed regions were primarily able to apply for and accommodate the majority of funds available from the SAPARD programme successfully, our analysis confirms this development by showing a significant (at 0.05 level) positive correlation (0.43) between the intensity of programme support (measured per region basis) and the overall level of rural development measured in terms of the RDI (Table 18) 28 . 27 These companies were also the most effective in submission of well-designed project proposals. 28 Also when calculating at per capita basis, the intensity of SAPARD funds was found to be significantly (at 0.05 level) and positively correlated with the overall level of rural development (yet, correlation was much lower =0.24).

Approaches for assessment of the impact of SAPARD programme An analysis of the allocation of total SAPARD funds\u2019, in Slovakia shows that all NUTS-4 rural regions in the period 2002- 2004 were, to some extent, supported (at least by one of 1-7 measures) from the SAPARD programme. However, the distribution of an individual (regional) intensity to programme exposure was highly skewed. In many cases the intensity of programme support (per region) was almost negligible (e.g. Poltar, Turcianskie Teplice, etc.). In 42% of Slovak regions the total programme support was lower than 66% of an average support measured per capita basis (i.e. lower than 600 SKK per capita, compared with 904 SKK per capita in regions\u2019 average). With regard to the regional distribution of programme support linked to individual programme measures (1-7), the picture is slightly different. That is to say, in all examined cases (applies to each individual measure) the support from the SAPARD programme embraced only a subset of all NUTS-4 regions (i.e. in no single case did the programme support linked to a specific SAPARD measure embrace all Slovak regions). Additionally, many Slovak regions obtained the support from individual SAPARD measures that was below 66% of the country average (for a given measure). Taking into consideration the above situation, the assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme was carried out using two complementary approaches: \u2022 Approach 1 (based on the binary PSM matching method) allowed the estimation of the effectiveness of the programme support by comparing regions that: a) received support from the programme with equivalent regions that did not receive any support from SAPARD, or b) received programme support above a certain threshold (e.g. above 66% of country\u2019s average) with those where programme intensity was much below the country average. This approach was applied basically to the assessment of the impact of individual programme\u2019s measures. \u2022 Approach 2 (based on the application of the generalized propensity score matching and dose-response function), allowed the estimation of the impact of the total support from the SAPARD programme at various programme support levels. This approach was applied mainly to the assessment of the impact of total funds from the SAPARD programme (i.e. where all regions were supported). 9.5. Application of a binary PSM matching to the assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia 9.5.1. Total SAPARD funds (all measures) The application of Approach 1, including the setting of the threshold (66% of the country average per capita), resulted in the division of all NUTS-4 regions into two groups: a) 42 regions where support obtained from the SAPARD programme was above the threshold (600 SKK per capita), and b) 30 regions \u201cnon-SAPARD Table 18: Slovakia: Correlation matrix between intensity of SAPARD (per region basis) and the RDI RDI 2002 SAPARD funds (total) RDI 2002 1.0000 SAPARD funds (total) 0.4303* 1.0000 ",

Comparison of these two groups of regions (applying 600 SKK per capita as a threshold) reveals significant differences in all major regional characteristics (factors 1-21) determining both the selection of individual regions into the programme as well as the effect of the SAPARD programme (Table 19). The most obvious differences, except of the overall level of rural development (the RDI was much higher in the programme supported group D=1 compared with non-supported regions D=0), concern factors f4 (Agriculture and natural endowment, with a much higher intensity level in group D=1 compared with group D=0), f3 (Social conditions and living environment (incl. availability of dwelling; with a much higher level of endowment in group D=1 compared with D=0), f16 (Primary schools; with a much higher density level in group D=1 compared with D=0), and f1 (Spatial density of social and retail infrastructure (per km\u00b2); with a much lower level in group D=1 compared with D=0). In summary, the analysis shows that the huge majority of SAPARD funds were targeted to regions that as a whole were: a) strongly agriculture oriented, b) characterized by relatively good social conditions (including endowments with primary schools) and living environment (including dwellings), and c) exhibited a high level of rurality (i.e. lower spatial density of social and retail infrastructure) compared to regions with a low intensity of programme support. 29 In fact by dividing NUTS-4 regions into two groups (\u201csupported\u201d vs. \u201cnon-supported\u201d regions) using above criterion we disregard the potential impact of very small SAPARD projects (i.e. below 333 thousand EUR per region). Significant differences in socio-economic and environmental characteristics of programme supported and non-supported regions prove that any direct comparisons of selected impact indicators in regions supported by the programme with respective impact indicators in non- supported regions would result in a considerable selectivity bias and thus unreliable results. The next step of the analysis aimed therefore at assessing the impact of the SAPARD programme by comparing the situation in regions supported by the SAPARD programme with a similar regions that were non-supported by the programme (thus enabling disentangling effects of the programme from other confounding factors). This was done separately for all individual SAPARD measures . Firstly, appropriate ( measure specific ) control groups were selected (e.g. selecting non-supported regions that, in terms of their characteristics, were not statistically different from the group of supported regions). Secondly, by calculating ATT indicators and applying a conditional DID method (i.e. combining ATT with DID) to the assessment of SAPARD\u2019s impact on the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI) and rural unemployment. Thirdly, by computing ATE and ATU policy indicators showing the potential effectiveness of the extension of the SAPARD programme to other regions; and fourthly, by assessing the sensitivity of obtained results (impact of hidden bias).

The results of the logit estimation (all SAPARD measures) for total SAPARD measures are shown in Table 20.

Selection of matching algorithms and testing balancing property Given the considerable differences between individual characteristics (factors f1-21) in supported and non-supported groups of regions the binary PSM matching was applied in order to find appropriate controls. The binary PSM method balances the observed covariates between the supported group and a control group based on the similarity of their predicted probabilities of receiving support (e.g. above the threshold) from the SAPARD programme. Implementing common support conditions ensures that any combination of characteristics observed in the treatment group can also be observed among the control group. In our study a common support region was imposed on both sides, i.e. by dropping treatment observations whose estimated propensity scores is higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum propensity score of the controls and vice versa (i.e. dropping control observations whose estimated propensity score is higher than maximum or lower than minimum propensity score of the treated) 30 .

For programme participation measured on a per capita basis (all SAPARD measures above a threshold 600 SKK per capita), imposition of the common support condition resulted in disregarding 35 \u201cnon-comparable\u201d regions 31 (i.e. 15 non-supported regions and 20 programme supported regions), a selection of comparable 22 regions supported by the SAPARD programme, and 15 control regions (Table 21). As the probability of observing two units with exactly the same value of propensity score is, in principle, zero, an estimation of programme effects requires using appropriate matching algorithms. The latter define the measure of proximity in order to define programme non- participants who are acceptably close (e.g. in terms of the propensity score) to any given programme participant. Given that the choice of both matching method (e.g. nearest neighbour (NN) matching, calliper matching, Gaussian kernel matching, Epanechnikov matching, etc) and selection of an appropriate matching parameter (e.g. number of nearest neighbours in NN matching, radius size in calliper matching, bandwidth size in Gaussian or Epanechnikov matching, etc.) can make a difference in small samples, and the quality of a given matching technique depends strongly on a dataset, the 31 Outside of the imposed common support area selection of a relevant matching technique in our study was carried out using the following three criteria: i) standardized bias (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); ii) t\u2013test (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985); and iii) joint significance and pseudo R\u00b2 (Sianesi, 2004). Given the above criteria, the best results concerning selection of an appropriate matching algorithm were achieved by applying a two-step selection procedure. Firstly, by scaling respective matching parameters within each matching algorithm (e.g. the number of neighbours in the nearest neighbour algorithm; size of calliper in calliper matching; size of bandwidth in kernel Gaussian; size of bandwidth in kernel Epanechnikov, etc.) and applying a linear search to find those matching parameters under each matching algorithm that minimize the estimated standardized bias 32 (after matching). Secondly, by searching across all considered matching algorithms and applying the min{min} criterion as the main final selection option. In all cases (i.e. various matching algorithms) 33 an optimal solution could easily be found due to local/global convexity of the objective function with respect to adjusted matching parameters (e.g. radius magnitude 32 The standardized bias is the difference of the sample means in the treated and non-treated (full or matched) sub-samples as a percentage of the square root of the average of the sample variances in the treated and non- treated groups (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985). 33 This does not apply to local linear weighting function matching which first smoothes the outcome and then performs nearest neighbor matching. In this case more controls are used to calculate the counterfactual outcome than the nearest neighbor only (Leuven and Sianesi, 2007).

An overview of results from the selection procedure involving various matching algorithms is provided in Table 22. By applying the above selection procedure to our data (conditional regional participation in the SAPARD programme given covariates f1- f21) we found that a kernel matching (Gaussian bandwidth (0.28)) was that one that ensured the minimization of the standardized selection bias (after matching) and thus the highest reduction of selection bias, and at the same time satisfaction of both the balancing property test (t-test) as well as pseudo R\u00b2 tests (see Tables 23 and 24). The balancing property test shows that, compared with the situation prior to the matching, application of the above matching procedure led to the selection of an appropriate control group of regions (performed t-tests confirmed the elimination of all significant differences between individual regional characteristics in both groups of regions and therefore significant reduction of the selection bias). This applies both to the differences in the RDI and all important variables (factors) determining both programme participation and programme outcomes, e.g. F4 (Agriculture and natural endowment), F1 (Spatial density of social and retail infrastructure (per km\u00b2), F6 (Spatial density of public utilities and social infrastructure, gas pipelines, water-supply- system (per km\u00b2), F9 (Hotels and recreation facilities), etc. Also other tests, e.g. pseudo R\u00b2 (pseudo R\u00b2 = 0.43 before matching and pseudo R\u00b2= 0.23 after matching) fully confirmed the applicability of the above approach (Table 24).

Calculation of policy evaluation parameters (ATT, ATE, ATU) A comprehensive assessment of a programme\u2019s impact requires separation of various programme effects of which the most important are: a) effect on regions which participated in a given programme (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated - ATT); b) effect on an average region randomly selected from the pool of programme participants and non- participants (Average Treatment Effect \u2013 ATE) and c) effect of the programme on the regions which did not participate (Average Treatment Effect on the Untreated \u2013 ATU). In our study, the above policy evaluation parameters (ATT, ATE, and ATU) were calculated on the basis of the estimated propensity scores using the following impact indicators: a. The RDI b. Unemployment (absolute values) c. Unemployment (per capita) The results of ATT, ATE and ATU calculations are shown in Table 25. Given these parameters the programme impact was quantified using a conditional DID estimator , i.e. combining PSM (ATT, ATE, and ATU) and difference in differences (DID) methods. 9.5.5. Conditional DID estimator Application of the conditional DID estimator to the assessment of the programme impact at the regional level shows that the overall impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia on the level of regional development, as well as on rural unemployment, were negligible.

This means that the impact of the SAPARD programme on a general performance (overall level of rural development and unemployment) in well-developed Slovak regions was negligible. 9.6. Impact of SAPARD programme (by measures) A slightly differentiated picture concerning the effectiveness of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia was obtained by carrying out an estimation of the programme\u2019s impact at individual measures basis (Table 26). Our results show that out of 1-7 measures examined, only two individual SAPARD measures (i.e. Measure 1: investment in agricultural enterprises, and Measure 6: Agricultural production methods designed to protect the environment and maintain the countryside) contributed positively to the overall level of rural development in supported regions (measured in terms of the RDI). On the other hand, the implementation of the measure M5 (Forestry) was found to be highly ineffective (the RDI was negatively affected) 34 .

Out of 35 contracted projects in the forestry sector two major projects (approximately 16 Mill SKK) were suspended due to bankruptcy of contracted forest enterprises. Average amount per project under Measure 5 was the lowest from all average project costs under other measures. No result indicators under Measure 5 set in the RDP plan were monitored.

A s s e s s m e n t o f t h e i m p a c t o f t h e S A P A R D p r o g r a m m e i n S l o v a k i a In terms of the impact of SAPARD measures on rural unemployment, Measures 4a, 4b, 5, and 7 were found to have a positive impact on the reduction of rural unemployment (measured both in absolute terms and per capita basis). Measure 4a had an especially positive impact on the reduction of rural unemployment (Investments not involving infrastructure) that was mainly focused on support of local agro-tourist facilities. On the other hand, due to the introduction of technological advancements, implementation of SAPARD measures M1 (investment in agricultural enterprises), M2 (investment in food processing) and M6 (environmental investments) had a negative impact on unemployment, i.e. the above measures were found to lead to an increase of rural unemployment. 9.7. Assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme using a generalized propensity score and dose-response function approach The application of a generalized propensity score matching and dose-response function approach is particularly advantageous if the huge majority of regions, or all regions, are subject to support from the programme (low number or no D=0). Additionally, the GPS approach allows questions relating to marginal programme effects to be answered (by linking programme impacts to the level of programme intensity). Application of the GPSM methodology to the analysis of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia was carried out using information about programme intensity on a per region and per capita basis. The four main steps were: a) estimation of the treatment function; b) calculation of the GPS and carrying out balancing tests; c) modelling conditional expectations of the programme outcome; and d) calculation of the dose-response and derivative dose-response functions. 9.7.1. Estimation of the treatment function Given regional individual covariates (f1-f21) and the regional levels of programme intensity (per capita) the conditional treatment function was estimated according to a modified eq. 14 Where: X = covariates (f1-f21) Ln_t = logarithm of programme intensity per capita level Results of the estimation of the conditional treatment function are shown in Tables 26a and 26b.

Calculation of GPS and balancing property tests Obtained estimates (9.7.1.) were used to calculate region specific propensity scores (prior to the programme) according to eq 15. Testing of the balancing properties for covariates was performed using a method proposed in Hirano and Imbens (2004), i.e. by blocking on both the treatment variables (e.g. programme intensity per capita) and on the estimated GPS. Given GPS and various intensity levels of the SAPARD programme support per region (on per capita basis), the balancing property test (t-test) was carried out for all variables f1-f21 in pre-specified blocks of GPS (=2) and programme intensity levels (=3), i.e. by testing if for each GPS block the covariate means of regions belonging to the group of the particular intensity level of programme support are significantly different from those of regions with a different intensity level of support, but similar GPS level. The results of the t-tests developed in Bia and Mattei (2007) showed that balancing property was satisfied for all variables, GPS blocks and intensity levels. 9.7.3. Modelling the conditional expectation of the programme outcome and dose- response function Given Ti and estimated GPS (Ri) for each of the NUTS-4 regions in Slovakia, the conditional expectation of the programme outcome measured in terms of the RDI (Y = \u2206 RDI) was modelled as a flexible function of its two arguments (Ti and Ri) according to eq (18) (polynomial quadratic function). Results of estimated the conditional expectation of the outcome function <E[Y(t)]> are shown in Table 27.

Imbens, 2004), the estimated regression function is later used to estimate of the causal effects of the SAPARD programme (average programme effects and marginal outcome of programme support at particular level T). The dose-response function (DRF) was computed as the average potential outcome for each level of treatment according to eq 16. The marginal programme effects were estimated means a derivative dose-response function E[Y(t+1) - Y(t)]. The bootstrap methods were applied to obtain standard errors that take into account the estimation of GPS and the parameters of the estimated conditional expectation of the outcome function. Results of the estimated dose- response and derivative dose-response function are shown in Table 28. Application of the GPS and the dose- response function to the assessment of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Slovakia primarily confirms the results obtained by using the binary PSM method, i.e. it proves that the impact of SAPARD measures (total funds) on the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI) across Slovak regions was generally negligible (or negative), except for those regions which received programme support between 260-780 SKK per capita (positive dose- response function). Apparently, the positive impact on the overall level of rural development (measured in terms of the RDI) of two SAPARD measures M6 (Agricultural production methods designed to protect environment and maintain the countryside) and M1 (modernization of agricultural enterprises), could not overcompensate some negative effects stemming from implementation of other SAPARD measures, especially M5 (forestry). More positive impacts of all SAPARD measures were found on a reduction of rural unemployment. Obviously, reduction of the number of unemployed caused by measures M4a (Investments not involving infrastructure, mainly in agro-tourism), M7 (Land improvement and re-parcelling), M4b (Investments in rural infrastructure not bringing substantial revenues) and M5 (forestry) overcompensated an increase of unemployment caused by measures: M1 (Investment in agricultural enterprises), M2 (Improving the processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products, mainly investment in food industry), and M6 (Agricultural production methods designed to protect environment and maintain the countryside). Our results show that in those regions that received programme support between 259- 1573 SKK per capita, the impact of the SAPARD programme on rural unemployment was positive (i.e. SAPARD funds contributed to a reduction in the number of unemployed persons). While the highest reduction of rural unemployment was found in regions with programme intensity in the range between 402-998 SKK per capita, the effectiveness of the programme intensity above 2280 SKK per capita (the highest support level) and those below 90 SKK per capita (i.e. the lowest support level) was found to be negative (i.e. in those regions the SAPARD programme contributed to an increase in the number of unemployment persons).

Aggregated effects of a given RD programme at regional levels were estimated using the Rural Development Index (RDI) \u2013 a proxy describing the overall quality of life in individual rural areas. The weights of economic, social and environmental domains entering the RDI index (composite indicator) were derived empirically from the econometrically estimated intra- and inter-regional migration function after selecting the \u201cbest\u201d model from various alternative model specifications (e.g. panel estimate logistic regression nested error structure model, spatial effect models, etc). The impacts of individual RD measures were analysed by means of a counterfactual analysis by applying combination of the binary Propensity Score Matching (PSM) (e.g. Kernel matching) and difference-in-differences (DID) methods (i.e. by comparing supported regions and matched control group, prior to the programme and after it). Evaluation of programme effects (by programme measures) at regional level is carried out on the basis of the estimated policy parameters: Average Treatment Effects (ATE), Average Treatment on Treated (ATT) and Average Treatment on Untreated (ATU) effects by using the RDI Index and unemployment ratios as impact indicators. Given information on regional intensity to programme exposure (financial input flows by regions) the overall impact of obtained support via a given RD programme was estimated by means of a dose-response function and derivative dose- response function within the framework of a generalized propensity score matching (GPS). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis (Rosenbaum bounds) was carried out in order to assess a possible influence of unobservables on obtained results (under a binary PSM methodology). Above methodologies were empirically applied to evaluation of the impact of the SAPARD programme in Poland and Slovakia in years 2002-2005 at NUTS-4 level. Our results show that the application of the GPS and the dose response function to the assessment of the impact of a given RD programme using the RDI combined with other partial indicators as an impact measure enables a more precise estimation of the effects of the given programme, compared with traditional \u201cnaive\u201d evaluation techniques or methodologies based on binary PSM methods. The major advantages from applying the RDI as an impact indicator in the framework of a generalized propensity score approach to the evaluation of RD programmes are as follows: \u2022 The approach allows for considering of all potential effects of a given RD programme (aggregated or separated by programme measures) on various rural development domains (economic, social, environmental, etc.) and on the overall quality of life of population living in individual rural areas. \u2022 The approach incorporates (implicitly) numerous general equilibrium effects of a programme, e.g. multiplier effects, substitution effects, into the analysis. \u2022 While the weights applied into the construction of the RDI represent society\u2019s valuation of endowments and socio- economic trends observable at local/regional levels (estimated weights are representative for society as whole i.e. reflect both the decision of the migrating population and of the population that stays in the region) an application of the above weighting system allows for a more comprehensive assessment ",

Especially promising is the possibility of the estimation of the average and marginal potential outcomes that correspond to specific values of continuous programme doses (i.e. for each level of programme support) by means of a dose-response and derivative dose-response functions. Here, programme impacts are linked to the level of programme intensity. \u2022 An essential advantage of the proposed methodology is that GPS method eliminates (or at least substantially reduces) selection bias and allows to estimate individual programme effects not only in \u201caverage\u201d terms, but also for different programme support intensity levels (!). \u2022 The above evaluation methodology permits testing a number of common stipulations, e.g. positive effect of a given policy on various indicators of regional performance, e.g. employment, labour productivity, environmental and social indicators, etc. \u2022 The major weakness is that the above method requires an abundant and good quality data (available at regional levels) and considerable technical skills on side of its users (e.g. programme evaluators). Clearly, the above methodology is highly applicable both for analysis of effects of RD as well as structural programmes at a regional level, and is powerful both at the aggregated level (e.g. NUTS 2) as well as NUTS 3 or NUTS 4 levels.
