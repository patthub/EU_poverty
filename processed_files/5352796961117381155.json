        "2 nature and biodiversity newsletter | February 2017 On 16 December, after a rigorous two-year assessment, the Commission concluded that the EU Habitats and Birds Directives are fit for purpose, but their implementation needs to be better and more uniform. The decision came in the wake of extensive consultations with citizens and stakeholders across all 28 EU Member States. These Directives are vital for Europe\u2019s nature, so improving their implementation will now become a top priority. The main challenges identified during the assessment relate to inadequate investment and insufficient management of the Natura 2000 network. Deficiencies at local levels were also singled out, from delays in authorisations and from burdensome project permits, to poor management of individual species and low levels of stakeholder engagement. The connections between the sites in the network need to be improved, if biodiversity and ecosystem services are to be maintained and restored in the wider landscape. Last but not least, the evaluation showed that we need to link the Directives\u2019 implementation with broader socio-economic objectives, including in EU policy areas such as energy, agriculture and fisheries. The Commission is now developing an Action Plan to address these implementation gaps, expected in spring 2017. We will improve the involvement of regional and local authorities and boost the involvement of those who live and work in these areas. The fitness check generated a huge amount of citizen engagement, with half a million citizens submitting their views. The Action Plan will build on this solid base and we will make sure citizens have further chances to be involved in the management of Natura 2000 sites. In this we will be helped by the new EU Solidarity Corps which will allow young people to gain invaluable on-site experience, including in working on conservation and restoration projects within Natura 2000. Strengthened implementation will also help the EU to deliver on global biodiversity commitments. At the UN Biodiversity Conference in Canc\u00fan, Mexico in December 2016, the EU and its Member States confirmed that we would highlight biodiversity considerations in policies for agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism. The Conference decisions on integrating a concern for nature into all other relevant policies should help the world achieve its global biodiversity targets by 2020. We can also go a long way to delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals and driving global action on climate change.

It concludes that, within the framework of broader EU biodiversity policy, the Nature Directives are fit for purpose. But achieving their objectives and realising their full potential will depend on substantial improvement in their implementation, in relation to both effectiveness and efficiency, working in partnership with different stakeholder communities in the Member States and across the EU, to deliver practical results on the ground. Fitness Check objective The nature Fitness Check represents the most comprehensive evaluation of the Nature Directives ever undertaken. It was initiated in October 2013 as part of a wider review of the implementation of EU legislation and policy under the Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT). Fitness checks provide an evidence-based critical analysis of whether EU actions are proportionate to their objectives and delivering as expected. They cover environmental, economic and social aspects, and concern all EU policy areas. Five specific criteria were used to assess whether the nature directives are still fit for purpose: effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence, and EU added value. Supported by a study contract, the Commission undertook extensive consultation to gather and assess relevant information from a wide range of different sources at both EU and Member State level. This included an online public consultation in mid-2015 which was designed to gather the views of Europe\u2019s citizens and stakeholders on this important topic. Strongly influenced by campaigns, over 550 000 people submitted replies, making it the public consultation EU nature legislation brings significant added value since it allows countries to work together across political boundaries. Currently, Natura 2000 covers more than 18% of the EU\u2019s land surface and 6% of the EU\u2019s marine surface ",
        "4 nature and biodiversity newsletter | February 2017 444 with the highest response rate ever received by the Commission. This testifies to the strength of interest and emotion the Directives generate amongst Europe\u2019s citizens, even in this time of economic uncertainty. The resulting analysis brought together a substantial body of evidence aimed at identifying changes that could logically be attributed to the intervention of the Directives. Effectiveness The evaluation of effectiveness focused on assessing the extent to which the objectives of the two Directives have been achieved, and any significant factors that may have contributed to or inhibited progress towards meeting those objectives. The Fitness Check confirmed that the general objectives of the Directives have not yet been met and it is not possible to predict when they will be fully achieved. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence to show that the status and trends of species and habitats protected by the Directives would be significantly worse in their absence. Moreover, where there are targeted actions at a sufficient scale, improvements in the status of species and habitats have clearly taken place. The issue of scale emerges several times in the evaluation. Despite being a catalyst for increased funding for nature, improved stakeholder awareness and engagement, as well as strengthened knowledge and sharing of experience, the Directives have nevertheless fallen short of their objectives because the actions undertaken in these areas have not yet taken place at a sufficient scale. The effectiveness of the Directives has been hindered in particular by delays in the establishment of the Natura 2000 network and in putting in place the necessary conservation measures for the management and restoration of the sites. Consequently, the network has not been able to deliver its full conservation and socio-economic potential, even if some significant progress has been made. Availability and targeting of funding, knowledge gaps, full stakeholder engagement, effective management of the Natura 2000 sites, policy integration and human resource constraints remain the most significant challenges. Efficiency The evaluation on efficiency examined whether the costs involved in implementation are reasonable and proportional to the benefits achieved. It concluded that the multiple benefits of the Directives, estimated for Natura 2000 at \u20ac 200\u2013300 billion per year, significantly exceed the cost of designating, protecting and managing the sites, which is estimated at over \u20ac5.8 billion annually across the EU. However, the socio-economic benefits of the many ecosystem services provided by Natura 2000 have not yet gained widespread policy recognition. There can also be a mismatch between those bearing the costs, such as landowners and developers and those benefitting, such as tourism and recreational bodies and society more generally, which has implications for the design of compensation and incentive schemes. Furthermore, the overall EU co-funding for Natura 2000 during the 2007\u20132013 period represented only 9\u201319% of the estimated financing needs and has not always been able to provide demonstrable results. National co-funding was unable to cover the remaining gap. On the other hand, the evaluation also concluded that the Directives do not create barriers to sustainable investments that are not damaging to the conservation values of the sites. The vast majority of proposed projects and plans falling within the Article 6 permitting procedures have been authorised. Delays in permitting procedures often result from a combination of factors including inadequate knowledge, difficulties in access to data and unnecessarily complex procedures at national level. But there is also a growing body of good practice on smart The socio-economic benefits of Natura 2000 have not yet gained widespread policy recognition.

        "5 nature and biodiversity newsletter | February 2017 5 5 implementation approaches such as early screening of plans, and streamlining of permitting procedures to help overcome these problems. Relevance The examination of relevance considered the extent to which the objectives and measures contained within the Nature Directives are consistent with the current needs of EU habitats and species. Evidence shows that the Directives continue to be relevant for tackling the key pressures on habitats and species. Their general and specific objectives remain valid, setting out what is to be achieved and leaving the responsibility for identifying and responding to specific threats to the Member States. Differences of views have been expressed on the current need to update the Annexes to the Directives. In the end, the Commission concluded that the Annexes in their current form provide an adequate level of protection to enable the objectives of the Directives to be met. Although the Directives do not fully cover all taxonomic groups, available studies indicate that the Natura 2000 network, through its \u2018umbrella effect\u2019, covers a high proportion of species of conservation concern beyond those listed in the Annexes. Coherence The analysis on coherence looked for evidence of synergies or inconsistencies between the Directives and other EU policies which are expected to work together, such as other EU environmental directives and EU sectoral policies affecting land and water use. Overall, it was concluded that the Nature Directives are coherent with each other but there is continued need to promote implementation solutions that optimise the attainment of their conservation objectives while having full regard to the socio-economic context in which they operate, working with different stakeholder communities. Other environmental directives are also considered to be consistent and complementary with the Nature Directives, although experience highlights the need and value for improved co-ordination, in particular as regards monitoring and reporting with a view to collecting data once for multiple purposes and reducing burden. As to other sectoral EU policies, there are examples of competing objectives, including in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and, given its continuing decline, greater efforts will be needed to conserve and enhance biodiversity associated with agriculture, through a more effective integration with the CAP. EU added value The analysis of the Directives\u2019 EU added value assessed whether action continues to be justified at the EU level and looked for changes that can reasonably be attributed to EU intervention. The evaluation found that there is broad recognition that the Directives have established a stronger and more consistent basis for protecting nature than existed in Europe before their adoption. The needs and rationale for EU level action through the Nature Directives remain valid also with a view to achieving the multiple ecosystem service benefits that they deliver to society. As the report reminds us, nature is a shared heritage of the Member States and effective management of natural resources needs to take place across political boundaries as the ranges of many species are dependent on suitable habitats and conditions being present simultaneously in several Member States. Different nature protection rules across the EU would also have lead to many diverse legal regimes for business. EU action has created a more consistent, fair and integrated approach to nature conservation and delivery of ecosystem services across the EU, generating opportunities while at the same time addressing transboundary concerns in line with international obligations. The Directives are \u2018framework legislation\u2019 whose detailed implementation is regulated through national/ regional law and decisions of national/regional/ local authorities supported by guidance and other EU level policy documents. The goals of the Directives continue to reflect the needs of nature conservation and sustainable use for nature, people and the economy although more efforts are needed to achieve them. Next steps The results of the Fitness check evaluation provide a solid and informed basis for follow up action. The findings have illustrated that the Directives, while remaining fully valid, require improved implementation through a modern approach capable of capturing the full potential and opportunities offered by the existing legislation. In light of these findings, the Commission is now preparing a follow up Action Plan that proposes a comprehensive set of measures to substantially improve the implementation of the two Directives in the coming years. The aim is to publish this in the first half of 2017, details of which will be provided in the next newsletter. Full details of the Fitness Check results are available on: http://ec.europa.eu/ environment/nature/legislation/ fitness_check/index_en.htm The rationale for EU-level action through the Nature Directives remains valid. \u00a9 A R C O / n a t u r e p l . c o m ",
        "6 nature and biodiversity newsletter | February 2017 66 UN Biodiversity Conference: Results from Canc\u00fan 66 In December 2016, delegates from 196 countries came together in Canc\u00fan, Mexico for the 13th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 13). With strong involvement of the EU and its Member States, the Conference adopted key decisions on a range of topics aimed at strengthening the implementation of the global Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020 and on creating synergies with the Sustainable Development Goals under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Canc\u00fan Declaration \u2013 mainstreaming biodiversity The main theme of the meeting was the integration (\u2018mainstreaming\u2019) of biodiversity into other sectors, with a particular focus on agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism. A two-day high-level meeting preceding the COP 13 brought together the relevant Ministers. It culminated in the adoption of the \u201cCanc\u00fan Declaration\u201d on mainstreaming the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. On this occasion, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) launched a new biodiversity platform to facilitate cross-sector dialogue on biodiversity and agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Furthermore, many countries announced concrete commitments and initiatives to achieve the global biodiversity targets. For example, 12 countries, led by The Netherlands, established a \u2018Coalition of the Willing on Pollinators\u2019 and committed to take actions, cooperate and learn from each other in order to protect pollinators. Strengthening implementation COP 13 adopted a short-term Action Plan on ecosystem restoration as well as decisions on a range of topics, such as protected areas, sustainable wildlife management, invasive alien species, climate change and financing. As regards marine issues, decisions were taken to encourage greater application of marine spatial planning, provide guidance on preventing and mitigating the impacts of marine debris, and to maintain and enhance the resilience of ecosystems in cold water areas in particular. Synthetic biology, digital sequence information and gene drives COP 13 also addressed a number of particularly sensitive topics, such as synthetic biology The 13th Meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in December 2016 in Canc\u00fan, Mexico. nature and biodiversity newsletter | February 2017 \u00a9 II S D / F r a n c i s D e j o n ( www . ii s d . c a / b i o d i v / c o p 13 / e n b / 7 d e c . h t m l ) The Early bumble-bee, Bombus pratorum . \u00a9 P e t e r C r ee d / n a t u r e b u r e a u \u2022 Globally, nearly 90% of wild flowering plants depend on pollinators \u2022 Pollinators have a crucial role in the food production process.

Rapid technological developments have facilitated enormously access to these genetic engineering techniques, but their potential implications for biodiversity are insufficiently known. COP 13 agreed to use a non-binding operational definition for synbio as a basis for further work. There were heated debates on the question whether DSI would fall under the CBD definition of \u2018genetic resources\u2019. If so, would this result in unworkable rules? If not, would that undermine the sharing of benefits arising from the utilisation of genetic resources? The Parties agreed on further fact-finding and consultations, in order to consider this issue in more detail at the next COP in 2018. The CBD Protocols Meetings of the two CBD Protocols, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing, took place at the same time as COP 13. As regards the Cartagena Protocol, the Parties took note of the Guidance on risk assessment for LMOs and decided on a framework for further work on their risk assessment as well as the identification of knowledge gaps and needs for further guidance. Two years after the entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol and with the signature of more than 90 governments, Parties agreed to a series of actions at the Canc\u00fan meeting to help its implementation reach cruising speed. They include an exchange of information on access regulations and compliance measures (through the \u2018ABS Clearing-House\u2019), and on capacity-building for such measures to be in line with the Protocol. Parties also agreed to further consider the need for a global multilateral benefit-sharing mechanism to complement the Protocol\u2019s default bilateral approach. Next steps With only four years left to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, it was generally recognised that efforts need to be stepped up. The Decisions adopted in Canc\u00fan, if properly followed up, will contribute to this. However, there remains a need for stronger commitment from all Parties and more effective tools for implementation of the current Strategic Plan 2011\u20132020. With this in mind, and looking further in the future, COP 13 requested the CBD Secretariat to prepare a detailed plan for the development of the post-2020 follow-up, including options for strengthening commitment and implementation. The next meeting of the Conference of Parties will be held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in 2018.

It is based on information officially transmitted by Member States up to February 2017 . The Natura 2000 network is composed of sites under the Habitats Directive (pSCI, SCIs or SACs \u2013 labelled \u2018SCIs\u2019 in the barometer) and sites under the Birds Directive (SPAs). The figures relating to the total area of Natura 2000 sites (i.e. SPAs + SCIs) have been obtained through GIS analysis. This avoids any risk of double counting sites which have been designated under both Directives. The sufficiency of sites under the Habitats Directive is determined by DG Environment, with the assistance of the European Topic Centre for Biological Diversity. For each Member State, the Commission assesses whether the species and habitat types on Annexes I and II, which are present in the country, are sufficiently represented by the sites designated to date. This is expressed as a percentage of species and habitats for which further areas need to be designated in order to complete the network in that country. A scientific reserve is given when further research is needed in order to identify the most appropriate sites to be added for a given species or habitat. The number of sufficiency assessments for a given Member State depends both on the number of biogeographical regions to which that Member State belongs, and on the number of habitats and species occurring on its territory in each of these regions. j Small increase in 2016 jj Moderate increase in 2016 jjj Substantial increase in 2016 ",

IuCN European Red List assessments funded by DG ENV. 11 Habitats. That is until now. In December 2016, following three years of ground-breaking work, the Commission published the first-ever European Red List assessment of all natural and semi-natural habitat types. The List provides a comprehensive overview of the character, extent and conservation status of some 490 marine, terrestrial and freshwater habitat types occurring in Europe at two geographic levels: for the EU28 countries and for Europe as a whole (i.e. the EU28 plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, the remaining Balkan countries and their neighbouring seas). Methodology At the start of the process, a common habitat typology was developed following the recommendations of a feasibility study financed by the Commission in 2012, which also advised on the most appropriate assessment criteria, level of assessment, and data sources to be used. The habitat typology is based on the EUNIS Classification but adjusted to take account of the fact that some EUNIS 3 or 4 level units are unhelpfully large and complex (such as broadleaved deciduous woodlands and the coniferous woodlands) or too broadly defined in terms of their ecological variation and biodiversity (such as dry grasslands or pelagic habitats). Data was subsequently collected from individual countries on the current area of habitat, trend in quantity (over 50 years), trend in quality (over 50 years), long-term and future trends, pressures and threats, and conservation measures. In total, around 300 experts from 33 countries contributed to the process. Once the data was assimilated, the conservation status of each habitat was then assessed using a modified version of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria. In total, eight Categories and five Criteria were identified for assessing the risk of habitat collapse, as a measure of degree of threat. nature and biodiversity newsletter | February 2017 \u00a9 B e r n a r d C a s t e l e i n / n a t u r e p l . c o m IuCN Red List Categories and Criteria.

        "12 nature and biodiversity newsletter | February 2017 Part I. Marine habitats The marine assessment covers the four marine regions of Europe: Baltic Sea, North-East Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Within these marine regions, the assessment includes the marine waters of the EU28 and those of neighbouring states of southern Norway, Russia in the Baltic, and non-EU countries bordering the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. 257 benthic (seabed) marine habitats were assessed, ranging from those occurring on the coast down to 200 m depth and up to 200 nautical miles offshore. In total, 19% (EU28) and 18% (EU28+) of the evaluated habitats are assessed as threatened in the categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable. An additional 12% are Near Threatened in the EU28 and 11% in the EU28+. These figures would be twice as high had the Data Deficient habitats been excluded. The percentage of threatened habitat types differs across the regional seas. The highest proportion occurs in the Mediterranean Sea (32%), followed by the North-East Atlantic (23%), the Black Sea (13%) and then the Baltic Sea (8%). The most frequently cited pressures resulting from human activities on benthic marine habitats are similar across the four regional seas. These are pollution (principally nutrient enrichment leading to eutrophication), biological resource use (essentially fishing), natural system modifications (for example dredging and sea defence works), urbanisation and climate change. It is clear that a large proportion of marine habitats are still Data Deficient (49% EU28 / 53% EU28+), but, thanks to the Red List assessment process, a substantial body of useful information has been collected on these little-studied habitats to support their conservation. 1% 9% 9% 12% 20% 49% 1% 7% 10% 11% 18% 53% Outcomes of 257 marine habitat assessments for the EU28 and EU28+. \u25a0 Critically Endangered \u25a0 Endangered \u25a0 Vulnerable All Eu28 habitats All Eu28+ habitats \u25a0 Near Threatened \u25a0 Least Concern \u25a0 Data Deficient Part II.

This is particularly a problem for grasslands and mires. As for freshwater habitats, drainage and pollution have been shown to be the main causes of loss and deterioration, along with invasive non-native species. For coastal habitats, urbanisation and associated infrastructure development continue to take their toll. As to the impact of climate change, this has been difficult to assess, but some damaging effects are already clear and are expected to increase over time, most notably in ice- and snow-dominated habitats. This assessment concerns all natural and semi-natural terrestrial and freshwater habitats occurring in Europe. Altogether, 233 habitats have been included in the European Red List (of which five occur outside the EU28). They cover: \u25cf 13 types of mires and bogs; \u25cf 53 types of dry and wet pastures and meadows, steppes, alpine grasslands and tall-herb vegetation; \u25cf 26 types of freshwater lakes, streams, rivers and springs; \u25cf 30 types of coastal saltmarshes, beaches, dunes and cliffs; \u25cf 38 types of heathland, scrub and tundra; \u25cf 42 types of broadleaved and coniferous forests; and \u25cf 31 types of scree, cliffs, rock, snow and ice habitats. The results show that 36% (EU28) and 31% (EU28+) of the evaluated habitats are threatened (i.e. included in the categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable). An additional 12% are Near Threatened in both the EU28 and in the EU28+. However, the percentages differ considerably between the seven main groups. The highest proportion of threatened habitats in the EU28 was found among mires and bogs (85%), followed by grasslands (53%), freshwater habitats (46%) and coastal habitats (45%). Forests, heathland and scrub, and sparsely vegetated habitats had relatively low proportions of threatened types but are nevertheless likely to be more or less in danger at a local or regional scale than across Europe as a whole. The loss of extent and quality of European terrestrial and freshwater habitats is the result of diverse pressures.

T e rr e s t r i a l a n d f r e s h w a t e r h a b i t a t s E u r o p e a n R e d L i s t o f H a b i t a t s E n v i r o n m e n t Relation with Annex I of the Habitats Directive The European Red List of Habitats covers a much broader set of habitats than those listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive, and assesses habitats on an EU scale, while Annex I habitats are assessed at the level of each biogeographical region. The relationship between the Red List types and the Annex I types is therefore complex and in only few cases is there a one- to-one correlation. In fact, a preliminary gap analysis revealed that some 22 terrestrial Red List habitats (for example temperate wooded pastures and meadows) are considered threatened or near threatened but are not listed in Annex I. While these crude findings need to be looked at in more detail, they show the value of a Red List assessment by complementing EU legislation. The red listing also looks at their conservation status from an entirely different perspective \u2013 that of extinction and collapse, rather than whether it has reached or is showing trends towards reaching a favourable status or not. Nevertheless, despite the marked differences in approaches, scale of assessment and assessment criteria, the two assessment processes have turned out to be quite complementary and to a large extent help to reconfirm the validity of each other\u2019s findings. Applications of the European habitat Red List Without reliable, timely information on the status and trends of Europe\u2019s biodiversity, there is little hope of meeting the EU target of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2020. The new Red Lists will help to improve our scientific knowledge on the distribution, extent and conservation status of Europe\u2019s habitats. This can, in turn, help identify and pre-empt upcoming problems as it is well known that habitat loss and degradation precedes species decline. It also provides the necessary background for new initiatives targeted at coordinated European conservation action. Elsewhere, the Red List is set to make a substantial contribution to the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) and to meeting the restoration goals under Target 2 in the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy. It can, for instance, indicate which habitats are in most urgent need of restoration and help estimate the time-frame for their restoration as well as identify possible indicators of recovery. Finally, the publication of Europe\u2019s first-ever habitat Red List assessment should also help raise awareness of the need for European conservation action. Two Red List publications are available \u2013 Part I covers all marine habitats, Part II covers all terrestrial and freshwater habitats. In addition, each individual habitat is described in detail in a series of online factsheets.

        "14 nature and biodiversity newsletter | February 2017 \u2022 NEWS \u2022 PUBLICATIONS \u2022 EVENTS EU list of invasive alien species adopted In July, the Commission adopted Europe\u2019s first Union list of invasive alien species. It contains 37 species that cause damage on such a large scale as to justify dedicated measures across the European Union. Examples include the American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus , the slider turtle, Trachemys scripta , the Eastern baccharis, Baccharis halimifolia all native to America, the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina from South East Asia, and the water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes from South America. Species on the list are now subject to a series of measures set out in the EU Regulation on invasive alien species. These include restrictions on keeping, importing, selling, breeding and growing. Member States must also take measures for their early detection and rapid eradication, and for managing species that are already present in their territory. The list will be updated at regular intervals to include further species likely to have significant impacts on Europe\u2019s biodiversity and ecosystems. Go to: http://ec.europa.eu/ environment/nature/invasivealien/ index_en.htm New Natura 2000 sites adopted In December 2016, the Commission updated the Union lists of Sites of Community Importance for eight of the nine biogeographical regions (all except the Steppic region). In total, 37 new sites were added covering over 43,000 km 2 . The largest site was proposed by Portugal for the marine Atlantic Region. Located on a volcanic seamount some 200 km south-west of Lisbon, the Banco Gorringe marine site covers no less than 22,000 km 2 . It harbours extensive reef habitats and acts as a stepping stone for the dispersal of benthic fish species between Africa, Madeira and the Azores. Spain has also added a major marine area for the Macaronesian region (almost 15,000 km 2 ), whereas Romania has increased the sea area protected under Natura 2000 in the Black Sea Region by a third. As a result, the total marine SCI area included in Natura 2000 has increased by a further 15% since 2015. The Natura 2000 Biogeographical Process The second Natura 2000 Seminars for the Boreal and Atlantic regions took place from 5 to 7 October 2016 in Vilnius, Lithuania and from 25 to 27 October 2016 in Ennistymon, Ireland. At both events, taking account of the 2015 EU State of Nature report, conservation and restoration issues related to the so-called \u2018top 20\u2019 habitats of the region were discussed. Particular attention was given to the setting of restoration priorities and implementing participatory approaches. A range of new ideas for concrete cooperation and future development initiatives to improve the management of Natura 2000, including a number of specific follow-up events, have been proposed.

Training materials were also produced for a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on GI. Finally, the study also explored the potential of introducing a Trans-European Network for Green Infrastructure (TEN-G). The first findings of the cost- benefit analysis indicate that a TEN-G has the potential to provide greater benefits per \u20ac invested than the current GI policy implementation and funding allocation. The report and the factsheets are available on: http://ec.europa. eu/environment/nature/ ecosystems/studies/index_en.htm LIFE Nature and Biodiversity The annual compilation of new LIFE projects adopted in 2016 is now available. In total, 39 projects were selected for funding involving an investment of \u20ac158.1 million, to which the Commission is providing action grants worth \u20ac95.6 million. The projects aim to conserve a wide range of threatened habitats, including rivers, wetlands, forests, meadows and bogs as well as protected species, such as the wild forest reindeer, Rangifer tarandus fennicus in Finland, the thick-shelled river mussels, Unio crassus in Denmark, and the great bustard, Otis tarda across Central Europe. The Commission has also published a summary of the best LIFE Nature projects for 2015. Six projects received the ultimate accolade \u2013 \u2018Best of the Best\u2019 project; among which is a LIFE Information and Communication (INF) project in Poland on biodiversity in the Natura 2000 network which developed a television series that was viewed by no less than 8 million people. http://ec.europa.eu/ environment/life/publications/ lifepublications/index.htm Task Force on migratory birds in the Mediterranean In July 2016, the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Task Force on Illegal Killing, Taking and Trade of Migratory Birds in the Mediterranean (MIKT) took place in Cairo. Governmental representatives of Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) around the Mediterranean, including the European Union and other interested organisations, came together to develop a detailed Programme of Work (PoW) until 2020 and to agree on a Cairo Declaration. The Cairo Declaration calls for the introduction of stricter penalties, increased surveillance and improved law enforcement to curb the large-scale killing of migratory birds in the Mediterranean. While the specific measures needed to tackle bird crime will vary for each country, the Task Force agreed to strengthen three key areas focusing on immediate legal measures, continuous monitoring and conservation actions as well as increased awareness campaigns and educational schemes. More information including the PoW is available on: http://www. cms.int/en/taskforce/mikt LIFE support for European Solidarity Corps In September 2016, President Juncker announced the creation of a European Solidarity Corps (ESC) to allow young people across the EU to engage in a broad variety of activities \u2013 such as rebuilding communities following a natural disaster; addressing social challenges such as social exclusion, poverty, health; supporting the integration of refugees; and protecting the environment.

The meeting, which was kindly hosted by the Maltese authorities and prepared by the European Topic Centre/Biological Diversity and the European Commission, brought together 16 Member States, as well as stakeholders and independent experts. The outcome of the seminars will now form the basis for further actions towards the completion of the marine Natura 2000 network. Mediterranean MPA forum The second Mediterranean forum of Marine Protected Areas in the Mediterranean, held in Tangier, Morocco, (28 November\u20131 December 2016), was an opportunity for managers, policymakers, socio-economic actors, civil society and the scientific community to tackle the challenges MPAs face in the region.
