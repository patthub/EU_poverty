        "European Union Institute for Security Studies September 2013 1 32 2 0 1 3 The Union\u2019s cyber security policy may still be in its infancy and hampered by difficulties, but the EU could yet become a key player in the field \u2013 if it plays its cards wisely. While the US has been seriously hit by the scan- dal surrounding the secret NSA surveillance programmes, the struggle over how to frame internet governance goes on and, more than ever, needs core stakeholders capable of de- fending freedom, democracy and the rule of law in cyberspace. The EU\u2019s longstanding commitment to those values in its foreign policy and unquestioned leadership in data protection mean it is well placed to play a significant role therein. At the same time, the EU and its member states have recently accelerated efforts to increase their cyber-defence capabilities so as to se- cure Europe against malicious cyber-attacks (like those carried out against the office of European Council President Herman van Rompuy in June 2012). To be truly effective, they may have to be able to play, at the same time, the roles of policeman, diplomat and regulator. A new cyber world order? Two concurrent debates about the governance of cyberspace provide the backdrop against which the EU seeks to strengthen its role and capabilities. First, the growing dominance of digital com- munication networks has brought to the fore two sharply conflicting visions about the fu- ture of the internet. A group composed pri- marily of liberal democracies (including the EU and US) argues that the multi-stakeholder approach bringing together governments, the private sector, civil society and technical ex- perts should continue to provide the basis for internet governance. This stance is op- posed by a group of \u2018cyber-sovereignty\u2019 advo- cates (including China and Russia) who wish to either retain or claw back more govern- mental control of cyberspace. The two sides clashed openly at the World Conference on International Telecommunications in Dubai in December 2012. The biggest bones of con- tention were (i) bringing internet govern- ance under the regulatory framework of the International Telecommunications Union ( de facto taking it away from the private sector and putting it into government hands); and (ii) giving states the authority to label certain content as spam (and therefore use this as a pretext to curb free speech). The second element in the debate concerns the application of existing international law to cyber conflicts. Europe\u2019s engagement in building international consensus is required here because the EU and its member states can be both targets and originators of cyber- attacks. Reducing possible sources of ten- sion requires cross-border coordination of A P / S I P A Cyber world: site under construction by Patryk Pawlak ",

Moreover, uncertainty related to cyber-attacks \u2013 what constitutes an \u2018attack\u2019, how definitely the identity of an attacker (and its possible links with state structures) can be ascertained \u2013 can be resolved only if the inter- national community develops a common un- derstanding and situational awareness. Several international organisations have tried to devel- op confidence-building measures but, so far, efforts to bring all members of the global com- munity on board have failed. The most promi- nent attempt to date \u2013 by the UN Group of Governmental Experts, in 2010 \u2013 resulted in a report on the application of international law and standards to cyberspace. A year later the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (in partic- ular SCO members China, Russia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) made its own submission to stimulate the discussion about international norms and rules regulating the conduct of states in cyberspace. The most recent initia- tive, undertaken under the aegis of the OSCE in 2012, was a package aimed at preventing a cyber-war \u2013 but it collapsed after Russia re- fused to sign up to the conclusions. Instead, Moscow advocates a universal cyber-conven- tion that would codify reasonable standards of state behaviour. Moving from the status quo \u2013 characterised by a patchwork of cyber-governance instru- ments [Table 1] \u2013 towards new regulations or changes in existing ones is necessary to reduce the uncertainty that affects and limits state and non-state actors alike. The direction in which the regulatory system may evolve will have significant security, economic and societal implications for Europeans. The EU thus needs to monitor developments closely and use its unique position to influence these debates. Add-ons \u2018made in the EU\u2019 The Union\u2019s Cyber Strategy endorsed by mem- ber states on 25 June 2013 sets out five stra- tegic priorities: (i) achieving cyber resilience; (ii) drastically reducing cybercrime; (iii) de- veloping cyber defence policy and capabilities related to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP); (iv) developing the industrial and technological resources for cyber secu- rity; and (v) establishing a coherent interna- tional cyberspace policy for the EU with a view also to promote core values. The strate- gy also reiterates the Union\u2019s commitment to existing international laws regulating cyber- space, including the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the Geneva Conventions and the principles enshrined in the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. The European External Action Service, in particular, is tasked with ensuring the pro- tection of freedom and human rights in the digital world, coordinating capacity-building assistance, strengthening the accountability and stability of the internet, and maintain- ing relations with partners and international organisations.

The Cyber Strategy, however, also makes clear that achieving these objectives will not be possible without international coopera- tion. Cybercrime cannot be combated effec- tively without police and intelligence services working across borders. Promoting freedom of the internet and other core values cannot be achieved without engagement at the global and regional level. Yet international engage- ment, in order to be credible, needs to proceed in lockstep with the development of cyber ca- pabilities aimed at building resilience and rais- ing awareness. These three dimensions \u2013 law enforcement, regulation and diplomacy \u2013 are vital for strengthening Europe\u2019s collective say on cyber governance. The EU as a policeman: combating the dark side \u2022 of the internet The EU\u2019s contribution to the fight against organ- ised crime, including its extensive network of law-enforcement partnerships on cybercrime and related issues, provides the backbone for its international role. The Union strongly ",
        "European Union Institute for Security Studies September 2013 3 supports the principles for fighting online crime set out in the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and engages in capacity-building efforts designed for law enforcement. It has successfully carried out cross-border opera- tions targeting child sexual-abuse file-sharing networks (Operation Icarus) and child sexual exploitation (Operation Atlantic), and coun- tering credit/debit card fraud. On top of that, the \u2018Cyber Atlantic\u2019 exercise \u2013 involving more than 20 countries and conducted jointly with the US Department of Homeland Security in 2011 \u2013 focused on a simultaneous attack on critical infrastructures in several countries. In addition to international efforts, the EU focuses on improving its own capabilities. In institutional terms: it has set up a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3); launched a network of national centres of excellence for cybercrime training, research and education (already op- erational in seven member states and under development in three more); and designed cybercrime training materials for law enforce- ment under the auspices of the European Cybercrime Training and Education Group hosted by Europol. The EU has also established a network of law en- forcement \u2018contact points\u2019 \u2013 operational 24/7 \u2013 which brings together officials with cyber expertise who are capable of provid- ing urgent assistance. In terms of legis- lative initiatives, the Foreign Affairs Council of 23 July 2013 approved the directive on attacks against information systems. This legislation defines \u2013 and establishes criminal sanctions for \u2013 basic offences or attacks against criti- cal infrastructure and information systems. Worth mentioning also are an obligation on member states to respond within eight hours to urgent requests for help, and an obligation to collect statistics on cyber offences. Member states now have time until September 2015 to transpose these new rules into their national legal systems. The EU as a diplomat: building trust and \u2022 capacities Improving access to broadband communica- tion in the developing world is necessary to achieve the economic and social benefits that the internet brings, including improved ac- cess to education and healthcare and, in the longer term, reducing poverty. This, however, cannot be achieved without concurrent ef- forts to improve the security of cyber infra- structure. For this reason HR/VP Ashton has highlighted the need for new cyber-capacity programmes and called for better coordina- tion of existing initiatives. The EU is already involved in cyber-capacity building efforts, such as training law enforcement experts and providing funding for ICT-oriented projects (e.g. in Georgia). Another important dimension for harnessing the EU\u2019s diplomatic potential is through con- fidence-building measures (CBMs). Despite attempts by international organisations like the UN, OSCE or NATO, multilateral solu- tions are still missing. Ambiguity remains with regard to what constitutes an aggres- sion and to what extent existing international law applies to cyber-attacks. This is why the creation of a common vocabulary with inter- nationally recognised definitions for grada- tions of attacks and potential targets remains a priority. In the absence of an over- arching framework, the Union\u2019s bilateral initiatives \u2013 like the EU-China Cyber Task Force, or scientific and law-enforcement cooperation with Russia \u2013 may provide a platform for build- ing trust. The EU\u2019s external action would be curtailed without the ability to effectively secure the conduct of CSDP missions and operations. A study to assess the cyber-defence capa- bilities of member states recently carried out by the European Defence Agency revealed a rather mixed picture on cyber-intelligence gathering and incident-response capabili- ties. Nevertheless, several efforts are under- way, including developing Cyber Defence Situational Awareness for CSDP operations and Cyber Defence Training Needs Analysis. The European Council on security and de- fence in December 2013 may also provide an opportunity to further develop some key con- cepts (i.e. the need to integrate cyber defence into the planning and conduct of CSDP mis- sions, training and exercises). \u2018Moving from the status quo \u2013 characterised by a patchwork of cyber-governance instruments \u2013 towards new regulations or changes in existing ones is necessary to reduce the uncertainty that affects and limits state and non-state actors alike.\u2019 ",

Ever since the crea- tion of the Single Market, the EU has been at the forefront of international harmonisation and standard-setting (including on digital communication), as well as the eradication of safe havens. Yet a 2012 Eurobarometer survey revealed that almost one-third of Europeans do not feel confident that their privacy is protected when using the internet. Defending the EU\u2019s international position at a time when some of its fundamental values and norms are being constantly challenged will be all the more difficult without first proving that a European model works for its own citizens. This is why EU initiatives, including the Digital Agenda for Europe, focus on strength- ening the resilience of systems and the Union\u2019s internal capacities by involving all relevant stakeholders. The EU is currently discussing a directive on network and information secu- rity (NIS) that would see member states es- tablish competent authorities at the national level, set up Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and adopt national NIS strat- egies and cooperation plans. Furthermore, government institutions, operators of criti- cal infrastructure (such as energy, transport or banking) and key internet enablers (e- commerce platforms, social networks) will be responsible for performing risk assess- ments and adopting appropriate measures. Contrary to the position preferred by some in the cyber community (the private sector in particular), the EU has put forward its own model for transparency that obliges private entities to report any incidents with a signifi- cant impact on core services provided. The EU has been the unquestioned leader on data protection since 1995, when the Data Protection Directive (DPD) was adopted. The directive \u2013 currently under revision \u2013 provides a legal framework regulating tran- snational data exchanges between public and private authorities: it has constituted a benchmark for international data flows for almost a decade. The DPD was used to en- sure (with varying degrees of success) that the security considerations which drove most of the counterterrorism policies introduced around the world after the 9/11 terrorist at- tacks did not undermine civil liberties and, in particular, citizens\u2019 right to privacy. With several new regulations adopted over the past ten years \u2013 especially those addressing the use of personal information for security purposes \u2013 the European data protection re- gime remains the most robust in the world. Towards 2015 A secure and safe digital environment is a necessary condition for reaping the benefits of ubiquitous access to the internet. With the number of devices connected to the internet ex- pected to reach 15 billion by 2015, addressing the threats posed by malicious cyber activities is a clear priority. This is why the Union\u2019s re- cent initiatives in developing cyberspace poli- cies and capabilities are most welcome. Hardly any other actor on the international stage has capacities, experience and credibility compa- rable to those of the EU in this domain. Its recent focus on cyber issues sends a signal that Europe is willing to participate in (and possi- bly shape) the ongoing debate. This is particu- larly important in view of the World Summit of the Information Society, scheduled in 2015, when major decisions about the future of the internet (including security) will once again be on the table.
