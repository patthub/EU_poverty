        "E u r o p e an P a r l i a m e nt October 1997 AX-AD 97-010-EN-C ISSN-0250 5754 EP NEWS S t a te of t he U n i on - p r e s i d e n ts d i s p el f e a rs T HE three presidents of the EU's institutions, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil Robles for the Parl iament, Jacques Santer for the Commission and Jean-Claude Juncker for the Council, came together in Strasbourg for the annual State of the Union debate to reassure MEPs about the future of the EU and dispel fears over the introduction of a single currency and enlargement. While President Gil Robles recog nised that both projects were creating uncertainty among the public at large \"important further advances such as those related to economic and mone tary union are viewed with a suspicion which, even if unjustified, is nonethe less real\". He felt the introduction of the single currency would mark a his toric date for European integration \"with the euro in their pockets, our citizens will be able to feel a little more European\". His views were shared by Com mission President Jacques Santer who was confident that the project would go ahead on time with the participa tion of a majority of member states, despite sniping from detractors. But the Commission President held out a warning for the UK and any other state deciding not to join at the begin ning: \"As for those member states who have chosen not to join the single currency at the beginning it is up to them to question the costs of being outside the currency and not part of a winning team.\" Council President Jean-Claude Juncker underlined his determination to see that all the necessary prepara tions would be taken in time for econ omic and monetary union to come on stream on 1 January 1999. He was looking forward to a stable currency and more economic convergence to contribute towards increasing <MP (\u00c4t ' : ' J MP* \u00a3 Three presidents: Jacques Santer, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil Robles and Jean-Claude Juncker sent out a reassuring message from Strasbourg employment. Jacques Santer also saw EMU as leading to the creation of new jobs pointing out that if it was possible to create ten million new jobs and reduce unemployment by three per cent during the last boom between 1985 and 1990, the challenge to find 12 million extra jobs over the next five years was not too ambitious a target. The other uncertainty over the future concerns enlargement to take in Cyprus and countries from central and eastern Europe. Council Pres ident Juncker was adamant that it was vital for the EU to give a clear positive response to the aspirations of those countries which had suffered under communism. At the same time, he warned that membership of the EU should not be seem as a panacea to solve all their problems but simply the best way forward for the countries concerned. But with countries such as Germany and the Netherlands ques tioning their contribution to the bud get, Juncker made a special plea for the member states not to revert to past squabbling over who pays what into the EU budget that represents less than 1.2 per cent of GNP. In unveiling its strategy for the enlargement negotiations which will be undertaken separately with each country, the Commission is proposing to double pre-accession aid in the year 2000, allow applicant countries to participate in EU programmes from 1998 and produce an annual assess ment of each country with a view to recommending a firm date for full membership. Commission President Santer underlined his determination to push ahead with vital reforms of the CAP and regional lund expenditures in preparation for enlargement. Indeed, the Commission's legislative programmes for next year will be dominated by these issues. THE MONTH IN STRASBOURG AND BRUSSELS j -~i 1 . LUXEMBOURG UNEMPLOYMENT dominated this month's debates in Strasbourg and Brussels as President Jacques Santer set out his strategy for creating 12 million jobs to be taken up at the Luxembourg special employment summit. Parliament's contribution was to vote for a special initiative in the EU's budget to combat unemployment. MEPs were also involved in trying to settle a number of contentious single market issues such as whether motorists should be obliged to use car manufacturers' spare parts and the conditions under which British chocolate can be exported to the European markets from which it is at present excluded. New Amsterdam treaty - a step in the right direction THE President of the European Parliament, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil Robles, was in the Netherlands this month for the signing of the EU's new Treaty of Amsterdam, an event which opens the way to the ratification process in the member states and to which Parliament will contribute its forthcoming opinion in November. Gil Robles declared that after half a century of reforms and enlargements the current system had reached its limits and would need to be revised after the effec tive introduction of the single cur rency. However, he believed that simply reforming the procedures would not be enough. \"We need to change the climate,\" he pro claimed, \"and not allow ourselves to be carried away by the tempta tions of nationalist selfishness, based on narrow financial preoccupations.\" He argued that the European Parliament needed to participate EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT to the full in the moves to mone tary union and promised that it would meet its obligations on implementing the relevant provi sions of the Amsterdam treaty at the earliest possible date, in par ticular the procedure for electing MEPs on principles common to the member states and for having a single and transparent statute for them. He made a plea that the EU institutions should take the opportunities offered by the treaty to improve decision making and, above all, to better serve the interests of EU cit izens, especially the unem ployed. \"Amsterdam took a great step in the right direction,\" he said. \"We must continue down this road. We must tackle the challenges facing us in the light of the com mon good.\" Gil Robles con cluded by calling for \"a real sense of interinstitutional co-operation\". He was \"con vinced that Parliament will find that the Council and Commission share with it a deter mination to work together for the benefit of all Europeans, a deter mination which will make this treaty a major contribution to the building of our European Union\". At a later special meeting of experts and MEPs convened to analyse the results of Amsterdam, there was general agreement that there would have to be a further revision of the treaty before the next enlargement. Budget for jobs IN approving an overall budget of Ecu84.6bn for 1998 MEPs voted for a special Ecul50m jobs initiative programme geared towards helping small firms and acting as a stimulus to encourage private finance. The intention is that the move will be taken up by EU ministers as the EU's contribution to the November Luxembourg Jobs Summit and indeed it won the support of Luxembourg Council President Jean- Claude Juncker. But in general, bearing in mind restrictions placed on public spending by member states, the approach this year was based on prudence, said John Tomlinson (Birmingham West, PES), who is responsible for looking after the funds earmarked for running the institutions where there is a freeze on expenditure except in the case of the Court of Auditors, responsible for checking up on fraud. The farm budget will account for some Ecu41bn, and the regional and social funds Ecu28.4bn. Internal policies including research, education and funding for the trans-European networks will receive some Ecu5bn while the aid budget amounts to Ecu4.4bn. The amended first reading now goes to Council before coming back to Parliament for a final reading in December. ",
        "European Parliament \u2014 EP News 2 British programmes win Prix Europa in Berlin THIS month MEPs from Britain and Germany attended the annual Prix Europa media awards in Berlin. The awards were first established in 1987, and the winners this year were chosen from more than 400 entries after a week of viewings and analysis. The Prix Europa is open to film and radio productions from across Europe; prizes also go to nations outside the EU, including Serbia and Romania. Designed to encourage new and high standards of programming, the 1997 Prix Europa was awarded to two British productions and an Irish film. Prizes went to the British Amber Production Team for their programme The Scar and to Mandy Temple for her outstanding documentary, Igor - the Boy Who Dared to Dream, a moving portrayal of a young boy born disabled after Chernobyl. The Prix Europa Youth Prize went to Irish film producer Stephen Burke for Eighty One, a look at two families in Northern Ireland during the hunger strikes of 1981. The European Parliament's special prize for non-fiction was awarded by German Euro-MP Maren G\u00fcnther to the Danish production They Don't Burn Priests, Do They? The award of Ecu6,250 was presented to Annette Mari Olsen at a unique ceremony held in the famous Babelsberg studios in Potsdam which was attended by 500 leading politicians and film producers. During the Prix Europa debate on the future of Europe's media, Roy Perry (Wight & Hampshire South) congratulated the British winners. Perry added: \"Politicians must create the framework for Europe's media industry but avoid the route of controls and subsidies. Euro-MPs should work closely with the Commission to ensure that we have a free market where qualify and innovation thrive.\" Transparency - new body to tackle secrecy STATEWATCH, the independent London-based organisation which monitors civil liberties across the EU, is to launch a new centre - Statewatch European Monitoring and Documentation Centre on Justice and Home Affairs in the EU (SEMDC). Its aim is to prise out of home affairs ministers and the 'K4' committee information on decisions taken under these council meetings as well as information on decisions taken under the Schengen Committee, the body responsible for administrative arrangements to monitor a \"Europe without border controls\". In the past, issues covering policing, Europol, immigration and asylum and legal co-operation have been largely discussed behind closed doors. The new organisation already houses a substantial collection of documents and will respond to enquiries by fax or telephone and carry out searches on its own in-house database. \u2022 Statewatch has just published 60 reports on policing, immigration and asylum adopted by EU justice and home affairs ministers in secret. \u2022 Key texts on Justice and Home Affairs.

Topics to be discussed include an assessment of the situation with regard to synthetic drugs, international comparisons by the World Health Organisation and the United Nations, street-level experience, prevention and research, and law enforcement. The meeting will bring together concerned EU ministers, experts and MEPs. Welcoming the conference, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark (East Sussex and Kent South, EPP) said: \"Across the world, 45 million people are addicted to illegal drugs and the annual turnover from illicit street sales exceeds $500 billion. Faced with large-scale trafficking and the increasing threat posed by organised crime from eastern Europe, EU governments must work together to fight drugs.\" Rules Committee to examine Labour Party 'Code of conduct' PROPOSALS for the next elections to the European Parliament to be conducted under proportional representation in the UK aroused controversy among some Labour MEPs this month who felt that new party instructions on the issue interfered with their freedom of speech. Ken Coates (Nottinghamshire and Chesterfield, PES) complained to Parliament's President Gil Robles who referred the matter to the Rules Committee. Coates, along with Alexander Falconer (Mid Scotland and Fife, PES), Michael Hindley (Lancashire South, PES) and Hugh Kerr (Essex West and Hertfordshire East, PES) have been denied the Labour whip in the European Parliament. Court ruling - back to Strasbourg MEPs bowed to a legal ruling from the European Court of Justice, that obliged Parliament to hold 12 parliamentary sessions a year in Strasbourg, and they reversed a vote taken last month by agreeing to hold an extra session in Strasbourg next October. MEPs will also be moving into new accommodation in Strasbourg and Brussels next year with the annual costs of the buildings in Luxembourg, Brussels and Strasbourg now amounting to Ecu211 million. B id to t a c k le j o bs crisis b ut no p r o m i s e s \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 With unemployment approaching 18 million in Europe or 10.6 per cent of the working population, this month's EP News focuses on the Luxembourg jobs summit and new ideas for getting those without a job back to work T HE European Commis sion in the shape of President Jacques San ter and Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn this month challenged member states to get to grips with Europe's unemployment problem, propos ing targets such as the creation of 12 million jobs over the next five years and a reduction of the employment rate across the EU from an average of 10.6 per cent to seven per cent. The Commission is also calling for the number of unemployed who are offered a job or training to rise from ten per cent to 25 per cent over the same period. All those out of work for over a year should be offered a job or training, said Santer, responding to the worrying statistic that 48 per cent of Europe's unemployed have been without work for more than a year. The intention is also that employers will not be deterred from hiring staff on account of high ancillary social charges. These new initiatives, Flynn told MEPs, were not to cost more money but would come from \"a restructuring of expenditure\". These proposals are to be pre sented to the jobs summit that will take place in November in Luxembourg. However, some member states have already expressed reservations about the setting of targets. The European Parliament's approach to the jobs summit has been similar in tone. Among pro posals in its resolution concern ing the forthcoming jobs summit adopted this month are: \u2022 Unemployment should be cut to seven per cent of the active population within five years. \u2022 Youth unemployment should be reduced to 50 per cent of its current level. \u2022 Unemployment should equal the mean rate in the three best performing countries within five years. \u2022 There should be a guarantee THE BRITISH FIGURES - DECLINE OR FALL? According to official statistics, unemployment in the United Kingdom is on the decline. But is the British experience all that it is cracked up to be? READING the UK's monthly unemployment statistics gives, upon initial inspection, some cause for celebration. The numbers out of work and claiming benefit have more or less continued to decline by a monthly average of 30,000- 40,000 over the last few years. On this basis, the former Conservative government claimed that its approach - namely, that govern ments cannot create jobs and that job creation should be left to the market - was bearing fruit. The new Labour government has also underlined the need for a flexible labour market. With employment standing at more than three mil lion in the early 1980s, the official figure is now under two million or 5.3 per cent of the active popula tion, below the European Commis sion's stated target of seven per cent. On further scrutiny, Britain's record appears to be not so impres sive. According to an independent inquiry published by the Council of Churches for England and Ire land earlier this year, the real number of unem ployed people in the summer of 1996 who would like to work was nearer to 4.5 mil lion, and this in a country where the number of people of active age is declining. Additionally, while many jobs have undeniably been created in the United Kingdom, a significant proportion of these have been of a part-time rather than the tradi tional full-time nature. Some of those in part-time work are there out of necessity rather than choice. The Churches' report also stressed that job creation of any kind is not necessarily the way for ward. Rather, the challenge to society was how to provide the necessary number of quality jobs, while at the same time maintaining a reasonable standard of living for the people who fill them through reasonable wages. In other words, the British model is not one that necessarily creates safe and secure employ ment. Even among the better paid jobs there has been a trend towards short-term contracts, the lengthening of probation periods in a system not far removed from the American model where, according to the OECD, the inci dence of in-work poverty is a fact of life. Competing for the well-paid rather than low-paid jobs of the future Employees, the report argued, were working faster, for longer and had more responsibilities. This was unproductive, limited the num ber of jobs avail able and under mined family life. It should be pos sible to give mothers and fathers of young children the opportunity to work \"less than full time\", with their employers giving them unpaid leave to make this possible. The need to alternate work and rest was essential. Most important of all, the report underlined the need to raise and foster education and training stan dards across the board \"(learning for life) to ensure that the UK could compete for the well-paid rather than low-paid jobs of the future\". Employers have in recent years Gordon Brown stressed at a recent meeting of EU finance ministers that promoting labour market mobility will be especially important in the context of a single European currency' that the retrained unemployed will be given paid employment for at least a year with special attention to groups that are par ticularly badly affected by unem ployment. \u2022 Member states' national bud gets should be geared to the mean of the three best perform ing member states as regards training. More resources devoted to 'passive' employment policies should be transferred to more active measures such as educa tion and training. \u2022 Promotion of labour market flexibility with regard to working hours, working time and working patterns such as career breaks was needed \u2022 It was desirable to move towards reducing the tax burden for individuals and companies The attempt to bring a Euro pean approach to the job cre ation process has to be consid ered in the market context that expansion will lead to increased profits or market share. Employers are reluctant to take on extra labour in the face of restrictive conditions. They get even more reticent, however, if by law, they are 'restricted' in how they employ staff. Employ ment protection such as a statu tory minimum wage, it is consid ered, is costly and unrealistic, all the more so given that countries are forced to compete within a globalised economy. Companies dare not raise their prices for fear of losing business as a result of tougher competition. On the other hand, it is argued that by paying employees a decent wage, adopting consulta tion practices, providing training and a measure of stability, a company is, in the long term, far more efficient and more prof itable. This approach also attracts a loyal labour force. Hiring and firing only causes fric tion and does nothing for effi ciency. In the changing employ ment market, the need for ongoing training is critical both Raising standards: a UK report says the challenge is to provide well-paid rather than low-paid jobs been almost unanimous in their call for better educated young peo ple, stressing that there will be few jobs for the unskilled in tomor row's jobs market. Many successful companies have pursued a policy of training their staff, thereby creating a posi tive working relationship between the company and the employee, who feels valued. Those on short- term contracts were unlikely to feel so loyal, a trend which, if it became too common, could hit the United Kingdom's competitiveness in the longer term. Among the report's recommen dations were: \u2022 Reform of the tax system to encourage more employment in the private sector. \u2022 More employment in the public sector financed by higher taxation. \u2022 A programme for creating good jobs for the long-term unem ployed. \u2022 Better conditions of work and fairer bargaining over pay. \u2022 Priority in the education system to basic skills for all young people. Significantly, the Churches' report underlined a stance that has recently been taken by the new Labour government in Britain, namely, that simply doling out money to the unemployed is not the answer. On taking office, the new government refused to simply increase welfare benefits, arguing that giving a few pounds extra a week to the unemployed was, in the long term, not in their best interests. Instead, the Labour Party pledged during the recent election campaign to get 250,000 back to work through a welfare-to- work scheme paid for by a one-off windfall tax on the privatised utili ties. They argued that accepting the millions without a job was immoral and costing the British taxpayer a fortune. The message was driven home with the alarming statistic that, despite the 'fall' in unemployment, 20 per cent of households in the United Kingdom had no wage earner. So where overall does the UK stand on employment? There is a long way to go before the real underlying issues are effectively tackled, although the government argued that it is facing up to the issues. There is a wish, however to avoid making concrete promises. Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his recent speech to the Labour Party conference, con cluded: \"No government creates jobs, but creates the possibility to work. We will not be a government which claims that it can protect you against the loss of your job, but one which will recognise that it is its duty to help you find another.\" ",

Shortages of qualified staff due to lack of training can push up wages to the detriment of the employer. The employee needs stability and up-to-date skills. Many large companies have sought to train their staff regu\u00ad larly, while others have seen this as an unnecessary expense, insist\u00ad ing that it is the individual's responsibility to retrain. A minimum wage, the counter argument continues, is only costly if it is set too high. Its func\u00ad tion is to prevent the excesses of an all powerful market. Furthermore, it is said, a mini\u00ad mum wage cannot be destroying jobs since non-skilled low-paid jobs are in decline anyway due to market demands. The new jobs, in the short to medium term at least, tend to be of a higher paid nature and therefore would not necessarily be affected. A minimum wage is not necessarily anti-competitive if it is applied across the board. It can also put more spending power in the pocket of the lower paid who tend to spend their money on goods generated by the domestic economy. Thus, a society is created that is more at ease with itself and THE LIVERPOOL EXPERIENCE crucially more willing to spend its money, the so called 'feel-good factor\" creating more wealth and jobs. Moreover, the argument goes, it is morally reprehensible to exploit employees. It should be illegal to employ people with low wages and poor conditions. Employment has shifted in recent years as a result of changes in the job market, new technology and expanding areas of the economy and the decline of others. One simple example is the decline in manufacturing industry and the rise in the ser\u00ad vices sector, which now repre\u00ad sents some 60 per cent of the EU economy. Part-time staff, of whom many are women, are also a growing area in the economy as employers seek to recruit more flexible staff, particularly in the rising service sector. Hence the need to give these workers the same rights as traditional full- time workers has increased. There are significant differ\u00ad ences in approach to the prob\u00ad lem. In France, the approach to the problem of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has so far concen\u00ad trated on the need to protect workers from the excesses of the free market, public sector job creation and a reduction in the working week. Tony Blair in Britain has gone for flexibility in the workplace, training for the young unemployed and a court\u00ad ing of the private sector. Jean- Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's president and jobs summit host, stressed in September that he believed that there was a third way between the US-style market flexibility and the more protec\u00ad tive welfare state, insisting that Europe \"has not lost its ability to compete and the European social model, though in need of reform, is not under threat\". The realistic way forward is therefore likely to require a mea\u00ad sure of both approaches. The summit will help us see just how far this is possible. WHEN it comes to unemployment in Britain, there are few places as severely affected as Merseyside and its principal city Liverpool. The official unemployment rate stands at 12.5 per cent and is falling; however, the unofficial rate could be double that figure. Certain areas within the region such as inner urban areas and outer housing estates have continued to experience unemployment of up to 40 per cent. In 1993, the proportion of all registered unemployed who had been out of work for more than five years was eight per cent. The UK average at the time was two per cent. At the end of last year, 28 per cent of children leaving school had no qualifications, twice the UK national average. Generally, Merseyside's unemployment rate was roughly 21 per cent above the European Union average. Male unemployment rates in June 1996 were 80 per cent above the UK average. As a result of statistics such as these, Merseyside was the only region in England to be granted Objective One status' in regional and structural expenditure, money which is designed to help less well-off European regions to catch up with the richer ones. The Objective One fund has meant, for Merseyside, funding amounting to \u00a31.5 billion over the six year period 1994-1999, consisting of \u00a3640 million directly from the European Union, matched funds from government, with the rest coming from the private sector. Robert Corbett, the region's MEP, recognises the need to create private sector jobs and to get local employers and trade unions at local level involved in attracting high-tech business to the area. It is possible, he argues, to attract such companies to an area that has suffered such high levels of unemployment and poverty. To ensure success, both the training and the jobs need to be put into place at the right time, to avoid either a sudden glut of trained workers with no jobs to go to, or an excess of skilled jobs without the necessary local workforce, resulting in firms having to look outside the local area. Two of the many initiatives that have resulted in part thanks to European funding are: \u2022 'Graduates for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises' (SMEs). Set up this year to retrain unemployed graduates who lack high- level vocational skills. 450 graduates were retrained with 400 obtaining work placements. \u00a3506.444 came from the European Social Fund, the remaining \u00a3760.000 coming from the public and private sectors. \u03c6 'Connect.' With \u00a31.195m from the European Development Fund and the European Structural Fund, \u00a31.629m from public funds and an additional \u00a31.174m from the private sector over four years, the initiative, set up in May 1996, is designed to encourage SMEs to adopt electronic network-related technology and establish in the long term a skilled workforce needed to sustain a large IT presence in Merseyside. Assistance has been provided for more than 1,300 SMEs. The target is to have 3,000 SMEs benefiting from the move, in a region where in 1993, the majority of businesses were small; 87 per cent of units employed fewer than 25 employees. EUROPE VERSUS THE USA AS the European Union's Employment Summit approaches, and politicians develop their views and strategies, comparisons with the United States are inevitable. The US unemployment rate is 4.9 per cent for the sixth consecutive month, the lowest level in 30years. Population/Participation THE EU has a population of more than 370 million, 302 million (82 per cent) of whom constitute its working age population. The US has a population of 265 million, with 200 million (75 per cent) of them of US working age. Of the EU's working age population, 167 million, or 55 per cent, are involved in the labour market, compared with 67 per cent of Americans of the working age population, 134 million people. Nearly 50 per cent of America's total population works, equalled in the EU only by Denmark. Of the total EU population, 40.7 per cent is actually working, 36.2 per cent in Ireland, 44.6 per cent in the UK. The lowest levels are in Spain with 31.5 per cent of the population working. The trend of labour force participation for most EU countries has been downward, although many countries in the EU have increased their rates of female participation. Job Creation In the field of job creation, there are differences between the EU and US. The EU developed an estimated 11 million jobs over the past 30 years, while the US has created an estimated 54 million jobs during the same period. Since 1994, the US has created 7.8 million jobs. Talk in the EU concerns developing quality jobs for its people, while in the US it is of the need to develop quality workers to fit into developing jobs. The American Work Experience The American work experience is quite different to that of the EU. Between January 1993 and December 1995 more than 9.4 million US workers were displaced as large businesses 'downsized' and streamlined their operations. Plant closures and relocations accounted for 44 per cent of the job losses, 29 per cent of the 9.4 million total were rooted out of manufacturing industry alone. By February 1996 a Labor Bureau survey revealed that 13 per cent of the 9.4 million displaced remained unemployed, while 75 per cent were again employed; the rest had apparently left the labour force or had participated in an alternative work scheme. Machine operators, assemblers, and inspectors had a 55 per cent rate of re-employment, while technicians and technical support staff were re-employed at an 84 per cent rate. Observing the public outcry when Renault closed its auto plant in Vilvoorde, Belgium, it would seem unimaginable to have America's apparent job volatility in the EU. At the height of this period, the US rate of unemployment reached a high of 7.5 per cent and has since edged its way down to its current level. In 1995,18.1 million Americans, or 13 per cent of the labour force, experienced some period of unemployment during the year: Blacks at 19 per cent and Hispanics at 17.9 per cent had higher work experience unemployment than whites on 11.9 per cent, but their levels continue a downward trend. Over half of the EU's 18.1 million unemployed have been without jobs for more than a year, 30 per cent have gone two years or longer without working. By contrast less than 15 per cent of America's unemployed remain so for a year or more. Clearly, Americans have a better chance of losing a job than their counterparts in the EU, but they also have a greater possibility of finding a new position. On the other hand, according to the OECD, the United States has a 'higher incidence' of low pay than most European countries. Some 25 per cent of all full-time work\u00ad ers in the US earn less than two- thirds of median earnings, com\u00ad pared with a fifth in the EU. On the same subject, The Economist argues that Europe's unemployment is largely due to its rigid markets for products and labour, not a lack of demand: \"The IMF estimates that unemployment cannot go below nine per cent without a rise in inflation. This structural unemployment is far higher in Europe than in the US and the UK ... The cure: social security reform, lower taxes, lower minimum wages, greater wage flexibility and an easing on the restrictions on hiring and firing.\" In both the US and Britain, unemployment has fallen sharply since the early 1990s: from eight per cent to 4.9 per cent in the United States; from 10.5 per ceni to 5.3 per cent in the United Kingdom and this without a corresponding rise in inflation. Support and Training Of the estimated 6.8 million unemployed Americans, 2.23 million receive unemployment benefits. Further support is given by the Federal government in the form of programmes and granis totalling more (han $11 billion. This money is earmarked for local, state, and private community-based bodies that provide or develop a variety of 'employability' schemes. The Welfare-To-Work programme, with $3bn in funding over the next two years, and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit Programme (WOTC), for example have helped more than 1.2 million Americans to get off welfare and into the workforce since they became law in April 1996. GERMANY IN Germany, employment has been affected by reunification in 1990. An estimated three million jobs may have been lost as a result, mainly in former East Germany, where a significant proportion of the workforce is unskilled and the current unemployment level is approaching 19 per cent. In western Germany it is 9.9 per cent. This has occurred despite the recent recovery of the German economy linked to the fall in value of the deutschmark. There has also been a recent tendency among German employers to create jobs outside the country as a result of a perceived lack of worker flexibility and expensive non-wage labour costs that are as high as Ecu23 an hour, compared with Portugal, where the rate is nearer Ecu6 an hour. More significantly, labour costs are approximately 20 per cent higher than in France, the country's main competitor. However, initiatives such as the reduction in working time at Volkswagen to 29 hours a week in 1993, which saved an estimated 30,000 posts, have helped. IT IS BETTER TO BE YOUNG IN GERMANY DESPITE an unemployment level of 10.8 per cent of the active population, there is one area where the rest of Europe could learn from Germany: youth employment. In the United Kingdom the figure is roughly 15.7 per cent, in Ireland, 16.2 per cent. In France, more than a quarter of under 25-year-olds are looking for work. In Spain, the figure is approaching 37 per cent. In Germany the rate is 10.4 per cent. Why such a difference? According to the publication Social Europe, there are a number of factors which explain German employers' willingness to take on young workers. Significantly, trade unions play an important role. Their insistence through works councils that companies take on a minimum number of youth apprentices rather than concentrate on securing the maximum level of pay and conditions for the existing workforce is crucial. It prevents existing employees from obtaining a disproportionate amount of power. The unions furthermore see the importance of co\u00ad operating with employers. In exchange for reasonable levels of employment stability and wages, the unions insist upon the satisfactory performance of their workers. Employer organisations also have a culture of putting pressure on companies that do not take on 'enough' young people. All sides agree that the level of pay for an apprentice should be temporarily lower than for an established worker on the understanding that young people can temporarily accept low wages at the start of their working lives. It is, however, in the field of German education that likely solutions to the problems of youth unemployment may be found. Children take a serious interest in their education as they see the long-term benefit in working hard while at school. Incentives are evident for all pupils, no matter what level of attainment, the most important of which is the close relationship between employers and schools. This convinces pupils that education is important to their future employment prospects. For Germany as a whole, the presence of a well trained, co-operative workforce is also attractive for both domestic and foreign investors. The contrasts with Germany's neighbours, the study argues, are important. In the United Kingdom, companies can be excessively 'cost responsive' to the market. The first response is to shed staff that are deemed to be no longer needed. Many non-quoted companies also find it difficult to borrow long-term from the banks. Therefore it makes more sense and costs less to hire and fire rather than retrain staff, which is deemed too expensive. Some have concluded that as it is more difficult to hire and fire workers in Germany, companies take a more positive attitude towards their employees. It is in a company's interest to retrain staff rather than fire them, in contrast to the hire-and-fire mentality displayed in the US and to a certain extent Britain, where jobs are shed as soon as the market changes. THE FRENCH WAY IN France, unemployment remains stubbornly high at above three million, or 12.6 per cent of the working population. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is currently trying to tackle the problem with his recent manifesto pledge to get 700,000 back to work, with a particular focus on youth unemployment; 150,000 five-year public sector posts for the young unemployed - many of whom are graduates - were recently put forward. However, the initiative was criticised by French President Jacques Chirac as creating 'non jobs', arguing along similar lines to the OECD that France must concentrate on stimulating employment in the private sector. A quarter of French employment is already in the public sector, significantly more than the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, who all have an equivalent level of roughly 15 percent. There are also complaints that this initiative does nothing to tackle the very real problem linked to France's employment laws, namely the cost and difficulty of employing and sacking staff. There is increasing evidence that the limitation of the working week to 35 hours without loss of pay is also running into trouble. The government, however, claims that up to 1.4 million jobs could be created by this measure. ",
        "Chocolate leaves a bitter taste \u0392 European Parliament \u2014 EP News 4 \u0393 i \u00cdXijm , n\"fr*r*\"\"r\"\" n '- 1 g 11,1 li 11 M\u00ab<M\u00bbMHi\u00bbHlMIW RITISH chocolate made with vegetable fat will have to be clearly labelled as such in order to be sold throughout the EU, if ministers accept an amendment voted by MEPs. MEPs want the vegetable fat content of chocolate to be clearly indicated on the front of the wrapper. They also want to see a mechanism for accurately measuring the vegetable fat content of chocolate before the introduction of any legislation. They called for the Commission to carry out a study on the impact of the directive on coun\u00ad tries that are dependent on cocoa exports. If it is shown to have an adverse effect on these exports then the Commission would be obliged to amend its proposals. The issue prompted a lively debate in Parliament that saw MEPs generally dividing on national lines. While MEPs from the original six member states were anxious to defend the existing status quo, British and Irish speakers favoured breaking down the barriers to the single market. Caroline Jackson (Wiltshire North and Bath, EPP) condemned the dis\u00ad crimination against British chocolate and argued that EU consumers should be free to choose what to buy. Chocolate made with vegetable fat, she said, \"was not radioactive\" and posed no risk to health. She was supported by Phillip Whitehead (Staffordshire East and Derby, PES) who believed that sup\u00ad porters of the existing situation were seeking to defend a pro\u00ad tectionist regime. The issue goes back to 1973 when Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the EU. Prior to that date all mem\u00ad ber states only allowed pure cocoa butter to be used in the manufacture of chocolate. However, the new entrants per\u00ad mitted the use of vegetable fats in the process. A compromise was therefore agreed whereby the three could maintain their traditional practices of choco\u00ad late manufacture, but could not export their products to mem\u00ad ber states which did not use vegetable fats in the process. The later accession of other states, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Portugal, that also allow vegetable fats in the man\u00ad ufacture of chocolate has led to ~ \"~ ' \u25a0\u25a0 * \" \u00bb t t\u00ed n \u00bb t * * \u00bb . \u00bb y i * M \u00ed \u00bb \u00bb ^ \u00bb \u00bbi W\u00bb**J#\u00ab\u00cd\u00bbM\u00bb*\u00bb\u00bb\u00cd5U\u00bb*I!I\u00bb \\ iiMIIMilfllIlll\u00bbll\u00cdH\u00dcWl\"ii' 1 \u00bb\u00ab\u00bb v fiW\u00ca\u00bbmMau\u00bb\u00bbm eme\u00bb \u00bb \u00bb\u25a0\u25a0 t MI -i * * mm i JJ* Jiauiiii\u00bbi*\u00bbjjWi\u00a1\u00fc\u00bb. jiJ^fjififiljjJji^JiliilPliiBllr\u00f8*\u00b7 -.l\u00fcwm\u00ab\u00b7 jifii/iai\u00c4in\u00fcii'aiiUii \"\" British chocolate: MEPs want vegetable fat to be labelled similar arrangements. However, such restrictions hamper the development of a single market and, since the Edinburgh summit in December 1992, the Commission has been trying to come up with a solution to the problem. The Commission has there\u00ad fore proposed to allow the use of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter in small propor\u00ad tions, ie up to five per cent of the total ingredients used. This proposal has caused concern in African countries such as the Ivory Coast and Ghana which rely on exports of cocoa butter and fear a loss of markets to competing products. The amended Commission proposal tabled under the co\u00ad decision procedure now goes to EU ministers before coming back to Parliament for a second reading. On the move: from Bosnia to a German caravan park Dublin moves for refugees IN THE week when the arrival of several hundred Slovak gyp\u00ad sies in Britain hit the head\u00ad lines, MEPs gave a conditional welcome to the European Commission's proposals on help for refugees. The propos\u00ad als would oblige member states to take joint action to provide temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons in need of international protection. Any such action would be binding on member states. Jan Wiebenga (NL, ELDR) argued that a harmonised policy of refugee protection would prevent distorted migratory patterns, with some countries making a disproportionate effort and others doing too little. The Figures largely support Wiebenga's case and the calls by Germany for a fairer distri\u00ad bution of asylum applicants among other member states. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall there has been a substan\u00ad tial influx of refugees into EU countries, fleeing particularly from conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Germany has taken in 400,000 refugees from that troubled region, including some 340,000 from Bosnia alone \u00ad more than all other EU countries put together. In addition, in 1996 Bonn received 569,000 applications for asylum, compared to the UK which received just 28,000 applications in the same year. However, this Figure was greater than that of any other EU country after Germany. Applications to other member states were generally much lower. Furthermore, last month Britain implemented the EU's Dublin Convention, and in future refugees' asylum appli\u00ad cations will no longer be con\u00ad sidered in the First country they reach, but the one in which they actually make their application for asylum. We may therefore be seeing more cases of refugees coming to Britain via other countries. All party support for Northern Ireland peace funding THE three Northern Ireland MEPs gave their unanimous support to the EU\u00adfunded Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in a report that they sent this month to Commission President Jacques Santer. Jim Nicholson (North\u00ad ern Ireland, I\u00adEN), John Hume (Northern Ireland, PES) and Ian Paisley (Northern Ireland, Ind) were giving their views on the programme that has been running since 1995 in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties and has now reached its half way point. It has pro\u00ad vided assistance of Ecu300m between 1995 and 1997 and was prepared jointly by the British and Irish governments. In their report the MEPs speak warmly of the positive contribution made by the pro\u00ad gramme to the general situation in Northern Ireland, and its unique achievement in bringing together elected representatives across the entire political spec\u00ad trum who are \"participating in it and unanimously and unequivocally wish to see it continued\". They consider that the programme has gained the strongest EU identification of any European initiative hith\u00ad erto carried out in Northern Ireland. \"It has had an impact on those marginalised in society in a completely new and dis\u00ad tinctive way\", they say, \"partic\u00ad ularly through its emphasis on social inclusion\". They welcome especially the concept of \"partnerships\" which aim to provide a focus and forum for reconciliation through broad based commu\u00ad Working for reconciliation nity participation. Partnerships are the most novel element of the programme and have attracted more than 12,000 applications. A particularly suc\u00ad cessful example has been in Armagh City and District where the population is charac\u00ad terised by extreme polarisation between the communities with pockets of severe deprivation. The Armagh partnership is made up of one third elected representatives from the district council, one third from the vol\u00ad untary/community sector, and one third from the business, trade union and statutory sec\u00ad tor. It has sought to contribute to peace and reconciliation through integrated social and economic actions. The three MEPs want the programme to continue to receive the same funding in 1998 and 1999 and are calling for some elements of it to be preserved in EU and other national programmes in subse\u00ad quent years. MEPs and Council clash over spare parts directive MEPs lined themselves up for a confrontation with the Council this week following their debate on a directive on the protection of industrial designs. They voted in favour of an amendment that would allow independent dealers to supply \"visible\" spare parts for cars as long as they make a \"reasonable contribution\" to vehicle manufacturers for the investment required in the original design. This was the second time that MEPs have put forward this amendment, having previously done so in March after which it was deleted by internal market ministers who decided to give each member state the option of whether to introduce a repairs clause. The decision by the ministers attracted fierce criticism from consumer groups who have claimed that the majority of member states will not take the trouble to introduce a repairs clause. Consequently, motorists would not have the option of deciding whether to buy replacement spare parts from car manufacturers or from individual suppliers. This would give car manufacturers a monopoly in the spare parts market and the opportunity to dictate prices, thereby forcing independent spare parts manufacturers out of the market. Christine Oddy (Coventry and North Warwickshire, PES) urging the Council to heed Parliament's amendments, warned that around 10,000 jobs in the West Midlands were dependent on the spare parts industry and were under threat. She believed that the Council had opted for a \"free for all\" and had failed in its duty to achieve a proper European solution. She believed that the issue was also important for consumers who needed to get speedy repairs at low cost. She was supported by Anne Mcintosh (Essex North and Suffolk South, EPP) who felt that Parliament's amendment, with its emphasis on reasonable remuneration for the holder of the copyright, struck the right balance. The amended proposal now goes back to Council for a second reading, but if ministers fail to take on board Parliament's amendment this time the conciliation procedure is likely to result in further discussions between both sides. MEPs anger at U-turn on cosmetics WEDNESDAY, 22 October - As the new British Labour government announced that animal testing for cosmetic purposes will continue in the UK for the time being, Parliament adopted a resolution regretting the decision by the Council of Ministers to postpone until 1 June 2000 the date of the implementation of such a ban at an EU level, due to be introduced on 1 January 1998. The Commission is requested to bring forward without delay a new proposal to impose a ban.
