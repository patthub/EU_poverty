        "IPOL | ional Affairs 8 PE 656.398 The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 was adopted in November 2010. It was designed to support the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD or UN Convention) at EU and Member State level, and to mainstream disability across a wide range of policy areas at EU level. The 2010-2020 Strategy is being reviewed or evaluated by several EU institutions with a view to developing a post-2020 European Disability Strategy. The new Strategy is being developed against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is having significant social and economic impacts on the lives of persons with disabilities and their families. In that regard, the European Parliament, in its Resolution of 18 June 2020, has called on the Commission to rsons with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures adopted by Member States in response to to propose relevant and specific recovery and mitigation measures in the Post-2020 Disability Strategy to overcome such shortcomings This study analyses the design of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, as well as the measures that have been adopted to ensure its implementation, and puts forward recommendations regarding the design and implementation of the European Disability Strategy post-2020. Chapter 1 of this study introduces the contextual background, methodology and limitations of this study, while Chapter 2 explores the evolution of EU disability policy, the content of the current Strategy and the relevant provisions of the CRPD. Chapter 2 also reflects on the views of key actors, including the European Parliament, other EU institutions and civil society stakeholders, on the design of the 2010-2020 Strategy. Chapter 3 analyses the ways in which the current Strategy has been implemented at EU level and examines the influence that it has had to date on EU action. It also reflects on the main achievements of the current Strategy and the gaps that still need to be filled in light of the obligations of the EU as a Party to the CRPD. Chapter 4 presents the proposals and recommendations of key actors on the design and implementation of the European Disability Strategy post-2020, while chapter 5 outlines the recommendations of the authors of this study. Main Findings and Recommendations for Action This study presents a wide range of findings and recommendations, with a focus on the scope and content of the European Disability Strategy post-2020. This study also reflects on the implementation and monitoring of the new Strategy. The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 has contributed to a human rights model of disability being reflected in several EU legislative enactments and in policy discourse at EU level. The current Strategy has also supported the adoption of many legislative, standardisation and financial instruments at EU level. One field which has witnessed particularly notable developments is that of accessibility, where important initiatives, such as the European Accessibility Act, have been put in place. This study recommends that the existing priority areas of action should be maintained in the new Strategy, but that they be tailored, in particular, to the current COVID-19 pandemic. A new priority area on Citizenship rights should be added to the European Disability Strategy post-2020. Furthermore, it is essential that the priority areas and lines of action in the new Strategy are aligned more clearly with ",
        "The Post-2020 European Disability Strategy PE 656.398 9 CRPD rights and obligations. The new Strategy should be in light of the CRPD, to ensure complementarity between the actions adopted by the EU and those taken by the Member States in implementing the CRPD, which is a mixed agreement under EU law. To address gaps between the CRPD and existing EU law obligations, the new Strategy should also include a plan and timetable for substantive revisions of existing EU law. A shortcoming of the 2010-2020 Strategy was the lack of a clear baseline data set. It is essential that such a data set be established with regard to the Strategy post-2020, so that progress can be monitored. Data should be collected based on disaggregated qualitative and quantitative indicators on disability and be CRPD-compliant. It is also essential that a first list of actions be published together with the new Strategy. This research has revealed that there is scope for greater complementarity between the European Disability Strategy post-2020 and other EU instruments and programmes, on economic governance and the European Semester. It has also demonstrated that EU instruments, such as the Open Method of Coordination, could be utilised to help achieve the objectives of the European Disability Strategy post-2020. Greater alignment between the post-2020 Strategy and disability strategies at Member State level should also be ensured. In that regard, the new Strategy can support not only the adoption of national strategies through structures such as the European Semester process, but can also address the coordination, dissemination and monitoring of national disability strategies. In terms of implementing the European Disability Strategy post-2020, it is essential that appropriate infrastructure is put in place at EU and Member State level. At EU level, each Directorate-General of the Commission, and all other EU institutions and agencies, should establish disability focal points with responsibility for implementing the new Strategy, and ultimately the CRPD. While there have been positive trends with regard to the mainstreaming of disability considerations across a broad range of policy areas during the course the 2010-2020 Strategy, the establishment of focal points would facilitate the further mainstreaming of disability across areas of EU action where disability issues have not yet been mainstreamed, such as consumer policy. This study also recommends that the European Commission, Parliament and Council establish an inter-institutional coordination mechanism, which should be composed of all disability focal points. An implementation plan, consisting of a second list of actions, for the European Disability Strategy post-2020 should be published by the Commission after the mid-term evaluation of the new Strategy. The mid-term review should ensure that the priorities and first list of actions are re-evaluated and amended where necessary. It is also important that the Commission guarantee that evaluations of instruments linked to the post-2020 Strategy address the impact of those instruments on people with disabilities, and pay attention to assessing compliance by Member States with EU legislation in the field of accessibility, in particular. Ensuring an adequate budget is also essential to guarantee the effective implementation of the European Disability Strategy post-2020. In that regard, the Council should ensure, within the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework, that sufficient funding is put in place for implementation in full of the new Strategy. In addition, a ring-fenced budget to support disability accessibility should be ensured with regard to all funding programmes put in place by the Commission. A specific budget line should be ensured to enable full and effective participation and inclusion of people with disabilities, ",

That evaluation is intended to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and added value of the Strategy, and also to provide conclusions and recommendations to support the development of a new Strategy, which will be in place post-2020. \uf0b7 The European Parliament, and notably its Committee on Employment, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Petitions, are now discussing and making proposals regarding the new European Disability Strategy, which will apply post-2020. The European Parliament has discussed and adopted, on 18 June 2020, a Resolution drafted by the Committee on Employment, on the European Disability Strategy post-2020.

        "IPOL | ional Affairs 12 PE 656.398 1.1 Introduction In December 2010, the European Community (now European Union) concluded the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD or (UN) Convention) 1 as a regional integration organisation, thereby becoming a Party to a UN human rights treaty for the first time. 2 The CRPD came into force for the EU a month later, in January 2011. In addition to its conclusion by the EU, the UN Convention has been ratified by all EU Member States. However, the EU has not yet ratified the Optional Protocol to the CRPD (OP-CRPD). 3 It is well established that the CRPD forms an integral part order. 4 The UN Convention has acquired a sub-constitutional status, situated below the EU Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Charter or CFR), but above EU secondary legislation. 5 The conclusion of the CRPD represented a milestone in the development of EU disability law and policy, and is deemed to be 6 including policy initiatives. The current European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 (Strategy), 7 adopted in November 2010 (before the EU concluded the CRPD), is a wide-ranging instrument that foresees mainstreaming of disability across various policy areas, complementing the legal framework that is in force at EU level.

Doctrinal research can be described as nalysis and creative synthesis, the making of connections between seemingly disparate doctrinal strands, and the challenge of extracting general principles from an inchoate mass 24 The legal and policy analysis conducted in this study is based on both primary legal sources (at EU and international level), as well as on secondary, soft law policy instruments and related documents. It also draws on documents drafted by representative organisations of people with disabilities related to EU disability policy, and more specifically to the current and new European Disability Strategies. In study pays particular attention to the Concluding Observations issued by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to the EU in 2015. In terms of limitations, it is important to note that this study only takes into account developments up until 1 June 2020. It is also worth noting that the study does not entail an analysis of action taken at Member State level which can be related to the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. 1.3 Structure of the Study Following this introductory chapter, the next chapter of the study (chapter 2) discusses, in section 2.1, the EU institutional architecture on disability, the development and content of EU disability policy, as well as the key areas of the CRPD that are of relevance to the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 and the new Strategy. It also addresses the content of the current Strategy in section 2.1. Section 2.2 sets out the reflections of key actors, including the European Parliament, other EU institutions and stakeholders from civil society, on the design of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. Chapter 3 of the study explores the current state of implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010- 2020 on the basis of data and input from relevant experts from academia, key stakeholders, the European Parliament and other EU institutions. In section 3.1, the public consultation on the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 is discussed. In addition, an overview is provided of the European 2017 Progress Report on the implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010- 2020 25 (the mid-term evaluation), as well as the views and recommendations of the European Parliament, other EU institutions and relevant stakeholders on the mid-term evaluation.

        "The Post-2020 European Disability Strategy PE 656.398 17 KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 Early EU initiatives in the area of disability policy mainly took the form of non-binding instruments designed to enhance the exchange of information between Member States, primarily in the fields of employment and vocational training. \uf0b7 The entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam was the major turning point in EU action on disability, as it conferred legislative competence on the EU institutions to combat disability discrimination. \uf0b7 The CRPD is the benchmark for European disability policy. \uf0b7 The priority areas of the 2010-2020 Strategy accessibility, participation, non-discrimination and equality, employment, education and training, health, social protection and external action and three of the four general sets of implementation measures prescribed by the 2010-2020 Strategy awareness-raising; financial support; and statistics, data collection and monitoring; and monitoring mechanisms required by the Convention are mirrored in the provisions of the CRPD. \uf0b7 The priority areas in the current Disability Strategy span various competences of the EU and the Member States. \uf0b7 The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 provided that the EU would (among other things) adopt legislative and other instruments, such as standardisation mandates; adopt market-based strategies; support Member State action in a range of fields; as well as take awareness-raising and educational measures. \uf0b7 The implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 and the CRPD have been facilitated by the institutional infrastructure that is in place at EU level, including the EU Monitoring Framework for the CRPD. \uf0b7 The current European Disability Strategy has been described as to implement the CRPD and the commitments of the EU arising from the conclusion of the UN Convention. However, key actors have criticised a number of aspects related to the design of the current Strategy. ",

In that regard, sub-section 2.1.1 examines the evolution of EU disability policy from the 1970s up to the present day, while sub-section 2.1.2 addresses the institutional architecture on disability policy at EU level. Sub-section 2.1.3 examines the areas of the CRPD that are particularly relevant to both the current and new Strategy, while sub-section 2.1.4 presents the content of the current European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. 2.1.1 The Evolution of European Union Policy on Disability The earliest European actions in the field of disability can be traced back to the 1970s. 26 These initiatives primarily took the form of soft law instruments designed to enhance the exchange of information between Member States, and were confined to the areas of employment and vocational training. 27 Since 1983, the European Commission has supported several action programmes designed to promote networking among rehabilitation and education professionals. 28 The third disability action programme (HELIOS II) 29 of the European Commission, in place between 1993-1996, was deemed to mark an 30 Its aim was to promote equal opportunities for, and the integration of, people with disabilities.

The constitutional developments brought about by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the proclamation of the CFR , according to Broderick and Ferri. 47 In 2003, the EU Disability Action Plan 2003-2010 (DAP) 48 was adopted. In a similar vein to the 1996 Strategy, the DAP was informed by the social model of disability, and it aimed to mainstream disability issues across all EU policies; however, unlike the 1996 Strategy, it identified specific areas where the EU would take action for each two-year period. The DAP covered the period 2003-2010 and had the following policy priorities: in 2004-2005, it focused on employment; 49 in 2006-2007, it focused on active inclusion; 50 and, in 2008-2009, it focused on accessibility. 51 Notably, these are still core areas of EU action under the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. The developments that occurred in the 1990s and in the 2000s led to greater mainstreaming of disability in EU law and policy, and to the emergence of disability law as a distinct field of EU action. 52 Disability issues are now mentioned in several policy documents at EU level, such as the Education and Training 2020 (ET 2020) framework, 53 Equality, 54 among others.

The EU had signed the Treaty in April 2014. The Marrakesh Treaty aims at facilitating the availability and cross-border exchange of books and other print material in formats that are accessible to persons with print disabilities. It requires Parties to provide exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights for the benefit of blind, visually impaired and otherwise print-disabled persons. 66 2.1.2 The EU Institutional Architecture on Disability Policy From the outset, it is important to note that the disability infrastructure at EU level has evolved over the course of the current Strategy. 67 Unit has moved from the Directorate-General (DG) for Justice and Consumers (DG JUST) to the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL). Officers in this Unit are assigned to follow particular countries and coordinate specific activities related to disability policy. It is also noteworthy that the Commission convenes a Disability High-Level Group (DHLG), which brings together senior officials from Member State administrations. In addition, the Commission has funded the Academic Network of European Disability experts (ANED), which carried out analysis of specific aspects of EU and national disability policy. ANED was established by the Commission in 2008, in order to provide advice to its Disability Policy Unit. The European Parliament also has an important role to play in monitoring and supporting the disability-related work of the EU, and, for example, regularly draws attention to the situation of disabled people in its Resolutions on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union. 68 Moreover, many individual Committees in the Parliament are active on disability issues. The Petitions Committee, for example, regularly examines petitions which raise disability-related issues, 69 while the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs addresses disability issues from multiple perspectives, including migration, asylum and disability; discrimination and equality; fundamental rights; political participation; citizenship; and free movement. The institutional infrastructure that is in place at EU level, as outlined above, has not only contributed to CRPD implementation but also to the implementation of the current European Disability Strategy. 65 Council Decision (EU) 2018/254 of 15 February 2018 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled [2018) OJ L 48/1, 66 See Modernisation of the European Copyright Rules: The Marrakesh Treaty Implementation Framework, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-connected-digital-single-market/file-the-marrakesh-treaty- implementation-framework. 67 with Disabilities.

The Strategy recognises that accessibility 82 Accessibility is also mentioned as one of the general principles of the UN Convention in led out in Article 9 CRPD, which requires Parties, including the EU, to take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies (ICT) and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public. Parties to the CRPD are required to identify and eliminate barriers to accessibility in buildings, roads, transportation, as well as in other facilities (including schools, housing, medical facilities and workplaces). In addition, goods and services, such as ICT and other services specifically electronic and emergency services must be made accessible. Notably, the accessibility obligations in Article 9 are of transversal application across the CRPD.

Furthermore, Article 4(3) CRPD requires close consultation with, and active involvement of, persons with disabilities, through their representative organisations, in the development and implementation of legislation and policies, and in all decision-making processes concerning issues relating to individuals with disabilities. 87 iii) Equality The European Disability Strategy 2010- on the basis of disability that exists within the EU. 88 The principle of non-discrimination has been . 89 Article 5 CRPD (on equality) has a broad remit, while the definition of discrimination on the basis of disability is contained in Article 2 CRPD. Article 2 CRPD covers many different forms of discrimination, including direct and indirect discrimination, and it classifies an unjustified denial of reasonable accommodation as a distinct form of discrimination. 90 In addition, the definition of discrimination on the basis of disability may be understood as meaning that harassment is covered discrimination, as well as an instruction to discriminate, 91 although the latter form of discrimination was not mentioned by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in its General Comment No. 6 on Equality and Non- Discrimination.

The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also recommended that the EU ensure that all forms of discrimination on the ground of disability are prohibited under EU law, including multiple and intersectional discrimination. 94 iv) Employment In relation to employment, the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 people with disabilities to earn their living on the open labour mark 95 This mirrors the approach taken under Article 27 of the UN Convention, which sets out the right of persons with disabilities to work, on an equal basis with others, and to gain a living by work freely chosen or accepted in a labour market that is open, inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities. In that connection, in its Concluding Observations on the initial report of the EU, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommended that the EU should take effective action to measure the employment situation of persons with disabilities and to increase their employment rate in the open labour market, including by providing training for Member States on reasonable accommodation and accessibility in the context of employment . 96 v) Education and Training The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 provides that the European Commission will support the goal of inclusive, quality education and training, while fully respecting the responsibility of the Member States for the content of teaching and organisation of education systems. 97 The key obligation contained in Article 24 CRPD, on education, is that of ensuring Article 24 seeks to ensure equality of access to all levels of education (primary, secondary and tertiary education, as well as vocational training, adult education and lifelong learning), and the provision of equal opportunities through reasonable accommodation and effective, individualised support measures, as well as the training of professionals and staff working with persons with disabilities.

In its Concluding Observations on the initial report of the EU, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommended that the EU take urgent measures, in cooperation with its Member States and DPOs, to prevent further adverse and retrogressive effects of austerity measures, including by setti respects the core of the right to an adequate standard of living and social protection. 100 vii) Health The focus of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 in the field of healthcare is on policy development to ensure equal access to healthcare, including quality health and rehabilitation services, CRPD, Parties to the UN Convention recognise that persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability. Parties to the CRPD have undertaken to adopt all appropriate measures to ensure access for persons with disabilities to health services that are gender-sensitive, including health-related rehabilitation. Pursuant to Article 26 CRPD, Parties must organise, strengthen and extend comprehensive habilitation and rehabilitation services and programmes, particularly in the areas of health, employment, education and social services. In its Concluding Observations , the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommended that the EU evaluate the impact of Directive 2011/24/EU 101 on patients rights in cross-border health care with regard to gaps in access for persons with disabilities, including accessible information, reasonable accommodation and training of professionals. 102 viii) External Action With regard to EU external action, the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 undertakes to promote the rights of persons with disabilities, among others, in EU development programmes.

In that regard, a key EU action in the current Strategy is the pledge to support research on healthcare provision to women and men with disabilities through the Seventh and Eight Framework Programmes (FP7 and FP8) actions. 142 \\ Other actions envisaged under the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 include the EU institutions promoting dialogue among Member States in the DHLG on the portability of rights, such as the right to personal assistance. 143 The Strategy also indicated that the EU institutions would raise disability matters in the context of education through the Open Method of Coordination (OMC). 144 133 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, p. 7; and European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, List of Actions, p. 11. 134 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, List of Actions, p. 10. 135 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, p. 8. 136 See: https://ec.europa.eu/youthonthemove/. 137 See: https://www.welcomeurope.com/european-funds/llp-lifelong-learning-programme- 585+485.html#tab=onglet_details. 138 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, p. 8. 139 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, List of Actions, p. 15. 140 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, p. 5. 141 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, List of Actions, p. 16. 142 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, List of Actions, p. 15. 143 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, List of Actions, p. 7. 144 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, List of Actions, p. 13.

Section 3.2 discusses the impact of the current European Disability Strategy, while section 3.3 discusses the achievements and shortcomings associated with it. 3.1 Implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 As noted in chapter 1 of this study, the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 has the overall aim to participating in society and in the European economy, notably 184 In light of this aim, the Strategy identifies overarching goals for its eight main priority areas of action and four sets of general implementation instruments. This set of goals was supplemented and made more specific by the list of proposed actions covering the period 2010-2015 that accompanied the publication of the Strategy. This list of proposed actions has become highly important in assessing the implementation of the Strategy, and assessments and evaluations of the Strategy have paid significant attention to whether each of the actions identified on the list was taken or not. However, in assessing the implementation of the Strategy, one should also pay attention to a number of other issues, including (changes in) the situation of people with disabilities in Europe over the lifetime of the Strategy, as revealed through Eurostat statistics and as presented by ANED. One should also note that several key instruments, which can, in fact, be regarded as contributing to the implementation of the Strategy, were not mentioned in the list of proposed action published in 2010. Moreover, as mentioned above, one should recall that the list of actions only covers the first five years of the Strategy, and no comparable list of intended actions was published for the second period of the current Strategy. Therefore, any assessment solely based on this list is highly limited. Several of the sub-sections which follow detail the various evaluations of, and consultations on, the Strategy that have taken place since 2015.

The factors which were most frequently identified as determining progress, even if limited, were interest groups and non-governmental advocacy, and public opinion/changes of mentality. EU funding and EU policy actions were identified as factors determining progress by about 10% of respondents. Organisations had a slightly more favourable view of the impact of these factors than did individuals. Lastly, the four factors most frequently identified as the main obstacles to quicker progress were lack -related needs, lack of awareness among non-disabled people, and lack of human and financial resources. Between 11.47% of respondents (this was the rate for individuals, in the case of lack of human and financial resources) and 16.18% of respondents (individuals, in the case of lack of political will) identified these factors as obstacles. In addition, 9.21% of respondents from organisations identified that there was a need for a new action plan based on the recommendations contained in the Concluding Observations issued to the EU by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Having identified the overall findings which emerged from the public consultation, some specific issues raised by key stakeholders in their individual responses to the consultation are outlined below. This is possible because many organisations published their response online, and these remain available. The European Disability Forum was strongly of the opinion that the Concluding Observations issued [ ] be used to develop a new action plan for the remaining years covered by the Strategy 2016- , 187 and its response quoted from the Concluding Observations. EDF noted that the current the economic crisis on the rights of per 188 Therefore, amongst the broader policy related suggestions were for the revised Strategy to have greater coordination with the European economic strategy (Europe 2020) and the European economic governance policy mechanism (European Semester), and for the European Disability Strategy to be part of the Social Pillar. 189 EDF argued that there was little in the current Strategy which promotes autonomy, and recommended role to promote sharing of best- practice on supported decision- 190 EDF also proposed that a number of other areas should receive (more) attention in the revised Strategy, including political participation, awareness-raising and 187 available at: http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-strategy-europe-2020. 188 -6. 189 e Review of the European Disability Strategy, Brussels, March 2016, pp. 5-6. 190 ",

Key points made in some of those submissions are presented below. However, given the time that has passed since the consultation, some submissions are no longer available online, and the following information therefore does not cover all submissions made by European-level disability-specific DPOs. Inclusion Europe , which represents organisations of people with intellectual disabilities and their families, carried out a survey of its members prior to submitting its response to the public consultation. 197 Their response focused on the barriers that their members faced in their day-to-day lives and made recommendations as to how the situation could be improved. 198 The response noted that deprivation of legal capacity for persons with intellectual disabilities is the greatest barrier to a new area of action in the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. 199 The European Union of the Deaf (EUD) also carried out a survey of its members prior to responding to the public consultation.

The original intention was that a progress report on the Strategy would be published in 2013, and this would provide the basis for an update of the list of actions to cover the second half of the Strategy (2016-2020) and, if necessary, a revision of the Strategy.

The Report noted that the Strategy the CRPD. 207 208 priority areas of the Strategy, and listed those actions. The actions indicated are not confined to the measures identified in the 2010- 2015 list of actions. 209 However, occasionally actions listed as linked to the Strategy in fact seem unrelated, such as judgments of the Court of Justice on the European Union (CJEU) on the interpretation of provisions of the Employment Equality Directive. 210 Nevertheless, such judgments are an important dimension of the action that the EU is taking in the field of disability. The Report noted that progress had been made in all eight areas, with major progress achieved in the area of accessibility, in particular. This was linked to the adoption of the Directive on Web Accessibility and the proposal for an EAA, 211 which was subsequently adopted in 2019. In addition, it also noted that successful efforts in external action had been recognised by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in its Concluding Observations to the EU. 212 Less progress was identified regarding employment and education. The Progress Report found that the objectives of the Strategy remained relevant and that the Commission was mainstreaming disability in all relevant policy areas. the Strat committed to implementing the Strategy to its full extent. 213 It noted that, in light of the dialogue with the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the recommendations it made for further action, challenges remained in all eight areas, and the Commission was taking account of the 214 Several ongoing actions were identified, including a commitment to adopt the 2008 proposal for an equal treatment Directive and efforts to improve accessibility for all, 207 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document, Progress Report on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2010-2020), Brussels, 2 February 2017, SWD(2017) 29 final, p. 2, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1484&langId=en. 208 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document, Progress Report on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2010-2020), Brussels, 2 February 2017, SWD(2017) 29 final, p. 2. 209 See European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document Accompanying the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, The Council, The European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, European Disability Strategy 2010-2020: A Renewed Commitment to a Barrier-Free Europe, Initial Plan to Implement the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020: List of Actions 2010-2015, {COM(2010) 636 final} {SEC(2010) 1323 final} SEC(2010) 1324 final, Brussels, 15 November 2010 (European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, List of Actions), available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52010SC1324. 210 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document, Progress Report on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2010-2020), Brussels, 2 February 2017, SWD(2017) 29 final, p. 8, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1484&langId=en. 211 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document, Progress Report on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2010-2020), Brussels, 2 February 2017, SWD(2017) 29 final, p. 2. 212 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document, Progress Report on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2010-2020), Brussels, 2 February 2017, SWD(2017) 29 final, p. 2. 213 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document, Progress Report on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2010-2020), Brussels, 2 February 2017, SWD(2017) 29 final, p. 19. 214 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document, Progress Report on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2010-2020), Brussels, 2 February 2017, SWD(2017) 29 final, p. 19.

It noted that access to the labour market was one of the main challenges facing people with disabilities. I 219 It also noted that many people with disabilities were unable to access inclusive quality education, and were much more likely to leave education and training earlier than people without disabilities (22.5% of young people with disabilities, compared to 11% of young people without disabilities), and more likely to be at risk of poverty (30% of people with disabilities, compared to 21.5% of people without disabilities). These calculations were based on EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) data from 2014. 220 In short, the Commission report indicated a serious commitment to the ongoing implementation of the Strategy; presented the ongoing, disadvantaged situation of persons with disabilities in Europe, as revealed through statistical data; identified numerous actions that the EU had taken which could be linked to the Strategy; and indicated a desire to take further action, including acting on recommendations of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, it did not explicitly address problems and obstacles that arose in the implementation of the Strategy, or reflect on how to overcome those. 3.1.3 Views and Recommendations of the European Parliament on the Mid-term Evaluation of the European Disability Strategy 2010- The European Parliament has taken an active interest in the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 and, more broadly, the conclusion and implementation of the CRPD by the EU.

It also called on the Commission to ensure that the revision took into account the needs of, and barriers faced by, persons with psychosocial disabilities, with a new specific action area covering autonomy, and for it to ensure meaningful consultation with DPOs and disability- allied organisations when developing or reviewing key disability policies. 260 In 2019, MHE published a second position paper in which it assessed the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. 261 This paper primarily reflected on the priorities for the new European Disability Strategy and, in this respect, the paper repeated many of the priorities which were previously mentioned in its 2017 Position Paper. 262 In line with the Commis Position Paper of MHE noted that most progress had been made in the areas of accessibility and proposals based on the eight action areas of the Strategy have not always led to ambitious policies, nor have [they] led to the rights of persons with disabilities [being] fully 263 does not mention relevant policy developments that have taken place after its adoption, nor were these integrated after the 2016 mid- 264 It also found that it was: a pity that the Strategy was not designed nor reviewed to cover all the provisions of the UN CRPD and the [Concluding Observations].

ENIL highlighted several recommendations from the UN Committee which it believed should be implemented as a matter of priority, some of which related to deinstitutionalisation. ENIL made a number of suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the Strategy, including identifying departments and units within the Commission responsible for coordination of implementation; establishing a mechanism for monitoring and evaluation, including identifying how user-led organisations would be involved; allocating resources for implementing the Strategy; and clear measurable actions linked to a specific timeframe. ENIL also called on the Commission to publish annual updates on the implementation of the current Strategy, not only highlighting areas where progress has been made, but also focusing on setbacks, delays and areas for improvement; and to provide training on the CRPD and the Strategy, in cooperation with user-led organisations, for everyone involved in implementing the Strategy. 268 The European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities (EASPD) published a Review of the European Disability Strategy in 2017. 269 The Review was based on responses given by 33 of its members, from 19 countries, to a questionnaire. EASPD was of the view that support services should be recognised as key facilitators of CRPD implementation and that the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 should help service providers to achieve this. Consequently, EASPD reviewed the extent to which the Strategy had assisted disability service providers in the implementation of the CRPD. The answers to the questionnaire carried out by EASPD indicated that the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 was not universally understood or applied by organisations operating at national or mostly aware of the existence of the Strategy, many of them did not refer to it for guidance in their work. In two thirds of cases, this was because either the CRPD or a national Strategy was regarded as more relevant to the work of the organisations, while insufficient knowledge about the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 was a reason for the remaining third. The Review identified several challenges that were, in the view of EASPD members, hampering achievements in several of the fields addressed by the Strategy. With regard to accessibility, two key challenges were identified: a lack of resources and funding, particularly for the alteration of physical infrastructure, to make all buildings universally accessible; and, at all levels, a lack of awareness about disability and the prevalence of traditional attitudes. The latter was also identified as the biggest challenge to achieving progress in the field of participation. With regard to education, identified ; inappropriate (implementation of) local or national strategies; a lack of funding and specialised teaching assistants to support a unified strategy for inclusion, and the need to mainstream inclusive training into teaching qualifications. With regard to employment, overall high unemployment rates were seen as a challenge in some countries.

The EASPD Review contained recommendations for further action in all five covered areas, including campaigns to change attitudes and awareness, and the creation and implementation of effective national or local legislation and policy to support social services in the implementation of the CRPD. The EASPD Review concluded that the Strategy: supports our members through its aim to support national efforts in the key areas of action [...] More can be done however and the European Commission must make the [Strategy] more relevant to service providers and acknowledge the important role support services play in the empowerment of people with disabilities to full implementation of the UN CRPD. 270 The European Platform for Rehabilitation (EPR) also published an analysis of the Mid-term Review and proposals for the future development of the Strategy. 271 With regard to the Progress Report, it noted that: [t]he most critical point of the review is the slow improvement of life of people with disabilities between the start of the Strategy in 2010 and 2015, despite the advocacy work carried out by interest groups and organisations working with people with disabilities. Lack of political will and understanding by policy makers of disability- rights are advancing in the European Union. 272 The analysis by EPR summarised some of the find views on the future development of the Strategy. EPR not only expressed the view that the new European Disability Strategy should show clear commitment and advancement in the areas of employment, education and social inclusion, 273 but also made several suggestions for issues to be addressed in the period 2015-2020. EPR called for work to be done on models to promote successful integration and employment of people with disabilities in the labour market, and particularly supported employment models; greater moves towards inclusive education models, and investment in national education programmes and vocational training; and work on high-quality social services with an emphasis on person-centred, community-based care and independent living. 270 271 -2020: Analysis of the Mid- at: https://www.epr.eu/wp-content/uploads/European-Disability-Strategy-Mid-Term-Review-and-Future-Strategy.pdf. 272 2010-2020: Analysis of the Mid- -3. 273 -2020: Analysis of the Mid- available at: https://www.epr.eu/wp-content/uploads/European-Disability-Strategy-Mid-Term-Review-and-Future- Strategy.pdf.

This was a modest consultation exercise (inception impact assessment), linked to an evaluation roadmap 275 and the Better Regulation Agenda, 276 which preceded the larger public consultation on the future of the European Disability Strategy, held in 2019. 277 Several brief responses from organisations were received, most of 278 Some of these submissions are noted below. The response of the European Disability Forum listed a number of points to be considered in developing a new Strategy, including the direct involvement of persons with disabilities in the planning and development of the new Strategy, and the full inclusion of the recommendations of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

It argued that part of the consultation should be focused on how the CRPD could be implemented through other European initiatives, including the next MFF, the European Semester, the Social Pillar, the Digital Single Market, and UN initiatives such as the SDGs. 282 Social Economy Europe , which is the umbrella organisation representing the social economy sector across the EU, stated that it believed that the current European Disability Strategy had not lived up to expectations, and noted that neither the 2008 proposed equality Directive nor (at that time) the EAA, had been adopted. Social Economy Europe called for the new European Disability Strategy to look specifically at, and promote the role that, social economy enterprises could play in improving the integration of people with disabilities. 283 In addition to these European-level organisations, several national organisations made submissions. The Spanish non-governmental organisation, CERMI, made two submissions, which called for a new Strategy which complied with the CRPD, and which was aligned with the SDGs and the Social Pillar. CERMI felt that the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 lacked the necessary mechanisms to implement the fundamental principles of the CRPD. It also expressed the view that the new Strategy should include the development, coordination, sharing and monitoring of national disability plans. 284 A second Spanish organisation, ONCE , also made a submission. ONCE works with people who are blind or have a visual impairment. This submission was largely the same as the longer contribution made by CERMI. Like CERMI, it regarded the European Disability Strategy 2010- disability policies were addressed. However, it felt that both the Strategy and the way in which it was executed had suffered from deficiencies, which should be addressed in the future. 285 A third Spanish organisation, COCEMFE , paid particular attention to the need for a much stronger gender dimension, addressing the situation of women with disabilities in the new Strategy. In its view, this should include collection of data disaggregated by sex; inclusion of gender and disability indicators in studies conducted by Eurostat and evaluations of the European Disability Strategy; positive action, to reduce the inequalities experienced by women with disabilities; and addressing issues that 281 Feedback from: MHE, 26 October 2018, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2018- 4958882/feedback/F14559_en?p_id=305847. 282 Feedback from: COFACE Families Europe, 25 October 2018, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better- regulation/initiatives/ares-2018-4958882/feedback/F14531_en?p_id=305847. 283 Feedback from: Social Economy Europe, 26 October 2018, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better- regulation/initiatives/ares-2018-4958882/feedback/F14558_en?p_id=305847. 284 Feedback from: CERMI, 19 October 2018, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares- 2018-4958882/feedback/F14409_en?p_id=305847 and Feedback from: CERMI, 26 October 2018, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2018-4958882/feedback/F14560_en?p_id=305847. 285 Feedback from: Grupo Social ONCE, 26 October 2018, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better- regulation/initiatives/ares-2018-4958882/feedback/F14563_en?p_id=305847.

The consultation ran between 31 July and 13 November 2019, and received 2,547 responses, which is considerably more than the 2009 consultation (336 responses) and the 2015/2016 consultation (1,518 responses). However, not all respondents addressed all questions. Nevertheless, this high response rate indicates a greater awareness of the Strategy amongst individuals and stakeholders, and greater engagement with the Strategy. Prior to launching this open consultation, DG EMPL (within the Commission) also organised two surveys relating to the evaluation of the current Strategy. These were directed at CSOs and representatives of Member States respectively. Some information on the findings of these surveys were presented at the European Day of Persons with Disabilities in November 2019. The information presented here is therefore based on the information made available at the European Day. 288 In addition, the responses of some DPOs and CSOs to the public consultation were published online, and these are briefly presented below. The public consultation addressed several important issues related to the assessment of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. One issue that was addressed was whether the situation of people with disabilities had improved over the lifetime of the Strategy. 56% of respondents agreed, or somewhat agreed, that the situation had improved, although this does not necessarily imply that the Strategy was regarded as the cause of the improvement. Many other important developments have occurred over the relevant period, not least of all the ratification by Member States of the CRPD, and this may have been a relevant factor for some respondents. 31% of respondents disagreed, or somewhat disagreed, with the statement that the situation had improved.

This question was therefore specifically linked to the impact of the Strategy. 52% of respondents agreed, or somewhat agreed, that the Strategy had led to improvements at the national level; while 27% disagreed, or somewhat disagreed, that this was the case.

        "IPOL | ional Affairs 66 PE 656.398 The eight priority areas of action covered in the Strategy were regarded as relevant for future work by the majority of respondents (N= 1052). With the exception of external action, all areas of action were regarded as relevant for future activities by between 74% and 78% of respondents, indicating quite a high level of support for further action in these seven areas. External action was regarded as having an ongoing relevance by a noticeably smaller number of respondents: only 55% of respondents thought that this was the case. The consultation also asked respondents to identify specific issues which should be considered in future work (N= 1401). Many of the issues identified as relevant for the future, such as accessibility of buildings and public services, independent living and inclusion in the community, work and employment, health, equality and non-discrimination, and inclusive education and training, clearly fall within the eight priority areas of action in the current Strategy, and this reinforces the view that such areas should be covered in the future. However, some issues, such as ageing and disability (identified by 51% of respondents as a relevant issue); children with disabilities and their families (identified by 49% of respondents as a relevant issue); and housing (identified by 35% of respondents as a relevant issue) perhaps have a lower profile within the current Strategy. The survey, carried out by DG EMPL, of CSOs was responded to by 87 organisations, and also revealed relevant findings. Regarding EU funding for the current Strategy, only 7% of respondents somewhat agreed with the statement that EU funding to support the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 had been adequate and proportionate. 74% of respondents disagreed, or somewhat disagreed, with that statement, indicating significant concern amongst civil society regarding the funding of the Strategy. 3.1.8 Views of Academics on the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 The adoption of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 was deemed by Broderick and Ferri to g point in the ongoing process of creating a coherent and comprehensive EU policy framework on disability it identified cross-cutting EU-level actions which, combined with national measures, were designed to empower people with disabilities and to ensure 289 to promote social inclusion by promoting equality through a rights- 290 Waddington highlighted the fact that the 2010- - in nature 291 In a similar vein, Hosking viewed the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 as representing a high-level statement of the objectives and subject areas of EU disability policy . 292 He noted that the current Strategy updated ves which had featured in earlier 289 Broderick, A. and Ferri, D., International and European Disability Law and Policy: Text, Cases and Materials , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2019, p. 365. 290 e Course: The European Disability Strategy 2010- in Waddington, L., Quinn, G. and Flynn, E.

The information presented here is therefore based on the information made available at the European Day. 324 The evaluation is intended to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and added value of the Strategy, and also to provide conclusions and recommendation to support the development of a new Strategy. Amongst the sources of information drawn on by ICF when evaluating the current Strategy are the results of the public consultation carried out by the European Commission CSOs, which were both referred to above, as well as a mapping of the actions taken by the EU, EU level stakeholder interviews, interviews and focus groups at Member State level, and further analysis and consultation. In terms of assessing implementation, the evaluation pays particular attention to identifying which actions contained in the 2010-2015 list of actions which accompanied the adoption of the current Strategy have, in fact, been implemented. The relevant information regarding actions taken by the EU is presented below in section 3.1.10. In the view of ICF, the current Strategy is considered to have strong internal coherence. However, while the Strategy is regarded as generally coherent with EU policy, that coherence is also hindered by limited inter-institutional coordination mechanisms.

ICF feels that the Strategy has contributed to a change in the overall policy discourse and a move towards a human rights approach to disability. It notes that stakeholders appreciated the Strategy as an important tool contributing to the implementation of the CRPD, and as having influenced the development of important legislative instruments. However, ICF also believes that there is room for improvement. It notes that the lack of a baseline and a monitoring framework for the Strategy made it difficult to monitor implementation continuously, and that it is necessary to consider the implementation of related policies and measures at Member State level in order to assess the long- term impact of the Strategy. It feels that the coherence of the Strategy with other EU policies may have benefitted greater mainstreaming through dedicated responsible experts in the EU institutions, 325 and that a dedicated budget for the implementation of the Strategy would have enabled more actions to have been implemented. 3.1.10 The Current State of Implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 information currently available regarding the final evaluation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 reveal the wide range of instruments adopted, and the action taken, at EU level to implement the Strategy. The 2017 Progress Report clearly identifies the key achievements and actions taken in each area, and it appears that the Final Evaluation Report will also pay particular attention to such issues. ICF, which is carrying out the final evaluation, presented some preliminary findings at the European Day of Persons with Disabilities in November 2019. 326 As well as presenting some findings from the public consultation and survey of CSOs, it addressed the extent to which the EU has adopted the actions contained in the 2010-2015 list of actions which accompanied the adoption of the Strategy in 2010.

EU Level Actions Implemented in the 8 Priority Areas of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 For most areas, the majority of actions listed for the 2010-2015 period have been achieved, or implemented in full. This is only not the case for the actions specified in the fields of education and training, and external action. However, the vast majority of listed actions for all eight priority areas of the Strategy have been achieved or partially achieved, and only a fairly small number ranging between 9% and 4% were not achieved at all. The quantitative dimension to implementation has therefore been identified and evaluated to quite some degree in both the 2017 Progress Report and the upcoming final evaluation. However, it is worth recalling that a second list of actions covering the period 2016-2020 was never adopted, and therefore a clear set of goals and activities for this second period, against which an evaluation can take place, is not available. Moreover, the lack of an initial baseline study has also hampered quantitative, as well as qualitative, evaluations. In the view of the authors of this study, a further challenge is the difficultly, in some cases, in linking EU action to the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. Not all EU action which is relevant to people with disabilities is explicitly linked to the Strategy and, in the absence of a list of comprehensive, planned actions covering the whole period of the Strategy, it can be difficult to establish a link between a particular action and the Strategy, and to know whether the Strategy had any role to play in the adoption of the relevant action. 36 58 67 75 81 82 67 18 55 33 26 19 15 18 33 82 9 8 7 6 4 Not achieved Partially achieved Achieved Source: PowerPoint accompanying the presentation by Dr. Katerina Mantouvalou of ICF on the Study supporting the evaluation of the European Disability Strategy, presented on 28 November 2019 at the European Day of Persons with Disabilities,Brussels.

This means that the impact, significance and effectiveness of the large number of actions has hardly been assessed. 332 The fact that a particular instrument has been adopted, and that this is linked to the Strategy, does not mean that it will necessarily lead to positive changes to the lives of people with disabilities. Therefore, it is important to not only identify what action has been taken, but also what impact, if any, that has had on the lives of people with disabilities. In a very broad way, the views of individuals and organisations were sought on this issue in the 2019 public consultation, and some cautiously positive results were revealed, with 52% of 1,052 respondents 327 European Parliament, Briefing Implementation in Action: The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 (Author: Irmgard Anlmayer), European Parliamentary Research Services, 10 July 2017, PE 603.252, p. 7, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2017)603252. 328 European Parliament, Briefing Implementation in Action: The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 (Author: Irmgard Anlmayer), European Parliamentary Research Services, 10 July 2017, PE 603.252, p. 7. 329 European Parliament, Briefing Implementation in Action: The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 (Author: Irmgard Anlmayer), European Parliamentary Research Services, 10 July 2017, PE 603.252, p. 7. 330 sability Strategy 2010- in Waddington, L., Quinn, G. and Flynn, E.

It is also worth noting that ANED has monitored the situation of persons with disabilities in the EU using data from EU-SILC. This data provides some information on the (changing) situation of persons with disabilities, compared to persons without disabilities, in key areas covered by the Strategy. The most relevant data compiled by ANED from the perspective of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 relates to employment and education, which are both amongst the eight priority areas of action in the current Strategy. The data reveals relatively little change in the situation of persons with disabilities, relative to persons without disabilities, over the covered period (2008-2017). ANED has also compiled data on the risk of poverty. In terms of changes in the employment situation of persons with disabilities during the first seven years of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, the data collated by ANED reveals a slight percentage increase in the overall employment rate of persons with disabilities. This is also the case for the overall employment rate of people without disabilities, meaning that there has been an increase in the overall employment rate of persons with and without disabilities over this period. However, persons with disabilities remain more likely to not be in employment than persons without disabilities. In 2012, there was a 16.6 percentage gap in the employment rate of people with disabilities compared to all people (both with and without disabilities); by 2016, which is the last year for which ANED has presented the relevant data, that gap had increased to 18.6%. Data is also available on the employment rate of people with and without disabilities between 2014 and 2017. In 2014, 47.8% of people with disabilities were in employment in the EU compared to 68.1% of people without disabilities, indicating a 20.3 percentage gap. By 2017, the employment rate for people with disabilities had risen slightly to 49.6%, whilst the relevant figure was 70.5% for people without disabilities, indicating a slightly increased percentage gap of 20.9.

However, in some cases, no significant improvement has occurred. This is the case for the overall employment rate and the risk of poverty or exclusion for people aged 16-64. Where improvements have occurred, they have occurred across the board, and persons with disabilities have not seen their situation improve relative to persons without disabilities. This indicates that factors other than the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, such as the general economic situation, have influenced the changing situation. In short, the Strategy has, it seems, not led to an overall improvement in the situation of persons with disabilities in these areas over the period covered by these statistics. 3.3 Achievements and Shortcomings of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 This next two sub-sections identify achievements and shortcomings of the current Strategy in terms of its design and implementation. 3.3.1 Achievements The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, in conjunction with the conclusion of the CRPD, has contributed towards embedding a human rights approach to disability in the policy discourse at EU level. The current Strategy, in combination with many other important legislative and policy developments at international and EU level, has helped to increase the awareness of disability-related issues and impacted, in a positive sense, on how the EU responds to such issues. Moreover, the high level of engagement with the latest public consultation on the Strategy reveals both the degree of awareness about the Strategy and EU action, and the importance attached to such action. The current Strategy has contributed to the taking of many important initiatives, including significantly the adoption of legislation in the field of accessibility, related specifically to the accessibility of goods and services, ICT and transport. Legal instruments, such as the Public Sector Web Accessibility Directive 334 and the EAA, 335 can be expected to have a significant impact at Member State level in the long term, if implemented in full and monitored, and represent major achievements in terms of their potential to enhance accessibility for persons with disabilities. The Strategy is referenced in the preamble to both instruments. In addition, in 2010 and 2011 shortly after the current European Disability Strategy came into effect the EU institutions adopted further Regulations on passenger rights: 336 In 2010, the EU adopted a Regulation on the rights of passengers when travelling by sea and 334 Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies [2016] OJ L 327/1. 335 Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on the accessibility requirements for products and services (European Accessibility Act) [2019] OJ L 151/7. 336 See previous Regulations in the field of transport: Regulation (EC) 1107/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 concerning the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air [2006] OJ L 204/1; Regulation (EC) 1371/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on rail ",

Moreover, further standardisation mandates were adopted in the fields of accessibility 339 and Design for All 340 during the course of the current Strategy. The level of activity by the EU institutions in the field of accessibility is most likely due to the competence the EU has to act in that field and its interest in facilitating the proper functioning of the internal market. It may also be attributable to the contribution of staff in DG EMPL in helping to push forward key initiatives, such as the EAA, and indeed to the advocacy efforts of civil society organisations (CSOs). Two of these factors (the role of civil society and the interest in promoting the proper functioning of the internal market) are confirmed by Priestley in the context of the EAA, when he notes that period of lobbying from civil society supported by the accumulation of an evidence base, published in 341 These studies highlighted, as Priestley pointed out, how: differences in national legal requirements and the variety of practices used by contracting authorities, including on accessibility, constitute a barrier to cross-border public procurement and provided the rationale for legislation, identified by 342 In addition to legislative initiatives, several funding initiatives of the EU institutions in various areas contributed to realising the goals of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. For instance, in the field of external action, Bridging the Gap 343 a project funded by the Directorate-General for contributed to realising the objectives of the current European Disability Strategy by facilitating the socio-economic inclusion of people with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries through more inclusive and accessible institutions and policies. There has also been an increase in mainstreaming disability issues across a broad range of policy areas during the lifetime of the current Strategy. This is reflected at the legislative level, in instruments such 337 Regulation (EU) 1177/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 concerning the rights of passengers when travelling by sea and inland waterway and amending Regulation (EC) No. 2006/2004 [2010] OJ L 334/1. 338 Regulation (EU) Regulation 181/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport and amending Regulation (EC) No. 2006/2004 [2011] OJ L 55/1. 339 See M/376 Standardisation Mandate in support of European accessibility requirements for public procurement of products and services in the ICT domain; and M/420 Standardisation Mandate in support of European accessibility requirements for public procurement in the built environment. 340 See also the recently published standard on Accessibility following a Design for All approach in products, goods and Services - extending the range of users. 341 Priestley, M., The Protection Role of the Committee on Petitions in the Context of the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Study for the PETI Committee), Directorate General for Internal Policies, 2016, p. 39 (footnote not included), available at: https://euagenda.eu/upload/publications/untitled-70600-ea.pdf. 342 Priestley, M., The Protection Role of the Committee on Petitions in the Context of the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Study for the PETI Committee), Directorate General for Internal Policies, 2016, p. 39. 343 See: https://bridgingthegap-project.eu/about-the-project/.

Having said that, neither of these instruments refers to the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, and this makes it difficult to identify a clear link between these important instruments, which mainstream disability-related issues, and the Strategy. Another area where mainstreaming of disability has increasingly occurred is in the European Semester process. During the analysis phase of the European Semester, individual Country Reports are prepared by Commission staff for each Member State. In 2012, U 2020 Country Reports failed to mention disability, while by 2019, almost all reports addressed disability. 346 This reflects an increased engagement with disability mainstreaming in the European Semester process on the part of Commission staff. This increase in disability mainstreaming is also reflected in a greater number of references to disability in the Country Specific Recommendation fiches, where the references to disability rose from 3 in 2012 to 12 in 2018, and the 2019 Joint Employment Report, which contained 57 references to disability, compared to 7 in 2013. 347 While it is not always possible to make a connection between this greater attention to disability-related issues and disability mainstreaming, and the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, the overall picture is one of greater engagement with disability by the EU legislator and policy maker. Furthermore, the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 has contributed to the establishment of several important fora with a view to facilitating the engagement of key stakeholders. These include the annual Work Forum on the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the EU, which has been organised since 2010, and provides a valuable opportunity for mutual exchange and learning on good practices related to CRPD implementation; and the annual European Day of Persons with Disabilities. Other fora at EU level, such as the DHLG while not established on foot of the Strategy itself have remained important in contributing to the goals of the 2010-2020 European Disability Strategy, by serving as a forum to facilitate (among other things) dialogue between Member States on the portability of personal assistance benefits, as the current Strategy envisaged. 3.3.2 Shortcomings Notwithstanding the achievements noted above, several shortcomings in the design and implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 are notable. 344 Directive (EU) 2018/1808 of the European Parliament and the Council of 14 November 2018 amending Directive 2010/13/EU on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administration action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (amended Audiovisual Media Services Directive) in view of changing market realities [2018] OJ L 303/69. 345 Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Electronic Communications Code (Recast) [2018] OJ L 321/36. 346 Presentation by Professor Mark Priestley to the Eur 347 Europe?

        "IPOL | ional Affairs 82 PE 656.398 The Strategy was intended to ensure the effective implementation of the CRPD across the EU. 348 The 2015 Concluding Observations of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which contained recommendations to the EU regarding the implementation of the UN Convention, could have prompted a reflection on both the appropriateness of the Strategy and the need for revision, in order to better achieve effective implementation. Indeed, the Commission had originally envisaged revising the Strategy mid-term, following an external evaluation, 349 and this evaluation was carried out before the UN the external evaluation and Concluding Observations to the EU did not prompt such a revision, even though many stakeholders called for the adoption of a new action plan based on the recommendations of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This was in spite of the fact that the UN Committee called for clear benchmarks and guidelines on how the recommendations in the Concluding Observations would be incorporated into the implementation of the Strategy during 2016-2020. 350 Whilst the Commission emphasised its commitment to implementing the CRPD in its 2017 Progress Report, including in light of the Concluding Observations, no detailed analysis was undertaken to identify the gaps between the Strategy and full compliance by the EU with the UN Convention, in light of the legal competence of the EU. Detailed benchmarks and guidelines were also not adopted, as called for by the UN Committee. In short, a full review of what action the EU needs to take to implement the CRPD, and how this relates to the current Strategy, has not been undertaken; nor have specific benchmarks and guidelines been adopted in this respect. Furthermore, for most of the current Strategy, a complete set of disaggregated indicators on disability (which comply with the CRPD) was not available, despite the implementation measures envisaged in the current Strategy. A set of draft indicators related to each area of the CRPD has recently been developed within the Bridging the Gap project, and was made available in 2019. 351 Nonetheless, the lack of a complete data set on disability during the course of the current Strategy can be assumed to have been a barrier to implementation of the objectives of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 and those of the CRPD itself, given the importance that both instruments lay on statistics and data collection. Moreover, the lack of disaggregated indicators and data sets hindered targeted implementation objectives in respect of specific groups of people with disabilities. In addition, a gender perspective has not been adequately taken into account in the Strategy. Likewise, disability considerations have not been adequately taken into account in EU gender policies, which seems to indicate a lack of coherence between EU policies in different areas. This lack of coherence is also evident in other areas of EU policy-making, such as the Social Scoreboard, where disability indicators are absent. Moreover, whilst the general goals and objectives of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 concur with the CRPD, more specificity and a targeted approach were arguably required. The lack of specificity in the current Strategy with regard to the particular actions that correspond to particular CRPD articles arguably impaired implementation of the current Strategy to some extent. In addition, no detailed analysis was conducted of the remaining gaps between the obligations of the CRPD and EU disability law and policy, in light of the competence of the EU. 348 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, p. 4. 349 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, p. 11. 350 UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Concluding Observations on the Initial Report of the European Union, 2 October 2015, UN Doc.

        "The Post-2020 European Disability Strategy PE 656.398 83 Furthermore, as noted above, a proposed list of actions to implement the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 covering the period 2010-2015 was published by the Commission in 2010. This list was initially intended to be updated periodically. 352 This did not happen, and the 2017 Progress Report - 353 In spite of the absence of an updated list of actions, the EU did take action, particularly in the second period of the Strategy, which can be linked to the Strategy but which was not referred to in the initial list. However, the failure to adopt a detailed implementation plan (i.e. an updated list of intended actions) covering the second half of the Strategy, may suggest a more ad-hoc and uncoordinated approach to implementation in the second period, and may have hampered the final evaluation, as a check list of intended actions was not available for comparison with actual achievements. Assessing the impact of the 2010-2020 Strategy, which is linked to its implementation, is also hampered by the fact that it was not accompanied by a baseline study, which could be used to identify progress, and the difficulty in attributing some EU action, and indeed Member State action, specifically to the Strategy. A further shortcoming in terms of implementation stems from the fact that while the EU has spent a considerable amount of money on disability-related issues over the lifetime of the Strategy, through, for example, the SIF and funds supporting academic research and training, the Strategy itself did not have its own budget which could be used to support its work. In addition, there was, and still is, no formal coordination or monitoring body within the Commission regarding the Strategy, nor is there a focal point in each DG. Such bodies could have contributed to a greater mainstreaming of disability across all policy areas. In both respects, the institutional structure within the Commission for implementing the Strategy is somewhat limited. While, as demonstrated above, several legislative and other initiatives have been pursued in the field of accessibility and, to a lesser extent, in the fields of employment and external action, the actions identified in a number of other priority areas are lagging behind in terms of implementation. Thus, progress across the priority areas of the current Strategy would seem to be uneven, especially in the fields of social protection and education. This may be attributable to the limited competence of the EU in those fields, although this would not prevent the EU from employing other non-legislative instruments in those areas. Another issue stems from the fact that many of the priority areas and lines of action in the current Strategy fall mainly, or partly, within the competences of the Member States. In that regard, there has been no clear delineation (between EU and Member State levels) of the actions that relate to the various competences at stake; neither has there been an alignment of the current Strategy with the various actions required under the CRPD in the field of between the EU and Member States, the EU has an obligation to ensure that CRPD obligations are fulfilled by using all 352 European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, List of Actions, p. 3 and European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, p. 11. 353 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document, Progress Report on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2010-2020), Brussels, 2 February 2017, SWD(2017) 29 final, p. 19, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1484&langId=en.

        "IPOL | ional Affairs 84 PE 656.398 354 In relation to specific areas of shared competence, however, the procedural requirements in existence at EU level for the adoption of legislative measures have proven to be a complicating factor. This can be seen, for instance, with regard to the adoption of the horizontal equal treatment Directive that was proposed by the European Commission in 2008. That proposal seeks to extend protection from discrimination based on disability (and other grounds) beyond employment to the fields of social protection, including social security; healthcare and social housing; education; and access to and supply of goods and services, including housing. The proposal remains blocked in the Council on account of the fact that unanimity has not (yet) been reached. In 2014, the idea to use enhanced cooperation for the proposed equal treatment D was overwhelmingly rejected in the Council . 355 Recently, a communication from the Commission to the Parliament and other EU institutions has noted that for those areas still governed by unanimity, a change in procedure towards qualified majority voting or the ordinary legi certainly render decision- 356 The Commission took decision-making on non-di decision to that effect according to the procedure contained in Article 48(7) TEU. 357 Thus, EU law procedural requirements arguably slowed down progress with regard to certain legislative initiatives connected to the 2010-2020 Strategy. As is evident from the assessment above, there are a number of achievements and shortcomings attaching to the design and implementation of the current European Disability Strategy and, in certain instances, it is possible to identify clear blockages and related responsibilities. The analysis above can, in turn, inform recommendations for the new, post-2020 Strategy.

        "The Post-2020 European Disability Strategy PE 656.398 85 KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The European Parliament has expressed a strong interest in contributing to the post-2020 European Disability Strategy. At present, the three key documents adopted by the European Parliament relating to the new Strategy are: The 2017 Resolution on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020; and, more recently, the Resolution of 18 June 2020 on the European Disability Strategy post-2020, drafted by the Committee on Employment; and the Resolution of 8 July 2020 on the rights of persons with intellectual disabilities in the COVID-19 crisis, drafted by the Committee on Petitions. \uf0b7 Whilst much of the 2017 European Parliament Resolution focused on the implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, many of the comments and suggestions found in that Resolution are relevant for the development of the new Strategy. In its Resolution of 18 June 2020, the European Parliament set out its concrete recommendations for the European Disability Strategy post-2020, and in its July 2020 Resolution, the Committee on Petitions deliberated on the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rights of persons with intellectual disabilities, and called on the European Commission and the Member States to take several measures to lessen this impact. \uf0b7 In its 2017 Resolution, the European Parliament recommended that any future strategy and . In its June 2020 Resolution, the Parliament called on the Commission to build upon what has been achieved by upscaling its commitment to the rights of persons with disabilities through an ambitious post-2020 European Disability Strategy.

The European Economic and Social Committee has, to date, issued two Opinions which address the Strategy. \uf0b7 In addition, Disabled P Organisations and other Civil Society Organisations have taken an active interest in the development of the post-2020 Disability Strategy, and have issued position papers and statements presenting their views on its content and scope. The input of such organisations is important because, in light of Article 4(3) CRPD, the views of representative organisations of persons with disabilities should be taken into account in developing the post-2020 European Disability Strategy.

        "IPOL | ional Affairs 86 PE 656.398 This chapter focuses on the proposals and recommendations regarding the post-2020 European Disability Strategy which have been made by a wide range of key stakeholders, including the European Parliament and other EU institutions, DPOs and CSOs, and other interested parties. To a large extent, these proposals and recommendations build on suggestions for improving and strengthening the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. However, the adoption of a new Strategy provides the opportunity to start afresh, and for greater openness towards these proposals and recommendations. 4.1 Reflections and Recommendations on the Post-2020 European Disability Strategy This section of the study presents key proposals and recommendations relating to the new Strategy made by various stakeholders. Sub-section 4.1.1 covers the European Parliament, while proposals and recommendations from other EU institutions, and specifically the European Economic and Social Committee, are discussed in sub-section 4.1.2. The views of relevant stakeholders from civil society, including DPOs, are presented in sub-section 4.1.3, whilst the final sub-section (4.1.4) draws on petitions submitted to the Petitions Committee of the European Parliament. 4.1.1 The European Parliament To date, the three key documents adopted by the European Parliament concerning the new Strategy are: The 2017 Resolution on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy 358 (which was discussed in sub-section 3.1.3 above); the European Parliament Resolution of 18 June 2020 on the European Disability Strategy post-2020, which was drafted by the Committee on Employment; 359 and the Resolution of 8 July 2020, drafted by the Committee on Petitions, on the rights of persons with intellectual disabilities in the COVID-19 crisis. 360 Whilst much of the 2017 Resolution focused on the implementation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, many of the comments and suggestions found in the Resolution are of importance for the development of the new Strategy, even though they are not explicitly framed as relating to the new Strategy. For example, the Parliament noted in its 2017 Resolution -term perspective is needed f , 361 and that the SDGs and the Social Pillar might be vehicles for implementing the CRPD. 362 Concerns were expressed, in that regard, in the June 2020 Parliament Resolution, where it was noted that the 2010-2020 Strategy has 358 European Parliament, Resolution of 30 November 2017 on implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2017/2127(INI)), Brussels, 30 November 2017, P8_TA(2017)0474, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2017-0474_EN.html. 359 European Parliament, Resolution of 18 June 2020 on the European Disability Strategy post 2020 (2019/2975(RSP), Brussels, 18 June 2020, P9_TA-PROV (2020) 0156, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2020- 0156_EN.pdf. 360 European Parliament, Resolution of 8 July 2020 on the rights of persons with intellectual disabilities in the COVID-19 crisis (2020/2680(RSP)), Brussels, 8 July 2020, B9-0204/2020, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9- 2020-0183_EN.html. 361 European Parliament, Resolution of 30 November 2017 on implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2017/2127(INI)), Brussels, 30 November 2017, P8_TA(2017)0474, para. 8. 362 European Parliament, Resolution of 30 November 2017 on implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2017/2127(INI)), Brussels, 30 November 2017, P8_TA(2017)0474, para.

The input of such organisations is important because, in light of Article 4(3) CRPD, the views of representative organisations of persons with disabilities should be taken into account in developing the post-2020 European Disability Strategy. The European Disability Forum has issued a paper in which it sets out its view on the priorities for the new Strategy. 440 Like the European Economic and Social Committee, EDF calls for the adoption of a European Disability Rights Agenda . EDF argues that the policy-making context is now very different from when the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 was adopted, and that the commitment to act is greater than ever. This is a result of the conclusion and ratification of the CRPD by the EU and all of its Member States, the appointment of a new European Commission which now includes a Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli and the realisation that, in spite of the good intentions of the Commission, the outcomes of the current Strategy sometimes fell short of expectations. The commitment to the SDGs and the Social Pillar also contribute to this new policy-making context. 441 EDF places great importance on monitoring and implementation of the new Disability Rights Agenda, stating that ven more central to the Disability Rights Agenda than the proposed actions, should be 442 It argued that EU institutions should use the Agenda to respond to the Concluding Observations of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 443 EDF also recommended that: 444 438 European Economic and Social Committee, Shaping the EU Agenda for Disability Rights 2020-2030: A Contribution from the European Economic and Social Committee, Doc.

Petition 2554/2013 concerned access by persons with disabilities to railway services in Spain. 489 The petitioner claimed that the Spanish railway operator RENFE did not implement an effective policy for individuals with disabilities regarding, in particular, the installation of lifting platforms to enable access to trains. The petitioner claimed that this situation was not in line with the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. Priestley notes that this petition raised . 490 In a subsequent Petition Petition 1294/2015 attention was drawn to the daily challenges faced by citizens who are colour blind, relating in particular to their difficulty in recognising signals indicated by light-emitting diode lights. 491 The petitioner in question complained that there was a general lack of legislation in the EU on the design of products for individuals who are colour blind. The petitioner highlighted that the only relevant measures adopted on the basis of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 up to the date of the petition such as Mandate 473, relating to Design for All were not legally binding. The petitioner claimed that the existing non-binding EU instruments designed to promote universal design were not sufficient to guarantee access for those who are colour blind, and asked the European Parliament (and the EU institutions more generally) to adopt appropriate, concrete measures concerning the design of electric goods which use these types of lights. This petition was forwarded to three committees of the European Parliament, namely the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Culture and Education. 492 487 Priestley, M., The Protection Role of the Committee on Petitions in the Context of the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Study for the PETI Committee), Directorate General for Internal Policies, 2016, p. 30, available at: https://euagenda.eu/upload/publications/untitled-70600-ea.pdf. 488 European Parliament, Resolution of 30 November 2017 on implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2017/2127(INI)), P8_TA(2017)0474, para. 151, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2017- 0474_EN.html. 489 Committee on Petitions, Petition 2554/2013 by Inaki Albin Diaz (Spanish), on access of disabled persons to railway services in Spain. 490 Priestley, M., The Protection Role of the Committee on Petitions in the Context of the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Study for the PETI Committee), Directorate General for Internal Policies, 2016, p. 37, available at: https://euagenda.eu/upload/publications/untitled-70600-ea.pdf. 491 Petition 1294/2015 by J.K.

The Commission also pointed out that another Directive, on the accessibility of public sector bodies websites 494 (proposed by the Commission in December 2012), was intended, once adopted, to provide the first EU-wide set of rules to make websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies accessible for persons with disabilities, by introducing mandatory accessibility features. The oth of the above-mentioned proposals contained a number of accessibility requirements which address issues related to the needs of those who are colour blind, including the provision of alternatives to colour in the user interface. Furthermore, it was noted in th that Directive 2014/35/EU, 495 related to electrical equipment within certain voltage limits, which covers the safety of light-emitting diode lights, states in its recitals that the CRPD should be taken into account at standardisation level. In addition, the Commission highlighted that, in 2005, it issued Mandate 376 to the European Standardisation Organisations to develop a European Standard addressing accessibility matters in the area of information and communication technologies (ICT). The resulting standard, EN 301549, 496 contains requirements intended to tackle the issue of colour blindness. Moreover, in the field of public health, the Commission replied that it was implementing activities related to rare diseases . While the Commission has no specific policy in place to address colour blindness, it pointed out that patients with colour blindness can benefit from actions taken under general rare diseases policy. 497 In order to raise awareness and to provide information on rare diseases, the Commission has also supported the Orphanet 498 database (the world reference database on rare diseases) for several years. The Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament expressed its agreement with the observations in relation to Petition 1294/2015, and decided to conclude its considerations on that basis. 499 In other petitions, the accessibility of public transport was at issue.

The European Commission noted that it had proposed on 2 December 2015 a European Accessibility Act, which was later adopted. It sets out common accessibility requirements for certain products and services, which are designed to help people with disabilities at EU level to participate fully in society. However, the Commission further noted that the problem described by the petitioner falls primarily within the responsibility of Belgium, which ratified the CRPD and its Optional Protocol. Under that Optional Protocol, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities can consider communications from, or on behalf of, individuals or groups subject to the jurisdiction of a State Party to the Protocol who claim to be victims of a violation of the CRPD by that State Party. Several recent petitions also relate to accessibility concerns, including Petition 1056/2016, 503 in which the petitioner claimed that, since petitions can currently be tabled in all official languages of the EU, Deaf sign language users should be given the possibility to table petitions in various sign languages. This petition is currently under discussion in the Committee on Petitions, and a debate on this petition took place on 14 July 2020. Notably, the relevant Parliamentary services have been consulted in order to make it possible to enable petitioners to submit petitions in sign languages, and an inter-DG Working Group has been set up to work on web accessibility in the Parliament. 504 Petition 0029/2017 505 related to ensuring access to toilet facilities, and was brought before the Committee on Petitions by M.G.C. (French). The petition was forwarded to the Commission, which noted that except for the limited application of certain EU legislation 506 that lays down concrete requirements to ensure accessible infrastructure and rolling stock in rail transport, but which is only applicable to new, renewed or upgraded infrastructure and rolling stock, there is no other applicable EU legislation with regard to accessible toilets. Nevertheless, the international obligations that Parties to the CRPD have committed to when ratifying the UN Convention still apply. Therefore, the matter may be pursued at national level. 507 The Committee on Petitions recommended informing the petitioner that the European Parliament has adopted a report on the implementation of the CRPD, with special regard to the Concluding Observations of the UN CRPD Committee, 508 in which access to toilets is mentioned under point 139. The Committee on Petitions also recommended referring the petitioner to the written Declaration drafted under Rule 136 of the a view to supporting an increase in accessible toilets in the EU. 509 Moreover, the Committee recommended explaining to the petitioner that the provision of such facilities is a matter of national 502 Information provided by the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, on file with the authors. 503 Petition No 1056/2016 Mark Wheatley (British) on behalf of European Union of the Deaf, requesting the European Parliament allow for the tabling of petitions in national sign languages used in the EU. 504 Information provided by the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, on file with the authors. 505 Petition 0029/2017 by M.G.C.

The petitioner expressed concern at the problems and obstacles faced by the deaf and hard of hearing in everyday life and called for the implementation of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Directive 2019/882 on the accessibility requirements for products and services. He also argued that new technologies should be used to promote the inclusion of those concerned instead of creating more barriers. In responding to the Committee on Petitions request to respond, the Commission observed as follows: 511 The obligation to ensure that financial institutions and private companies provide accessible services to persons with disabilities remains, for the time being and pending the transposition of the European Accessibility Act, a national competence. All Member States, including Spain, have ratified the CRPD. By virtue of Article 9 CRPD, Parties to the CRPD must ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to information, communications (including ICT and systems) and services provided to the public. By virtue of Article 12 CRPD, States Parties must ensure the equal right of persons with disabilities to own or inherit property, to control their own financial affairs and to have equal access to bank loans, mortgages and other forms of financial credit. The Commission noted that it has no power to intervene or to monitor the implementation of the CRPD in matters falling within the competences of the Member States. However, in relation to the accessibility of products and services, and specifically of banking services, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the EAA in March 2019. The Directive was published in the Official Journal of the EU in June 2019 (shortly before the facts reported by the petitioner). The EAA sets out the obligation for EU Member States to ensure that the products and services included within the scope of the Directive are made accessible to persons with disabilities. The deadline for transposing the EAA is 28 June 2022. By that date, all EU Member States must adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the EAA. The measures set out in the Directive will apply as of 28 June 2025, and if a Member State fails to communicate measures that fully transpose the provisions of the EAA, or does not rectify a suspected violation of EU law, the Commission may launch a formal infringement procedure. 512 Notably, the Committee on Petitions will discuss t to Petition 0954/2019 at one of next meetings. 513 Furthermore, in Petition 0530/2018 by J.S.

The petitioner expressed her concern regarding this alleged gap in the GDPR. Notably, the point raised by the petitioner is a relevant one in terms of ensuring the complementarity of existing EU legislation with the CRPD via the new European Disability Strategy. The Commission has set out its response to Petition 0530/2018, a summary of which is provided below: 516 The CFR guarantees, in Article 8, that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him- or herself. On 27 April 2016, the EU adopted the GDPR, which is directly applicable since 25 May 2018. Under the GDPR, health data are considered as a special category of data requiring a stricter level of protection. The processing of special categories of data is, in principle, prohibited, unless a justification can be found in Article 9(2) GDPR. Article 9(2)(a) GDPR expressly provides that organisations are allowed to process health data where the individual concerned has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes. Organisations acting as data controllers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the GDPR, and Article 32 GDPR requires that organisations processing personal data implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk involved. However, those organisations should not refuse to deal with requests by individuals for reasons based on data protection. When these organisations have implemented security measures such as encryption to secure the processing of health data, the individuals concerned have to take all of the necessary measures to allow for a secure exchange of personal data. Failure by organisations to respect the obligations and rights set forth in the GDPR may lead to the imposition of corrective measures as well as administrative fines. The Commission concluded that the monitoring and enforcement of the application of data protection legislation falls within the competence of the data protection supervisory authorities and courts, without prejudice to the competences of the Commission as Guardian of the Treaties. Any individual whose personal data are processed may lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority in the EU, or file a legal action in court, if he/she considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes data protection legislation. The petition is still open, and the response from the Commission was sent to the petitioner for comments. 517 The petitions lodged with the Committee on Petitions have also served to draw attention to a lack of progress on EU legislative initiatives connected to the CRPD.

That same petition Petition 0924/2011 was later referred to by the Committee on Petitions in its September 2015 debate on disability petitions, 523 where the Committee expressed its concern about the lack of progress made at that point in time on a European Accessibility Act, and called for legislative progress within the year . 524 In a later, 2017 Opinion, the Committee on Petitions stressed that: the right to accessibility, as defined in Article 9 of the UNCRPD, must be implemented in a comprehensive manner to ensure that persons with disabilities can access their environment, transportation, public facilities and services, as well as information and communications technologies [and called] on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that accessibility is a high priority and that it is better integrated into all disability policy areas. 525 Subsequent to the submission of Petition 1294/2015, discussed above, Directive 2019/882 on the accessibility requirements for products and services (the EAA) was adopted, as mentioned in previous sections of this study. The EAA pays attention to some of the issues raised in the petitions outlined above, including making the products and services covered under its scope accessible to people who cannot perceive colour; however, the material scope of the EAA is substantially narrower than that of the CRPD.

Having contacted all the relevant Italian authorities, she argued that those who should be helping her are failing to do their jobs properly and that the laws adopted in Italy intended to help those with disabilities are not being complied with in practice. As a result, she maintained that Italy is failing to comply with the CRPD, the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 and Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. 539 That petition was forwarded to the European Parliament Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and further information was requested, and later received, from the European Commission in August 2016. In its reply, the Commission outlined that a complaint on the same subject as the petition had already been submitted to the Commission twice in the form of the following documents: CHAP(2016)453 (the reply was sent to the petitioner on 8 July 2016 and the case was closed on 8 August 2016) and CHAP(2016)716 (which was closed immediately because of duplication). The Commission therefore repeated its conclusions already communicated to the petitioner, and those conclusions are summarised below: 540 In accordance with the division of competences between the EU and its Member States in this field, as enshrined in the EU Treaties, the European Commission has no competence to intervene in national employment situations; this area falls within the exclusive competence of the national authorities. Directive 2000/78/EC prohibits discrimination on the grounds of, among others, disability, with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment in the areas of employment and occupation. The Directive also provides for reasonable accommodation for individuals with disabilities. However, it does not impose on Member States the obligation to take measures of positive action; rather, it merely allows them to adopt such measures aimed at creating or maintaining provisions or facilities for safeguarding or promoting the integration of disabled persons into the working environment.

There is no mutual recognition between Member States of disability status, and the European Commission does not have any competence in that regard, and thus cannot establish common disability criteria for Member States. Nevertheless, the CRPD, which the EU and its Member States have ratified, provides a definition of persons with disabilities that the Parties to the UN Convention should follow.

The Commission acknowledged that individuals with disabilities travelling to another EU Member State are often not treated equally to residents of that other Member State, as their disability cards/status are not always recognised outside their Member States of origin. To improve this situation, the Commission developed the pilot EU Disability Card in 2016-2017, to be implemented on a voluntary basis in certain Member States 546 in the areas those States approved. 547 The Commission stated that it will continue to support Member States in the implementation of the pilot project on the EU Disability Card and associated benefits in the areas of culture, leisure, sport and transport. It will further encourage other Member States to enter the scheme. 548 In its response to Petition 1500/2016, the Commission also pointed out that attention is paid to the recruitment of people with disabilities by the EU institutions, as the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) has consistently applied an equal opportunities policy to its selection procedures and takes all reasonable measures to ensure equal treatment of all candidates. These measures are firmly in line with the CRPD, according to the Commission. Candidates are informed of the rules and procedures in the Notice of competition 549 as well as in the application form, and how they need to proceed in order to benefit from accommodations. EPSO carefully analyses each case by focusing on the candidate s needs, and proposes tailor-made special measures for testing in order to enable them to perform to the best of their abilities. This analysis is done in close contact with the candidates. EPSO maintains an open and constructive dialogue with its candidates requiring extra accommodation, and does its best to ensure the testing conditions are as satisfactory as possible for them. EPSO also collaborates with EDF by exchanging information with them with regard to mutual experiences on how to handle and accommodate individuals with different kinds of disabilities. Moreover, the Commission there is no legal basis in its Staff Regulations to put in place positive discrimination measures (such as quotas) for persons with disabilities. The Staff Regulations allow compensation for the disadvantages experienced by persons with disabilities by providing them with reasonable accommodation. However, the Staff Regulations also stipulate that recruitment for the EU institutions must be based on merits. This being said, the Commission actively welcomes the applications of candidates with disabilities. The Committee on Petitions agreed mostly with the C reply, which was sent to the Petitioner.

In contrast, severely disabled workers who work within a private undertaking are entitled to representation in such events. The petitioner alleged that the above situation constitutes discrimination on the ground of disability. This petition was also forwarded to the Commission, which pointed out in its response that EU law, in particular Directive 2000/78/EC, 551 prohibits discrimination on the basis of certain exhaustively enumerated grounds including disability in the fields of employment and occupation. However, the Commission noted that the German legislation at issue does not establish a difference of treatment between workers on the basis of disability but rather on the basis of the organisation where they work. Since the criterion used for the differential treatment at issue is not related to the protected characteristic, namely disability, 552 the Commission found that there does not appear to exist any direct or indirect discrimination on the ground of disability in the sense of Article 2 of Directive 2000/78/EC. 553 The Committee on Petitions agreed mostly with the C reply to Petition 1190/2017, which was sent to the Petitioner.

The objective of supporting deinstitutionalisation and promoting community living accords clearly with Article 19 CRPD. In this light, Priestley is of the view that: [t]here is clearly a role for [the Committee on Petitions] in protecting and seeking enforcement of this right at the EU level where petitioners identify such cases, whether or not the planning and organisation of long-term care systems lies within the responsibility of national authorities. Given the existence of specific EU law relating to European investment funds and public procurement this is, conceivably, an issue where Commission infringement proceedings could be invoked as [a] consequence of a well- substantiated petition. 562 On the whole, the four areas discussed above and the petitions lodged to date with the European serve to shed light on the wide array of challenges faced by citizens with disabilities in the EU.

This final chapter draws on the findings to present recommendations in relation to the design, scope and content of the new Strategy, as well as recommendations concerning the new implementation, and the key infrastructure and changes necessary at EU and Member State level. Both the substantive content of the post-2020 European Disability Strategy, and the mechanisms for implementation and monitoring of the new Strategy, are addressed in the recommendations in this chapter. The recommendations pay particular attention to implementation and monitoring. This is because it is submitted that the main shortcomings of the current European Disability Strategy stem from weaknesses in these two key areas. This is also reflected in the views of other scholars and stakeholders, as detailed throughout this study. Improved implementation and monitoring mechanisms can facilitate a better assessment of the impact of individual instruments, and this knowledge can help to inform changes and developments in the substantive content of the post-2020 Strategy. Each sub-section in this chapter contains a number of recommendations for key stakeholders, including the Commission, the European Parliament and Member States. Each recommendation is firstly summarised in a sentence, and presented in a box. The study then describes the background and factors taken into account in formulating the recommendation. Lastly, the recommendation is given in full, with the institution or institutions at which the recommendation is directed being highlighted in bold. The full recommendation is indented and in italics.

",
        "IPOL | ional Affairs 120 PE 656.398 5.1.1 Overall Goal: Implementation of the CRPD It is important that the CRPD frames the new Strategy, and that the Strategy has the goals of implementing the CRPD at EU level, in light of EU competences, and of supporting the implementation of the CRPD at Member State level. The new Strategy should be a clear EU strategy to implement the UN Convention, as called for by the European Parliament. 570 Ioannis Vardakastanis had called for the - 571 The ratification of the CRPD by all Member States indicates the high level of commitment and consensus regarding the Convention across the EU, and the Strategy can support national implementation in numerous ways, including through EU legislation, funding for national activities and exchanges of best practice. The design of the new Strategy should also ensure alignment with other relevant UN instruments, such as the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda, which the EU has committed to implementing in its internal and external policies. It is recommended that the Commission ensure that the post-2020 European Disability Strategy reflects the human rights approach to disability endorsed by the CRPD, and that much clearer alignment is ensured between the priority areas and lines of action in the new Strategy, and the rights and obligations contained in the CRPD. The new Strategy should have the goal of implementing the CRPD at EU level and supporting Member States to implement the CRPD at national level. The Commission should also ensure that the new Strategy makes better connections with the goals of the SDGs, in particular. A repeated refrain from the EU institutions, and CSOs and DPOs, on the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 is that it should be tied more closely to the CRPD and serve to implement the UN Convention at EU level; and that it should support Member State implementation, particularly in light of the Concluding Observations issued by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Commission did not take the opportunity to rethink and relaunch the Strategy following the issuing of 570 See European Parliament, Report on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, with special regard to the Concluding Observations of the UN CRPD Committee (2015/2258(INI)), 09 June 2016, para. 20, available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2016-0203_EN.html. 571 -203 February 2020.

The recommendations of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to the EU, found in the 2015 Concluding Observations of the Committee, should be considered in full when drafting and revising the post-2020 disability policy, including the new Strategy. The EU will be subject to another review by the UN Committee in the coming years, and is due to submit its next periodic report in January 2021. It is recommended that the Commission take the Concluding Observations into account in full when drafting the new Strategy. Furthermore, the Commission should ensure that concrete actions in the new Strategy are linked to the Concluding Observations. Other EU institutions, including the European Parliament , should take the Concluding Observations into account when adopting Resolutions and Opinions on the new Strategy, or otherwise contributing to the discussion on, or assessing, the new Strategy. 5.1.2 Designing a Strategy to Implement the CRPD Doing the Groundwork Given that the new Strategy is expected to cover a decade, it is important to carry out appropriate groundwork to ensure that the Strategy has been well thought-through and developed. The mid-term evaluation and the final evaluation of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 are, of course, important elements in this respect, which will feed into the design of the new Strategy. However, it is also important that certain other actions are taken before the new Strategy is proposed and adopted. Moreover, during the negotiations on the next MFF, which will cover the period 2021-2027, account should be taken of the new European Disability Strategy, and the need to ensure an adequate budget to implement the Strategy. As highlighted by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it is important to ensure that persons with disabilities, through their representative organisations, participate in the process leading to the adoption of all new legislation and policy at EU level. 573 This general obligation is also contained in Article 4(3) CRPD, which, as highlighted in chapter 2 above, requires close consultation with, and active involvement of, persons with disabilities through their representative organisations, in the development and implementation of legislation and policies to implement the CRPD, and in all 572 See generally European Parliament, Report on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, with special regard to the Concluding Observations of the UN CRPD Committee (2015/2258(INI)), 09 June 2016, available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2016-0203_EN.html. 573 UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Concluding Observations on the Initial Report of the European Union, 2 October 2015, CRPD/C/EU/CO/1, para. 29.

This is also emphasised in General Comment No. 7 of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, on participation. 574 The Commission has engaged in a number of public consultations, and consultations with CSOs and DPOs, over the course of the current Strategy, and the engagement of the EU institutions with key stakeholders was praised by the International Disability Alliance during the event Shaping the EU Agenda for Disability Rights 2020-2030 . 575 It remains important to engage with such organisations in drafting the new Strategy. Taking the above into account, it is recommended that the Commission set up a forum for between the EU and organisations representing persons with disabilities, to discuss the design of the new Strategy, as recommended by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 576 and the European Parliament, 577 among others . 578 The forum should include the Commission and EDF , as the umbrella organisation representing the interests of people with disabilities and their families, as well as relevant DPOs and CSOs which were involved in the public consultation on the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. The Commission should consider what format such a forum for structured dialogue should take, but it needs to be accessible and inclusive, guaranteeing that individuals with different types of disabilities are adequately represented. Individuals with disabilities should be actively involved and closely consulted, including on the design of actions for the new Strategy targeted at reducing the impact of the current pandemic on various aspects of their daily lives. As noted above, the CRPD is a mixed agreement, which means that both the EU and its Member States have relevant competences or powers to implement the UN Convention. While the EU and its Member States have taken on all of the obligations set out in the CRPD in combination, the exact division of competences and responsibilities can be difficult to determine. For some areas where competences are shared, a joint approach or joint action may help to facilitate implementation in full.

        "The Post-2020 European Disability Strategy PE 656.398 123 Helena Dalli has asserted that the new Strategy will focus on areas where the EU can be most effective in its actions. 579 Consequently, and preceding the adoption of the new Strategy, it is recommended that the Commission conduct an extensive mapping of the respective competences of the EU and the Member States not only exclusive competences but also shared competences with a view to adopting a Strategy which is not only respectful of those competences but which, through combined action of the EU and the Member States, facilitates implementation in full of the CRPD. In this regard, there would be a role for the Council Working Group on Human Rights , which addresses the human rights aspects of the external relations of the EU. The Commission should ensure that the new Strategy is as previously suggested by the European Parliament, 580 in order to determine how best the EU can work alongside its Member States to implement the CRPD via the post-2020 Strategy. As highlighted throughout this study, there is currently no clear overview of the alignment and compatibility of EU laws and policies with the CRPD. Indeed, it was noted earlier in this study 581 that Petition 0530/2018, 582 which was submitted to the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament, alleged incompatibility of the GDPR with the requirements of the CRPD. Prior to adopting the new Strategy, it is recommended that the Commission carry out a CRPD, taking account of the Concluding Observations issued to the EU by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2015. This review and mapping exercise should identify the compatibility of existing EU instruments with the UN Convention, and areas where further action is needed in order to achieve compliance. The post-2020 European Disability Strategy should then provide for a workable schedule of substantive revisions of existing EU law and policy in light of the identified gaps and weaknesses. 579 - Brussels, 26 February 2020. 580 European Parliament, Resolution of 30 November 2017 on implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2017/2127(INI)), Brussels, 30 November 2017, P8_TA(2017)0474, para. 120, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2017-0474_EN.html. 581 See sub-section 4.1.4 above. 582 Petition 0530/2018 by J.S.

        "IPOL | ional Affairs 124 PE 656.398 Eurostat and ANED have made important contributions to the collation and presentation of data concerning people with disabilities, in both the EU as a whole and individual Member States, over much of the course of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. Much of the relevant information has been extracted from EU-SILC data. However, the amount of data identifying the situation of people with disabilities, including in comparison with the situation of people without disabilities, remains quite limited. Disability-specific data is important for both the design and implementation of the post-2020 European Disability Strategy, and numerous organisations, including the European Parliament and the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as various CSOs and DPOs, have referred to the importance of collecting disability-specific data over the course of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. The collation and presentation of data on the situation of people with disabilities can contribute to both developing and monitoring the new Strategy. This is because the data can serve two purposes: helping to identify priority areas of action, at both EU and Member State level, for the new Strategy; and providing a baseline against which to assess changes and progress over the course of the new Strategy. The lack of adequate baseline data has hampered evaluations and assessments of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, which have often focused on the taking of various listed actions, rather than changes in the situation of people with disabilities and the wider environment. It is recommended that the Commission ensure that the post-2020 European Disability Strategy starts from a clear baseline data set, which can be used both to identify priority areas of action and monitor developments related to the new Strategy. The Commission should also ensure that adequate benchmarks are put in place, and that data is collected based on a set of disaggregated, comparable qualitative and quantitative indicators on disability. CRPD- compliant disability indicators, disaggregated on the basis of sex, age and type of impairment, should be included in the data collected by Eurostat and in any future evaluations of the new Strategy. Indicators should be developed in conjunction with people with disabilities and their representative organisations. The adoption of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 was accompanied by a list of actions, linked to the priority areas, covering the period 2010-2015. The intention was that a second list of action covering the period 2016-2020 would be published following a mid-term evaluation. However, a second list was never published. it is recommended that the Commission ensure that a first list of actions is published when the new Strategy is adopted, and this is reviewed and updated following a mid-term evaluation.

The five recommendations outlined above (involve persons with disabilities and other key stakeholders in the design of the new Strategy; review and map EU law and policy in light of the CRPD; map EU and Member State competences regarding the CRPD; establish a baseline data set as well as indicators, and support the ongoing compilation of data on the situation of people with disabilities; and finally identify the first list of actions (implementation plan) and periodically update it) should be undertaken before the adoption of the new Strategy, with a view to informing its content and fulfilling its overall aim, which should be implementation of the CRPD in the EU. 5.1.3 Scope and Content of the New Strategy The EU CRPD Monitoring , 583 and which covers all CRPD articles. In line with stakeholder recommendations, Commissioner Dalli has committed to presenting a 10-year post-2020 f the new Strategy. 584 This sub-section reflects on issues related to the scope and content of the post-2020 European Disability Strategy, and makes some specific recommendations in that regard. The 2019 public consultation on the European Disability Strategy revealed that the majority of respondents regarded the eight priority areas of action covered by the 2010-2020 Strategy to be of ongoing relevance. With the exception of external action, all areas of action were regarded as relevant for future activities by between 74% and 78% of respondents. External action was regarded as having an ongoing relevance by 55% of respondents. Given the broad nature of the eight priority areas in the current Strategy and fairly consistent levels of support from stakeholders for addressing these areas, they can be regarded as also being of relevance for the new Strategy. It is recommended that the Commission build upon and integrate what has been achieved . 585 This entails maintaining the existing priority areas of action, although some fine-tuning in terms of the specific areas covered 583 Jakub Pawlowicz, Legal Officer at the Office of the European Ombudsman, Agenda for Disability Rights 2020- February 2020.

In particular, account should be taken of the social, economic and health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on people with disabilities and their families. The impact of the current pandemic on the right to the highest attainable standard of health on a non- discriminatory basis, as well as on the situation of persons with disabilities (including older persons with disabilities) living in residential institutions, and on equality in education, should be addressed specifically in the new Strategy. It is also recommended that the Commission ensure that the actions linked to the new Strategy implement the priority areas across the board, and the somewhat uneven implementation of actions in the eight priority areas that occurred during the course of the current Strategy should be avoided. Some stakeholders regarded political participation and Citizenship rights as particularly important issues over the course of the last Strategy. 586 As noted in chapter 2 of this study, the European Disability Strategy 2010- from fully exercising their fundamental rights including their Union citizenship rights and limiting 587 The current Strategy mentions the exercise of participation rights by people with disabilities as political actors; 588 however, it does not address the issues of mobility and free movement to any great extent, other than requiring the EU institutions to promote dialogue on the portability of rights in the DHLG, and to identify the obstacles encountered by people with disabilities in the exercise of the right to free movement and residence. The EU institutions have already taken policy measures aimed at addressing mobility and free movement issues through the pilot European Disability Card, but further action in this field is desirable. In this respect, the European Parliament has recommended that the Commission extend the material scope of the European Disability Card and that it extend it to all EU Member States. 589 In light of the above, it is recommended that the Commission include a new priority area in the post-2020 European Disability Strategy, Citizenship rights .

        "The Post-2020 European Disability Strategy PE 656.398 127 including the scope for mutual recognition or harmonisation of disability assessments, 590 and the portability of social supports. The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 has been repeatedly criticised, by the European Parliament in particular, for failing to include an integrated gender perspective or pay sufficient attention to gender-specific issues. 591 In addition, the needs of people with complex support needs and their families were not adequately considered under the current Strategy. Moreover, limited attention was paid to intersectionality generally in the current Strategy, including the situation of persons with disabilities who come from ethnic minority backgrounds, older people with disabilities, children with disabilities, refugees and other migrants with disabilities, and people with disabilities who are Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and/or Intersex. However, the fact that the new Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2024 592 pays attention to the situation of women and girls with disabilities is a welcome indicator that more attention is now being paid to intersectionality at EU level. It is recommended that the Commission ensure that the new Strategy adopts a cross-sectoral approach to disability and that, in particular, a gender perspective is mainstreamed in the Strategy. The specific needs of women and children with disabilities should be integrated in the new Strategy, and the needs of specific groups of people with disabilities, including people with intellectual disabilities, those with invisible disabilities, older people with disabilities and homeless people with disabilities, LGBTI+ persons with disabilities, as well as refugees and other migrants with disabilities should be targeted by the actions in the new Strategy. Addressing gender specifically in the new Strategy would be in line with Article 6 CRPD, and including consideration of the needs of other specific groups would be in line with the intersectional approach to disability taken in the CRPD. 593 In order to ensure that this cross-sectoral approach is followed through, disability rights should also be mainstreamed in the Youth Guarantee, and also in other relevant group-specific EU strategies. Disability considerations should also be included in the reform of the Common European Asylum System. 590 for Disability Rights 2020- 591 European Parliament, Resolution of 25 October 2011 on mobility and inclusion of people with disabilities and the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 (2010/2272 (INI)) OJ C 131 E/9, para. 5, available at: https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/- /publication/20f5cc9b-b820-11e2-ab01-01aa75ed71a1/language-en. 592 European Commission, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, The European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions A Union of Equality: Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025, COM(2020) 152 final, Brussels, 5 March 2020, available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A152%3AFIN. 593 See Preamble, para. p, CRPD.

While it is important to note that this is an area where the EU has limited competences, the EU does have the possibility to support Member State action in this area through, for example, through facilitating exchanges of best practice. It is recommended that the Commission pay attention to issues related to autonomy and legal capacity of certain groups of individuals with disabilities in the priority area of participation under the new Strategy, and the Commission should give due consideration to fostering good practice and exchange of knowledge on supported decision-making in the implementation plan for the new Strategy and making recommendations as appropriate. Given the limited competences which the EU has in this area, legal capacity should not become one of the main priority areas of action under the new Strategy, but due attention needs to be paid to this issue. Rather than only being a stand-alone area in the Strategy, participation of people with disabilities should be a cross-cutting consideration, in order to mainstream adequately CRPD rights throughout each priority area of the new Strategy. Ensuring full and effective participation and inclusion in society is a general principle and cross-cutting objective of the CRPD set out in Article 3(c). Participation is also a key objective o and as acknowledged in the current European Disability Strategy, 596 Article 26 CFR states that the EU recognises and respects the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure, among others, their participation in the life of the community. The current Disability Strategy also recognises that the full economic and social participation of people with disabilities is essential if the Europe 2020 Strategy is to succeed in creating smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. 597 The 2010-2020 European Disability Strategy mentions participation as a cross-cutting objective relatively little on the whole.

It is recommended that the Commission place a stronger focus on participation as a cross- cutting theme in all priority areas of action in the post-2020 European Disability Strategy. In that regard, cross-references should be inserted in the new Strategy to relevant CRPD obligations. The drafting of the new Strategy provides the opportunity to address areas which may not have been of particular significance in 2010, but which have now acquired that status. One such area is digital inclusion and new technologies, which can provide both opportunities and challenges for people with disabilities. 598 The European Economic and Social Committee has recently published an Opinion on this issue, emphasising that s. 599 Thus, real involvement of social economy and civil society organisations is imperative to ensure that the huge opportunities offered by the new technologies are geared towards delivering benefits, access, transparency and participation for all, and not just for a new \"digital economy elite\" . 600 According to Henriette Geiger, Director of the Directorate for People and Peace at DG DEVCO, assistive technology is a key issue necessitating a massive global investment, and a major pillar for jobs and growth. 601 The EU CRPD Monitoring Framework has argued that the new Strategy should show commitment to keeping the costs of assistive technology affordable for persons with disabilities . 602 It is recommended that the Commission pay due attention in the new Strategy to digital inclusion and new technologies, including affordable assistive technologies. The relevance of digital inclusion and new technologies should be considered, in particular, in the context of the current pandemic, whereby the inaccessibility of certain virtual environments including virtual educational environments is resulting in further inequalities for persons with disabilities .

Since digital inclusion and new technologies are fields which are relevant in many areas, including participation, employment and education, they should be addressed as cross-cutting issues across the priority areas in the new Strategy, although it is not recommended that digital inclusion and the use of new technologies become a new priority area in the post-2020 European Disability Strategy. Awareness-raising is one of the four sets of general implementation measures foreseen under the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. Nevertheless, awareness-raising was identified as an area where more could have been done under the Strategy by the European Parliament 603 and various CSOs and DPOs, 604 and limited understanding by policy makers and limited public awareness were identified as factors hampering progress by many respondents to the 2019 public consultation. According to Priestley, many negative attitudes towards people with disabilities stem from the fact that people with , and therefore the social dimensions of stigma must be targeted, through inclusive education and employment in the mainstream, among others. 605 According to the EU CRPD Monitoring Framework, the new Strategy should also pay attention to the ping perceptions of disability, promoting diversity and of the barriers still faced by persons with disabilities, including invisible disabilities, and to break . 606 It is recommended that the Commission address in detail awareness-raising and combating stereotyping and stigmatisation of people with disabilities in the new Strategy, and in its implementation plan, including, in particular, stereotyping and stigmatisation of people with intellectual disabilities and people with psycho-social disabilities. This is in line with the model of inclusive equality that underpins the CRPD and Article 8 CRPD specifically. The new Strategy should aim to target structural disability discrimination. This element of the new Strategy should be wide-ranging, and should address awareness-raising regarding disability among the general 603 European Parliament, Resolution of 30 November 2017 on implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2017/2127(INI)), Brussels, 30 November 2017, P8_TA(2017)0474, para. 118, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2017-0474_EN.html. 604 EDF, The European Disability Strategy Rights Agenda 2020-2030, Following on from the Disability Strategy 2010-2020, p. 9, available at: http://www.edf-feph.org/sites/default/files/edf_disability_rights_agenda_position_0.doc. 605 Disability Rights 2020- 606 European Disability Strategy Post-2020: Contribution from the EU CRPD Monitoring Framework, Brussels, 16.02.2020, p. 21, available at: https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/contribution-eu-framework-post-2020-disability- strategy_en.pdf.

This training should be tailored to the particular work carried out by these officials, with a particular focus on training of officials responsible for implementing and monitoring the use of EU funds, such as the SIF, in light of the CRPD, and other relevant EU provisions, taking into account the challenges brought to the forefront by the current pandemic. Initiatives to raise awareness about the possibility to use public procurement to improve accessibility for people with disabilities should also be supported at the national level. At the EU level, training and awareness-raising regarding the scope for mainstreaming disability in policy areas where this currently does not happen is important. Individuals with disabilities themselves, through DPOs , should be involved in planning and delivering the awareness-raising and training . The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has expressed its concern at the failure of the EU to conclude the OP-CRPD, and has called on the EU to ratify (or conclude) the Convention. 607 Likewise, the Eu conclude the OP-CRPD and considers that its own role should be clarified and recognised in the Committee on Rules of Procedure before the conclusion of the Protocol. 608 The conclusion by the EU of the OP-CRPD would provide an important avenue of complaint for EU citizens in the event of non- compliance by the EU institutions with the CRPD, as they could take their complaint directly before the UN Committee. It is recognised, however, that conclusion of the OP-CRPD would require unanimity in the Council, under Article 19(1) TFEU in combination with Article 218(8) TFEU. Thus, each Member State would have a veto on the accession of the EU to the OP-CRPD. It is recommended that the Council take the necessary measures to ensure conclusion of the OP- CRPD; however, the challenges in implementing this recommendation are acknowledged. 607 See UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Concluding Observations on the Initial Report of the European Union, 02 October 2015, CRPD/C/EU/CO/1, paras. 6-7. 608 European Parliament, Report of 30 October 2017 on implementation of the European Disability (2017/2127(INI), Opinion of the Committee on Petitions for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities with special regard to the Concluding Observations of the UN CRPD Committee (2015/2258(INI)) (Rapporteur: Wikstr \u0308 m), 11 September 2017, para. 13, available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A8-2016-0203&language=EN.

Given the potential disability dimension to many areas of EU action and policy-making, it is essential that the Strategy is taken into account across the wide range of EU actions, and that disability is mainstreamed across all relevant policy areas and integrated within important policy instruments. In order to achieve this, institutional structures need to be set up and existing structures need to be modified to embed the Strategy and its goals within the infrastructure of the EU. A repeated recommendation of many stakeholders 609 when commenting on the current Strategy, and reflecting on the new Strategy, and which is repeated here is as follows: It is recommended that each EU institution and agency establish DFPs with responsibility for implementing the Strategy. These focal points could also have the task of supporting CRPD implementation within the relevant institution or Commission DG . In light of the transversal action necessary for implementation of the Strategy, and to ensure careful coordination of the EU internal action with that of the EU External Action Service, the main DFP should be in the -Genera l. The establishment of such focal points should facilitate the mainstreaming of disability across the work of the EU, including in areas of EU action and policy which, to date, have not embraced a mainstreaming approach, such as consumer policy. Moreover, it is recommended that the Commission set up a particularly strong DFP within DG JUST. That focal point should cooperate with, and support, the work of the Equality Commissioner , who has been tasked with leading implementation of the CRPD and with working closely with all Commissioners to achieve this aim. 610 All other DGs should also have a DFP. 609 See, for example: http://www.edf-feph.org/newsroom/news/edf-responds-review-european-disability-strategy-2010- 2020.

        "The Post-2020 European Disability Strategy PE 656.398 133 Furthermore, it is recommended that the European Parliament establish DFPs (i.e. appoint individual MEPs) in each of the thirteen committees currently represented in the CRPD Network 611 of the Parliament and locate a DFP within the office of the Secretary General. The relevant committees include, amongst others, the Committees on Employment and Social Affairs; Human Rights; Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs; Petitions; and Legal Affairs; and within the administration. The current Network is an inter-committee network on the implementation of the CRPD, but has not been particularly active in the past two years. One Vice President of the European Parliament should also be assigned the role of DFP, and become the Chair of the implementation of the post-2020 European Disability Strategy, and its name should reflect this. The Network should collaborate with the Disability Intergroup in the Parliament. The Network should be supported by staff at the Parliament, and DFPs should also be appointed at the level of the administration. The coordinating DFP should be located within the Secretary General, and nominated specialists in each DG of the Parliament should support the DFPs. It is acknowledged that establishing DFPs in the Council is more challenging than for the other two main institutions, given that there are no fixed members of the Council. However, it is recommended that a senior civil servant be assigned the task of DFP for nine of the ten different figurations of the Council , 612 and that the civil servant have the task of working with the relevant Presidency of the Council regarding issues related to the post-2020 Disability Strategy and CRPD. The President of the Council should have a DFP located within his/her office. Lastly, it is recommended that the respective Presidents of the Commission, Parliament and Council meet at least once every six months to discuss disability-related issues, including the implementation of both the CRPD and the post-2020 European Disability Strategy. Mainstreaming of disability across EU policy fields and actions is a particularly important means of addressing disability-related issues. An increase in disability mainstreaming has been observed in some areas, including in the European Semester process, over the course of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. However, the EU has not establishe UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities made this point with regard to international cooperation policies and programmes. 613 Moreover EDF has noted that the European 611 See: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/product-details/20170322CDT01321 612 It is not suggested that the Agriculture and Fisheries Council have such a civil servant. 613 See UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Concluding Observations on the Initial Report of the European Union, 02 October 2015, CRPD/C/EU/CO/1, para. 4.

        "IPOL | ional Affairs 134 PE 656.398 Disability Strategy 2010-2020 did not succeed in mainstreaming disability across all relevant policy areas, and that several general measures were adopted that did not mainstream disability. 614 In its 2017 Resolution, the European Parliament reminded the Commission of its du Commission to verify that this duty is 615 In its June 2020 Resolution, the Parliament also called on the Commission expert Task Force for Equality, under the supervision of the in all relevant EU laws, decisions, policies and programmes. 616 It is recommended that, under the new Strategy, a systematic approach to mainstreaming is established. This should ensure that a disability dimension is considered and, where appropriate, acted on through the inclusion of disability-specific provisions, clauses and references in EU instruments, including EU legislation, is established. As the Commission is the primary initiator of legislative and policy proposals, it is particularly important that disability mainstreaming is considered when proposals are drafted. However, the Council and Parliament , as co- legislators, also have an important role to play in ensuring that disability mainstreaming occurs. In this respect, the above mentioned DFPs in these institutions can have an important role to play. Within the Commission, each DG should appoint an identified expert who has responsibility for disability mainstreaming. This individual should also participate in the DFPs which have responsibility for implementing the Strategy. It is also recommended that units with expertise in accessibility be set up by the Commission. Such units should coordinate their actions with working groups on accessibility within the Commission, such as the Web Accessibility Directive Expert Group, which supports the implementation of the relevant Directive, facilitating cooperation between the Member States and relevant stakeholders. The implementation of the actions related to the post-2020 European Disability Strategy, and the implementation of the CRPD itself, requires close coordination between the main EU institutions.

It is recommended that the European Commission, Parliament and Council establish an inter-institutional coordination mechanism with a view to supporting the implementation of the post-2020 European Disability Strategy. Moreover, while a coordination mechanism is not required under the CRPD, it is desirable, and such an inter-institutional coordination mechanism at EU level could also facilitate implementation of the CRPD via the Strategy. The coordination mechanisms should be composed of all of the DFPs, and oversee the implementation of the new Strategy. Participation of people with disabilities, through their representative organisations, should be ensured not only in the design of the new Strategy, but also in its implementation and monitoring, and this participation should be structured coherently. Structured dialogue with CSOs and social partners should also be ensured. In view of the above, it is recommended that the Commission adopt guidelines/a code of conduct for the participation of civil society, DPOs and social partners , to structure , implementation and monitoring. Those guidelines should be based on the general principles and minimum standards of stakeholder consultation co Guidelines, 617 which should be tailored to participation of relevant organisations in the design and implementation of the post- 2020 European Disability Strategy.

In some cases, these instruments and programmes already explicitly include a disability dimension, as in the case of the European Pillar of Social Rights, although this is not always the case. There is scope for greater complementarity between EU instruments and programmes, and the new Strategy.

Ensuring that all funding programmes are accessible and include a separate budget for accessibility: 618 The EU has a wide range of funding programmes, covering areas as diverse as infrastructure construction, research and training, education, and employment support. It is important that accessibility, following a universal design approach, and in line with Article 9 CRPD, is a core principle underlying all EU funding schemes, and this should be linked to the goals of the new Strategy. It is recommended that the Commission ensure that all proposals for EU funding programmes take disability accessibility into account, and this is supported by the Council and Parliament when the relevant legislation and programmes are adopted. In administering the programmes, the Commission should ensure that persons with disabilities are supported to participate through accessibility budgets, including a budget to cover the cost of individual reasonable accommodations, and that accessibility is addressed in an appropriate way more generally. The Commission should disseminate information about the accessibility budget widely, and ensure that the application process is simple and straightforward. Ensuring that the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union is used to its full potential to protect the rights of persons with disabilities: As noted above, 619 the CFR contains a number of provisions which are of particular importance for people with disabilities: Article 20, which provides for the right to equality before the law; Article 21(1), which contains an all-embracing prohibition of discrimination; and Article 26, setting out the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the life of the community. The Charter as a whole is also of relevance for disabled persons, as its provisions apply to all EU citizens and residents. It is recommended that the Commission (DG JUST) address disability and the rights of persons with disabilities in its New Strategy for the Implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is to be published later this year. The New Strategy will aim at improving awareness and the effective use of the Charter in the EU so that it becomes a reality for all, and it is important that the situation of disabled people is explicitly addressed in these contexts. The New Strategy should support the work of be provided by the EU; and foster mutual learning through best practices. 620 Disability-related issues must be addressed in all these areas. Ensuring coherence between the new Strategy and implementing the goals of the European Pillar of Social Rights: The Social Pillar addresses three core themes equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions, and social protection and inclusion which are all relevant to people with disabilities. Right 17 of the Pillar explicitly addresses the inclusion of people 618 See European Parliament, Resolution of 30 November 2017 on implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2017/2127(INI)), Brussels, 30 November 2017, P8_TA(2017)0474, para. 7, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2017-0474_EN.html. 619 See Section 2.1. 620 European Commission.

Notably, Commissioner Helena Dalli has stated that the 621 In that light, the new Strategy can provide the impetus for further action in the areas mentioned above. It is recommended that the Commission and other EU institutions (as relevant) adopt a strong disability mainstreaming approach when following up on the Social Pillar, and ensure that this is linked to the new European Disability Strategy. ANED has explored how this can be done, across all of the principles of the Social Pillar, and noted that it will require the active engagement of the EU institutions, the Member States, social partners and civil society, including organisations of persons with disabilities . 622 The scope for exploring the use of disability- related indicators within the Social Scoreboard, consisting of key indicators to measure progress with regard to some of the rights under the Social Pillar, should also be explored. It is also recommended that the post-2020 European Disability Strategy specifically address the impact of the current pandemic on the rights of disabled people to social protection and social inclusion, as provided for in the Social Pillar. Ensuring links between the post-2020 European Disability Strategy sm on economic governance, the European Semester, the post-Europe 2020 Strategy, and the Sustainable Development Goals: The Commission is currently reviewing the mechanisms it uses for economic and fiscal surveillance, 623 including the European Semester process, which has been used in strategic economic policy coordination mechanism. It addresses the public finances of the Member States and includes a strong focus on employment policies as well as a social dimension. The EU 2020 Strategy sets out shared goals, in the EU and its Member States. Among its most relevant headline targets, from a disability perspective, are those for employment, education and poverty reduction. Over the ten years of the EU 2020 Strategy, the number of references to disability in the Country Specific Recommendations issued by the Commission (as part of the European Semester process) to the Member States has risen, revealing a significant increase in disability mainstreaming, as noted above. 624 621 See Speech by Commissioner Dalli on the Impact of the Coronavirus Outbreak on Persons with Disabilities, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/dalli_en. 622 See generally Waddington, L. and Priestley, M., (eds.), Mainstreaming Disability Rights in the European Pillar of Social Rights A Compendium, on behalf of ANED, February 2018, available at: https://www.humanconsultancy.com/projects/academic- network-of-european-disability-experts-aned. 623 See European Commission Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Central Bank, the European Economic and Social Committee of the Regions, Economic governance review, COM(2020) 55 final, Brussels, 5 February 2020, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/economy- finance/com_2020_55_en.pdf. 624 See sub-section 3.3.1 above.

The Semester should be used to stimulate Member State policies and approaches, to support the employment and social protection of persons with disabilities. The Commission should provide for an annual review of disability mainstreaming in the European Semester process, as has been carried out by ANED for a number of years , 625 and it should ensure that Commission staff who are involved in the European Semester process, including those drafting the Joint Employment Report and the Country Specific Recommendations, CRPD and the content of the new Disability Strategy. The Strategy should also support Member States in ensuring that the officials responsible for drafting the NRPs are familiar with the CRPD and the new European Disability Strategy. In the future, the European Semester may also be used to assess and coordinate the economic policies needed to achieve the SDGs. This would allow for the recommendation of the European Economic and Social Committee to set targets and actions to achieve all SDGs inside the EU, including for people with disabilities, to be acted upon. 626 In that regard, disability should be fully mainstreamed into the European Semester as it relates to the SDGs. Using the Open Method of Coordination for realising the goals of the post-2020 European Disability Strategy: The OMC is a framework for coordination between the Member States, which aims to help them to reach common goals. The OMC can complement EU legislation, or operate in areas where the EU has limited legislative competence. 627 The OMC supports the Member States in achieving common goals through guidelines, benchmarking and measuring progress, 628 and periodic monitoring and reporting, revaluation and peer review, 629 and is based on voluntary political cooperation. 630 The OMC is principally based on: i. Jointly identifying and defining objectives to be achieved (adopted by the Council); ii. Jointly established measuring instruments (statistics, indicators, guidelines); iii. Benchmarking, i.e. comparison of EU countries performance and the exchange of best practices (monitored by the Commission). 631 Existing OMCs cover areas relevant to people with disabilities, such as employment, youth and social protection.

It is recommended that Member States report on the action that they have taken with regard to the disability-related objectives, and what has been achieved. It is recommended that the Commission take account of disability when monitoring actions of the Member States. In addition to mainstreaming disability within existing OMCs, consideration should be given to establishing a disability-specific OMC with the goal of supporting Member States to implement the CRPD in their fields of competence, and operationalising national disability action plans or strategies which will complement the new European Disability Strategy. Making use of the Structural and Investment Funds for achieving the objectives of the post-2020 European Disability Strategy: EU SIF funding has the potential to make a significant contribution to the achievement of the goals of the new Strategy. Under the current Strategy, action has been taken to ensure that the SIF supports implementation of the CRPD, by providing financial support for deinstitutionalisation and support services to enable persons with disabilities to live independently in the community. This is supported by the ex ante conditionalities linked to the Funds. Disability mainstreaming, meaning that persons with disabilities are facilitated to access and participate in projects, must be taken into account when deciding on which projects to fund and when monitoring projects. This is also the case for infrastructure projects and accessibility. The SIF also supports numerous other activities which are potentially relevant to persons with disabilities, including vocational training, employment support projects and infrastructure projects. It is recommended that the new Strategy provide for close monitoring of the SIF by the Commission at EU level and by the relevant officials at Member State level . This was also recommended by the Parliament. 634 The Strategy should provide for training of all relevant officials in the requirements of the CRPD and with regard to the importance of the ex ante conditionalities related to the SIF. This would be in line with general ex ante conditionality No. 3 on disability, which requires arrangements for training for staff of the authorities involved in the management and control of the SIF Funds in the fields of applicable Union and national 632 in Waddington, L., Quinn, G. and Flynn, E.

These provide EU Member States with more flexibility to use EU SIF to counter the effects of the pandemic. Monitoring of these measures should be focused specifically on whether the SIF are being properly targeted towards achieving the overall goals of the new Strategy and are distributed in a CRPD-compliant way.

Horizon 2020 already addresses gender as a cross-cutting issue, and it is mainstreamed in each of the different parts of the Work Programme, ensuring a more integrated approach to research and innovation. 640 Horizon Europe offers the possibility to treat disability in the same way. This would, amongst others, require project proposals to indicate how the project will incorporate a disability-related perspective, and for this to be taken into account in the evaluation. It is recommended that the EU institutions involved in the drafting and adoption of the multiannual Horizon Europe programme (the Commission, Council and Parliament ) ensure that Horizon Europe mainstreams disability issues, and the Commission , when drawing up individual work programmes and calls, ensure that disability equality is addressed as a cross- cutting issue and is taken into account in assessing the quality of research proposals. annual Rule of Law Report: In October 2016, the European Parliament addressed recommendations to the European Commission regarding the establishment of an EU mechanism on democracy, the rule 635 See: Annex IX of Regulation (EU) 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. 636 See: https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/publications/factsheets/2020/coronavirus-response- investment-initiative. 637 See: https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/newsroom/news/2020/04/04-02-2020-coronavirus-response-investment- initiative-plus-new-actions-to-mobilise-essential-investments-and-resources. 638 For more information, see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/node/71880. 639 European Parliament, Resolution of 30 November 2017 on implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2017/2127(INI)), Brussels, 30 November 2017, P8_TA(2017)0474, para. 35, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2017-0474_EN.html. 640 See: https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/promoting-gender-equality-research-and- innovation.

It is recommended that the Commission annual Rule of Law Reports report on disability rights, and relevant connections be made in the annual Rule of Law Report with the post-2020 European Disability Strategy on issues such as access to justice and political participation. Ensuring that disability considerations are taken into account in implementation of the European Green Deal: The Commission has recently published a Communication on the European Green Deal. 647 The Green Deal is intended to work towards making Europe climate-neutral and ensuring that no one is left behind in this process. It addresses decarbonising the energy sector, renovating buildings to help cut energy use, supporting industry to innovate, and ensuring cleaner, cheaper and healthier forms of public and private transport. Some of these actions are of relevance for people with disabilities, as is the general . Moreover, people with disabilities can be affected in particular ways by climate change and by the various measures taken to address climate change. 648 not mention people with disabilities. It is recommended that the Commission reflect on the disability dimension to the European Green Deal and implement it in a disability-sensitive way.

Through their representative organisations, people with disabilities should be meaningfully involved in the various mechanisms set up to implement the Green Deal. The objectives of the Strategy should be mainstreamed in the work of the EU administration, in line with the recommendations of the EU CRPD Monitoring Framework. 649 It is recommended that, the Commission include in the implementation plan for the new Strategy specific actions that target the public administration, requiring that all EU institutions and agencies take CRPD-compliant actions in respect of the work as a public administration. This would entail ensuring that the policies of the EU institutions and agencies are fully inclusive of people with disabilities, particularly policies on employment, and that all websites of the EU institutions and agencies are accessible, in accordance with relevant international and EU standards. The Commission carries out impact assessments on proposed initiatives which are expected to have significant economic, social or environmental impacts, and it periodically evaluates instruments which have been adopted. The Better Regulation Guidelines 650 set out the principles that the Commission follows when preparing new initiatives and proposals, and when managing and evaluating existing legislation. Where proposed measures may have an impact on the situation of people with disabilities, and where existing instruments are having such an impact, it is important to take the disability dimension into account in impact assessments and evaluations. This does not always happen at present. For example, the 2017 evaluation 651 of the Directive on Consumer Rights, 652 which was adopted after the entry into force of the CRPD, did not mention consumers with disabilities. 649 European Disability Strategy Post-2020: Contribution from the EU CRPD Monitoring Framework, Brussels, 16 February 2020, p. 11, available at: https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/contribution-eu-framework-post-2020-disability- strategy_en.pdf. 650 See: https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/better-regulation-guidelines_en. 651 See: http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/item-detail.cfm?item_id=59332. 652 Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights amending Council 93/13/EEC and Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 95/577/EEC and Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.

        "The Post-2020 European Disability Strategy PE 656.398 143 It is recommended that the Commission amend the Better Regulation Guidelines to ensure that they provide appropriate guidance on how to assess the expected impact of proposed measures on persons with disabilities and evaluate the impact of existing measures on persons with disabilities. This new guidance should be acted upon when carrying out impact assessments or evaluations of existing legislation. 5.2.2 Embedding the New Strategy within Member State Infrastructure Since the new Disability Strategy should be a strategy for implementing the CRPD throughout the EU, it should also be embedded within Member State infrastructure, and Member States and relevant actors at the national level have a role to play in ensuring that the objectives of the post-2020 European Disability Strategy are met. In that regard, relevant recommendations are outlined below. Many Member States have in place national strategies for implementing the CRPD, and these are periodically reviewed and updated. With regard to national strategies, it is worth bearing in mind that other EU Strategies, and specifically the EU Framework for National Roma integration strategies, call on Member States to adopt strategies for Roma integration. 653 That Framework focuses primarily on the adoption of national strategies which address four areas (access to education, employment, healthcare and housing). Under that Framework, Member States are also to produce annual reports detailing progress. In contrast, the European Disability Strategy has a much broader scope, with significant implications for both EU institutions and Member States, that extend beyond the adoption of national strategies. Given that the EU and its Member States share responsibility for implementing the Convention and, in combination, are jointly responsible for implementing the Convention in full, it is recommended that the Member States pay attention to the complementarity of their national strategies with the post-2020 European Disability Strategy. Likewise, it is recommended that the Commission ensure that the EU Strategy supports the implementation of national strategies. The EU Strategy can also facilitate and support the adoption of national strategies, where these are not already in place. Existing structures, such as the DHLG, the European Semester process, and the OMC, may have a role to play in this respect. In brief, the EU Disability Strategy should support the development, coordination, dissemination and monitoring of national disability strategies. 653 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020, COM(2011) 173 final.

        "IPOL | ional Affairs 144 PE 656.398 Given that the NRPs are an integral element of the European Semester process which feed into it is recommended that the Member States ensure that the employment of people with disabilities is addressed in the NRPs. In addition, when submitting their NRPs to the Commission, the Member States should indicate which structural reforms and policy actions are being taken to achieve the objectives of Europe 2020 and the new Strategy in the fields of employment, education and social inclusion, and the extent to which input was received from relevant stakeholders, including people with disabilities themselves. It is also recommended that the Commission monitor the experience with national disability strategies and the existing European coordination mechanisms mentioned above. If the approach recommended above, which encourages and supports Member States in the adoption and implementation of national disability strategies seems inadequate, it is recommended that the Commission reflect on whether an approach similar to that found in the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies be adopted. Such an approach would place greater requirements on Member States in terms of adopting national disability strategies and reporting on achievements. As acknowledged by several EU institutions 654 and stakeholders, 655 there is a need for participation of civil society actors from EU Member States in implementing the objectives of the new European Disability Strategy, and ultimately those of the CRPD. Civil society organisations and Member State authorities cooperate with each other in various ways in different countries, and a more coherent approach entailing mutual learning would serve to facilitate implementation of the new Strategy across the EU. In order to enhance cooperation between all relevant actors at the national level throughout the Member States, it is recommended that the Commission facilitate, in the context of the DHLG, the exchange of best practices and knowledge regarding new and existing models of cooperation between DPOs, CSOs and relevant officials at national level. It is recommended that Member States cooperate in this process of exchange of knowledge and best practices. 654 See, for instance: European Parliament, Resolution of 30 November 2017 on implementation of the European Disability Strategy (2017/2127(INI)), Brussels, 30 November 2017, P8_TA(2017)0474, para. 119, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2017-0474_EN.html. 655 See, for instance: Ioannis Vardakastanis, President of EDF, Rights 2020- 26 February 2020.

Some of those have already been explored above in sub-section 5.1.2 ( Designing a Strategy to Implement the CRPD Doing the Groundwork and, especially, the recommendation made to identify a first list of actions (implementation plan), which is periodically updated), and in sections 5.1.3 (Embedding the New Strategy within the Infrastructure of the EU). Further implementation measures are discussed below. Both the European Parliament 657 and several DPOs, including EDF, 658 have acknowledged the need to establish a specific budget line linked directly to the new European Disability Strategy. This budget line should be foreseen in the next MFF. Such a budget the disability focal points, to ensure their shared ownership in ensuring the Agenda [Strategy] achieves 659 EU funding programmes administered by the Commission , such as Horizon Europe, should also have a ring-fenced budget line to be used to fund disability-related projects and accessibility, and a specific budget line should be guaranteed by the Commission for the EU CRPD Monitoring Framework, to ensure that it is in a position to carry out its tasks under Article 33(2) CRPD. It is recommended that the Council , as the body which plays the central role in the adoption of the MFF, ensure sufficient funding is allocated to implement the new European Disability Strategy. The budget should be allocated amongst the DFPs, with each institution and focal point responsible for its proper use.

As noted above in sub-section 5.1.2, it is important to publish an initial list of planned actions linked to the new Strategy when it is adopted. This should be subject to periodic review, and a second list of actions, covering the second period of the Strategy (2026-2030), should be published following a mid- term review. The lists should consist of clear, measurable actions which are linked to a specific timeframe, and will be important both in implementing and monitoring the Strategy. The second list of actions should take full account of the second Concluding Observations issued to the EU by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which should be adopted in the early years of the new Strategy. In light of the above, it is recommended that the Commission publish a second list of actions (implementation plan) for the European Disability Strategy post-2020 before 2026. This should build on the mid-term review of the Strategy 660 and the second Concluding Observations issued to the EU by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Both the initial and second list of action should identify which organisation or body is responsible for taking the listed action. 5.3.2 Monitoring the New Disability Strategy It is important to build into the post-2020 European Disability Strategy appropriate monitoring tools from the onset. Monitoring can help to reveal the impact the Strategy is having, and identify where changes in approaches are needed. The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 provided for a mid-term evaluation. However, this was carried out somewhat later than originally envisaged, with the related Progress Report only being published in 2017, and the mid-term evaluation did not lead to the adoption of a new list of actions covering the second period of the 2010-2020 Strategy.

This is particularly important as the second set of Concluding Observations issued to the EU by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will not be available at the time the new Strategy is adopted, but can be taken into account in the mid-term evaluation. It is recommended that the Commission ensure that the mid-term evaluation of the new Disability Strategy is carried out in a timely manner and that it leads to a re-evaluation of priorities and actions where the evaluation indicates that this is needed. The Commission periodically evaluates instruments which have been adopted, including legal instruments which mainstream disability or which could otherwise be expected to have an impact on people with disabilities. It also monitors compliance by Member States. The 2017 Resolution of the European Parliament on the Implementation of the European Disability Strategy called for full implementation and monitoring of all accessibility-related legislation, and enhanced assessment compliance with certain EU legislation. 661 The June 2020 Resolution of the European Parliament on the European Disability Strategy post-2020 called for accessibility legislation to be monitored by a European Access Board, established by the European Commission for that purpose. 662 It is recommended that the Commission ensure that evaluations of instruments which are linked to the post-2020 European Disability Strategy, including legislative instruments which mainstream disability, fully address the impact of the instrument on people with disabilities. Given the importance of accessibility, the Commission should pay particular attention to assessing compliance by Member States with EU legislation in this field. These recommendations are linked to the recommendation on the Better Regulation Guidelines made above. 663 A recommendation has already been made above regarding indicators and data collection (see sub- section 5.1.2).
