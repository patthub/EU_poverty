        "G. whereas the EU should play a central role in promoting conflict prevention, mediation and resolution, the protection and promotion of human rights, the rule of law and space for civil society, as well as democratic, social and fair economic governance in the Maghreb and Mashreq regions; whereas an open civil society and the work of human rights defenders as actors for social change are fundamental to the long-term resilience and prosperity of the region; H. whereas any detention that results from the exercise of the rights or freedoms guaranteed by international law, such as freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, constitutes arbitrary detention that is prohibited under international law; whereas, in significant swathes of the MENA region, human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, political opposition activists and civil society at large have faced increasing systematic persecution, threats, attacks, reprisals, judicial harassment, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment; whereas the EU and the Member States must significantly step up their efforts in order to adequately address this issue; I. whereas in the region, there are numerous armed conflicts and thousands of people have been murdered and disappeared and millions displaced; whereas ISIS/Daesh and other jihadist groups have committed atrocities, including brutal executions and unspeakable sexual violence, abductions, torture, forced conversions and the enslavement of women and girls; whereas children have been recruited and used in terrorist attacks; whereas there are serious concerns about the welfare of the population currently under the control of ISIS/Daesh and their possible use as human shields during the liberation campaign; whereas these crimes may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity; J. whereas in response to the developments in the region, the EU revised its Neighbourhood Policy in 2015; whereas the review provides for a deeper involvement of Member States in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP); K. whereas state and societal resilience are among the key priorities of the EU Global Strategy; whereas the latter recognises that a resilient society hallmarked by democracy, trust in institutions, and sustainable development lies at the heart of a resilient state, while repressive states are inherently fragile in the long term; L. whereas, for those countries with which the EU has signed association agreements, the legally binding commitments of these agreements, including on human rights, should form a basis for relations and, notably, the partnership priorities agreed between the EU and certain neighbourhood countries; M. whereas according to UNICEF, the first threat affecting children living in MENA conflict areas is child labour; whereas 2,1 million children in Syria and 700 000 Syrian refugee children do not have access to education; whereas continuing violence and external displacement, natural disasters, growing economic and gender inequality, and high rates of youth unemployment and poverty in several MENA countries have left 28 million children in need of humanitarian assistance; 1. Notes with concern that, eight years after the first upheavals, most of the legitimate aspirations of the peaceful protesters for dignity, human rights and progressive social, economic and political reforms have still not been met in most countries; acknowledges that in some cases there have been a few positive developments and some democratic gains have been consolidated, but points to the fact that these are still insufficient; condemns the persistent and continuing violations of human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms, and widespread discrimination against minorities; is very worried about the continued dire socio-economic situation in the region and, in particular, about the high levels of unemployment (affecting, in particular, women and young people) and social exclusion, which cause disillusionment and disenfranchisement on a large scale, especially among young people, pushing them into despair, to irregular migration as a way out or making them more vulnerable to radicalisation; stresses that the economic situation of these countries has a strong impact on their security situation as well; deplores the persistent levels of corruption, nepotism and unaccountability in the region; 2. Stresses that the long-term prosperity of post-Arab Spring countries goes hand in hand with their capacity to actively ensure the protection of universal human rights and the establishment and anchorage of democratic and transparent institutions that are engaged in protecting citizens\u2019 fundamental rights; is, therefore, very concerned about ongoing human rights violations, the shrinking or closing space for democracy and local civil society organisations, the rollback of gains in 26.3.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 108/93 Wednesday 27 March 2019 ",
        "freedom of expression \u2014 both online and offline \u2014 and of assembly and association, the repression of human rights defenders and the suppression of the role of the media \u2014 including through abuses of anti-terrorism legislation and surveillance technology and the curtailment of the rule of law, in a number of MENA countries; notes with concern the particular role and responsibility of the military and the security services in the deterioration in the political trajectory of several countries in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, and their persistent and dominating control over State and economic resources; calls, therefore, for the EU and the Member States to adequately incorporate this fundamental dimension within their engagement with the MENA region; calls for the EU and Member States to engage with third-country governments to end such practices and repeal repressive legislation, as well as to ensure proper vetting of the exports of European surveillance technology and technical assistance; urges the EU to give priority to supporting parliamentary and civil society efforts towards greater accountability and transparency of the security and military services; 3. Welcomes the EU and its Member States\u2019 continued efforts to promote democracy, the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms, as well as economic development and the important nexus between democracy and sustainable security in post-Arab Spring countries, and acknowledges the complexity of such a task; takes the view, however, that, despite a fifteen-year policy focus on Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries, renewed policy efforts and increased budgetary resources in the wake of the Arab Spring (or Arab Springs), the EU\u2019s goals and policies have not yet been achieved to the extent needed (and in some instances the situation has become worse), and that a real process of socio-economic inclusion has yet to begin; stresses that the external action of the EU vis-\u00e0-vis post-Arab Spring countries should factor in the realities on the ground and adapt policy strategies and their implementation accordingly; considers that insufficient EU leadership and initiative in working towards the resolution of protracted conflicts have weakened the EU\u2019s capacity to make a diplomatic impact in the region; calls for the EU to strongly support the UN peace processes aimed at the resolution of conflicts in the MENA region; 4. Recalls the harm and suffering caused by extremism and terrorism in the region, and highlights that violence is a serious threat to its stability and that security cooperation within the region, as well as cooperation with the EU and its Member States, in full respect for international human rights law, remains of the utmost importance in order to successfully overcome terrorist organisations such as Daesh and, in so doing, help the people in the region to eventually live in peace and in an environment of stability and progress; welcomes, therefore, EU initiatives aimed at addressing the terrorist threat in the MENA region; underlines the importance of strengthening the capacity of state actors that play a key role in countering terrorism and violent extremism, as well as the essential need to focus on partnerships between the authorities, young people and communities to address underlying factors that can make communities vulnerable to violent extremism, and to tackle the root causes of conflict; 5. Expresses concern about the fact that, in spite of its considerable political and budgetary investments and continuous political and economic outreach, the EU has not been able to gain real, substantive political and economic leverage, that the impact of EU policies remains limited, and the EU is not perceived as a game changer by the countries in the region; points to the dissatisfaction felt by civil society, local NGOs and young people in general at how the EU fails to fully translate its vision into action on the ground; is concerned about the increasingly complex political situation in the Maghreb and Mashreq regions, and notes the emergence of new and resurgent political and economic regional players such as Russia and China in addition to the competing narratives and financing from the Gulf countries and Iran, which pursue objectives that could even be in conflict with those of the EU; calls for a stronger commitment by and firmer vision on the part of the EU to enable it to become a more central player; calls for the EU to engage in more dialogue with civil society organisations (CSOs) in order to pursue policies which are able to meet the expectations of all democratic stakeholders; emphasises the need for the EU to engage in dialogue with all political actors in the MENA countries; 6. Highlights the importance of the Union for the Mediterranean(UfM), which is the only political forum that brings together the EU Member States and all the Mediterranean countries; stresses that the UfM that has recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, must play a greater role in jointly addressing the challenges we have in common; takes positive note of the Third Regional Forum of the UfM on 8 October 2018, which commemorated the 10th Anniversary of the Paris Summit for the Mediterranean, recognised the usefulness of continuing to develop the interactions between the UfM and other actors in the Euro-Mediterranean region; calls on the Commission, the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the High Representative to substantially rethink and revive the project of the UfM; encourages the use of this project as a means of fostering closer cooperation between the EU and Mediterranean countries; C 108/94 EN Official Journal of the European Union 26.3.2021 Wednesday 27 March 2019 ",
        "7. Regrets that partnership priorities are being concluded with countries without any conditions attached and despite significant and continuing backsliding in the field of democracy, human rights and the rule of law; 8. Takes the view that for far too long the policy stance towards Maghreb and Mashreq countries was marred by an approach which was based to too great an extent on the EU\u2019s expectations and objectives, which did not fully take into account the interests and realities of the EU\u2019s partner countries, and with little incentive for and ownership by the latter and too little consideration for the aspirations of the populations who ought to benefit from EU policies, and for the particular political situation in different countries; regrets that the initial efforts after the Arab Spring (or Arab Springs) to introduce stricter conditionality and delivery incentives for beneficiary countries through the \u2018more for more\u2019 principle did not lead to greater leverage on the part of the EU in its ability to promote real change in the areas of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, economic and social development and sustainable security in most countries; stresses that differentiation and enhanced mutual ownership are the hallmarks of the ENP, recognising different levels of engagement, and reflecting the interests of each country in relation to the nature and focus of its partnership with the Union; calls for a more consistent application of the \u2018more for more\u2019 principle by defining, at policy, programme and project levels in bilateral relations, concrete goals and benchmarks for increased support; recalls that the goal of democratisation can only be achieved in a sustainable manner if it is thoroughly pursued throughout the respective countries in both urban as well as, in particular, rural areas, and highlights that stability supports the development of a democracy, and that a well-timed preparation process which should include a wide consultation and inclusion of relevant societal groups and leaders, is beneficial to achieving this goal; further underlines that democratisation both supports economic development and strengthens the rule of law; 9. Acknowledges the initial efforts by the EEAS and the Commission, in cooperation and dialogue with the European Parliament, to substantially reform the EU policy framework for post-Arab Spring countries in order to increase its political leverage capacity in the Maghreb and Mashreq regions; points to the Global Strategy for the European Union\u2019s Foreign and Security Policy and its added value as regards the potential for achieving synergies in actions at EU level, building on political, economic and social dialogue, stressing further the nexus between socio-economic development and sustainable security, and ensuring adequate support and implementation through the Financial Instruments for the external action of the EU; takes note of the 2015 revision of the ENP aimed at taking into account the changing scenarios in the region; insists on the importance of in-depth, annual country-by-country reporting on the implementation of the ENP; recalls also the important support provided by the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) in the implementation of the EU\u2019s Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy and its human rights guidelines and country strategies, which has enabled the EU to act more strategically in this area, including in the Southern Neighbourhood, and has ensured greater accountability, visibility and effectiveness; 10. Stresses the need to strive for the most efficient use of available resources in order to optimise the impact of the EU\u2019s external action that should be achieved through coherence and complementarity among the Union\u2019s external action financing instruments; 11. Points out the complexity of responding appropriately to the migration and refugee flows from and through the Maghreb and Mashreq regions, of a security-focused perspective on migration, of the challenge of terrorism and the legitimate concerns about the fragility of certain countries in the region, and the need for stronger consideration of climate change imperatives, as well as the challenges arising from the lack of a cohesive approach by the Member States; is concerned that these factors are leading the EU\u2019s action in relation to the region to rely excessively on an ideology of short-term stability, thereby disregarding other important aspects; takes the view that when stability and security become the predominant objectives, they lead to a shorter-term and short-sighted policy vision and deprive EU action directed at reaffirming human rights and fundamental freedoms of the required intensity; recalls that fostering state and societal resilience should not lead to the continuation of authoritarian regimes; reiterates that human rights are not subordinate to migration management or counter-terrorism actions, and is convinced that a credible and coherent stability and sustainable security policy can only be achieved through the pursuit of longer-term interests and principles, such as inclusive and beneficial economic and social development, as well as the strengthening of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in the framework of a human-centred and conflict-sensitive approach; recalls, however, that the long-term stability of those countries can only be achieved through a balanced relationship between security requirements and development, based on the rule of law and human rights; 26.3.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 108/95 Wednesday 27 March 2019 ",
        "12. Calls for the EU to address the root causes of migration such as conflicts, environmental issues, extreme poverty and social exclusion and to re-orient political cooperation towards a more balanced and equal partnership with the MENA region, putting youth policies and investments towards local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at its heart; 13. Notes that some countries host millions of refugees, the majority of whom are women and children living in poverty, which exacerbates domestic violence, the prostitution of women and young girls, forced child marriage and child labour in the community; 14. Calls for the European institutions, its Member States as well as national development agencies, to strive to provide a unified European stance towards the region, focusing on our common interests, to ensure a single and coherent European strategy, in order to fulfil the EU\u2019s full potential as a meaningful supporter of democratic, economic and social reforms; 15. Notes with particular concern that civil society and human rights defenders across the MENA region face increasing threats, reprisals, judicial harassment, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment as well as other forms of persecution; underlines that the work of human rights defenders is crucial for the long-term development and stability of the region; reiterates, in this context, its call for full implementation of the EU guidelines on human rights defenders; emphasises the need for EU and Member State leaders and diplomats at all levels to raise cases of individual human rights defenders at risk with third-country governments including, where appropriate, through public statements, d\u00e9marches and regular dialogue, meetings with defenders, visiting defenders in detention, and observing defenders\u2019 trials; highlights the need for the EU and Member States to increase their funding and capacity for supporting human rights defenders at risk, through emergency grants as well as through support for civil society protection mechanisms such as ProtectDefenders.eu; welcomes the European Endowment for Democracy and the EIDHR\u2019s consistent efforts to promote democracy and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms in the Southern Neighbourhood of the EU; insists that the EU and its Member States must actively seek to engage with and support the most vulnerable human rights defenders and civil society actors across the region, including those in remote and rural regions, those fighting for LGBTI, indigenous, environmental and land rights, refugee and labour rights defenders, and women, who face specific risks and threats due to their gender; 16. Welcomes the concept of co-ownership put forward by the revised ENP; is concerned, however, that it runs the risk of allowing authoritarian regimes in certain partner countries to cherry-pick priorities according to their national agenda, instead of advancing along the path towards democratisation; stresses, therefore, the importance of a long-term policy framework and synergies in programming for post-Arab Springs countries based on the primacy of democracy, the inclusion of all democratic political forces and the primacy of the rule of law, human rights and fundamental values; reiterates that strengthening these aspects, as well as developing an attractive economic climate and support for positive reforms are in the interests of the partner countries and their populations, as well as of the EU, and calls for stronger conditionality in cases of systematic violations of human rights by the authorities; recalls that partner countries that are willing to pursue reforms, closer political dialogue and that attain more should be given new incentives and support adequate to their aspirations and commitment, and demands a performance-based approach, based on inclusive dialogue, clear priorities and objectives in this sense; insists that in cases of systematic violations of human rights by the authorities, EU budgetary assistance should be redirected to local civil society; 17. Supports the aspirations of all those in the MENA region, including the majority of young people, who want to establish free, stable, prosperous, inclusive, and democratic countries which respect their national and international commitments on human rights and fundamental freedoms; welcomes democratic processes in the region and the sustained partnership with the EU; calls for the EU to take this into account in all its policy areas, in order to enhance their coherence and to assist the partner countries in a more effective way; highlights that, for any political transformation to be fully sustainable, it is important and necessary to come to terms with the past and, in this context, points to the important work of the \u2018Truth and Dignity Commission\u2019 of Tunisia, which sets an example for the entire region; 18. Regrets that in certain instances, bilateral investigative and judicial cooperation on cases of detention, violence or the deaths of EU citizens has been inadequate, as in the case of the Italian researcher Giulio Regeni; considers it essential to link further collaboration in other sectors to substantial improvements in this field; C 108/96 EN Official Journal of the European Union 26.3.2021 Wednesday 27 March 2019 ",
        "19. Is convinced that where the prerequisites for the negotiation of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFATs), conditional on democratic progress, are not yet in place or do not meet the respective countries\u2019 aspirations, the EU should provide increased access to sustainable trade and investment, notably for the benefit of Southern Mediterranean populations and economies, supporting production capacities, the modernisation of infrastructure and the creation of attractive economic climates, with a focus on the domestic and regional markets, fostering decent work, social protection and inclusive socio-economic development; 20. Takes the view that, as the EU struggles to come up with a forward-looking, rights-based and people-centred vision for its migration and asylum policy, there is an increasing risk that some countries in the region might use migration containment and their role therein to seek greater leverage in their political and policy dialogue with the EU; considers that more assistance should be provided to the MENA countries to deal with the influx of immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, and, in this context, welcomes the efforts made by the EU to tackle the root causes of migration, but recalls that more efforts will be needed to be successful in this endeavour; considers it important to involve MENA region partners in the implementation of common solutions to tackle issues such as the fight against human trafficking; is concerned, however, about the possible instrumentalisation of EU foreign policy as \u2018migration management\u2019, and emphasises that all attempts to work with post-Arab Springs countries, including countries of origin and transit, on migration must go hand in hand with improving human rights conditions within these countries and their compliance with international human rights and refugee law; stresses that the challenge posed by migration flows is a common challenge for the countries of the MENA region (countries of origin and transit) and those of the Union (countries of destination); stresses, in addition, the importance of a policy framework promoting democratic, political and socio-economic inclusion as mutually reinforcing factors, including with regard to fostering conditions for a safe, dignified life for people in the region and reducing forced displacement; 21.
