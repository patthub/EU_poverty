        "5 The use of renewable energy sources in Europe will increase, leading to a more sustainable energy mix, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a lower dependency from oil. In pursuit of the Kyoto protocol and the revised Lisbon strategy the European Union has set itself the ambitious goal to derive 12% of its total energy consumption from renewable energy sources by 2010. The Framework Programmes for Research and Development (FP) of the European Union have contributed from their beginning to the development of renewable energy technologies. These Community actions have a proven European added value in terms of building critical mass, strengthening excellence and exercising a catalytic effect on national activities. In combination with national activities, working at European level with an adequate combination of innovation and regulatory measures has produced substantial results. For example technological progress has enabled a ten-fold increase in the sizes of wind turbines, from 50 kW units to 5 MW, in 25 years and a cost reduction of more than 50% over the last 15 years. In consequence, the installed capacity has increased 16 times in the last ten years to reach 40 GW in Europe. In 2005, the world production of photovoltaic modules was 1760 MW compared to 90 MW in 1996. Over the same period, the average module price has decreased from about 10 \u20ac /W (1996) to about 3 \u20ac /W (2005).The average annual growth rate of about 35% in the past decade makes photovoltaics one of the fastest growing energy industries. The European technology platforms (ETPs) established in the energy field (hydrogen and fuel cells, photovoltaics, biofuels, solar thermal technologies, wind energy, smart grids, zero-emission fossil fuels power plant) have demonstrated the readiness of the research community and industry, together with other important stakeholders, such as civil society organisations, to develop a common vision and establish specific roadmaps to achieve it. These technology platforms are already having an influence on the European and national programmes. The platforms themselves are calling for action at European level and a framework for the elaboration of large-scale integrated initiatives needs to be developed for this to happen. This brochure presents an overview on the 64 medium-to-long term research projects aiming at the development of renewable energy sources and technologies, including their connection to the grid and socio-economic research related to renewable energy sources, which were funded through the \u2018Sustainable Energy Systems\u2019 programme managed by DG Research under the 6th Framework Programme in the period 2002-2006. Amongst the 64 projects presented here photovoltaics and biomass were the most important sectors, supported with 66.5 M \u20ac and 82.5 M \u20ac respectively, while for the other sources of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal, solar concentrating and ocean energy 45.5 M \u20ac were spent in total. The socio-economic aspects of renewable energy were also studied in projects funded to the level of 20 M \u20ac . These long-term research efforts were supplemented by short-term research and demonstration actions in the short to medium term part of the programme, which is not included in this brochure. The projects are grouped by energy source, i.e. photovoltaics, biomass etc. rather than funding instrument. This allows the reader to gain a quick and comprehensive view of the European research activities in each technical area. An electronic version of this brochure will be available on the web (http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/index_en.htm) allowing easy online access to the projects. I hope that this publication will be of interest to many, and particularly those considering further industrial development of renewable energy sources and those planning to participate in FP7.

        "Challenges Long-term scenarios for a sustainable global development suggest that it should be feasible, by the middle of this century, to provide over 80% of electric power by a mix of energy from renewable sources. Photovoltaics are one important option which can provide a significant share of over 30% of such a mix. This Integrated Project (IP) is focused on the development, assessment and consolidation of photovoltaic thin film technology, and on the most promising material and device options, namely cadmium-free cells and modules, based on amorphous, micro- and polycrystalline silicon as well as on I-III-VI2-chalcopyrite compound semiconductors. The overall challenge is to provide the scientific and technological basis for industrial mass pro- duction of cost-effective and highly efficient, environmentally sound and economically compliant large-area thin film solar cells and modules. By drawing on a broad basis of expertise, the entire range of module fabrication and supporting R&D will be covered: substrates, semiconductor and contact deposition, monolithic series inter- connection, encapsulation, performance evaluation and applications. Photovoltaics have become an increasingly important industrial sector over the past ten years. PV is a widely accepted technology and numerous kinds of solar modules and PV systems are commercially available. The expansion of the production volume of PV systems will be accompanied by considerable cost reductions. Therefore the main challenges are: (cid:129) Significantly reducing the cost/efficiency ratio towards \u20ac 0.5/WP in the long run. (cid:129) Providing the know-how and the scientific basis for large-area PV modules by identifying and testing new materials and technologies with maximum cost reduction. (cid:129) Developing the process know-how and the production technology, as well as the design and fabrication of specialised equipment, resulting in low costs and high yield in the production of large area thin film modules. O B J E C T I V E S A T H L E T Advanced Thin Film Technologies for Cost Effective Photovoltaics 8 The overall goal of this project is to provide the scientific and technological basis for industrial mass production of cost-effective and highly efficient large-area thin film solar modules. This includes the development of the process know-how and the production technology, as well as the design and fabrication of specialised equipment. A successful development will establish Europe as the leading producer of thin film solar modules and maintain European leadership in photovoltaics (PV) over the longer term. The main objectives are two-fold: development and improvement of existing thin film PV technologies, with the goal of increasing the module efficiency/cost ratio towards a target of \u20ac 0.5/Wp, and the establishment of know-how and a scientific basis for a future generation of PV modules by developing new device concepts, materials and production processes. Project Structure To meet these challenges, existing concepts for materials and technology will be improved and brought to ma turity in close cooperation with industry, and new options will be investigated for materials and new types of solar cells to provide the scientific and technological basis for the next generation of PV devices. Accordingly, the re search activities range from basic research to industrial implementation. This is reflected in the division of the project into 4 horizontal (trans-disciplinary) and 2 vertical (along value chain) sub-projects: THIN FILM TECHNOLOGIES Two vertical sub-projects (SP) are oriented along the value chain: SP III focuses on large area, environmentally sound chalcopyrite modules with improved efficiencies; SP IV deals with the up-scaling of silicon-based tandem cells to an industrial level. Four horizontal sub-projects have a trans-disciplinary character: SP V will provide analysis and modelling of devices and technology for all other sub-project; SP I will demonstrate higher efficiencies of lab scale cells; SP II will focus on module aspects relevant to all thin film technologies; SP VI will ensure that the performed work will have a positive impact on the environment and society. An experienced management will help the consortium meet its goals. ",
        "9 This Integrated Project, which consists of the six interlinked sub-projects visualised above, covers the area of fundamental research, technological development and production issues relating to the most relevant photovoltaic thin film tech- nologies. For the first time, the research on these technologies will be carried out within a joint scientific framework. Close cooperation of the research teams in the horizontal and vertical projects, in combination with common workshops and panel discussions, will guarantee a continuous exchange and flow of know-how in both direc- tions. All sub-projects are embedded in a man- agement unit. The management controls the compliance with the objectives, which are defined in milestones and deliverables. It will also coordinate all reporting required, provide legal assistance and moderate all negotiations between project partners concerning relevant commercial and scientific results. The six sub- projects contain 23 work packages altogether.

        "Project Information 11 Other expected results are: (cid:129) Strategic impact: reinforcing competitiveness and solving societal problems: the aim is to improve the cost-effectiveness of thin film PV modules to substantially increase their contribution to the sustainable energies supply. Europe, Japan and the US contribute the largest share of PV production worldwide. Europe was on a level with Japan in 1997. During 2002 Japan was already responsible for almost 50% of global PV production. (cid:129) Reinforcing competitiveness of small and medium-size enterprises (SME): the technology transfer of new solar cell technologies from the lab to industry will help to reinforce competi tiveness of small and medium-size enterprises (Solarion, Sulfurcell). It can be assumed that results from this project will inspire the foundation of new companies. (cid:129) Innovation-related activities, exploitation and dissemination plans: international consolidated solar cell producers, like Shell Solar and SCHOTT Solar, are an integral part of the project. They co-operate closely with the R&D partners. The industries will exploit the results generated within the project. Dissemination of the R&D results will occur internally and externally. (cid:129) Added value of the work at EU level: this project aims at decreasing the cost of PV electricity to competitive levels by focusing on new and improved thin film technologies and materials.

        "Challenges In most cases, the integration of PV systems gives a building a \u2019high tech\u2019 modern appearance, since most conventional PV modules have a typical window-like surface. Considering, however, that 90% of the building stock is older than 10 years and therefore has a more or less \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 appearance, it is evident that aesthetic building integration of PV calls for a lot of willingness from planners and creativity from architects. Many PV systems integrated into existing buildings do not harmonise with the building and its sur- roundings, indicating a potential for conflict with urban planners. We therefore pay special attention to architectural and aesthetic questions. Another key fact is that the market for refurbishing and modernising old buildings is much larger than the market for new buildings. Therefore, there are not only aesthetic but also important economic grounds for accessing this market. O B J E C T I V E S B I P V - C I S Expanding the Potential for the Integration of Photovoltaic Systems into Existing Buildings 12 Building integration of PV (BIPV) often leads to a \u2019high-tech\u2019 and modern appearance of buildings, caused by the typical window-like surface of most conventional PV modules. In many PV systems integrated into existing buildings, the modules do not harmonise with the surroundings. The objectives of this project are to identify the potential and needs for improved BIPV components and systems, as a basis for developing modules without a glass/window-like appearance, to develop and investigate fa\u00e7ade elements and overhead glazing, both for the ventilated and the insulated building skin based on CIS thin-film technology, to develop PV roof tiles which have a modified optical appearance for better adaptation to the building skin, to fabricate and test prototypes according to relevant standards and carry out subsequent performance tests, and to develop electrical interconnection components suitable for thin-film modules. Project Structure The project consortium consists of seven indus- trial partners, two research institutes and three universities. The project comprises a very broad approach to the building integration of CIS modules since two proposals were merged together by the European Commission. The fol- lowing topics are now being developed and investigated within the project: (cid:129) The integration of PV into the ventilated building skin (cid:129) The integration of PV into the insulated building skin (cid:129) Roof integration with CIS roof tiles. Furthermore, we are investigating aesthetic, technological and legal aspects of integrating PV into existing buildings, as well as developing module components. As a basis for the work mentioned above, studies were conducted into European building regulations that strongly influence the construction and dimensioning of the modules and often forbid the use of what are known as standard PV modules in building integration. Also European surveys on roofing elements and on mullion/transom constructions were conducted. A market study provided information about market needs. Cost-optimised junction boxes which are especially suited for thin film modules are being developed in the project. A solution for the invisible connection of modules integrated in the insulated building skin will also be developed. The prototypes will be tested in accordance with the relevant standards.

For that purpose, the results of this project as regards modification of module appearance will be exploited by the CIS producing partners. The junction box for thin film modules to be developed in the project, as well as innovative edge con- nectors, will be used by the partners in their module production line: they will also be available for the entire thin film module industry. Progress to Date PV in fa\u00e7ades Prototypes of CIS modules with modified optical appearance on both front and rear sides, for improved integration into surroundings, were developed and characterised. PV in overhead glazing A prototype of novel overhead glazing includes semi-transparent CIS modules optimised for daylight transmission. Interconnection Prototypes of a small junction box especially suited for thin-film modules were developed. Limiting the by-pass diodes to only one per box allows a reduction in both size and cost. It is also possible to use the box for parallel inter - connection of the modules. PV and architects A workshop on the architectural fundamentals of BIPV was held at the Glasstec fair in D\u00fcsseldorf on 9 November 2004. Building regulations European surveys were conducted on building regulations concerning PV building integration, on architectural glass, on mullion/transom con- structions, and on roofing materials suited for PV.

        "Challenges The technical challenges of the project are, on the one hand, to allow the module manufacturers to implement new equipment and processes in their production lines and, on the other hand, to give the equipment manufacturers the possibility of constructing and selling equipment for complete production lines producing unbreakable modules at unbeatable cost. Consequently, all the commercially exploitable results of the project are foreseen as being used directly by the companies involved in Flexcellence: VHF-Technologies is to set up an advanced pilot production line for 2 MW annual capacity by end-2006, and R&R and Exitech are expected to be able to offer standardised roll-to-roll deposition systems and laser scribing processes by the end of the project. The scientific challenges of the project are to master the different interfaces in multi-layer devices, to develop effective light-trapping schemes for n-i-p cells on flexible substrates, and to understand the interaction between the depo- sition conditions (for different kind of deposition techniques) and device properties. Project structure The project is divided into eight work packages (WP) with a minimum of three participants in each. The composition of the WP should ensure a maximum cross-fertilisation and exchange of the scientific and technological know-how. The seven R&D work packages are organised in a logical way, starting from substrate preparation (WP 2), to cells with increased complexity (WP 3-5), to the monolithic interconnection issue (WP 6). Then, the complete modules including packaging are tested (WP 7) and finally, detailed cost assessments for multi-megawatt roll-to-roll production lines are given in WP 8. The exploitation panel is formed of representatives of the industries in order to optimise the exploitation strategy of the project. O B J E C T I V E S F L E X C E L L E N C E Roll-to-roll Technology for the Production of High-efficiency, Low-cost, and Flexible Thin Film Silicon Photovoltaic Modules 14 The Flexcellence project aims at developing the equipment and the processes for cost-effective roll-to-roll production of high-efficiency thin film modules, involving microcrystalline (\u00b5c-Si:H) and amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). In particular its objectives are: to achieve a final blueprint planning of a complete production line for thin film silicon photovoltaic modules with production costs lower than \u20ac 0.5/Wp; to design and test the equipment necessary for the realisation of such lines; to demonstrate the high-throughput manufacturing technique for intrinsic \u00b5c-Si:H layer (equivalent to static deposition rate higher than 2nm/s); and finally to show that the technology developed in the project is suitable for the preparation of flexible \u00b5c-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem cells and modules which satisfy the strictest reliability tests and guarantee long-term outdoor stability. Expected results All aspects necessary for a successful implemen- tation of this novel production technology are considered simultaneously. In order to achieve high efficiency \u00b5c-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem devices, effective light-trapping schemes are implemented on flexible substrates and high-efficiency solar cells and modules are developed on these new surfaces. Laboratory- scale solar cells and mini-modules (10*10 cm 2 ) with 11% and 10% efficiency respectively are to be fabricated in order to demonstrate that tandem junction \u00b5c-Si:H/a-Si:H can compete with current technologies for electricity output par square meter. The deposition rates of the intrinsic micro - crystalline silicon (\u00b5c-Si:H) layers need to be increased from typically 0.1nm/s to 2nm/s: three of the most promising techniques for high rate deposition are being investigated: Very High Frequency Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition VHF-PECVD, Hot Wire Chemical Vapour Deposition HWCVD and Microwave Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition MW-PECVD. A benchmarking of the different deposition techniques will take place and will indicate which method emerges as the most cost-effective and could be implemented in the different pilot production lines of the partners. In parallel system aspects, going from the cells to the modules, is being studied. The critical aspect of monolithic cell integration with minimum electrical and optical losses will be solved by using scribing/screen-printing techniques and new concepts for more cost-effective encapsulation materials and processes will be investigated. All the innovative results, hardware develop- ments, concepts and designs developed in the project will lead to new systems (substrate preparation/deposition reactor/laser scriber/ screen-printer) that will be integrated directly into the pilot production lines. They will also be used for the final blueprint of multi-megawatt production lines that can achieve the production of modules with production costs of less than \u20ac 0.5/Wp.

High- quality reflectors have already been obtained on PET and PEN (Fig 1(b)). The first devices deposited on these substrates coated by FEP have reached efficiencies higher than 7% and 8% for a-Si:H and \u00b5c-Si:H cells respectively (laboratory scale). Single junction a-Si:H modules (surface area: 30*60cm 2 ) with stable efficiency higher than 4% have been obtained on flat substrates on the pilot production line at VHF-Technologies. With respect to the high-throughput manufac- turing technique, ECN and R&R are commissioning a roll-to-roll MW-PECVD deposition system and the UBA is designing a new laboratory scale HW-CVD reactor. On its side, UniNE has already demonstrated the possibility of depositing device-quality intrinsic \u00b5c-Si:H layers at 1.7nm/s on 35*45 cm 2 substrate area. For the series connection, two priorities are currently addressed by EXI and VHF: the melting induced by the laser scribing at the edge of the laser line, which must be minimised, and the removal of the ITO layer on top of the silicon that must be further developed. On its side, the UL-FEE succeeded in developing a 2D electrical model which already provides information on suitable designs for the metallic contact on VHF- Technologies\u2019 modules. Finally, VHF-Technologies has conducted a cost simulation for 1 Mio m 2 per year capacity plants for different type of cell technologies on polymer substrates. Preliminary results show that: (cid:129) The standard EVA/ETFE encapsulation materials dominate the bill for single and tandem cells. (cid:129) The production costs could be reduced to less than \u20ac 0.8/Wpeak for 5% efficiency a-Si:H modules. (cid:129) The preliminary estimation for \u00b5c-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem cells (10% efficiency) leads to pro- duction cost lower than \u20ac 0.6/Wpeak. ",
        "Challenges The parallel development objectives of increasing the production yield and efficiencies on large areas and, at the same time, reducing manufacturing costs and material costs are not self-evident. However, these production-relevant criteria are not independent of each other. Some challenges to be overcome in this context are: (cid:129) CIS coevaporation approach on an area of 60 x 120 cm 2 : to reduce absorber thickness (i.e. materials consumption) but also to increase large-area efficiencies above 13% at the same time; to demonstrate high efficiencies on large area by 3-stage in-line CIS coevaporation. (cid:129) CIS electrodeposition approach: to demonstrate homogeneous large-area CIS deposition providing modules with efficiencies > 10% at high production yield; precise know-how about the hydrodynamic flux of the reactant is necessary to obtain high lateral homogeneities on large areas. (cid:129) To implement a Cd-free buffer for large-area application on coevaporated and electro - deposited absorbers, resulting in at least the same module efficiencies, yield and production costs as for those with CdS buffer. (cid:129) To find appropriate in situ and ex situ CIS growth control methods to be implemented in a production line for both electrodeposited and coevaporated modules. O B J E C T I V E S L A R C I S Large-area CIS-based Thin-film Solar Modules for Highly Productive Manufacturing 16 The overall objective of the project is to develop advanced manufacturing technologies for CIS thin film solar modules both for the electrodeposition and coevaporation approach. The project will improve the manufacturing techniques for low-cost, stable and efficient CIS thin film large-area solar modules. This includes work on the molybdenum back contact, the buffer layer, the CIS absorber, and the quality and process control. Special emphasis is placed on the development of cadmium-free large-area modules and of electrodeposition methods for CIS absorbers. The project will provide a framework for the knowledge, know-how and cross- fertilisation between the groups and technologies involved in the project, i.e. between coevaporation and electrodeposition. Project Structure The consortium, 10 partners from five countries, consists of four independent industrial firms, three research institutions and three universities. Three firms are CIS module producers in the starting phase or already in an advanced state. The fourth company is a leading European glass manufacturer equipped to provide back-contact- coated substrates on a production level for the CIS module plants. The research institutes and universities offer expertise in the different and complementary approaches to the development of high-quality and low-cost CIS modules and will enable the industrial companies to reach their ambitious goals. The project work is distributed between seven work packages (WPs) which are generally fur- ther split into sub-WPs (see Figure 1). Two main approaches are investigated, aiming at the cost effective development of: (cid:129) Large-area modules based on coevaporated Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 absorbers (60 x 120 cm 2 ) (cid:129) Large-area modules based on electrodeposited Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) 2 absorbers (30 x 30 cm 2 ). Common targets are high production yields and high efficiencies at reduced costs. The WPs such as contact layers, buffer, quality/process control and technological/economic assessment provide results and tools which support both absorber approaches.

The cooperation and cross-fertilisation of different institutes, firms and approaches are expected to result in: (cid:129) Large-area modules manufactured by coevaporation and applying cost-effective methods with efficiencies > 13.5% on 0.7 m 2 . (cid:129) The development of cadmium-free buffer layers for modules on an area of up to 0.7 m 2 with an efficiency > 12%. (cid:129) The development of electrodeposited low- cost CIS modules with efficiency > 10% on 0.1 m 2 (estimated cost < 0.8 \u20ac /Wp). It is expected that basic investigations at universities and R&D institutes on, for example, stabilisation of the back contact, in situ and ex situ CIS process control, substitution of the CdS buffer by an environmentally harmless and physically superior alternative, will be successfully transferred to production-relevant areas. Thus any result achieved can be directly exploited within the consortium. Progress to Date All activities and work packages are within the time schedule. Very promising results have already been achieved with a novel chemical-bath- deposited Zn(S,O) buffer layer resulting in at least the same efficiencies as achieved by standard CdS buffers. Best cell efficiencies with this novel buffer on inline-deposited CIS exceed 15%. Within the first months of the project, four additional bilateral meetings were held between UB-EME and EDF/CNRS and between ZSW and CNRS/EDF in order to organise the cooperation in detail.

        "Challenges Solar energy is the ultimate future energy source. It is a clean and sustainable source of energy that can provide a significant share of our energy needs and greenhouse gas emission reductions. At present, solar energy is much more expensive than conventional energy. SE-Powerfoil aims at the development of roll-to- roll manufacturing technology for production of high-efficiency flexible photovoltaic (PV) modules. These photovoltaic modules allow for easy integration and installation leading to low-cost PV systems. This is essential to create mature subsidy-independent markets for solar electricity, cost-competitive with conventional electricity sources. The target is to develop 12% efficient PV modules, with more than 20 years\u2019 outdoor lifetime and manufacturing costs below \u20ac 0.5/Wp. Flexible PV laminates will allow versatile use in growth markets with \u20ac billion-size economic potential: (cid:129) Large power markets in which the PV laminates will substantially contribute to European objectives to establish a future dent electricity supply system and to strengthen the European industry and export position. (cid:129) Mass markets where flexible solar cell laminates provide cost-efficient lightweight portable power, including, for example, personal electronics, ICT, security, leisure, medical, military and affordable power for electrifi - cation in rural and remote regions. O B J E C T I V E S S E - P O W E R F O I L Development of Roll-to-roll Manufacturing Technology for Production of High-efficiency Flexible Photovoltaic Modules 18 SE-PowerFoil focuses on high-efficiency flexible thin film silicon PV modules, produced in a roll-to-roll process on metal foil. The scientific and technical objectives are to achieve high efficiency 12% thin film silicon laboratory devices, the development of 10% tandem or triple- junction large-area pilot line modules, and a high rate (1-3 nm/s) industrial plasma deposition technology for high-performance microcrystalline silicon layer deposition. The innovative deposition technology in the pilot line for novel transparent conductive oxide (TCO) in a high-throughput thermal CVD deposition process will be tested, and a prototype flexible module installed in representative outdoor monitoring stations for lifetime monitoring, demonstrating less than 2% performance decrease per year and improved yield compared to existing PV technologies. A full economic assessment of \u20ac /kWh potential of project results will be included. Project Structure At the beginning of the project, a small work package WP 1 is devoted to detailing the specifi cations of the high-performance flexible PV modules and underlying systems. In WP 2 the full efficiency potential of flexible thin film silicon PV modules is explored on a lab scale: the chal- lenge in this WP is to assemble all individually opti- mised building blocks of a micromorph device and drive their cooperative performance in an actual flexible module to a world class level of 12% stable efficiency. The basic approach will be to pursue parallel research on the individual building blocks and systematically measure progress by integration into complete flexible micromorph modules. WP 3 deals with the production cost of flexible thin film PV modules. Focus will be on the crucial production steps of the applied roll-to-roll proces - sing technologies. This includes the develop ment of large-scale, reliable and fast homogeneous deposition technologies for the high-performance transparent conductive oxide (TCO) window layer and for the active silicon layer. In WP 4, pilot line PV flexible thin film Si PV modules will be manufactured, with an efficiency of 10%, based on existing know-how and the (preliminary) results of the WPs 2 and 3. At the start of the project as well as at mid-term, PV modules from the pilot line will be exposed to outdoor climate conditions for true power output monitoring. This work package also deals with an accelerated lifetime assessment in accordance with to IEC standard 61646. THIN FILM TECHNOLOGIES ",

        "Challenges Solar radiation is a diluted energy source: only approximately 1000 Joules of energy per second per square meter are accessible. It is clear to us that strategies to reach the ultimate goal of a module cost of \u20ac 1/Wp will necessarily have to go through the development of concepts capable of extracting the most of every single photon available. In this respect, each of the five activities envisaged in this project to achieve the general goal has to confront its own challenges. The multi-junction activity pursues the develop- ment of solar cells that approach 40% efficiency. To achieve this, it faces the challenge of finding materials with a good compromise between lat- tice matching and band-gap energy. The thermo photovoltaic activity bases part of its success on finding suitable emitters that can operate at high temperatures and/or adapt their emission spectra to the cell\u2019s gap. The other part relies on the successful recycling of photons so that those that cannot be used effectively by the solar cells can return to the emitter to assist in keeping it hot. The intermediate-band solar cell approach addresses the challenge of proving a principle of operation which would see a significant improvement in the performance of the cells. The activity devoted to the search for new molecules engenders the challenge of identifying molecules capable of undergoing two-photon processes: that is molecules that can absorb two low-energy photons to produced a high-energy excited state or, for example, dyes that can absorb one high-energy photon and re-emit its energy in the form of two photons of lower energy. Among all of the above concepts, the multi- junction approach appears to be the most readily available for commercialisation. For that, the activity devoted specifically to speeding up its path to market is the development of trackers, optics and manufacturing techniques that can integrate these cells into commercial concentrator systems. O B J E C T I V E S F U L L S P E C T R U M Towards the Production of Cost-competitive Photovoltaic Solar Energy by Making the Most of the Solar Spectrum 20 FULLSPECTRUM is a project whose primary objective is to make use of the full solar spectrum to produce electricity. The need for this research is easily understood, for example, from the fact that present commercial solar cells used for terrestrial applications are based on single-gap semiconductor solar cells. These cells can by no means make use of the energy of below band-gap energy photons since these simply cannot be absorbed by the material. The achievement of this general objective is pursued through five strategies: the development of high efficiency multi-junction solar cells based on III-V compounds; the development of thermophotovoltaic converters; research into intermediate-band solar cells; the search for molecules and dyes capable of undergoing two photon processes; and the development of manufacturing techniques suitable for industrialising the most promising concepts. Project Structure The Project is coordinated by Prof. Antonio Luque (Instituto de Energ\u00eda Solar) assisted by Projektgesellschaft Solare Energiesysteme GmbH (PSE). The Consortium involves 19 research insti- tutions listed at the end of this text. As mentioned, to make better use of the afore - mentioned solar spectrum, the project is structured along five research development and innovation activities: (cid:129) Multi-junction solar cells. This activity is led by FhG-ISE with the participation of RWE-SSP, IES-UPM, IOFFE, CEA-DTEN and PUM. (cid:129) Thermophotovoltaic converters. Headed by IOFFE and CEA-DTEN. IES-UPM and PSI are also participating in this development. (cid:129) Intermediate-band solar cells. This activity is led by IES-UPM. The other partners directly involved are UG, ICP-CSIC and UCY.

This activity is led by ISOFOTON. IES- UPM, INSPIRA and JRC are also involved. In addition, every two years, the project sponsors a public seminar on its results and provides grants to students worldwide to enable them to attend the seminar as part of dissemination activities. Formal announcements are made on the FULLSPECTRUM webpage. NEW AND EMERGING CONCEPTS ",
        "21 Expected Results The multi-junction solar cell approach pursues the better use of the solar spectrum by using a stack of single-gap solar cells incorporated in a concentrator system, in order to make the approach cost-effective (Fig. 1). The project, at its outset, aimed at cells with an efficiency of 35%. This result has already been achieved by FhG-ISE in the second year of the project and the consortium now aims to achieve efficiencies as close as possible to 40%. In the thermophotovoltaic approach the sun heats up, through a concentrator system, a material called the \u2018emitter\u2019, leading to incandescence (Fig. 2). The radiation from this emitter drives an array of solar cells, thus producing electricity. The advantage of this approach is that, by an appropriate system of filters and back-reflectors, photons with energy above and below the solar cell band-gap can be directed back to the emitter, helping to keep it hot by recycling the energy of these photons that otherwise would not be con- verted optimally by the solar cells. By the conclusion of the project, it is expected that the system, made up basically of the concentrator, emitter and solar cell array can be integrated and evaluated. The \u2018intermediate-band\u2019 approach pursues better exploitation of the solar spectrum by using intermediate-band materials. These materials are characterised by the existence of an electronic energy band within what otherwise would be a conventional semiconductor band-gap. According to the principles of operation of this cell, the inter- mediate band allows the absorption of low band-gap energy photons and the sub sequent production of enhanced photocurrent without voltage degradation. The project also expects to identify as many intermediate-band material candidates as possible, as well as demonstrate experimentally the operating principles of the intermediate-band solar cell by using quantum dot solar cells as workbenches.

        "As mentioned under the \u2018molecular based concepts\u2019 heading, it is expected to find dyes and molecules capable of undergoing two-photon processes. Dyes - or quantum dots - suitable for incorporation into flat concentrators are also being evaluated. Flat concentrators are essentially polymers that, by incorporating these special dyes into their structure, are capable of absorbing high-energy photons and re-emitting them as low-energy photons that match the gap of the solar cells ideally. This emitted light is trapped within the concentrator usually by internal reflection and, if the losses within the concentrator are small, can only escape by being absorbed by the cells. Within the manufacturing activity, it is expected to clear the way towards commercialisation for the most promising concepts. This is the case for multi-junction solar cells and, within this activity, it is expected to develop for example trackers with the necessary accuracy to follow the sun at 1000 suns, and \u2018pick and place\u2019 assembly techniques to produce concentrator modules at competitive prices, as well as draft the regulation that has to serve as the framework for the implementation of these systems. F U L L S P E C T R U M Towards the Production of Cost-Competitive Photovoltaic Solar Energy by Making the Most of the Solar Spectrum 22 Progress to date As far as multi-junction activity is concerned, monolithically stacked triple-junction solar cells (GaInP/GaInAs/Ge), with an efficiency exceeding 35% at a concentration of 600 suns, have been obtained. Because of their band-gap (1 eV), (GaIn)(NAs) solar cells are being researched for their possible implementation as the fourth cell in a four-junction monolithic stack, in order to approach the goal of 40% efficiency. In this regard, efficiencies of 6% have been measured for this cell. The technological processes related to the mechanical stacking of thin film GaAs solar cells onto silicon as well as the mechanical stacking of a dual-junction GaInP/GaAs cell onto a GaSb cell have also been experimentally studied. In this respect, it has been necessary to research the crystal growth of GaSb using the Czochralski method of sufficient quality. As a result, a 6%-efficient GaSb solar cell has been obtained when operated below a GaInP/GaAs solar cell at 300 suns. In the thermophotovoltaic activity, GaSb solar cells with 19% efficiency, for integration in a thermophotovoltaic system with a tungsten emitter, have been measured. Moreover, in con- nection with the multijunction activity, these cells show 6% efficiency when used at the back of a GaInP/GaAs dual-junction cell in a mechanical stacked multi-junction approach operated at 300 suns. Two geometries (cylindrical and conical) have been analysed for the chamber that has to contain the cells. The cylindrical configuration has been found to be more suitable for final system production. Within the framework of research into the inter- mediate-band solar cell, test devices have been manufactured using quantum dots (Fig. 4). These devices have demonstrated the production of photocurrent for sub-band-gap energy photos, and experiments have been best interpreted when a quasi-Fermi level has been associated with each band, just as the related theory has proposed. Chalcopyrite semiconductors substituted by several transition metals have been identified recently as plausible intermediate-band materi- al candidates. These add up to the TiGa3As4 and TiGa3P4 systems previously identified and whose energetics as intermediate-band materials has been studied. The analysis has revealed that NEW AND EMERGING CONCEPTS Figure 4: Atomic force microscope image of a layer of quantum dots. ",

As regards research into new molecules and dyes for a better use of the solar spectrum, the efficiency of some solar cells has been improved by the application of a polymer coating containing a luminescent dye that shifts the spectrum towards wavelengths that are better converted into electricity by the cells. The research on a dye-doped flat concentrator has increased its efficiency from below 1% to over 1.7% through the application of better mirrors and dyes. Moreover, the use of quantum dots has also been anticipated in order to increase the photo- generated current of a solar cell by spectrum shifting. Optical modelling has been developed and has become a valuable tool in the optimisation of the flat concentrator. Among the concepts above, multi-junction solar cells are closest to commercialisation. In this regard, significant progress has been made, for example, in aspects related to the manufacture of the optics, and the development of encapsulation and trackers with high pointing accuracy to operate these cells in high-concentration systems. Up to five new releases of advanced concentrators (primary) have been moulded (Fig. 6), improving moulding conditions in order to achieve the highest possible optical efficiency. More than 100 optical assemblies with these new releases have been encapsulated on 1mm-2--single junction III-V-cells Off-track angle under 0.1\u00ba with 95% probability for several complete days has been proven in first trials.

        "Challenges Existing and innovative solar concentrators were evaluated for their properties in high-concen- tration photovoltaics. Plant types were identified that fulfil the technical requirements of homogenous irradiation distribution with solar concentration factors of 500 to 2000 suns and cost-effective implementation perspectives. The conclusions were that Modified Spherical Dish (Tailored Concentrator) configurations look more suitable for meeting current technology requirements than classical Parabolic Dish solu- tions. The results shown with this design are promising. It has been proposed to build and test a tailored concentrator for HICONPV technology with this design. An innovative heliostat variant was evaluated for its properties in high-concentration photo- voltaics, demonstrating that the proposed Torque Tube Heliostat design concept promises significant cost advantages over existing heliostat designs. This can be achieved with a much lower construction height of the TTH, which reduces drastically the wind loads on the structure and the required specific drive power. The aim of this tailor concentrator is to prove the real possibilities of this innovative conceptual design, and to see the performance of the concept O B J E C T I V E S H I C O N - P V High Concentration PV Power System 24 The aim of this project is to develop, set up and test a new high-concentration \u2013 1000x or more \u2013 PV system with a large-area III-V-receiver. This will be achieved by integrating two technology fields: the high concentration of the sunlight will be obtained using technologies experienced in solar thermal systems like parabolic dishes or tower systems. The high-concentration photovoltaic receiver is based on the III-V solar cell technology. To deal with the high concentration, Monolithic Integrated Modules (MIM) will be developed and will be assembled as Compact Concentrator Modules (CCM). The CCM prototypes will be implemented at three solar test installations in Cologne, Almer\u00eda and Israel. The tests will be evaluated and compared with other types of systems. The objectives of the project are directed towards high-efficiency concentrating photovoltaics to reach the system cost goal of \u20ac 1/Wp by 2015. under real manufacturing constraints. The proposed final configuration was not optimised for 1000x but rather close, so it is necessary to take into account the optimised structural heliostat concept, where the shape of the concentrator is no longer round but rectangular. Rectangular con- centrators allow us to keep the gravity centre lower for the same aperture area. This has a strong influence on the structural design and the final cost. Project Structure In this project, two ways will be explored in order to reach a cost-effective solution: the use of existing mature concentrators and the use of a new tailored concentrator. During development, the focus will be on significant cost reduction. Therefore, current cost-efficient concentrators developed in the area of concentrating solar thermal power plants will be used in combination with high-concentration PV. The concentrator system has to meet specifications on flux distri- bution and accuracy, safe operation and reliability. Taking advantage of the achievements in concentrating solar thermal systems, this will reduce system costs significantly due to mass production. Further cost reduction aspects of the selected concentrator system will be addressed.

        "Challenges To reach MOLYCELL goals, the following points are addressed in parallel: (cid:129) Design and synthesis of new materials to overcome the large mismatch between the absorption characteristics of currently available polymer materials and the solar spectrum, and also to improve the relatively slow charge transport properties of organic materials. (cid:129) Development of two device concepts to improve efficiencies: the \u2018all-organic\u2019 solar cells concept and the nanocrystalline metal oxides/organic hybrid solar cells concept. All-organic solar cells Devices are based on donor-acceptor bulk hetero- junction built by blending two organic materials serving as electron donor (hole semiconductor, low band-gap polymers) and electron acceptor ( n -type conductor, here soluble C 60 derivative) in the form of a homogeneous blend and sandwiching the organic matrix between two electrodes.

In addition to the incorporation of polymers with improved light harvesting and charge transport properties, two concepts are developed to improve efficiencies: (cid:129) An innovative junction concept based on the orientation of polar molecules (cid:129) A multi-junction bulk donor-acceptor hetero- junction concept. Nanocrystalline metal oxides/organic hybrid solar cells Devices are based upon solid-state hetero-junctions between nanocrystalline metal oxides and molecular/polymeric hole conductors. Two strategies are addressed for light absorption: the sensitisation of the hetero-junction with molecular dyes, employing transparent organic hole transport materials and the use of polymeric hole conductors having the additional functionality of visible light absorption. O B J E C T I V E S M O L Y C E L L Molecular Orientation, Low Band-gap and New Hybrid Device Concepts for the Improvement of Flexible Organic Solar Cells 26 Molycell aims at demonstrating the technical feasibility of organic solar cells. The project has targeted two different technologies: hybrid organic/inorganic solar cells and bulk hetero-junction organic solar cells. Project Structure The project is managed as a series of six linked work packages, covering a large field of research from the development of new materials to their characterisation, the elaboration of solar cells and their evaluation. WP 1: Design, Synthesis and Basic Chemical Analysis of Novel Organic Hole Conductors: the objective of reducing the band-gap of conjugated polymers to 1.8 eV in a first stage and then to 1.6 eV have been achieved through the development of efficient synthetic strategies. The charge carrier mobilities of these polymers are in line with expectations, and hole mobilities above 10-4 cm 2 /V.S have been demonstrated. WP 2: Metal Oxide Development: new low- temperature processes for the deposition of mesoporous nanocrystalline metal oxide films on flexible substrates have been developed for the elaboration of solid-state nanocrystalline metal oxide/organic hybrid solar cells. Due to accelerated recombination of injected electrons, the efficiencies of cells built on these films remain low compared to benchmark devices, and further studies should reveal the exact origin of this behaviour. To overcome this difficulty, an alternative strategy based on the elaboration of cells on flexible Ti foils has been developed, leading to an inverted structure which shows highly promising initial results. Alternative methodologies for the fabri- cation of mesoporous nanocrystalline metal oxide films have also been studied. Among these, evaluation of mesoporous films made by supramolecular templating has led to promising results and a novel approach has been developed in which the porous metal oxide layer is replaced by a blend of TiO 2 nanorods with a conjugated polymer. WP 3: Advanced Characterization and Modelling: a detailed understanding of the fundamental properties and behaviour of the novel materials developed in WP 1 and WP 2 is necessary to check their mutual compatibility and suitability for improved solar cell energy conversion efficiency.

(cid:129) Identification of specific design improvements. (cid:129) Prediction of optimum device efficiencies achievable with each device concept. WP 4: All-Organic Device Development: based on the donor-acceptor bulk hetero-junction concept, two innovative principles are explored in parallel and low band-gap polymers issued from WP 1 are tested. The two innovative principles explored are one based on a junction induced by the orientation of polar molecules, and one based on a multi-junction bulk donor-acceptor hetero-junction concept. Proofs of concept studies for the innovative devices are now in progress. First two-terminal multi-junction solar cells, in particular, were shown with near doubling of the open-circuit voltage as compared to the single-junction device. A prototype device with a certified efficiency of 4% on 1 cm2 glass substrate has been realised, and an efficiency of 3% on 10 cm 2 flexible substrate has also been demonstrated. WP 5: Metal Oxide/Organic Hybrid Device Development: solid-state metal oxide/organic solar cells on glass and flexible substrates have been developed following two distinct routes and employing an optically transparent organic hole conductor or an organic material that serves the functions of both hole transport and light absorption. Using different organic or inorganic dyes, in combination with a transparent molecular hole conductor, efficiencies of over 4% have been reached. WP 6: Device Evaluation/Cost Assessment: an initial evaluation of device processing and stability for metal oxide/organic and all organic devices has been carried out, leading to the identification of critical stress factors. A definition of the speci- fications requested for a 4% flexible solar cell (5% on glass substrate) has also been established. Expected Results The results expected at the end of the project with one or both devices concepts are: (cid:129) Certified 5% solar to electric energy conversion efficiency under Standard Test Conditions (AM1.5 simulated sunlight, 100 mW/cm 2 , 25\u00b0C) for a 1 cm 2 cell on glass substrate.

        "Challenges One can observe a strongly growing R&D effort in the domain of solar cells based on organic layers. This progress is essentially based on the introduction of nano-structured material systems to enhance the photovoltaic performance of these devices. The growing interest is fuelled by the potentially very low cost of organic solar cells, thanks to the low cost of the involved substrates, the low cost of the active materials of the solar cell, the low energy input for the actual solar cell/module process and, last but not least, the asset of flexibility. In addition, the ease of up-scalability of the required application technologies lowers the threshold for new players to enter this field. These efforts have resulted in the creation of technologies which are approaching the stage of first industrialisation initiatives. These industrial activities target in the first instance the market of consumer applications where energy autonomy can be ensured by integrating these flexible solar cells with a large variety of surfaces. O B J E C T I V E S O R G A P V N E T Coordination Action Towards Stable and Low-cost Organic Solar Cell Technologies and their Application 28 The goal is the establishment of a common understanding for future investments and strategies concerning organic photovoltaics by allowing closer relations between the various organisations of scientific and technological cooperation in the two largest organic solar cell communities in Europe; by facilitating the transfer of results from European research to the European PV industry, and by fostering measurement standards and prediction of the performance of organic PV cells and modules. Other objectives are to disseminate results to the whole sector by means of various tools such as an OrgaPvNet website and identification of technology gaps and determination of requirements for sustainable future growth. The result will be an integrated vision in the form of a European Organic Photovoltaics Technology Roadmap. In order to have a real impact on the PV market, additional progress is needed at the level of efficiency, stability and application technologies to allow the exploitation of these solar cell techno logies for power generation on a larger scale. The OrgaPvNet coordination action consortium aims to foster the progress needed on these issues by integrating a number of leading insti- tutions in association with the main industrial players in this field.

In this way a powerful Organic Photovoltaic Platform will be created that can sustain the leading R&D position of Europe within this domain and, in the end, strengthen European competitiveness in a sector which is of high strategic relevance in ensuring a sustainable energy supply.

        "Challenges There is a rapidly increasing awareness and urgency concerning the transition to a sustainable energy supply. The greenhouse effect and also dependence on energy imports, local air pollution and unavailability of energy for poor people are seen as major problems to be addressed ambi- tiously and immediately. For the longer term, the depletion of fossil fuel reserves needs to be faced. Solar energy can play a key role in solving all these problems, but still has a very small impact today. By far the most important barrier to large-scale use of solar energy is the current price of systems. Therefore CrystalClear tries to lower the direct fabrication costs of PV modules, while at the same time improving the environmental profile. Key activities for achieving this are: (cid:129) Strongly reducing the consumption of expensive materials (especially silicon, but also others), as well as introducing the use of cheaper materials. (cid:129) Increasing the electricity output of solar modules. (cid:129) Developing highly automated, high-throughput, low-cost manufacturing processes. (cid:129) Screening materials, processes and products in relation to sustainability and suitability for large-scale use. Project Structure To reach these goals, CrystalClear is organised in eight sub-projects (SPs), five of which deal with a specific part of the production chain. In addition, one sub-project (SP 6) covers all sustainability aspects, while SP 7 focuses on integration. Finally, SP 0 is devoted to management of this large consortium and to communication with the EC project officers and contracting departments. The sub-projects are divided in different work packages, in which the actual research is being carried out. O B J E C T I V E S C R Y S T A L C L E A R Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaics: Low-cost, Highly Efficient and Reliable Modules 30 The integrated CrystalClear project is a research and development project dedicated primarily to cost reduction of solar (photovoltaic, PV) modules, which form the heart of any solar energy system and which account for some 60% of the turnkey price of roof-top installations. The objective of the CrystalClear project is to enable a price reduction to a level of \u20ac 3.0-3.5/Wp, which roughly corresponds to electricity generation costs of 15-40 eurocents per kWh, depending on location in the EU. At the same time, CrystalClear aims to improve the environmental quality of solar modules by the reduction of material consumption, replacement of materials, and design for recycling. Last but not least CrystalClear wants to enhance the applicability of solar modules by tailoring to customer needs and improving product lifetime and reliability. Sub-project 1: Feedstock Of the five sub-projects dealing with the different steps of the value chain, SP 1 is dedicated to the subject of the so-called feedstock, the high-purity silicon from which solar cells are made. For solar cells (as well as for microelectronic chips) a high grade of silicon is required. It is customary to speak of solar-grade silicon. The production of this high-purity silicon requires advanced equipment, is expensive and energy-intensive. SP 1 aims at testing alternative manufacturing methods for high-purity silicon that are under development. In addition to this, SP 1 aims at gaining better scientific understanding and practical know-how on solar-grade silicon. Sub-project 2: Wafers Once high-purity (solar-grade) silicon has been obtained, it has to be brought into a form suitable for solar cells. CrystalClear is about crystalline silicon in the form of wafers. SP 2 focuses on the two crucial steps required to turn feedstock into wafers: ingot crystallisation and wafer sawing. First, emphasis will be on achieving a higher productivity of the crystallisation equipment (the furnaces), by applying larger crucibles and better use of the capacity, which will lead to an increase of ingot weight by about 80%. Second, the utilisation of ingot material will be increased dramatically by different improvements of the sawing process. Next to an increase in wafer size (from standard size of 125 x 125 mm 2 to 200 x 200 mm 2 ), the wafer thickness will be decreased from about 300 \u00b5m to 150 \u00b5m or even less. In addition to the work on ingots and sawing or cutting, research will be done on an alternative method of wafer formation, namely ribbon growth (EFG, Edge-defined Film-fed Growth, and RGS, Ribbon Growth on Substrate). WAFER-BASED SILICON Multicrystalline silicon blocks. \u00a9 R E C ",
        "31 Sub-project 3: Thin film Another research line pursued in the project is the use of so-called thin-film \u2018wafer-equivalents\u2019 (SP 3). In this case, a thin (typically 10-20 m) high-quality silicon layer is deposited onto a cheap substrate such as low-grade silicon or ceramic material. If well designed, the cell pro - perties determined by the thin active layer can be very good, while the costs may be reduced, both because of the small amount of high-grade silicon used and because no sawing is needed. The work in this sub-project is aimed at achieving efficiencies comparable to those of solar cells based on cut wafers or ribbons, but at lower manufacturing costs. Sub-project 4: Cells Solar cell manufacturing is a key issue in cost reduction strategies for PV. By enhancing cell efficiency, using thin (< 200 \u00b5m) and large (> 150 x 150 mm 2 ) silicon wafers, processing low-cost material, increasing process quality, yield and throughput, and implementing cell designs to allow for low-cost module assembly (such as back-contact schemes), a substantial decrease of production costs per watt peak can be achieved. The different work packages in SP 4 deal with each of these topics. Sub-project 5: Modules The research and development efforts of sub- projects 1 to 4, from silicon feedstock to finished cells, come together in SP5 which deals with the final \u2018product\u2019 of CrystalClear: the solar module. This sub-project aims at developing advanced module concepts and corresponding highly auto- mated and fast module assembly technologies, which should of course be fully matched with the cells developed in SP 4. The research is specifically targeted at advanced cell intercon- nection schemes for large and thin wafers and for back-contact cells, at new module materials, and at \u2018single shot\u2019 encapsulation as well as one- material concepts. Sub-project 6: Sustainability Although PV is based on the use of sunlight and therefore a fully renewable energy technology, its environmental quality (sustainability) is partly dependent on energy consumption during manu- facturing and on the materials used. SP 6 covers two main aspects: (cid:129) Further development of module recycling technology (cid:129) Analysis of the environmental impacts of module manufacturing by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. Sub-project 7: Integration The CrystalClear project tackles all aspects from the starting materials up to the completed solar module. However, it is important that no one aspect of this value chain is optimised without due regard to the others or to the sustainability of the overall technology. SP 7 will be the focus for this integration. Key activities concern cost calculations, internal roadmapping, com munication and a socio-economic impact study of the factors that will influence the exploitation of the technology. Expected results CrystalClear is targeted to attain a price reduction for grid-connected systems to a level of roughly \u20ac 3/Wp or less, which roughly corresponds to electricity generation costs of \u20ac 0.15-0.35/kWh, depending on location. This is within the range of consumer electricity prices in parts of Europe, which will greatly encourage the use of solar energy on a large scale. To assure its sustainability, CrystalClear aims to decrease the energy pay-back time of PV systems from 3-5 years to roughly 1-2 years, depending on different locations corresponding to different levels of insolation (NW and Central Europe versus Southern Europe). ",
        "Progress to date In SP 1 the first tests of new silicon material (Wacker solar-grade silicon produced in a fluidised bed reactor) have been carried out. For such evaluation of new solar-grade silicon feedstock materials developed outside the CrystalClear consortium, well-defined baseline cell manufac- turing processes have been established. Three baselines at different partners have been used to process wafers from two different directionally solidified reference ingots. These baseline solar cell results are used for comparison of the Si material quality of new feedstock materials. The impurities present in normal multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers were determined by a lite - rature study as well as by chemical analysis of wafers and ingot samples. The effect of relevant impurities on solar cell performance has been investigated, to work towards a practical speci- fication of the so far rather vaguely defined term, \u2018solar-grade\u2019 silicon. The experimental approach for this investigation was established. In SP 2 the first super-size ingots of 80% increased weight (400-450 kg) were analysed and their electrical and mechanical quality was found to be very similar to the standard ingots of today\u2019s production. In silicon ribbon growth by the EFG (Edge-defined Film-fed Growth) technique, two new feedstock materials have been tested and compared to reference material. No differences with respect to feeding, ribbon growth and mechanical and electrical quality of the wafers were found. The use of new materials gives more flexibility in the selection of starting silicon and less dependency on few suppliers. The first new Ribbon-Growth-on-Substrate (RGS) wafers of regular and small thickness (down to 110 \u00b5m) were produced and processed to cells. Efficiencies obtained were 13% for regular thickness and 11% for thin wafers. The latter corresponds to a record low silicon consumption of 3.3 grams per watt-peak. In SP 3 of CrystalClear, three approaches to wafer-equivalents are being pursued: (cid:129) free-standing thin films produced by lift-off of thin silicon films from a wafer (cid:129) epitaxial wafer equivalents, a sole silicon epitaxy on low-cost silicon substrates C R Y S T A L C L E A R Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaics: Low-cost, Highly Efficient and Reliable Modules 32 (cid:129) recrystallised silicon layers on mechanically supporting substrates. Significant progress was achieved with the SiC intermediate layers that are needed to allow recrystallisation of high-quality layers on a low- quality substrate: they are now conductive and mechanically stable. High-speed Zone Melting Recrystallisation (ZMR) to recrystallise silicon layers was done up to 400 mm/min. Cells of high-speed layers showed a comparatively large detrimental effect of the high scanning speed on layers which were epitaxially thickened after ZMR. Cells directly made from ZMR layers (no epitaxy) show nearly no decrease in voltage. A large-area ZMR cell (86 cm 2 ) achieved 8.4% efficiency in a 20\u00b5m ZMR + epitaxy layer. SP 4 aims for low-cost cell processes for thin and large solar cells resulting in high efficiency. Key research issues are new passivation process schemes for the rear side, such as dielectric layers combined with local back-surface fields (BSFs), new cell designs and novel processes for high efficiencies. Furthermore, new BSF processes are under development for the standard cell concept to reduce wafer bowing. Fundamental studies on SiN x :H passivation are performed in CrystalClear. It has been found that the SiN bond density in the layer is the parameter that determines the surface and bulk passivating quality for layers deposited with very different methods. Using laser-fired contacts with low-temperature PECVD a-Si/SiO 2 stack, an efficiency of 21.3% was reached. This is the highest efficiency reported for non-thermal oxide rear-side passi- vation. Using a process based on screen-printed and SiN x :H as passivating layer at the rear, effi- ciencies up to 16.0% were obtained on 180 \u00b5m thin mc-Si wafers. Solar cells on ultra-thin wafers have been prepared and reached >15% efficiency on mechanically thinned 80-90 \u00b5m mono-crystalline silicon. Spraying has been used as diffusion source to fabricate solar cells. This process is very well suited for thin wafers. On standard thicknesses of about 270 \u00b5m, 17.5% efficiency has been reached on mono-crystalline silicon. The process is now transferred to wafers of reduced thickness.

Therefore, in sub-project 5, alternative interconnection technologies are being explored which can relieve the stress experienced by the cell. After an evaluation, the developments have focused on replacing the conventional soldering technology by the use of fast- curing conductive adhesives. Modules have been manufactured and have entered a test phase. The industrial introduction of back-contacted solar cells is supported by the development of advanced module manufacturing concepts. Of the suggested novel manufacturing technologies and concepts, module casting and roll lamination were selected for further exploration. For roll lamination the first conceptual tests using exist- ing equipment from other fields are promising and dedicated equipment has been installed. In SP 6 the environmental analysis activities were focused mainly on current silicon, cell and module production technology. Together with 11 European and US photovoltaic companies, most of them partners in the CrystalClear project, an extensive effort has been made to collect Life Cycle Inventory data for production of crystal - line silicon modules. On the basis of such LCI data the environmental impacts of PV systems can be evaluated using a Life Cycle Assessment approach. The new set of LCI data covers all processes from silicon feedstock production to cell and module manufacturing. All commercial wafer technologies are covered, that is multi- and mono-crystalline wafers as well as ribbon technology. The collected data can be considered representative for the technology status in 2004. The data have also been made available to the public domain (www.ecn.nl/solar). The energy pay-back times of PV systems were calculated to be respectively 1.6, 2.1 and 2.5 years for ribbon, multi and mono-Si technology (Southern Europe). These results are considerably lower than previously published estimates, and they have the great advantage that they are now based on real pro- duction data. In the outlook for near-future silicon technology, it was estimated that an energy pay-back time of around one year can be achieved for multi- and ribbon silicon technology. If fluidised bed reactor technology can be applied successfully to deposit solar-grade silicon feedstock material, wafer thickness can be halved and module efficiency can be increased to 15-16%. Modules from different project partners have been recycled at the pilot recycling installation. Reclaimed wafers have been successfully reprocessed and used in a new module. SP 7 has the role in CrystalClear of bringing together the activities of the other sub-projects (that have specific roles in the PV module value chain) and of ensuring consistent focus in order to achieve the overall project objective of delivering solutions offering a \u20ac 1/Wp module cost. A cost model has been developed as a project tool to evaluate the prospective technology innovations and to analyse benchmark cost data collected from the industrial partners. The analysis has detailed the average module cost of the industrial partners on the project in 2003, just prior to the start of the CrystalClear project. Looking to future cost reductions by stretching the existing technology to limits not yet contemplated (as defined in the roadmapping activity) could reduce the module cost close to the project goal of \u20ac 1/Wp.

        "Challenges The FoXy partnership will answer the need of the PV market for low-price and high-quality solar grade (SoG) Si feedstock by: (cid:129) Further developing and optimising refining, purification and crystallisation processes for metallurgical SoG-Si feedstock, as well as for recycled n-type electronic grade Si. (cid:129) Optimising associated cell and module processes. (cid:129) Setting input criteria for metallurgical and electronic n-type silicon to be used as raw materials for SoG-Si feedstock.

By developing a close partnership along the whole value chain from feedstock to module production, a foundation is created for new investments in SoG-Si feedstock production and subsequent commercial use of the material produced. The FoXy consortium aims at achieving a significant cost reduction (down to \u20ac 15 per kg) through more efficient cleaning processes for raw materials, and.securing high-volume production of SoG-Silicon by developing recycling techniques for end-of-life products. Expected results (cid:129) Remove inclusions above 20 \u00b5m and reduce the level of inclusions down to 5 \u00b5m by 80% of initial levels. The particles to be removed include SiC from primary silicon and recycled silicon, Si 3 N 4 from recycled silicon, and oxides from slag treatment processes and remelting of silicon. (cid:129) Estimates based on similar figures for refining of aluminium show that the total cost of electrochemically refined SoG-Si would be less than \u20ac 10 per kg. The raw silicon will be purified with new techniques, such as fast- casting and electrochemical treatment, reducing the cost of the final feedstock considerably from the present situation.

        "Challenges The main objective of PERFORMANCE is to conduct pre-normative research, to develop more reliable test procedures and measurement methods for standard and innovative types of PV modules, and to harmonise system performance measurement and evaluation techniques. The project covers all relevant aspects from cell to system level and from instantaneous device characterisation and system measurement to life-time performance prediction and assessment. The limitations of current indoor and outdoor calibration measurement technology will be investigated and precision will be improved, covering current technologies as well as new and advanced cell and module concepts. Methods will be developed to link measurements of module power to module energy production. In addition, PERFORMANCE covers the development and validation of PV module life-time assessment procedures for several PV technologies, including crystalline silicon and thin film PV, and also building industry-integrated PV codes and standards. All activities aim at improving the competitiveness of the European PV industry for both the European and the world markets. Project Structure From the demands of market players, eight topics have been identified and transformed into a consistent set of sub-projects. Following this work programme, PERFORMANCE will produce a coherent framework of measurement and modelling methodologies to create the transparency needed for the European market and industry. Intense involvement of all European companies along the value chain will be organised systematically through feedback loops. These include project workshops, seminars and the involvement of an Industry Advisory Board. Project results will be fed directly into standardisation processes on CENELEC and IEC level. O B J E C T I V E S P E R F O R M A N C E A Science Base on PV Performance for Increased Market Transparency and Customer Confidence 36 The general idea behind the PERFORMANCE project is to provide the photovoltaics (PV) community with tools to measure the quality of products \u2013 devices, systems and services \u2013, to ensure their usefulness and reliability, and to deliver data to predict the useful lifetime of these products. The project will develop reliable test and calibration procedures for both standard and innovative types of PV modules, and will harmonise measurement and evaluation techniques for PV systems. PERFORMANCE will cover all relevant aspects from cell to system level and from instantaneous device characterisation and system measurements to life-time performance prediction and assessment. Expected Results The general idea behind the project is to provide the PV community with tools to measure the quality of products \u2013 devices, systems and services \u2013, to ensure their usefulness and reliability, and to deliver data to predict the useful lifetime of the products. It is safe to say that the results of the effort in this project will meet with strong interest from the whole PV community. Thus, PERFORMANCE creates the platform to transfer and liaise between the scientific community (the creator of the necessary know - ledge), the industry, the end-user and the implementing bodies (the standardisation bodies) in order to meet the goals of European decision- makers (represented by the Member States and the European Commission). The PERFORMANCE Sub-Projects 1. Traceable performance measurement of PV devices Set up of traceability chains of indoor module measurements in test labs and in industry, adap- tation of measurement procedures for new and emerging technologies (thin film cells, multi- junction cells, back-contact silicon cells, etc.). 2. Energy delivery of photovoltaic devices Bridge the gap between indoor STC measurements and outdoor \u2018real world\u2019 measurements for any place in Europe.

        "Challenges The costs of PV have come down considerably over the last decade, but must decrease further (perhaps by a factor of five to ten), by the middle of the century, in order to fulfil the promise of solar energy becoming a significant factor in the future energy supply. Fortunately, there is great potential for cost reduction. However, this requires a long-term coordinated technology and market development. The present learning rate of around 20% must be maintained alongside a long- term average growth rate of at least 20-30%. The present market in the EU is heavily dependent on a very effective feed-in tariff system in Germany, accompanied by easy allowance for access to the grid. It is important to develop new markets for sustainable growth, both in new countries and in market sectors where the value of PV is highest. Europe has a very strong research community but time-to-market needs to be improved. Central to market development is the need for products that have a high conversion efficiency and deliver the amount of energy expected by the system purchasers. If there is a need for both electricity and hot water, a PV thermal system is a high-efficiency solar system with commercial potential. Professional investors need accurate information on the amount of electricity that a proposed PV system will produce. The relation between the power rating determined indoors with a flash tester by a manufacturer, and the energy yield under real operating conditions, is not unam- biguous if different technologies are compared or if thin film modules are applied. Project Structure The PV CAtapult consortium comprises 19 con- tractors: representatives of research institutes, universities and the PV industry. The project, coordinated by ECN, was divided into eleven work packages that combine to give three sub-projects: (cid:129) EPIA addressed technological, marketing, socio-economic and financial issues, based on a general SWOT analysis for the European PV industry. (cid:129) ECN brought together all the key players in R&D and the industrial PV thermal energy (PVT) field to build up a strong network. O B J E C T I V E S P V C A T A P U L T Accelerating the European PV Industry 38 The overall aim is to strengthen the position of the European PV sector. New routes will be identified to decrease costs of PV electricity, to improve the quality of PV and PV thermal systems and to open new markets. A SWOT analysis will be made for the whole PV sector covering the complete value chain. Innovative finance schemes are discussed and new market approaches are developed for PV implementation in developing countries, as well as in the new EU Member States and for building- related PV. The technology transfer from research laboratories to industry will be improved by setting up a strategic research agenda by industry and the research community. Roadmaps will be developed for building-related PV and for PV thermal systems in order to define the path for future R&D and market introduction. The uncertainty in power and energy rating will be assessed, enabling the consumer to get a better insight into PV systems performance. (cid:129) CREST improved module performance meas- urements and modelling, setting a basis for standardisation. Cross-fertilisation was used to identify links between the different activities, maximising the synergy effects and bringing together the different stakeholders. Results It was the first time a SWOT analysis was performed for the whole PV Sector covering the complete pro- duction chain. An in-depth analysis was performed on three main issues: (cid:129) Solar grade silicon is not available at a reasonable price for the quantities needed. (cid:129) Thin film technologies are not taken off as expected. (cid:129) Feed-in tariffs are a very effective support instrument, worthwhile to apply more. The analysis led to valuable recommendations for action. Many of them can be taken by the PV sector itself, with a coordinating and initiating role for EPIA, but in some cases a closer collaboration with other industrial sectors, such as the building and glass trades, is needed. A common European industry-research vision on future R&D needs was achieved. Based on the Vision Report of PV-TRAC, priorities for future technology development were set, encompassing the whole chain from materials to systems. To permit the cost reductions required for PV, a significantly higher R&D budget is needed from public as well as private sources, in particular for technology transfer to industry, systems development and non-technical issues such as monitoring, training and standardi - sation.

More interaction between short-term technology transfer and long-term material science is recom - mended. Of the total budget, 40% is allocated for crystalline silicon technology and 25% for thin film technology; the remainder (35%) is for systems technology. To effectively and efficiently support the technology development of PV over the necessary extended period, an R&D strategy must be formulated not only in a European PV programme, but also implemented in the national PV programmes of the Member States. Three markets segments were explored in more detail: (cid:129) Building related (integrated) PV (cid:129) The new EU Member States (cid:129) Rural electrification. A roadmap has been prepared indicating possible routes to creating a mature European market for BIPV (Building-integrated or -related PV). As PV has to compete with the relatively high end-user electricity prices, it will be the first large market segment where PV will be competitive, given BoS (system) costs comparable with the BoS costs of large PV installations. It is essential that BIPV become a regular building product, integrating with the building process and attractive for all actors in the value chain. The status of the PV sector in the new Member States was analysed and recommendations given for strengthening its presence. A position paper for an EU-wide feed-in tariff for PV was published, as an analysis has shown this to be the most effective measure for developing a sustainable market for PV. An initiative based on a position paper on rural electrification and the UN Millennium Development Goals was established: this is the ARE (Alliance for Rural Electrification). It will provide a platform for all stakeholders. The aim is to create synergies of all the initiatives taken at the global level and to contribute to the poverty eradication process. A new financial model was presented based on the creation of ESCOs (Energy Service Companies). A fund of around ? 150 million is required to meet the needs of extending production capacities and financing ground-based PV power plants. A \u2018round robin\u2019 was organised for indoor calibrations and for outdoor power and energy ratings. The results show that for crystalline and poly - crystalline devices, substantial agreement has been achieved between laboratories. Less agre - ement between laboratories has been achieved regarding thin film devices, in particular for indoor measurements, and further research is needed. A rather surprising level of agreement has been reached between the different outdoor test facilities, with much reduced PV technology- related problems despite their one-of-a kind designs. The accuracy of several modelling methodologies of the energy yield of photovoltaic devices has been investigated by means of a questionnaire to evaluate the state-of-the-art, leading to a series of modelling \u2018round robins\u2019 to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches. The best case of the models, i.e. only statistical variations, is in the order of 2-3% deviation of the predicted energy yield with respect to measured values. Once translations from one site to another are considered, this inaccuracy goes up to 4-6% if the precise efficiency of the module is known. If the modules have changed significantly or the name-plate efficiency of the module to be modelled deviates significantly from the input, errors in the 15% range have been observed. PV thermal is a relatively new technology that converts the power of the sun not only into electrical but also thermal energy. A technology and marketing roadmap has been made, based on discussions in workshops and with relevant stakeholders. The most promising market segments identified are multi-family buildings as early- market potential, domestic water and space heating for the medium term and, for the long term, solar cooling or industrial high-temperature applica- tions. The systems can use liquid or air to transport the heat collected. Barriers, such as unknown legal status, lack of financial support, product certification and track record are identified and an action plan has been established for all stakeholders. ",

        "Challenges At this moment, there is no commercial production of ethanol from ligno-cellulose because of eco- nomic and technical barriers. The main questions that remain to be solved for a successful imple- mentation of such a process are: (cid:129) How to decrease the cost of enzymatic hydrolysis which may represent 30-40% of the production cost of ligno-cellulosic ethanol? (cid:129) Can the pentose-rich hemicelluloses be effi- ciently converted to ethanol? (cid:129) How should the process be scaled up and integrated to minimise the energy and water demand? (cid:129) What quality of lignin can be obtained and how to optimise the value of this product? (cid:129) How to obtain representative and reliable data for cost estimation and evaluation of environmental and socio-economic impacts? (cid:129) Is bioethanol from ligno-cellulose fully com- patible with internal combustion engines? O B J E C T I V E S N I L E New Improvements for Lignocellulosic Ethanol 42 NILE will design and investigate new solutions for an efficient conversion of ligno-cellulosic feedstocks to bioethanol, especially novel enzymatic systems and new ethanol-producing yeasts strains, and make an integrative evaluation of the advances in a dedicated and unique pilot plant to obtain reliable data for technical, socio-economic and global environmental assessments. Project Structure To address these various issues, the project struc- ture is mainly based on the steps of the process converting ligno-cellulose to bioethanol, i.e.: Therefore, the project comprises seven work pack- ages. WP 1 and WP 2 are devoted to enzymatic hydrolysis and to ethanol fermentation respec- tively; WP 3, named process technology, covers the whole process including pilot plant tests; WP 4 is focused on environmental and socio- economic impacts; WP 5 aims at evaluating ligno-cellulosic bioethanol for automotive appli- cations; and dissemination and training activities are grouped in WP 6. Expected Results Different approaches will be used to improve enzy- matic hydrolysis: identification of new efficient ligno-cellulose-degrading enzymes, improvement of the key enzymes (e.g. by directed evolution), creation of multifunctional enzymes, and devel- opment of an enzyme production system that is easy to integrate.

        "Challenges Mobility in the future demands CO 2 -neutral transportation means characterised by low emissions and high energy efficiency on a \u2018well- to-wheel\u2019 basis. The gasification of biomass with subsequent synthesis of fuels could provide a substantial contribution to this demand. This project assesses the thermochemical production pathways and aims to support the major objec- tives of EU energy policy, notably the Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gases and policy on security and diversification of energy supply. This will include developing, testing and evaluating new biomass-based energy carriers for individual sustainable mobility (i.e. motor vehicles): (cid:129) Use of primary energy sources with sustainable availability (cid:129) Energy biomass-to-wheel chains with highest efficiency (cid:129) Lowest possible biomass-to-wheel emissions (pollutants and CO 2 ) (cid:129) Potential for European technical implemen- tation at affordable cost The conversion of ligno-cellulosic biomass via gasification into a synthesis gas offers a variety of opportunities for the production of liquid fuels made from biomass and will lead to recom - mendations for future realisation. Project structure A European consortium led by Volkswagen AG has joined forces to develop, demonstrate and comparatively assess pathways from biomass to different energy carriers with a single common intermediate product: synthesis gas. The conver- sion of lingo-cellulosic biomass (wood, straw and energy plants) via gasification into a synthesis gas offers a variety of opportunities for the production of fuel for transportation means. Major vehicle manufacturers, oil companies and plant builders are working together with research and development institutes in a four-year project called RENEW to make a technical, economic and environmental assessment of production pathways for renewable fuels. O B J E C T I V E S R E N E W Renewable Fuels for Advanced Power Trains 44 The main objective of this project is the development and comparative assessment of pathways from biomass to various motor vehicle fuels with a single common intermediate product: the synthesis gas. The fuel pathways will be compared through Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and a technical analysis. Relevant boundary conditions for the comparison will be defined in the consortium, immediately after starting the project. The main focus is on biomass gasification issues related to the subsequent gas cleaning/treatment. Work will be done to determine suitable gas compositions and required purity levels of the synthesis gas with regard to synthesis of premium fuels. Apart from marketable biofuels, for which innovative production paths are explored, a new type of synthetic fuel, biomass-to-liquid (BTL), will be produced at pilot level through Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The latter will be submitted to tests both in current and in new internal combustion engines. RENEW is assessing the fuel production pathways shown in Fig. 1. The focus is on the gasification of lingo-cellulosic bio\u00acmass, the subsequent gas cleaning/treatment, the deter\u00acmination of suitable gas composit\u00acions, and the required purity levels of the synthesis gas for fuel production. From the synthesis gas, several fuel types can be produced which can easily be applied in current and future combustion engines. The production pathways for Fischer-Tropsch diesel (FT diesel), Homogeneous Charged Compression Ignition fuel (HCCI fuel), Dimethylether/Methanol (DME) and ethanol will BIOFUELS FOR TRANSPORT Pathways for the production of BTL fuels undergo a Life Cycle Assess\u00acment (LCA), as well as an economic and technological assessment. As a result of this project, a comprehensive knowledge-base regarding BTL fuels (Biomass to Liquid) produced through gasification of ligno- cellulosic biomass will become available to relevant stakeholders in the EU, thus allowing for a more profound assessment of the impact of future road transport at the environmental, economic and social levels. RENEW is structured in six sub-projects. The first four are devoted to research and develop ment of fuels and production pathways. Sub-project five undertakes the assessment activities and sub- project six is devoted to knowledge dissemination and training. Expected results This project is expected to provide the scientific and technological base for the transition to sus- tainable and environmentally friendly road transport, based on renewable fuels.

Progress to Date The halfway mark of the project has been reached and all activities of the project have started. The overall progress achieved is close to plan: (cid:129) 2500 litres of BTL fuels were produced according to predetermined specifications regarding distillation cut and Cetane number and were tested in engines at Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Regienov/Renault. (cid:129) Engine tests with BTL and fuel analysis revealed the potential for reducing emissions. Preliminary specifications for BTL fuels were agreed on by manufacturers and VW, Daimler-Chrysler and Regienov/Renault. (cid:129) The gasification processes at several gasifiers ranging from 400 kW to 7 MW were optimised and two synthesis routes were installed for further testing. (cid:129) The integration of a black liquor gasification plant at a paper mill was analysed and the basic engineering was performed. (cid:129) The production of ethanol via the thermo- chemical pathway is being studied in detail and work is focussed on the catalytic conversion. (cid:129) The biomass potential in EU-28 was reviewed. Theoretical potential for BTL fuels produced via gasification from biomass grown on available arable land has been estimated at 1.5 EJ/y for the short term perspective and at over 12 EJ/y for long term perspective (> 2040), based on energy crops. Estimating the transport energy demand in 2040 and a 50% use of available biomass for BTL fuel production, a substantial part of the transportation energy demand could be substituted. (cid:129) Goal and scope for the LCA and an economic and technological assessment were agreed. The acquisition of necessary data from the thermochemical production pathways was completed in 3/2006.

        "Challenges The proposal aims at demonstrating the technical and economic feasibility of a global process for exploitation of cardoon (Cynara Cardunculus L.) in energy applications. This energy crop is par- ticularly suited to the Mediterranean region, where problems of water insufficiency prevail. A combined process to produce a low-cost liquid biofuel from seeds and energy from lingo-cellu- losic biomass is proposed.

        "Challenges The concept is based on the use of anaerobic digestion (AD) as a means of producing methane from biomass, including energy crops and agri- cultural residues. The technology of biochemical methane generation is well established: the breakthrough to a cost-effective and competitive energy supply will come from engineering and technical improvements to increase conversion efficiencies and from reductions in the cost of biomass by the introduction of integrated systems, including novel and multi-use crops and agro- wastes. The research aims to determine how the technology can best be applied to provide a ver- satile, low-cost carbon-neutral biofuel in an environmentally sound and sustainable agricultural framework. Project Structure The first phase of the work identified energy crops and agro-wastes best fitted to energy pro- duction in an integrated farming environment. It considered the energy losses in production and processing, and used these to set net energy production targets as a technological goal. The role of storage and pre-treatments to enhance or reduce energy production is considered. Co-digestion is being evaluated as a means of improving energy yields from materials which are uneconomic for biogas production. Some agricultural residues are also being inves- tigated as potential high-yielding substrates. Innovative bioreactor designs and operation modes have been tested to determine their suitability for energy production from crop materials. A European database of bio-kinetics for use in design and operation is being established. True life-cycle costs of biogas production are being determined from large-scale trials. These will allow verification of laboratory data and predictive models, including decision support systems to optimise energy production. The work allows for the need to achieve continuity of energy supply in an integrat- ed farming environment, and addresses broader issues of sustainability, environmental impact and the influence of socio-economic factors on application and uptake. O B J E C T I V E S C R O P G E N Renewable Energy from Crops and Agro-wastes 48 The overall objective is to produce from biomass a sustainable fuel source that can be integrated into the existing energy infrastructure in the medium term, and in the longer term will also provide a safe and economical means of supplying the needs of a developing hydrogen fuel economy. Expected Results The results will add to EU databases on bio- energy crops, give engineers the necessary tools to further develop the technology, and provide the farming community with evidence of pro - fitable energy production without subsidy and within the EU\u2019s target cost for renewable energy. The work contributes to security and diversification of the energy supply, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, soil amelioration and reduced water pollution. It will also create opportunities for increased employment in agriculture and rein- forced competitiveness in technology exports.

        "GASIFICATION AND H 2 -PRODUCTION Challenges The main characteristic of the AER (Absorption Enhanced Reforming) process for the efficient and low-cost conversion of biomass is a CaO- containing bed material, a CO 2 sorbent. It circu- lates between two fluidised bed reactors, takes up CO 2 in the reaction zone of a steam gasifier, and releases CO 2 in the combustor. As a result of the in situ CO 2 removal, the reaction equilibriums are shifted towards hydrogen production and the tar concentration is reduced. Since the CO 2 absorption is a highly exothermic reaction, the released heat is integrated directly into the endothermic gasification/reforming process. The principle of the AER process is illustrated in Fig. 1, applying two fluidised bed reactors with circulating sorbent bed material. While biomass is gasified with steam in the first fluidised bed reactor at 650-700\u00b0C (1 bar), the loaded absorbent material is transported \u2013 together with gasification residues \u2013 into a second fluidised bed reactor for regeneration. This calci- nation reaction at ca. 800\u00b0C is achieved through combustion of biomass residuals. Additional fuel is needed, allowing the adjustment of the process temperature. Two gas streams are obtained, a H 2 -rich product gas as well as a CO 2 - enriched flue gas. The requirements on appropriate CO 2 -sorbent bed materials are high: sufficient mechanical stability, suitable sorption properties, and preferably also catalytic activity encouraging tar removal. Further challenges are to consider mineral-rich biomass resources like straw as fuel for gasifi - cation. Due to ash melting, leading to bed material O B J E C T I V E S A E R - G A S I I AER-gasification with in-situ Hot Gas Cleaning Using Biomass for Poly-generation 50 The project work concentrates on the development and demonstration of a new, efficient and low-cost steam gasification process for clean conversion of solid biomass. By in situ gas cleaning/conditioning, a product gas with a high H 2 content (> 70 vol. %), high heating value (15 MJ/Nm 3 ; due to low CO 2 and negligible N 2 contents), and low tar/alkali/sulphur concentration is generated. Due to the high product gas quality, it is suitable for various applications like CHP (Combined Heat and Power) generation, SNG (Substitute Natural Gas), hydrogen or synthesis gas production. Besides the delivery of an improved catalytic CO 2 sorbent bed material, the project aims to open up new biomass potentials such as humid and mineral-rich resources. The overall goal is the operation of the 8 MWth power plant at Guessing in AER mode. agglomeration, these feedstocks are difficult to handle in fluidised bed gasifiers. In the case of AER conditions, low gasification temperatures (< 750\u00b0C) and the CaO-containing bed material are supposed to prevent agglomeration. The comparable low AER gasification temperature has further interesting effects. The methane content of the raw gas increases, and tars mainly consist of primary and secondary tar components (like phenol and toluene) instead of poly-cyclic compounds, being problematic in subsequent process steps. Despite the low temperature level, the tar content is still small due to the CO 2 sor- bent. Considering commercial realisation, the downstream gas cleaning unit can be simplified, because the product gas quality is increased by implementing in situ hot gas cleaning, thereby reducing plant complexity and costs. Important advantages of the AER process were demonstrated in the recent European AER-GAS project. They are briefly summarised as follows: (cid:129) Product gas with high hydrogen content (up to 80 vol. %) (cid:129) Low CO 2 content (cid:129) Low tar content (< 500 mg/m 3 ) by in situ hot gas cleaning (cid:129) In situ heat supply for endothermic biomass conversion. The following figure shows a typical composition of the raw product gas and of the lower heating value (LHV) obtained dur- ing continuous wood gasification in the AER- FICFB gasifier.

On one hand, the product gas composition can be controlled by process conditions (e.g. by temperature). On the other hand, it can be upgraded downstream e.g. by machination or by gas separation. Thus, the AER process has a high potential for decentralised efficient poly-generation of heat, power and fuel from different biomass resources. A possible integration of the AER process in the existing infrastructure is illustrated. Project Structure The structure of the project with its five work packages (WP) and the contributing partners. Main outcomes of single WPs are added to show the networking. WP 1 concentrates on the delivery of a suitable CO 2 sorbent bed material, a core component of the AER process. Natural materials (e.g. dolomite, limestone) are characterised in terms of: (cid:129) Mechanical stability (cid:129) Catalytic activity towards tar reforming (cid:129) CO 2 absorption capacity during repeated absor ption/regeneration cycles. Pre-treatment methods are developed and deactivation mechanisms are investigated in order to improve the performance of the CO 2 sorbent. WP 2 deals with the analysis of the tar formation/ decomposition process in the presence of different absorbents in order to further reduce the tar content and to optimise the in situ gas cleaning. Furthermore, natural and commercial catalysts are screened and characterised in terms of attrition and activity. Pre-selected materials are delivered to partners in WP 3 and WP 4. In WP 3, the multi-feedstock compatibility is investigated by gasification of mineral-rich bio- mass (e.g. straw) and of humid wood. Due to low gasification temperatures and the presence of CaO (increasing the ash melting point), agglom- eration of the bed material is not expected. The gas composition is analysed, not only with respect to the major compounds (H 2 , CH 4 , CO, CO 2 ), but also alkali, tar and sulphur. Within WP 4, the 8 MWth plant at Guessing is operated in order to prove the feasibility of scale-up of the AER process and in order to assess the economic aspects of the process. The existing gas engine is modified to be operated with the H 2 -rich product gas for electricity production. Recorded data will be provided for process analysis, efficiency calculation and economic analysis, undertaken in WP 5. As a result, the AER mode will be compared with the normal gasification mode in order to point out the market potential and the cost-reduction potential of the new technology. Expected Results Whereas in the former AER-GAS project the feasibility of the AER process was proven with very good results (e.g. high product gas quality), this follow-up project concentrates on the demonstration of the technology on an industrial scale, as well as on new aspects like multi-fuel compatibility, material research and tar formation/ removal mechanisms. Important expected results are listed as follows. (cid:129) Production of a raw product gas from bio- mass with low tar, sulphur and alkali content, increased H 2 concentration, and high calorific value.

        "Challenges The BiGPower project aims to develop reliable, cost-effective and fuel-flexible gasification technologies for high-efficiency small-to-medium scale (1-100 MWe) power production from biomass. The project is designed to create the fundamental and technical basis for successful industrial follow-up developments and demonstra- tion projects aiming for commercial breakthrough by 2010-2020. This overall aim is approached by carrying out, in a pre-competitive manner, well-focused R&D activities on the key bottlenecks of advanced biomass gasification power systems.

In all biomass gasification processes, the product gas contains several types of gas contaminants which have to be efficiently removed before utilising the gas in advanced power systems. The key technical solutions to be developed are: (cid:129) High-temperature catalytic removal of tars and ammonia by new catalytic methods (cid:129) Development of innovative low-cost gas filtration and the control of different gas contaminants by sorbents (HCl and alkali/ heavy metals). Three of the most potential power production cycle alternatives are examined and developed: (cid:129) Gas engines (cid:129) Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) (cid:129) The simplified Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) process. The performance and techno-economic feasibility of these advanced gasification-to-power concepts will be examined by carrying out case studies in different European regions.

The cooperation of gasification manufacturers, gas cleaning developers, and engine and fuel cell suppliers is also a unique feature of the BiGPower project, which could not have been realised on a national or bilateral basis. Expected Results The most economical gasification technology that can be realised on a small scale (below 5 MWe) is fixed-bed gasification. However, most of the available biomass residues in Europe do not meet the requirements of commercial fixed-bed gasifiers. Usually the bulk density is low, the fuel is fibrous and also contains fines, which creates problems with the gas flow in gasifiers relying on gravity for fuel feed in the reactor. Thus, fixed- bed gasifiers can only be operated with high- quality and expensive wood chips, briquettes or pellets, which makes their use uneconomical. The new NOVEL-gasification technology uses forced fuel feeding, making it possible to effectively utilise such biomass residues and energy crops that cannot otherwise be used in fixed-bed gasifiers without expensive pre-treatment. The gasifier can be operated with a wide range of biomass residues (moisture content 0-55%, particle size from sawdust to large chips). The first generation Novel CHP plant (2 MWe and 4 MW district heat) is presently under construction in Kokem\u00e4ki, Finland. The basis of this technology was created in previous EU projects realised in 1997-2002 (by project partners VTT and Condens). The BiGPower project is aiming to create a basis for the second-generation Novel process, which can be used in advanced power cycles of the project and with the whole range of biomass and waste fuels.

        "The innovative dual fluidised-bed gasification process was originally developed in Austria in the late 1990s (by TUV and Repotec). This gasification process can produce a medium-heating-value gas without the need for expensive oxygen plant. As the product gas does not contain diluting nitrogen, it can be utilised more easily in gas engines, fuel cells or gas turbines originally developed for natural gas. This gasification process also has a good potential for small-scale production of hydrogen or synthetic natural gas. The first-generation dual fluid-bed process has been demonstrated in Guessing, Austria (2 MWe and 5 MW district heat). The BiGPower project is aiming to create the basis for the second- generation dual fluid-bed process, which can be used in advanced power cycles of the project (gas engines, fuel cells) as well as in future H 2 /CH 4 production systems. The third gasification technology of the project team, air-blown pressurised fluidised-bed gasifi- cation, was developed in the 1990s (by Carbona and VTT), originally for Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plants and for size ranges 30-150 MWe. The gasification and gas-cleaning steps of the first-generation process were suc- cessfully demonstrated in the 20 MW pilot plant in Tampere, Finland. Presently this technology is applied in a gas engine demonstration project in Skive, Denmark (5 MWe, 15 MW district heat). In the BiGPower project, the basis for second-generation pressurised fluidised-bed gasification will be created for IGCC plants and large gas engine plants. In small-scale (1-15 MWe) power production, the most potential systems are based on either advanced gas engines or molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC). The most developed state-of-the-art gas engines for the target size-range have been developed in Austria (by GE Jenbacher) and, according to VTT preliminary studies, the most potential fuel cell system for biomass gasification applications has been developed in Germany (by project partner MTU CFC Solutions). The aim of the BiGPower project is to study and develop new innovative power concepts integrating B I G P O W E R Advanced Biomass Gasification for High-Efficiency Power 54 selected optimised gasification technologies with new innovative gas engine and MCFC concepts. In all biomass gasification processes, the product gas contains several types of gas contaminants, which have to be efficiently removed before utilising the gas in advanced power systems. The high concentrations of tars, nitrogenous species and alkali-metals are typical challenges for bio- mass gasification that have created numerous operational problems in previous gasification plants. The project partners have already been able to overcome this critical barrier of biomass gasification by using first-generation catalytic gas-cleaning and/or oil-scrubbing. However, these present gas-cleaning methods are expensive and have only limited utilisation potential. The BiGPower project is aiming to develop effective and reliable novel gas cleaning methods which can be realised with substantially lower investment and operation costs and with higher availability than the present technology. The simplified IGCC process based on pressurised air-blow gasification and hot-gas filtration offers the best potential for increasing substantially the efficiency of biomass-based electricity production in large-scale power production. This gasification technology was developed in Finland in the early 1990s and successfully demonstrated in two pilot plants in ca. 20 MW fuel size-range (Tampere and V\u00e4rn\u00e4mo). However, the commercial break- through of BIGCC technology requires further development and cost reduction of the processes, which is the target of the BiGPower project.

The values can be in the range of thousands of ppm, which clearly exceeds the emission standards in many European countries. Consequently, this matter can become a major hurdle in the commercialisation of gasification-based engine power plants. Therefore special emphasis has to be paid to the control of CO, in addition to all other gaseous emissions. Furthermore, contaminated waste- water from gas scrubbers and condensers requires treatment before it can be discarded, and it would be advantageous if complete wastewater recycling in the process could be achieved. Therefore the development of near-zero emission power plant concepts is one of the main R&D topics in the BiGPower project. All the technologies selected for this project have the required potential to meet the targets of efficient, reliable and economically attractive power production. In addition, these technologies cover the whole range of most potential electricity production capacities from 0.5 MWe up to 100 MWe. Only the very small scale (kW-scale) and, on the other hand, the 500-1000 MWe concepts are excluded from this proposed project. Progress to Date The project started in October 2005, in accordance with the work plan. In WP1 first new catalyst materials have been produced by MEL, Norta, TKK and VTT and catalytic filter samples have been made by Madison Filter. The laboratory and bench-scale testing has also started. In WP2 (Novel fixed-bed gasifier), studies on waste water minimisation have been carried out and the slip-stream testing of new catalysts from WP1 has been started. In WP3, the experimental activities at TUV on improved fuel flexibility have been started by TUV and Repotec. In WP4, IGCC process modelling and a gas turbine survey have been carried out by Carbona and CERTH. In WP5 and WP6, GEJ and MTU have started their activities on optimised gas engine and fuel cell processes for biomass gasification gas.

        "Challenges Energy from biomass needs highly efficient small-scale energy systems in order to achieve cost-effective solutions for decentralised gener- ation. Especially in Mediterranean and southern areas and for applications without adequate heat consumers, highest efficiencies are needed due to the fact that no revenues for heat may be achieved. Thus fuel cells are an attractive option for distributed generation from biomass and agricultural residues. Due to their robustness, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are applicable above all other concepts to the use of gaseous fuels from biomass. They operate with exhaust gas temperatures between 800\u00b0C and 1000\u00b0C and are able to convert not only hydrogen but also carbon monoxide and even hydrocarbons. But; even if the fuel gas matches the strict requirements of SOFC mem- branes, the main challenge of the conversion of biogenous fuel gas is to achieve the required efficiency of the fuel cell system. Common bio- mass fuel cell systems with realistic boundary conditions will hardly reach efficiencies above 30%, due to the low hydrogen and methane content of biogenous fuel gases, which reduces the fuel cell efficiency and the physical limitation of the cold gas efficiency of any gasification system. Thus the system performance and the thermal integration of the gasification process are of particular importance. Fuel Cells for biomass conversion therefore have to meet at least two outstanding challenges: (cid:129) Fuel cell materials and the gas cleaning tech- nologies have to treat high dust loads of the fuel gas and pollutants like tars, alkalines and heavy metals. (cid:129) The system integration has to allow efficiencies of at least 40-50% even within a power range of a few tens or hundreds of kW: this can be realised with the TopCycle concept. O B J E C T I V E S B I O C E L L U S Biomass Fuel Cell Utility System 56 Fuel cell systems for biomass have to meet at least two outstanding challenges: fuel cell materials and the gas cleaning technologies have to treat the high dust loads of the fuel gas and gas pollutants like tars, alkalines and heavy metals, and the system integration has to allow efficiencies of at least 40-50% even within a power range of a few tens or hundreds of kW in order to achieve the cost targets of \u20ac 0.05/kW. The BIOCELLUS project addresses in particular these two aims \u2013 the investigation of the pollutants\u2019 impact on the fuel cell, and the development and demonstration of an integrated fuel cell system which meets the special requirements of biofuels. Project Structure The BIOCELLUS project addresses in particular these two aims. Hence the first part of the project will focus on the investigation of the impact of these pollutants on the degradation and perfor - mance characteristics of SOFC fuel cells, in order to specify the requirements for an appropriate gas cleaning system. These tests will be per- formed at four existing gasification sites, which represent the most common and applicable gasification technologies. A long-term test at a commercial gasification site will demonstrate the selected gas cleaning technologies in order to verify the specifications obtained from the gasification tests. The results will be used for the development, installation and testing of an innovative SOFC gasi- fication concept, which will especially match the particular requirements of fuel cell systems for the conversion of biomass feedstock. The innovative concept comprises heating an allothermal gasifier with the exhaust heat of the fuel cell by means of liquid metal heat pipes. Internal cooling of the stack and the recirculation of waste heat increases the system efficiency significantly. This so-called TopCycle concept promises electrical efficiencies of above 50% even for small-scale systems without any combined processes. Expected Results The main three results of the project will be: (cid:129) The performance characteristics of SOFC mem- branes (\u2018polarisation curves\u2019: cell voltage with respect to the current density) for different gas compositions and varying operational condition. Measuring the cell voltage and its degradation under realistic conditions is inevitably necessary for a reliable estimation of fuel cell efficiency, requirements for the gas conditioning system and the economic assessment of upcoming SOFC concepts based on biomass feedstock. (cid:129) The design and demonstration of an appropriate gas cleaning concept which matches the severe requirements of SOFC systems. GASIFICATION AND H 2 -PRODUCTION ",

This will be measured and evaluated by means of a detailed cost analysis based on the chosen system design. Progress to Date In order to characterise the performance of SOFC membranes with different gas compositions and varying operational conditions, two test rigs have been designed and built, one for planar and one for tubular SOFCs. With the help of these test rigs preliminary tests with synthetic wood gas have been carried out, in order to identify degra dation processes with gas mixtures of hydrocarbons. After successful testing with synthetic gases, tests at three different gasifiers have been carried out. At all gasifiers, two fixed bed and one fluidised bed gasifier, no degradation of the membranes was observed during short-term testing, the longest lasting 168 hours. The testing will be continued at one other gasifier with different testing parameters. In order to make these tests at the gasifiers feasible, a gas cleaning device has been designed and built which comprises desulphurisation, particle removal and pre-reforming. The pre-reforming can be bypassed in order to examine the effects of higher hydrocarbons on the performance of SOFCs. The gas cleaning device has proved its functionality and reliability during testing at the different gasifiers, as no degradation was observed during the 24-hour tests. It will be further improved and adapted for long-term testing at a commercial gasification site. An innovative stack design, which implements the TopCycle concept with its high efficiencies by means of heat pipes, has been conceived for planar and for tubular fuel cells. These two designs achieve an effective heat transfer from the stack towards the gasifier on the one hand, and an isothermal temperature distribution within the stack which avoids carbon deposition on the other hand. The two concepts will be tested by building short prototype stacks first, after which the consortium will vote for the most promising concept to be realised through a 5kW stack.

        "Challenges The Kyoto Protocol addresses the need to reduce the transport sector\u2019s dependence on oil. The CHRISGAS project responds directly to this chal- lenge with its aim of arriving at a cost-effective and attractively viable solution to producing a high-quality syngas from the thermochemical process of the gasification of biomass. This gasi- fication/synthesis route is expected to be lower in cost than the hydrolysis/fermentation route. Cost-effective means high-energy efficiency for process competitiveness. This implies the high- est possible gas filtration temperature \u2013 in the range of 800 to 900\u00b0C \u2013 with, preferably an acceptable function of catalytic steam reforming to decompose methane, tar and other hydro - carbons when in the presence of certain sulphur compounds. The major forthcoming challenge in the project is rebuilding and putting back into operation the large complex pilot unit, V\u00e4xj\u00f6 V\u00e4rnamo Biomass Gasification Centre, which has been mothballed under a conservation programme for more than five years. The Centre can then be used as a plat- form for advanced research, development and demonstration and testing of biomass gasifica- tion. It is hence being designed to include possi- bilities for gas cleaning and upgrading as well as conversion of gases to gaseous and/or liquid energy carriers at semi-industrial level. Another significant technical challenge is to find a solution to reducing the inert gas consump- tion and its presence in the syngas. An innova- tive piston system for feeding biomass to the gasifier is being developed within the project to tackle this. Project Structure The hub of this project is based around the V\u00e4xj\u00f6 V\u00e4rnamo Biomass Gasification Centre (VVBGC) in Sweden and the use of the biomass-fuelled pressurised IGCC (integrated gasification com- bined-cycle) CHP (combined heat and power) plant in V\u00e4rnamo as a pilot facility. By building VVBGC around this plant, gasification research and demonstration activities can be conducted at a much lower cost than if a new R&D facility was to be built. This part of the project is sup- ported by the RTD and demonstration parts of the CHRISGAS project. O B J E C T I V E S C H R I S G A S Clean Hydrogen-rich Synthesis Gas 58 The primary aim of the CHRISGAS project is to demonstrate within a five-year period an energy-efficient and cost-effective method of producing hydrogen-rich gases from biomass which can then be transformed into renewable automotive fuels such as FT diesel, DME and hydrogen. This syngas process is based on steam/oxygen-blown gasification of biomass, followed by hot-gas cleaning to remove particulates, and steam-reforming of tar and light hydrocarbons to further enhance the hydrogen yield. The process is planned for demonstration at V\u00e4rnamo, Sweden, after modifications to the world\u2019s first complete IGCC demonstration plant for biomass. Parallel R&D activities cover the whole value chain from biomass to syngas and include: feedstock biomass logistics, biomass drying integration, pressurised fuel feeding, gasification, hot synthesis gas characterisation, high-temperature filtration/cleaning, catalytic steam reforming and shift gas catalyst characterisation. This will all lead onto the next phase: conversion of gas into motor fuels (Biomass to Liquids, BTL). The project also concentrates on research-related networking, training and dissemination activities, as well as on socio-economic research on the non-technical obstacles for penetration into the markets of the technologies concerned. Progress to Date As mentioned, the key work areas of the project are related to the activities around the V\u00e4rnamo pilot plant. During the first 18 months a study providing conceptual engineering design alter- natives (including mass and energy balances, definitions of all streams, PFD, PID, basic equip- ment specifications, etc.) has been performed, as well as an initial risk assessment. A basic engi- neering study of the planned rebuild using an external engineering consultant has also been completed. This later part has been funded out- side the project. In addition a thorough status review of the existing pilot plant at V\u00e4rnamo has been conducted. Maintenance needs and modi- fication requirements have been identified and this work is ongoing at the plant. In the status review the gasifier, feed system, ash system and gas cooling as well as auxiliary systems were checked for function and/or quality. GASIFICATION AND H 2 -PRODUCTION ",

The methodological approach to estimating poten- tial biomass resources has been developed, and data concerning agricultural and forest residues has been collected for Spain, France, Italy and Greece. In these evaluated countries, the poten- tial of agricultural field residues have been found to reach 160 million o.d.t/year and the forest residues potential 36 million o.d./t year. The required databases are ready to be used throughout the EU. To investigate the influence of process/fuel parameters on steam/oxygen blown CFB gasifi- cation, a considerable number of experiments have been carried out in atmospheric conditions at the laboratories of two of the partners, using common fuels supplied by one of the partners. These results are a very valuable base for the large pilot demonstration programme at V\u00e4rnamo. Pilot research work has also been con- ducted, resulting in knowledge within the area of measurement techniques and the characteri- sation of gaseous and aerosol trace components that are present in the gasifier raw gas. The experiments in this area are aimed at using and developing methods for high-temperature measurement of particles without changing the original aerosol. A key process area and piece of equipment for the CHRISGAS project is an efficient and robust hot gas filter. A design has been produced for a novel hot gas filtration unit, to be placed and tested for filtration on the laboratory gasifier at the research premises of one of the partners. The novelty is related to the new type of back-pulsing system, as well to the application of a catalyst for tar cracking on the filter material surface. Catalyst lifetime and degradation rate in the gasifier raw-gas atmosphere is another signifi- cantly important area within CHRISGAS. The specific trends of the deactivation using 20 and 50 ppm of H 2 S in the feed have been observed in laboratory tests, as well as the positive effect of increasing the temperature and O 2 concentration. The analysis of the catalyst exposed to sulphur deactivation has shown a specific decrease of available Ni atoms attributed to NiS formation. An increase of the Ni 0 crystal size, associated with the high temperature obtained during the tests with oxygen, has also been observed. A reactivation of catalyst activity takes place when adding oxygen to the catalyst. This is very significant in making the catalytic reforming process viable. In conjunction with the charact - erisation and activity studies on reformer catalysts, the first year of the project has indicated that the pilot plant would benefit from studies on com - mercial water gas shift catalysts. Work has therefore been expanded within CHRISGAS to encompass such water gas shift catalyst investigations. The main dissemination activities have concen- trated on raising public awareness of the project and of the technical possibilities of producing automotive fuels from biomass. The production of a flyer, a website and posters with their broad approach, as well as project presentations at conferences in Washington DC, Moscow, Beijing, Seville, Stockholm and in several other European cities, have formed a major part of dissemina- tion activities. One of three planned workshops has already taken place and a further training and dissemination activity is planned at the University of Bologna for early September this year, with a summer school covering the whole scope of the CHRISGAS project.

        "Challenges The overall technical objective is to develop a tar decomposition and gas cleaning system that can be integrated with biomass gasifiers. The resulting challenge is to prepare a basic design for a full- scale (1-50 MW th ) innovative gasifier and gas treatment system for integrated biomass gasifica- tion SOFC systems with the following expectations: (cid:129) Tar content of the gas < 10 mg tar/Nm 3 gas (cid:129) Cold gas efficiency > 85% for the whole gasi- fication process (cid:129) Carbon conversion > 99% (cid:129) Minimal process waste streams and by- products so as to reduce the environmental impact of the waste from the gasifier and the operational cost. Project structure The technical concept for this project is to design an up-scalable char bed that can be integrated into existing gasifiers, in order to reduce tar concentrations to a level low enough to avoid tar-related problems in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system.

The main objective is thus to produce a gas suitable for SOFC application through reliable, up-scalable and cost-effective staged gasification of biomass, with less environmental problems from stream containing tars or char. be suitable as a catalytic agent for the reduction of tar concentration at high temperatures (900\u00b0C or higher). Two new designed up-scalable staged gasifiers are being developed, integrating tar removal technologies based on char beds. Two different char-bed systems (with or without bed material) are being developed and tested on a laboratory and pilot scale. The advantages of both designs will be further evaluated and compared. A specific and more fundamental task aims at better understanding tar formation and its destruction in char beds, in order to minimize the tar content in the gas. Moreover, the performance of an SOFC is investi- gated in relation to the presence of organic com- pounds (representing tars) and inorganic impurities in the feed gas, in order to determine the required gas specification for possible utilisation in an SOFC. According to these specifications, a complete train of a dry gas cleaning system downstream from the gasifier will be implemented and the operation parameters will be identified. Finally a long-term testing of two complete integrated gasification/fuel cell stack plants will be performed on woody bio- mass, for at least 100 hours each.

As the produced gas is expected to be a clean gas with very low tar content, and because an appropriate dry cleaning system will solve inorganic contam- ination, various applications can be considered, including fuel synthesis. The achievement within the project will be the two fuel cells coupled to gasifiers for at least 100 hours each. Progress to date During the first 18 months of the project, the work has been devoted to the following activities: Char-bed gasification The two different designs are in progress of development by TKE and ECN. In both cases, cold models have been built and led to experimental data useful to the design and construction of hot lab-scale pilots which are currently being or have been tested. A pilot gasifier including a hot char bed has been designed and constructed at TKE. Tar research The activities are carried out to gain knowledge on tar formation and destruction in char beds: (cid:129) An analytical quantitative protocol with a SPME method is under development at CEA. (cid:129) Lab-scale experiments have been conducted at DTU to characterise char in terms of residual tar release. A comparison with char obtained on a pilot-scale pyrolysis unit at CIRAD is in progress. (cid:129) The partial oxidation mechanisms of tar destruction are being investigated at DTU. (cid:129) Axperiments are in progress at RISOE and CIRAD to study tar destruction in char beds, with regards to the nature of tars and the origin of char. At RISOE, experiments with isotope- labelled compounds aim at determining the mechanisms of irreversible binding. Inorganics behaviour and modelling Thermodynamic calculations were performed by CEA to evaluate the composition of syngas at equilibrium, taking into account the conditions of gasification. For condensable species in the gas, the range of temperature where condensation occurs is determined for each species. This is of importance for corrosion risks evaluation and also for gas cleaning strategy. Gas cleaning system A dry gas cleaning system is currently being designed in order to reduce the levels of particles, S-compounds, Cl-compounds and alkali to a level acceptable to the SOFC. Three gas cleaning trains (two lab-scale and one pilot-scale) are going to be dimensioned and built. ICT has constructed the facility and performed experiments to test the efficiency of sorbents that will be used, mainly with regards to HCl and H 2 S. SOFC vs pollutants So far, the sensitivity of a single SOFC has been investigated with respect to organic compounds with synthetic pre-mixed gases. There was no impact of C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 4 , which are reformed. Toluene is reformed but induces a degradation of the cell due to carbon deposition. Naphtalene creates a sharp and irreversible degradation. This degradation might be decreased or avoided by increasing the H 2 O content and/or limiting the maximum allowable concentration of the organic compounds. The facility aiming at studying the influence of inorganic pollutants on SOFC material is almost ready for experiments at CEA. ",
        "Challenges The main challenge addressed in this project is the expected increase in demand for hydrogen from renewable resources which will arise from the transition to the hydrogen economy. Furthermore, the project adds to the number and diversity of routes for supply of hydrogen from renewable sources, giving greater security of energy supply at the local and regional level. Project structure The aim of HYVOLUTION is described by the full title: non-thermal production of pure hydrogen from biomass. The core issue at stake is the combination of a thermophilic fermentation (also called dark fer- mentation) with a photoheterotrophic fermen- tation. In the first fermentation, thermophilic bacteria are used to start the bioprocess. This offers two important advantages. First, ther- mophilic fermentation at >70 \u00b0C is superior in terms of hydrogen yield when compared with fermentations at ambient temperatures. In ther- mophilic fermentations, glucose is converted to, on the average, 3 moles of hydrogen and 2 moles of acetate as the main by-product. In contrast, in fermentations at ambient temperatures, the average yield is only 1-2 moles of hydrogen per mole of glucose: butyrate, propionate, ethanol or butanol are the main by-products. The second O B J E C T I V E S H Y V O L U T I O N Bacteria also like to make Hydrogen! 62 The main scientific objective is the development of a two-stage bioprocess for the cost-effective production of pure hydrogen from biomass. Amongst the challenges are pretreatment technologies for optimal biodegradation of energy crops and bio-residues, maximum efficiency in conversion of biomass to hydrogen, assessment of installations for optimal gas cleaning, minimal energy demand and maximal product output through system integration and identification of market opportunities for a broad feedstock range. The main technological objective is the construction of prototype modules of the plant which form the basis of a blueprint for the whole chain from biomass to pure hydrogen. Points to be studied are prototypes of equipment for mobilisation of fermentable feedstock, reactors for thermophilic and photoheterotrophic hydrogen production, devices for monitoring and control, and equipment for optimal gas cleaning. Socio-economic objectives are to increase public awareness and societal acceptance and the identification of future stakeholders. advantage of the process is the production of acetate as the main by-product in the first fer- mentation. Acetate is a prime substrate for pho- toheterotrophic bacteria. Through the combination of thermophilic fermentation with a photoheterotrophic fermentation, complete con- version of the substrate to hydrogen and CO 2 can be achieved. HYVOLUTION is structured around this core issue with a design aimed at closely associating the events in the chain from biomass to hydrogen. The work packages addressing hydrogen production are surrounded by studies in system integration and societal integration in order to develop an econo - mically viable, fully sustainable process for hydrogen production (Fig. 1). The process starts with the conversion of biomass to make a suitable feedstock for the bioprocess (WP 1). The ensuing bioprocess is optimised in terms of yield and rate of hydrogen production through integrating fundamental and techno- logical approaches, addressed in WP 2 and 3. Dedicated gas upgrading is developed for high efficiency in small-scale production units dealing with fluctuating gas streams (WP 4). Production costs will be reduced by system integration, combining mass and energy balances (WP 5). The impact of small-scale hydrogen production plants is addressed in socio-economic analyses performed in WP 6.

        "Challenges The overall aim of the project is to contribute to the solution of open ash- and aerosol-related problems in biomass combustion and biomass/ coal co-firing systems. For medium- and large- scale systems these problems mainly concern deposit formation in furnaces and boilers, as well as corrosion, while for small-scale applica- tions fine particulate emission control is of interest. Moreover, health risks caused by partic- ulate emissions from biomass combustion and co-firing need to be investigated. Some previous projects have already attempted to investigate the basic mechanisms responsible for the behaviour of ash-forming elements in combustion units, and this work is being continued within BIOASH. A major starting point is thus basic research into the release of ash-forming elements from the fuel to the gas phase. These release data provide the basis for developing new codes for the simulation of aerosol and deposit formation. An improved data basis con- cerning thermodynamic and viscosity data of typical biomass combustion- derived ashes is needed, however, to further advance these models. No economically affordable and efficient fine particle separation devices are presently avail- able for small-scale biomass combustion units: therefore, the project also focuses on the devel- opment of such a technology. Air pollution caused by particulate emissions affects human health but it is still unclear which parameters (chemical composition, particle size) are the most relevant concerning the toxicity of these particles. In order to determine the toxicity of fine particulate emissions from biomass combustion and biomass/coal co-firing plants, in vivo and in vitro studies are carried out using particle samples collected during real-scale test runs. Project Structure The investigations within BIOASH are based on laboratory tests as well as test runs at pilot-scale and real-scale biomass combustion and co-firing plants. Furthermore, theoretical mathematical modelling of ash, aerosol and deposit formation is applied. In this context, the results from the test runs are used to gain substantial high-quality data for the calibration and validation of the models developed. Woody biomass fuels (wood, O B J E C T I V E S B I O A S H Ash and Aerosol Related Problems in Biomass Combustion and Co-firing 68 BIOASH focuses on solving open ash-related problems in biomass combustion and biomass/coal co-firing systems. BIOASH therefore aims to investigate the release behaviour of ash-forming compounds from biomass fuels in fixed-bed and pulverised fuel combustion systems, and to determine missing thermodynamic and viscosity data as a basis for investigations concerning aerosol and deposit formation. BIOASH also focuses on the development of advanced models for a more precise prediction of aerosol and deposit formation, with respect to the release behaviour of ash-forming elements from the fuel. Furthermore, a new technology for cost-effective and efficient aerosol precipitation in small-scale biomass combustion units is being developed. Another focus is on investigating the effect of particulate emissions from biomass combustion and co-firing on ambient air quality and related health risks. bark, waste wood) and straw are considered. Olive residues and sawdust are investigated for biomass co-firing in coal-fired power stations. Expected Results BIOASH will provide new insights into ash and aerosol formation during biomass combustion and biomass/coal co-firing and provide the basis for developing improved models to predict aerosol and deposit formation in furnaces and boilers. These models should be applicable for the design and optimisation of combustion plants but should also be used as supporting tools for optimised fuel choice and fuel blending. A second relevant result of the project will be the development of a new aerosol precipitation techno - logy for small-scale biomass combustion units, with high separation efficiency at comparably low costs. Finally, the project will provide new data concerning health risks caused by fine particulate emissions from biomass combustion. This data, together with available comparable data for particulate emissions from other emission sources (e.g. diesel soot), should support regional and national authorities in the definition of emission limits. Progress to Date One important objective of the project is the characterisation of the BIOASH fuels, using both conventional and novel methods. Wet chemical analyses, SEM/EDX analyses, CCSEM analyses, chemical fractionation tests as well as investiga- tions by DTG/DSC were undertaken, and thermo- dynamic equilibrium studies were carried out based on the results of these analyses. All BIOASH fuels were investigated and evaluated and the analytical data was summarised in data- bases. The release behaviour of ash-forming elements from the fuels was studied under fixed-bed con- ditions and under pulverised fuel combustion conditions. The laboratory-scale tests as well as the planned evaluation work were successfully concluded, providing comprehensive information about the release of relevant ash- and aerosol- forming elements (K, Na, S, Cl, Zn and Pb) during combustion.

DTG/DSC studies are carried out in order to predict the melting behaviour of Zn- and Pb-rich ash mixtures. The results of the tests have been used to improve a thermodynamic melting model for alkali salt mixtures containing Pb and Zn. During the third project year this model will be further improved and will then act as an important tool for the development of a deposit formation model for biomass combustion and co-firing plants. Viscometer measurements have been performed to validate and extend the range of existing empirical correlations for calculating particle viscosities. Carefully selected synthetic samples as well as pre-ashed fuel samples of the BIOASH fuels have been analysed. The results of these tests have already provided valuable input for modelling tasks. Further viscosity measurements are planned for the third project year. Another important task of the project is to determine the corrosion potential of ash deposits. To do this, small pieces of superheater material coated with different types of synthetic deposits are exposed to a synthetic flue gas. Experiments are conducted at different exposure times (up to 3-4 months) at two different tem- peratures. The results will help to address the corrosive potential of deposits formed during biomass combustion and biomass co-firing. So far test runs at four real-scale biomass com- bustion and co-firing plants have been performed. Innovative high-temperature particle sampling devices (new types of deposit probes as well as a high-temperature low-pressure impactor), developed during the first project year to pro- vide deeper insights into particle and deposit formation processes, were successfully applied during these test runs for the first time. The con- siderable volume of data obtained (fuel and ash compositions, data about aerosol and deposit formation etc.) will be compared with the data from the lab-scale tests. Furthermore, the data will be utilised as a basis for calibrating and verifying the models developed within the project. A code for the simulation of aerosol formation in biomass combustion processes was also improved. The comparison of modelling results and measurement data gained from the test runs has already proven the applicability of this code for aerosol formation prediction in biomass combustion processes. Work on deposit formation modelling has already started and will continue during the third project year. During the real-scale test runs aerosol emission samples were taken and forwarded for in vivo and in vitro studies concerning health effects of fine particulate emissions from biomass combustion and co-firing. The results of this work will be available at the end of the project.

        "Challenges The production of fuels and other materials from biomass, summarised as biorefineries, is expected to grow steadily over coming years. Several of the existing technologies like biodiesel or bio-alcohol production suffer from the fact that they consume considerable amounts of fossil energies while converting only a fraction of the carbon input into the desired product. Advanced technologies are necessary to overcome this drawback and to utilise the residues arising in the process. The BIO-PRO European project aims at the development of easy and robust technologies to convert the residues of the biorefinery processes to energy, thus allowing them to self- supply the required energy. The core activity of the project is to convert new burner technologies, originally developed for natural gas, to burn low calorific value (LCV) gases generated from biomass. Within the BIO-PRO project, the flameless oxidation technology (FLOX) and the continuous air staging technology (COSTAIR) are being transferred to these new applications. Both technologies have several benefits compared to conventional combustion systems, especially the high reduction potential in thermal NOx and CO emissions. Of particular importance for the combustion of gases generated from biomass is the improved flame stability, despite varying fuel qualities. Project Structure Based on the waste materials derived from biorefinery processes, two types of burners will be developed in line with the fuel mix: biogas, fermentation residues, fibres etc. The methodology of the work programme is as follows: (cid:129) Every development will start with the work on gas/liquid BIO-PRO burners (GL-burner): first experiments will be made on existing burner test rigs, subsequently new burners will be developed. (cid:129) In parallel, a pre-gasification unit will be installed in order to facilitate the development of the solid BIO-PRO burner (S-burner): develop ments in the GL-burners will be trans- ferred and adapted on this test rig. (cid:129) A new control technology will be developed, incorporating a self-diagnosis module assessing O B J E C T I V E S B I O - P R O New Burner Technologies for Low Grade Biofuels to Supply Clean Energy for Processes in Biorefineries 70 The project aims at developing new combustion technologies for bio-residues. Innovative combustion technologies like flameless oxidation (FLOX\u00ae) and continuous air staging (COSTAIR) will be enhanced by re-burning and co-firing in order to meet this goal. Two basic types of BIO-PRO burners will be developed to meet this goal, a pilot burner for gas and liquid fuels and a pilot burner for solid fuels applying a pre-gasification step for the solids without gas cooling. The technology to be developed will be able to self-adjust to different fuel qualities (fuel moisture 10-50%). For emissions of the investigated fuels, the upper limit for CO will be 30 mg/m 3 (currently 50 mg/m 3 is typical) and NO x will be reduced by 50% (starting point for dry wood chips in available combustion systems = 210 mg/m 3 ). the fuel quality and an adoptive control loop on-line. This will first be applied to the GL-burners and then transferred to the S-burners. This methodology will be used to develop a first and a second generation of prototype burners. The second generation will be equipped with the control system. A GL- and an S-burner of this second-generation prototype will be tested on industrial appliances. Expected Results The prototypes of the new burners will be brought to pre-commercialisation level (two pilot scale burners and operation guidelines). The accompanying socio-economic assessment will assess the economic viability of the new technology (life-cycle assessment) on the one hand, and will show promising markets for a subsequent dissemination of the technology on the other (dissemination strategy). A successful development and application of the technology is expected to have the following impact: (cid:129) Increased use of bio-residues, increasing the utilisation of biomass in Europe by up to 50% (basis 54.175 toe in 1998): this will reduce CO 2 emissions by 46 Mio t/a (basis: energy consumption 1998). (cid:129) Improved European competitiveness in the global market, accounting for up to 15,000 new jobs. (cid:129) NO x emissions from biomass combustion sys- tems will be reduced within 10 years by approx. 76,500 t/a (basis: biomass consump- tion 1998).

The investigations are conducted with a 20 kW FLOX combustor provided by WS W\u00e4rme pro zess technik. The tests with combustion air temperatures of 300\u00b0C and higher have shown that a stable and complete combustion can be achieved with LCV gases above 2.1 MJ/Nm 3 High emission of nitrogen oxides originated from fuel nitrogen will doubtless occur when solid biofuels, e. g. residues of flour or oil mills, are burned. Therefore, further investigations concentrate on possible measures for NO x emis- sion reduction for the solid burner system. A first approach is to provide a reduction zone downstream from the pre-gasification zone. First tests regarding NO x reduction potential were car ried out in a double-staged combustion chamber with a FLOX combustor using methane as fuel. The tests have shown that the proposed reduction measure can re duce the NOx emissions by 40%. S-burner development \u2013 FLOX technology The S-burner development based on the FLOX technology is carried out at the University of Stuttgart (USTUTT). A new FLOX burner for the test facility at USTUTT was designed and combined with a fixed-bed pre-gasifier that provides a hot and tar-loaded LCV gas to the burner. First tests with wood chips have shown that the burner can be operated at a low level of excess oxygen (below 4% O 2 ) that results in a higher efficiency of the total system, and the emissions can be significantly decreased. Compared to the original burn-out zone, CO emissions are reduced by 60-80% and NO x emissions by 20% respectively. Tests with other bio-residues, especially ones with high N-content, are ongoing. For further NO x reduction an external flue gas recirculation will be installed. S-burner development COSTAIR technology Tests with an S-burner based on the COSTAIR technology and combined with a cyclone gasifier (BIOSWIRL) were conducted at TPS Termiska Processer AB. Comparative tests with the developed COSTAIR burner and the original burner showed similar results in tests with three different fuels. CO emission was on the same level for both types of burners, but emission of NO x was slightly lower in tests with the original burner, compared to the COSTAIR burner. The performance of the burner was however satisfactory at this stage of development, considering the difficulties encountered regarding adapting the COSTAIR concept to the Bioswirl gasifier and scaling up the design from a laboratory scale of 30 kW to a pilot scale of 1 MW. Industrial test of 1 st FLOX burner prototype Industrial tests with a first prototype FLOX burner were carried out on a 1.5 MW atmospheric CFB gasifier operated by Foster Wheeler. The burner was tested over a period of 176 hours. The FLOX burner operated very reliably and without any problems over the whole test period. The CO emissions in all test runs were below 15 mg/Nm 3 (@ 3% O 2 ) and the NOx emissions mostly below the limit value of 400 mg/Nm 3 (@ 3% O 2 ). Thermal NOx emissions are mostly eliminated by the FLOX burner. The emitted NO x is mainly generated by fuel nitrogen. Further optimisation of the burner is necessary to further reduce NO x emissions. Figure 2: NO x and CO emissions with and without an NO x injection ",
        "Challenges Apart from securing the supply of different resources at the expense of fossil fuels, particu- larly biomass, there are other problems like lack of experience, economics and environmental consequences: (cid:129) Experience with multi-fuel use is very limited or, in many case, confined to solving localised environmental problems, even if some effort has been made in the past at research level in the EU by various research centres. (cid:129) The management practices of handling multi-fuels are less developed than in many industrial plants, because this may require investment: without any apparent benefits, companies are not willing to make such investments. (cid:129) The selection of different fuels to blend could be important for operational considerations and could undermine the economics. (cid:129) Uncertainties can arise about what could be expected, as operational problems introduce high risk levels not acceptable to companies. (cid:129) Uncertainties associated with the cost of dif- ferent fuels could dissuade companies to use them. (cid:129) The environmental benefits of establishing a new chain of fuel supply are still not well understood. (cid:129) There is a lack of information about the synergy between different fuels to achieve high pro- ductivity during energy production. (cid:129) The use of biomass and wastes for electricity production is technically possible, but efficien- cies are low compared with more traditional systems, especially for smaller plants: there is a need for policies to provide incentives. (cid:129) There is a lack of environmental impact studies for multi-fuel systems, due to a shortage of information about the environmental conse- quences. O B J E C T I V E S C O P O W E R Synergy Effects of Co-processing of Biomass with Coal and Non-toxic Wastes for Heat and Power Generation 72 The proposed study aims at determining the limits of optimised operation that could be beneficial in disposing of waste and promoting biomass for energy in an environmentally acceptable way. Fluidised bed systems are particularly well suited for such a co-firing operation, because of their versatility with regard to fuel. The important output of the proposed work would be that biomass and wastes would be used in co-firing applications, thus enhancing the prospect for wide range of availability of the co-fuel. It has still to be demonstrated that some combinations of, for example, biomass with a certain waste could have specific advantages, either for the combustor performance or for the flue gas cleaning, or for ash behaviour. The integration of biomass with its whole supply chain into a multi-fuel-based nationwide heat and energy supply system is also comprehensively investigated for Portugal, Italy and Turkey. (cid:129) The economics of the whole supply chain for energy have yet to be demonstrated on a full commercial scale. (cid:129) The social acceptance of the co-firing concept using multi-fuels has still to be demonstrated, as there is a great need for a detailed environ- mental analysis, management and communi- cation towards local and neighbouring populations to control possible negative reactions.

(cid:129) To assess the fluidised bed co-firing potential to deal with the types of fuels to be considered, evaluating the process requirements to improve the combustion of the different blends of fuels to be used. (cid:129) To perform a complete environmental impact assessment and LCA of the product from data to be obtained, thus assessing the socio-economic impact of the co-firing in large-scale power plants. (cid:129) To collect data and provide knowledge for engineering to optimise the whole of the supply-to-energy-production chain by cor- rectly applying the synergic combinations of multi-fuel use (cid:129) To assess the applicability of the proposed system in other EU countries as well as in developing countries. Progress to Date The project has six work packages and WP 1 has been completed at the end of the first year, as planned. WP 2 is about to finish, and WP 3 will last until the end of the project\u2019s combustion studies and is hence currently ongoing. WP 4 is progressing in accordance with the original plan. WP 5 has just started. WP6 is the coordination, which is ongoing. ",
        "Challenges To develop the market for solid biofuels within the EU, European standards are urgently needed. At the moment several \u2018Technical Specifications\u2019 (or pre-standards) are available which have to be upgraded to European standards within the next three years. But industrial applications have shown that there are still considerable gaps in knowledge and that additional information has to be integrated. Against that background, the goal of the BioNorm II project is to support the ongoing standardisation efforts, especially for the devel- opment of improved solid biofuel specifications (concerning specifications given by the combustion unit???) and rules for conformity of the products with their specified requirements. To achieve this, the following aspects will be addressed within this project in detail: (cid:129) Development of sampling and sample reduc- tion methods for further materials as well as sampling plans (cid:129) Improvement of existing reference test methods (cid:129) Development of new reference test methods (cid:129) Development of rapid on-site test methods (cid:129) Development of improved quality measures, especially adapted to solid biofuels. Additionally the results of this pre-normative work will be transferred directly into the ongoing standardisation process to allow for the deve - lopment of improved European Standards and acceptable Technical Specifications. Project Structure The work packages of BioNorm II and their inter- dependencies are shown below. WP0, the project management part, has not been included in this diagram since it is in the nature of this work pack- age that it interacts with all other work packages. Expected Results Against the background of the above- mentioned challenges, it is the aim of the BioNorm II project to carry out pre-normative research in the field of solid biofuels in close collaboration with the work of CEN TC 335 \u2018Solid Biofuels\u2019. O B J E C T I V E S B I O N O R M I I Boosting the Energetic Use of Biomass by Standardisation 74 The development of European standards is seen as a major driver to expand the market for and the use of solid biofuels. This expansion is needed to fulfil the aims defined within the European Commission\u2019s White Paper on renewable energy, the directive on \u2018green\u2019 electricity from renewable energy and the European Biofuel Directive, as well as various political goals at the national level. As a result the European Commission had already given a mandate a couple of years ago to CEN, the European Standardisation Organisation, to develop standards for solid biofuels. A Technical Committee \u2013 CEN TC 335 \u2018Solid Biofuels\u2019 \u2013 was founded by CEN to develop such standards. Against this background the aim of the BioNorm II project is it to carry out pre-normative research in the field of solid biofuels, in close collaboration with the work of CEN TC 335 \u201cSolid Biofuels\u2019. Due to the wide range of standards to be devel- oped by CEN TC 335, this project will focus on aspects urgently needed by the industry to increase the markets for solid biofuels where significant pre-normative R&D effort is required. The specific aims of the different work packages are as follows: WP 1 \u2018Sampling, sample reduction and sample planning\u2019 The objective of WP I is to provide essential information to CEN TC 335 \u201cSolid Biofuels\u201d about three aspects of sampling of solid biofuels: (cid:129) The size and number of increments to be taken from a wider range of material-types than was covered in the recently completed BioNorm project. (cid:129) The most appropriate systems for reducing those samples to test-portions. (cid:129) The best location(s) in typical production processes at which to take samples, and the appropriate frequency of sampling and testing, again for a wide range of solid biofuels. Task I.1 of WP I of BioNorm II will extend the work of the BioNorm I project on increments and sample reduction by applying broadly the same methodology to a second selection of materials and test methods, including solid biofuels that are specially relevant for Southern Europe (e.g. agricultural residues from the production and processing of olives and grapes), as well as some others that are of general interest across the EU (other kinds of wood chips and bark). Task I.2 of WP I covers a subject not considered in the recently completed BioNorm project, i.e. matching the location and frequency of sampling and testing to the variance of the materials in real time. WP 2 \u2018Test procedures\u2019 In several areas concerning the test methods for solid biofuels, the European standardisation process cannot continue without pre-normative work. This applies to both reference test methods and rapid tests. PRE-NORMATIVE RESEARCH AND CO-ORDINATION ACTIVITIES ",

Such definitions had been included in the business plan of CEN TC 335 \u2018Solid Biofuels\u2019, but their elaboration had to be postponed due to the lack of suitable testing methods and the relevant basic experience. It is the objective of Task II.1 to develop and test appropriate measuring technologies for both parameters. Rapid test methods The very successful basic research, method development and method evaluation carried out in the recently completed BioNorm project led to a number of drafts of CEN Technical Specifications for the determination of chemical parameters in solid biofuels. During this pre-normative R&D work, questions arose that need to be clarified before the Technical Specifications can be transformed into European Standards. Furthermore, additional rapid test methods are necessary to decrease analyses costs and to obtain necessary information much faster. Currently, the available methods are not suffi- ciently developed for the characterisation of biofuels with low sulphur and low chlorine con- tent. The proposed research will improve the methods accordingly. Additionally, the methods will be extended to apply to the determination of bromine and iodine in biofuels. These elements are currently completely neglected. WP 3 \u2018Quality measures procedures\u2019 To allow for an increase of the market for solid biofuels, a steady fulfilling of required fuel spe - cification of a defined product quality is essential. The specification of the fuel (according to a standard or specific needs defined by a certain plant) should be the result of an agreement between one operator and the next operator within the overall supply chain. The next operator should be considered as the customer of the previous one. Specifications can also be estab- lished according to anticipated market demands, whereas the specification is often a combination of customer requirements, market demands and the operator\u2019s preconditions. Against this background WP III focuses on: (cid:129) Quality planning (Task III.1) (cid:129) Quality improvement (Task III.2) (cid:129) Quality policy (Task III.3) resulting in procedures and methodologies which give operators throughout the overall provision chain valuable information about the following aspects: (cid:129) Most appropriate technical and managerial quality measures. (cid:129) Most appropriate test methods for quality control of different biofuels at different posi- tions within the different supply chains applied. (cid:129) Most effective procedure to improve the fuel quality considering both the use of potentials for improvement as well as cost effects in the light of quality improvement. (cid:129) Guidance on how to deal in practice with inter- actions of quality assurance, quality control, quality planning and quality improvement, and further management aspects. This should result in the development of a management tool for companies dealing with solid biofuels. WP 4 \u2018Biofuel specifications\u2019 Biofuels are specified by some key properties, e.g. moisture content, particle size and ash content. Such key properties could be for wood pellets, e.g. the diameter, the average length including the degree to which this length might vary, the maximum allowed share of fines (i.e. wood powder), and the maximum ash content. But for the time being only aspects resulting from the fuel supply chain have been considered. This does not reflect the needs of industry fully since the requirements set by the end-use technology (i.e. the combustion or gasification unit) also have to be taken into consideration. In small-scale combustion units, fuel quality has a great influence on the emission levels of combustion; it is therefore essential to determine limit values of the properties for different type of units by combustion tests.

        "Challenges Bioenergy has the potential to provide the largest share of renewable energy sources in Europe. The use of bioenergy has to be increased significantly if the goals of the EC on security of supply and environmental drivers are to be met. To allow bioenergy to reach its full potential, key barriers must be resolved: the challenge is to identify and address key RTD needs that can help overcome the barriers to the expansion of the bioenergy market. Integration in bioenergy R&D, in addition to new technology and business concepts, is needed, and the Bioenergy NoE has to respond to the demands of the EC and industry. The critical tasks will be to: (cid:129) Support generation of new bioenergy oppor- tunities through improved RTD capabilities. (cid:129) Back up and influence policies and legislation. (cid:129) Enhance knowledge-sharing, education and mobility. The mission is to create a \u2018Virtual Bioenergy RTD Centre\u2019 that exploits the capabilities of the partners in building a thriving and successful bioenergy sector in Europe. Project Structure Bioenergy NoE is a partnership of eight leading institutes in bioenergy RTD from across Europe and is coordinated by VTT, Finland. In 2004-2005, activities were carried out within Work Packages (WPs): Integration Activities 1-8, Spreading of Excellence (SEA), Jointly Executed Research (JER), and Coordination. The initial joint programme of activities and the integration structure was based on the detailed integration areas (Figure 1). O B J E C T I V E S N O E - B I O E N E R G Y The Network of Excellence \u2018Overcoming Barriers to Bioenergy\u2019 76 The aim of the Bioenergy NoE is to identify and address key RTD needs that can help overcome barriers to the expansion of bioenergy markets in Europe. To overcome these barriers, development of the entire chain from resource base to end-use markets has to be considered. A significant increase in the use of bioenergy cannot take place without the involvement of industry and, as a result, such a desired increase can be viewed in terms of business opportunities. The primary objective is to integrate partner activities to create a \u2018Virtual Bioenergy RTD Centre\u2019 and to develop a deep and durable integration, to be extended beyond the period of Community financial support. Interaction with other European public R&D instruments will also be encouraged. Each partner has its area of expertise and initial responsibility coordinated within the NoE. The mapping of partners\u00b4 activities, together with the subsequent barrier analysis and RTD goal definitions carried out within the WPs, will provide the basis for final integration with JER activities. A new WP structure was implemented in 2006. It is based on those industrial sectors in which bio energy plays a role and future business opportunities may be identified. The WP structure will be built upon the initial work, JER project ini- tiatives, identified strategic drivers including key EC directives, and identified market opportunities. The RES-E, Biofuels, Emissions Trading and Land - fill Directives are the most essential of the key drivers and market opportunities within the area. Expected Results The expected principal result at the end of the five-year period is an integrated R&D structure, a \u2018Virtual Centre of Excellence\u2019 that will influence the implementation of the main EC directives and the expansion of R&D and business opportunities in the bioenergy area in Europe. A considerable increase in the use of bioenergy cannot occur without the participation of industry. Therefore the intended increase has to be analysed in terms of business opportunities. The integration was initially intended to focus on the non-technical barriers. During the second phase, the target will be to activate and carry out a JER phase and to plan the integration structure. During the final phase, the focus will be on executing the integration. After the mapping of partner activities and barrier analysis with RTD goals definition, integration will proceed with the planning and establishing of JER projects. Integration will take place in practice through common NoE projects, which will be funded outside the current NoE framework, resulting in the preparation of integrated projects and identi - fication of market opportunities and industry needs.

        "Project Information 77 Integration is also expected to result in wide human mobility, researcher exchange, and education and training among the partners. Interaction with other European public R&D instruments, such as the ERANET Bioenergy and Research Infrastructure, will be a target. European Technology Platforms for the 7th Framework Programme are examples of initiatives in which NoE can also have an active role. Progress to Date Initial mapping of partners\u00b4 RTD activities The mapping exercise on RTD activities of the partners was carried out and completed in 2004, and has been since analysed and reviewed. The mapping report provides a solid foundation that will determine the future work of the NoE. The analysis shows that there is comprehensive coverage of all the identified bioenergy topics with an overall high level of complementarity in most areas. There are clearly some areas of overlap but often at different scales of operation and with different objectives, and early integration attempts will focus on these areas. There is also an extensive range of facilities and expertise within the consortium that permits almost every aspect of bioenergy systems to be studied, from fundamental science and technology R&D to system analysis. Detailed information on the capabilities and capacities of partners can be found on their websites, which can be accessed from the NoE website, www.bioenergynoe.com Barriers to market introduction and the definition of RTD goals Identification and analysis of barriers to bioenergy and the definition of RTD goals have been carried out within the different WPs. A uniform approach was created for the barrier analysis, dividing the expected barriers into the following categories: economics, legislation, technology, biomass supply, sustainability and social aspects. Most of the main barriers to the increase in bioenergy utilisation relate to these topics. The Bioenergy NoE covers almost the entire field of bioenergy, from production to use. The barrier analyses carried out within the WPs resulted, as expected, in a wide variety of non-technical and technical barriers. The overall impression is that the non-technical barriers dominate, and economic barriers are the most prominent ones. However, no single barrier stands out as the most impor- tant; it is the interaction of many barriers that impedes the rapid expansion of bioenergy use. Insufficient availability of low-cost biomass feedstock has been seen as a major barrier in most areas, except biowaste-to-energy applications. There might be competition for biomass resources in large-scale applications, e.g. forest industry and liquid biofuel production. Furthermore, competition for land use is discussed in terms of energy crops. The price structure of biomass is influenced by local, national and European policy issues, environmental and energy taxes as well as supporting and legislative instruments. As well as non-technical barriers, a large number of technology-related barriers were identified within the different areas of bioenergy. Even omitting the economic barriers and biomass availability constraints, technical barriers were considered critical in introducing novel production and utilisation technology, e.g. in the area of transportation biofuels. A whole-chain approach and demonstration were emphasised in most WPs. R&D work was suggested to overcome a wide variety of technical barriers related to individual ",
        "process steps within production and utilisation schemes. The RTD goals identification of JER topics and proposal preparation is currently in progress within the WPs. The next step is to prioritise com- mon topics and proposals regarding integration benefits and business opportunities.

The integration structure based on business sectors scenario has been proposed as the most con- structive approach. The second 18-month period starting in 2006 is built upon this approach. The final structure of integration can be established only after the RTD goals and RTD market oppor- tunities have been analysed in detail and major common JER initiatives have been launched. The NoE interaction with other European public R&D instruments, such as the Technology Platforms, ERANET Bioenergy, and IP projects, has been addressed. The NoE partners have representatives in the Forest Industry and Biomass for Road Transport Platforms. A summary of the NoE activities for the first three years is schematically presented in Figure 3. Spreading of Excellence SEA has developed a communication plan that provides a coherent programme of internal and external communications targets for the life of the project. For the first 18 months, the target audience was the EC, as well as NoE partners and researchers, in order to promote a strong corporate identity and build a sound foundation for future integration. After this period, the target audience will be expanded to include other govern mental organisations across Europe, the PRE-NORMATIVE RESEARCH AND CO-ORDINATION ACTIVITIES ",

Two annual NoE researchers\u00b4 meetings have been organised, the first at FZK in Karlsruhe in 2004 and the second at ECN in Petten 2005. During the first phase, nine joint project proposals were submitted to the 6th Framework Programme. Coordination All partners have a representative in the Bioenergy NoE board which meets about five times a year. A coordination team participates in the preparation of material for the board meetings. Email, phone, and the eMeeting system have been the main means of communication for the team. A password-protected document manage- ment system and web-based eMeeting platform have been established to enhance NoE researcher communication. A financial support structure has been established to catalyse researcher exchange and mobility and joint application initiatives. Several research exchange visits have been organised, and JER projects were started in 2005. Highlights of Results The mapping of partners\u2019 RTD activities carried out in 2004 provides a solid foundation for future work. Identification and analysis of barriers to bioenergy and definition of RTD goals were carried out in the WPs as a well-defined task and resulted in the pinpointing of a wide variety of non- technical and technical barriers. The integration process has continued through the planning of jointly executed projects. A new WP structure driven by policy and business opportunities was developed and implemented in 2006. A commu- nication plan for internal and external targets was developed, a Bioenergy NoE newsletter was established, and a website was created. Several researcher exchange visits have been organised.

        "Challenges The promotion of renewable energy has an important part to play in redefining the European strategy in the energy sector. Since 1997, the EU has been working towards the ambitious target of a 12% share of renewable energy in gross inland consumption by 2010. In 1997 the share of renewable energy was 5.4% and by 2001 it had reached 6%. Bio-energy already provides 64% of all renewable energy sources (RES) of the European Union, thus leading the way for a sustainable pattern of energy gen- eration. Despite the advances already gained in the bio-energy sector, the overall development lags far behind the goals fixed in the White Paper of the European Commission. According to this document, the contribution of bio-energy should increase from 45 Mtoe in 1995 to 135 Mtoe in 2010. However, it will not be possible for the EU-15 to achieve such targets alone, due to the scarce national biomass resources existing in some countries (e.g. the Netherlands). Today, the inclusion of ten new Member States gives the opportunity for reaching the European goals, since the new Member States bring to the EU a significant bio-energy potential. The new Member States provide additional potential for the development of biomass energy such as huge and unexploited biomass resources, surplus of agricultural production, opportunities for energy crops, adoption of EU Directives and a strong agricultural lobby. However the prevailing energy system is characterised by a presence of large quantities of fossil fuels available for energy purposes, which has resulted in a more or less fully fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure. Due to this situation, the implementation of stand-alone biomass-based power technologies in this region will not be enough to provide the bio-energy demand. Consequently, biomass co-firing in already existing coal-fired power plants is one of the most feasible bio-energy options. Project Structure The coordination activities are implemented through two different processes, classified as work packages and expert groups. The work packages (WPs) will be accomplished by all members of the consortium who will work together on specific tasks in line with their O B J E C T I V E S N E T B I O C O F Co-ordination Platform to Promote European Co-operation in Biomass Cofiring 80 NETBIOCOF will promote European cooperation between research organisations devoted to the research, development and application of biomass co-firing in new and existing power plants. It will aim for the integration and unification of efforts and the exchange of knowledge and expertise between West and East Europe to promote the development and uptake of innovative methods and technologies and expand the use of biomass co-firing. A biomass co-firing expert platform and a coordination platform will be established in order to coordinate and assess ongoing research and to develop suitable assessment activities, with the aim of identifying best practices, gaps in knowledge and barriers to further execution, as well as proposing strategies of implementation and directions for future research. expertise and suitability. The Expert Groups (EGs) are an advisory and active body composed of specialists in each biomass co-firing field who, besides accomplishing the scientific and technical counselling and monitoring tasks, will discuss hot topics and deliver publishable reports. The diverse activities and tasks are divided into 7 WPs, each associated with a key objective. WP 1 \u2018Evaluation of current State-of-the-Art and identification of best practices\u2019 WP 1 starts at the beginning of the project and aims to collect relevant information about current state-of-the-art, successful experiences and applications of biomass co-firing in the various relevant areas (biomass production, pre-treatment and supply, thermal conversion and energy use). This work package will also allow the identification of best practices throughout the region, focusing on the potential of Central and Eastern European countries for the extended implementation of this renewable source. WP 2 \u2018Assessment of on-going research and identification of gaps in knowledge\u2019 WP 2 identifies the research and development inst itutions and organisations throughout the region, in order to map current activities, in particular in the Central and Eastern European countries. Additionally the work performed within task 32 of the IEA Bioenergy Action will be taken into account. WP 3 \u2018Identification of barriers of implementation\u2019 WP 3 will process the information gathered in previous steps in order to evaluate the current status of biomass co-firing at a laboratory and practical level, and to identify technical and non-technical barriers to its extended application at the European level, in particular in the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs). A list of requirements for the co-firing technology for further application in Europe, especially in the CEECs, will be compiled.

Among the most important activities covered by this work package will be the task of identifying and shaping European research clusters in biomass co-firing, making recommendations for future research and development, creating and managing a database platform, and organising staff secondments. WP 5 \u2018Proposal of strategies for implementation\u2019 The development of this working package will be a key process in completing NETBIOCOF goals, since it will be the format by which discussion and evaluation of biomass co-firing perform- ance and suitability in targeted countries is undertaken. The outcome of this work package will be a list of scientific, technological, legal, socio- economic and cooperation strategies to promote the use of biomass co-firing. WP 6 \u2018Dissemination and Exploitation\u2019 WP 6 will bring to the general public and relevant stakeholders the knowledge gathered through the coordination of efforts, by developing a website, presentations, workshops, publications and the final conference. WP 7 \u2018Project management\u2019 WP 7 is involved with the management of the project and is responsible for all of the other work packages. Each expert group is led by two members (one from West Europe, the other from the CEECs) with vast experience in the field, who will guarantee the complementation and fluent exchange of knowledge between the participants. The expert groups have been defined in line with the process chain of biomass co-firing in the following way: EG 1: Biomass resources (Leaders SLU and EAU) EG 2: Biomass supply and pre-treatment (Leaders: VTT and NYME) EG 3: Biomass co-firing technologies (CIEMAT and SEC) EG 4: Energy use (Lk-Stmk and TUS) Expected Results The overall objective of NETBIOCOF is to establish a biomass co-firing expert and coordination platform at an integrated European level, as well as a network of expertise that will encourage unification of efforts to develop biomass co- firing, by highlighting the future research and the required synergies needed to make the tech- nology a reliable, safe, available and durable source of energy. The principal outputs expected from NETBIOCOF are: (cid:129) A better co-ordinated European research and development integrated activity in biomass co-firing (cid:129) The establishment of defined European expert groups in the biomass co-firing field (cid:129) A network website and database platform (cid:129) Clear action guidelines for future research and development in biomass co-firing (cid:129) A set of strategies for the extended use of biomass co-firing to overcome the current barriers. These clear outputs from the establishment of the NETBIOCOF network aim to have specific impact in the European Union, as well as in other Central and Eastern European countries. Progress to Date The NETBIOCOF project is approximately at the halfway stage. The tasks related to the preliminary state-of-the-art review and mapping of current research activities have been completed: the identification of best practices and technical and non-technical barriers is now being carried out. The consortium has produced informative project leaflets and distributed them among its network of contacts. The webpage has been running since the first month of the project, hosting a powerful online database which contains information on biomass co-firing provided by the partners, as well as the public project deliverables.

        "Challenges The integration of wind power into the national or EU energy supply systems is becoming relatively more problematic with increasing installed capacity and production, especially due to a mismatch of supply and demand of energy. The wind energy is produced at rather random times, whereas the energy use pattern shows distinct demand peaks during day time and office hours and low levels during the night. The random production of wind energy cannot easily be accommodated on the grid by switching on and off conventional energy suppliers, like coal fired power plants. This would lead to an increase of CO 2 emissions, rather than the reduction of CO 2 emissions which is desired. In order to accommodate the random production of wind energy in the grid, it is desirable that alternative (renewable and conventional) elec- tricity producers balance out the difference between production of wind energy and electric- ity demand. The Night Wind project aims to store wind energy produced at night in refrigerated warehouses, and to release this energy during daytime peak hours. The concept underlying Night Wind makes use of existing technology, extended with novel control strategies. These are needed to set the temperature in refrigerated warehouses to a level that reflects O B J E C T I V E S N I G H T W I N D Storage of Wind Energy in Cold Stores 84 Night Wind addresses the following strategic objectives: integrating renewable energy resources into the European energy service network by providing new facilities for energy storage, increasing the economic value of wind energy by providing means to deliver the energy at peak demand hours, and increasing the competitiveness of SME Cold Storage facilities by providing adding \u2018energy storage\u2019 as an additional service to be provided for the European energy service network. The overall impact is that the project will offer a solution to integrate wind energy with energy storage in the European electrical grid, giving space to a further growth in the use of wind energy worldwide and a contribution to the Kyoto targets at the same time. the balance between wind energy production and actual electricity demand. This is the case for \u2018island operation\u2019, with delivery of surplus energy to the grid, and also for Distributed Energy Resources (DER) where windmills are physically located elsewhere than (existing) cold stores, but controlled in an interdependent way to support the European energy service network. Design of control strategies, with the help of powerful simulation tools, will be the main task of the Night Wind project. Project Structure The research stage of the project includes the following topics: (cid:129) Potential, economic & trade aspects of Wind Power DER + Cold Store DSM (cid:129) Design and modelling of infrastructures for island operation of Wind Energy + Cold Store DSM (cid:129) Control concepts and algorithms for Wind Energy + Cold Store DSM grid integration (cid:129) Quality preservation of frozen products during minor temperature fluctuations (cid:129) Legal issues (cid:129) Demonstration and introduction outline plan.

It starts with a kick-off meeting, followed by a phase in which literature will be surveyed and a technical specification established. The benefits of the concept need to be detailed, both the benefits on a macroscopic scale from the European viewpoint of integrating RES with the energy network, and the benefits on a smaller scale for energy distributors, warehouse owners and end-users. It is furthermore necessary to address a number of basic research topics \u2013 such as the effect of temperature fluctuations on the quality of stored refrigerated and frozen products \u2013 before the idea can be demonstrated with minimal risk. The demonstration phase of the project should mark the start of a larger-scale implementation. Therefore, the project will include the preparation of an implementation outline plan, which will be based on the preliminary experiences gained in the demonstration, and will include input from representatives in the sectors that are directly involved in the implementation: the refrigerated warehouse sector and the energy distribution sector.

        "Challenges Climate change is related to the way we generate electricity. As part of the Kyoto effort to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, the European Union has an overall target of 12% of energy (22% electricity) from renewables by 2010. Wind energy is the fastest growing renewable energy source in the European Union. By 2003 more than 28,000 MW of wind energy capacity had been installed in Europe (600 MW offshore). The wave resource in European waters is even larger: 120-190 TWh/year (offshore) and 34-46 TWh/year (nearshore). Yet, despite many research efforts from the 1970s onwards, relatively little installed capacity exists, although prototypes have been developed in many countries. The proposed project seeks to integrate further the wind and wave energy communities to maximise the research effort on resource assessment and to utilise expertise from wind energy short-term forecasting and wave energy resource assessment for optimal planning and operation of offshore energy technology. While some of the project resources go into specialised activities supporting research in the three fields individually (wave power, short-term prediction of wind power, and offshore wakes O B J E C T I V E S P O W \u2019 W O W Coordinating the Prediction of Renewable Offshore Energy Production 86 POW\u2019WOW is a new project trying to harmonise approaches to wave and wind modelling offshore, helping the short-term forecasting and wake research communities by establishing virtual laboratories, offering specialised workshops, and setting up expert groups with large outreach in the mentioned fields. Two Virtual Laboratories, one for offshore wake modelling, the other one for short-term forecasting, will be set up. Two guides on best practices will be written, one on short-term forecasting (bringing the experiences of high wind penetration countries to those with little wind power) and one for wake modelling. In the end, this Coordination Action will also support preparation of further initiatives such as a Network of Excellence or an Integrated Project. behind turbines and wind farms), it shall also be seen how to better integrate the long-term and short-term prediction of offshore energy resources from a modelling standpoint. Project Structure The project is largely structured around three topical work packages, for wave energy (both long-term and short-term), short-term prediction of wind power (both onshore and offshore: long-term prediction of wind resources is only a problem in complex terrain, which is too dissimilar to the other activities to be included here), and wakes behind offshore turbines and wind farms. Two additional work packages deal with man- agement and dissemination activities and future work. The dissemination in the field of short-term forecasting also includes connections to colleagues outside Europe. Expected Results A number of workshops are envisaged in quite specialised areas, usually leading to a document detailing out the progress in the field. One is a cross-cutting workshop with the aim of cross- fertilising the separate approaches in the offshore meteorology community, integrating wind and wave resource modelling. Another workshop is planned on integrating and implementing wake models in short-term forecasts of wind power. A third workshop is already in preparation for October 25, 2006, on the best practice in short-term prediction of wind power, where high-penetration utilities can present their experiences with the day-to-day use of short-term forecasting tools to utilities quite new to the game. The results of this workshop should go into a document detailing the best utility practice in short-term forecasting. In the fields of wave modelling and short-term forecasting, two expert groups are being set up, for support of politics, but also for dissemination activities outside Europe. The expert groups will also identify potential new research topics for funding agencies. One problem hindering progress, especially in the economically sensitive field of offshore wind power but also in wind power in general, is the WIND ",

This will be taken care of by the establishment of two Virtual Laboratories, one for short-term forecasting, the other one for wakes. The idea is, in part, to take some of the cumbersome work of data acquisition out of the research projects themselves and put it here, and in part to have common evaluation criteria and common evaluations of the work, and being able to compare one\u2019s own research with the best (and worst) in the field. This idea is somewhat modelled on two very successful efforts, one being www.winddata.com and the other one the Anemos case studies and bench- marking process. In winddata.com, quality- checked measurement campaigns (of usually short duration) have been put into a central repository in a common data format, so that institutes that have signed up to it can download the data and use it. The data spans 165,000 hours from 57 sites and is used for many different purposes, ranging from resource assessment to structural high-resolution measurements on actual wind turbines for load cases. The other case to model on is the Anemos benchmarking exercise, where in all 11 different models were fed with the same NWP data for six wind farms in Europe. One institute (CENER) did the common evaluation and presented the results in London at the EWEC conference in November 2004. One important aspect of this was the development of a common evaluation procedure and common evaluation criteria, led by IMM. The details of access to data, the potential worries of the data owners (wind turbine data and NWP) about making their data public, and the exact demands for publication from ViLab participants will have to be decided on during setting-up of the ViLab. Progress to Date Currently, the expert groups are established, and work goes on towards establishing the Virtual Laboratories. Also, the first workshop has been announced on the website (powwow.risoe.dk/ BestPracticeWorkshop.htm). It will be held in conjunction with the 6th Workshop on Large-Scale Integration of Wind Power and Transmission Networks for Offshore Wind Farms in Delft (see off- shoreworkshop.org).

        "Challenges In order to realise a significant contribution of wind energy to the global electricity supply (e.g. 20%) in the future, very large wind turbines with an installed power of over 10 MW each, operating as wind \u2018power plants\u2019 (often called wind farms) of several hundreds of megawatts capacity will become necessary. Such machines are not available yet and their design requires the highest possible standards, encompassing complete understanding of external design conditions, availability of materials with extreme strength- to-mass ratios, advanced integrated control and measuring systems, all geared towards the highest degree of reliability. O B J E C T I V E S U P W I N D Finding Solutions to Design Limitations of Large Wind Turbines 88 The objectives of the UpWind project are to achieve a state-of-the-art design methodology for very large wind turbines and to establish the largest turbine dimensions that can be designed reliably. This will be a critical analysis of advances in the following scientific disciplines, with a view to the design of large wind turbines of >10 MW installed power. A review will be made of rotor aerodynamics, aero-elastics, rotor structure and materials, foundations and support structures, control technology, remote sensing, condition monitoring, flow around wind turbine clusters, and the wind power plant/grid interface, followed by the conception of innovative components: rotor blades structure, smart rotor blades incorporating advanced distributed aerodynamic control elements over the blade length, and transmission and electric conversion systems. Project Structure As the project includes many scientific disciplines which need to be integrated in order to arrive at specific design methods, new materials, compo- nents and concepts, the project\u2019s organisation structure is based on work packages (WPs) which variously deal with: scientific research (eight WPs); the integration of scientific results (three WPs); and their integration into technical solutions (four WPs). External communication and the dissemination of project findings are considered essential and therefore have been organised in a separate additional work package (see the figure below). The working methods and organisation structure ensure that scientific research meets industry needs. This will be achieved by letting the inte- gration work packages guide the scientific work packages to a certain extent.

UpWind will, however, develop the accurate, verified tools and some essential component concepts the indus- try needs to design and manufacture this new breed of turbine types. The following examples illustrate not all but some of the most important issues relating to new design tools. UpWind will address the aerodynamic, aero- elastic, structural and material design aspects of rotors. Future wind turbine rotors may have a diameter of over 150 meters. These dimensions are such that the flow in the rotor plane is non- uniform, as a result of which the inflow may vary considerable over the rotor blade. Full blade pitch control will no longer be sufficient. That is why UpWind will investigate local flow control along the blades, for instance by varying the local profile shape. Without associated new control strategies (software), the new control elements \u2013 the hardware side of the issue \u2013 will be useless. Control strategies will be developed in a separate work package. Also critical analysis of drive train components will be carried out in the search for breakthrough solutions. Wind turbines are highly non-linear, reactive machines operating under stochastic external conditions. Extreme conditions may have an impact a thousand times more demanding on, for instance, the mechanical loading than average conditions require. Understanding profoundly these external conditions is of the utmost importance in the design of a wind turbine structure with safety margins as small as possible in order to realise maximum cost reductions. A similar argument applies to the response of the structure to external excitations. In order to make significant progress in this field more accurate, linearly responding measuring sensors and associated software are needed. Preferably the sensors should remain stable and accurate during a considerable part of the operational lifetime of a wind turbine. UpWind will explore measuring methods and will look more in detail into new remote sensing techniques for measuring wind velocities. Two integrating work packages are of particular importance: \u2018Integrated Design & Standards\u2019 and \u2018Up-scaling\u2019. All results from various work packages will serve as an input to assemble an integrated design methodology and to provide inputs to redraft design standards, which in their turn will have a positive impact on certification processes. The work package \u2018Up-scaling\u2019 will explore the maximum dimensions (up to an installed power of 20 MW); the new design methodology allows the designers to conceive new wind turbine structures reliably. The work package \u2018Training & Education\u2019 will, among others, include the new findings of var- ious work packages into training and education curricula. ",
        "Challenges From the tests performed in 2005, it appears that the distribution of natural permeabilities in the deep fractured system of Soultz-type geothermal reservoirs is the leading factor in these wells\u2019 productivity/injectivity potential. Consequently, the quality of the connections developed between the wells and the far-field network of natural permeable fractures is of major interest. The main challenge being both to produce maximum flow rates with minimum pumping power and to get the most possible stable production temperatures, it will be necessary to consider carefully the future role of the inter-wells heat exchanger for EGS operations in the context of Soultz- type systems. Then, interactively with the results of the ongoing investigations and tests, we address the question of the optimisation of the energetic performances of the system (and neutralisation of the associated risk of micro-seismic nuisances) with an appro- priate strategy. From a preliminary general review of the existing technologies that could be used to pump geo - thermal brine at temperatures higher than 175\u00baC, it appears that the two techniques available O B J E C T I V E S E G S - P O W E R P L A N T Enhanced Geothermal Systems: EGS Pilot Plant at Soultz-sous-Forets, France 90 The Soultz project is a long-term research project aiming at developing a new kind of geothermal energy. The Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) principle aims to extract the heat contained in deep-seated rock (between 3000 and 6000 m) by circulating water through a large-capacity natural geothermal reservoir/heat exchanger. This can be created by hydraulic and/or chemical stimulation of the permeability of natural fractures in hydrothermally active regions where deep rocks are permeable enough for the temperature to increase with depth more quickly than normal, due to regional deep water convective loops (200\u00baC at about 5000 m depth at Soultz). today on the market of conventional geothermal practise (oil-lubricated line-shaft pumps and hydraulic drive systems) have rather severe limi- tations. For this reason, the EEIG \u2018Heat Mining\u2019 project developed a programme for submersible pumps and line-shaft pump testing. For down-hole pumps the main problem will be to adapt their equipment to temperatures of the pumped fluid that are higher than present limits (175\u00baC), while for line-shaft pumps the main problem will be to increase the maximum setting depth of the pumps and to check their tolerances with regard to the linearity of the pumping chamber. The most challenging questions today are related to corrosion and scaling risks, due to the geo - thermal fluid chemical composition. Project structure The EEIG \u2018Heat Mining\u2019 project is in charge of general on-site management, operations and partner coordination. Its Supervisory Board controls a management team that includes one represen- tative of each funding member of the EEIG. Management is supported by a scientific coor - dination team and by an operations management team. The scientific partners and the EEIG are associated within a Consortium Agreement, and most of the scientific partners are also associated within the framework of EHDRA (European Hot Dry Rock Association). Expected results At termination of the present phase it is expected to have on-site at Soultz an operational pilot plant functioning on the basis of 70 to 100 l/s of permanent brine production at a temperature close to 185\u00baC. It will be able to produce up to 5 MWe, a part of which will be used for pumping and servicing the peripherals (lighting, surface pumping, cooling, etc.).

        "Challenges Large wavelength thermal anomalies are charac- terised at the scale of Europe and within ultra- peripheric regions (Caribbean Island, Canaries) and constitute a source of energy potentially available throughout Europe. However, the use of geothermal energy is limited by the fact that it relies on the relatively uncommon geological concurrence of rocks being simultaneously water-bearing, hot and permeable, and lying at economically accessible depths. Different ways have been tested or are imagined for enhancing and broadening geothermal energy reserves which can be classified into unconventional geothermal resources, i.e. mainly enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and supercritical reservoirs: (cid:129) Stimulating reservoirs in hot dry rock systems. (cid:129) Enlarging the extent of productive geothermal fields by enhancing/stimulating permeability in the vicinity of naturally permeable rocks. (cid:129) Enhancing the viability of current and potential hydrothermal areas by stimulation technology and improving thermodynamic cycle. (cid:129) Defining new targets and new tools for reaching supercritical fluid systems, especially high- temperature down-hole tools and instruments. (cid:129) Improving drilling and reservoir assessment technology. (cid:129) Improving exploration methods for deep geothermal resources.

Major cost reduction must be accomplished to achieve the objectives of the EU for the use of renewable energies. The development of unconventional geothermal resources may also be linked in an \u2018unconventional\u2019 way to other industrial activities such as CO 2 storage or hydrogen production. In parallel, the environ- mental and social aspects of the development of geothermal energy are of great importance as the image of this renewable and sustainable energy must be improved, not only in terms of awareness of decision-makers, but also of acceptance by the general public.

A Best Practice Handbook and the definition of innovative concepts for the investigation, reservoir assessment and exploitation of geo - thermal energy will constitute the deliverables of this work. It will include a technical and socio-economic risk evaluation for the develop ment of geothermal energy in Europe. Phase 1 \u2013 Integration This integration of scientific and technical know-how and practices will provide an updated framework of activities concerning geothermal energy in Europe. It will cover all initiatives and bottlenecks encountered during the investigation of EGS and unconventional geothermal resources, drilling, stimulation and reservoir assessment and exploitation, economic, environmental and social impacts. For each of these work packages, the coordination work will be aimed at (cid:129) presenting the state-of-the-art (cid:129) defining the most appropriate scientific and technological approaches (cid:129) identifying the main gaps, barriers and unsolved questions (cid:129) analysing how such know-how and procedures can be transferred and bottlenecks overcome. The economic factor and the cost-effectiveness of each scientific and technological approach will be systematically considered. The deliverables will main- ly consist of publications providing access to the conclusions of these integration activities and, in particular, to the state-of-the-art. Phase 2 \u2013 Synthesis Four groups of experts will perform an evaluation of the best practices and innovative concepts to be adopted on the different types of activities. Risk evaluation for the development of geothermal energy is aimed at synthesising the main scientific and technical aspects, as well as economic and environmental constraints, resulting from the different expert groups. Deliverables will include a Best Practice Handbook and the definition of innovative concepts for geothermal investigation, reservoir stimulation and assessment and exploitation. A scientific and technical European Reference Manual for the development of unconventional geothermal resources will finally present this Best Practice Handbook and will include all pub- lications, information, metadatabases, databases and models collected and compiled during the integration phase of the co-ordination action. Expected results The main potential impact expected from the coordination action is to reestablish the institu- tional and political support essential to ensure that geothermal energy reaches its full efficiency and profitability thresholds on a European scale. It is necessary to sensitise the geothermal-energy community to the task of defining innovative research projects. The emergence of such projects requires a capitalisation of the knowledge of the different actors currently playing in the geo - thermal field; this implies sharing experience, exchanging best practices and clearly identifying the gaps and barriers. The expected impact of this coordination action is that a large scientific research community will be mobilised that is able to promote such spin-off projects with industrial partners. The coordination action also intends to play a transmission role and constitute an information exchange platform. It will provide an opportunity to integrate and synthesise all information about know-how, practices, innovations and barriers at the level of the steering committee and expert groups. This knowledge will be disseminated and made available through the information and publication systems, and should increase the interest of other potential scientific and industrial partners. The dissemination will also contribute to the transfer of knowledge towards those requiring more information about the technical and socio-economic know-how for developing the geothermal industry, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. This could speed up the exploitation of both conventional and unconventional geo - thermal resources in these countries and thus contribute considerably to the short- and long- term goals of the EU of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by increasing the share of renewable energy. Progress to date The kick-off meetings of the steering committee and executive group were held in Potsdam on 10-11 November 2006. Further information on progress to date can be obtained on the website http://engine.brgm.fr, where access is provided to the contents of the launching conference that was held in Orl\u00e9ans on 12-15 February 2006. A provisional schedule of workshop and conferences is presented where partners can register and contribute on-line. ",
        "Challenges Over the last few decades, increasing concerns have been directed towards the world\u2019s hydro- carbon energy usage with eventual supply shortfalls and harmful environmental impact. Geothermal renewable energy has been considered one of the major alternatives in the near and distant future. Efficient use of existing geothermal fields and higher energy yields from new sources are seen as priority issues. Recently, ideas to radically improve power extraction from geothermal boreholes have been put forward. A ten-fold increase in power production has been predicted theoretically when drilled from the conventional 3 km to unconventional 5 km depth in Icelandic geothermal regions. An ongoing project, code-named IDDP (Iceland Deep Drilling Project), is being funded by major local power companies with cooperation from European and international societies. For the first time, the scientific community will also be able to study a hydrothermal reservoir at supercritical temperatures. Supercritical fluids have higher enthalpy than steam produced from two- phase systems. Large changes in physical pro - perties near the critical point can lead to extremely high flow rates, resulting in the projected ten-fold increase in turbine power production relative to conventional production. The main objective of this project, and its greatest challenge, is to develop sensors and methods to accurately determine the existing conditions of the reservoir and fluids in situ at the base of a deep geothermal system. As well as investigating super- critical phenomena, drilling in this environment can address a wide range of scientific questions related to, for example, the origin of black smokers along mid-ocean ridges and the deposit of hydrothermal ores. Deep drilling has been achieved previously with a world-record depth of 13 km in Kola, Russia. Drilling in geothermal areas up to supercritical temperatures has also been demonstrated in Kakkonda, Japan, reaching 500\u00b0C at a depth of 3.7 km. Other reports of near-supercritical temperatures include a well site in Larderello, Italy, at 400\u00b0C and Nesjavellir, Iceland, exceeding 380\u00b0C. These wells were not designed to utilise the extreme temperatures and pressures for electricity production. O B J E C T I V E S H I T I High Temperature Instruments for Supercritical Geothermal Reservoir Characterisation and Exploitation 94 The HITI project is aimed at solving the technological problems associated with the characterisation and production of supercritical geothermal reservoirs. This implies developing down-hole instruments capable of tolerating temperatures over 300\u00b0C, and preferably up to 500\u00b0C, with the following functions: temperature, pressure, fluid and rock electrical resistivity, natural gamma radiation, televiewer acoustic images, casing collar location, casing monitoring, fluid flow, chemical temperature sensing and organic tracers. The main objective of this project, and its greatest challenge, is to develop sensors and methods to accurately determine the existing conditions of the reservoir and fluids in situ at the base of a deep geothermal system. The key parameters to be measured for thermo- dynamic modelling of a reservoir and production evaluation are well-bore fluid parameters: tem- perature (T), pressure (p) and nature (i.e. ionic charge). First of all comes temperature and, for this, three main types of down-hole instruments are being considered by HITI: (cid:129) Wireline instruments, where a cable with electrical wires is constantly connecting the down-hole gauge to a surface computer. (cid:129) \u2018Sick line\u2019 instruments where a metallic wire is used to lower the instrument and the data is gathered on a memory chip inside the instrument, without real-time readout at surface. (cid:129) Monitoring instruments where distributed temperature sensors along a fibre optic cable are installed inside the borehole and quasi- continuous temperature profiles are obtained during all phases of production. In situ reservoir temperatures might also be obtained from Na-Li geothermo meters. These approaches are complementary and should provide a needed cross-calibration. The most appropriate overall approach will be determined as part of the HITI project. Project Structure The consortium consists of the following eight participants: ISOR, CNRS Montpellier, BRGM, Calidus Engineering, ALT, Oxford Applied Technology, GFZ Potsdam and CRES. Two dedicated tool designers and manufacturers are included (CalEng and ALT), all SMEs working on different instrument types. Two research institutes will manage additional instrument design and implementation (BRGM and GFZ), while the third research institute models high-pressure geophysical environment in a dedicated research laboratory (CNRS Montpellier). In situ instrument testing is achieved by one of the applicants (ISOR), in cooperation with the relevant tool builders and technical observers mentioned above. Technical dissemination and market research is provided by two applicants (Oxatec and CRES), each specialising in different dissemination areas (one state-of-the-art electronic technology, the other geothermal market assessment).

High relevance is put on tool development, where most of the budget and man-months are allocated. Expected Results Over the past decades, a large number of advanced down-hole instruments have been developed to meet the demands of the oil industry. Geothermal exploration has greatly benefited from techniques used by the much bigger oil industry and their correspondingly larger research and innovation spending. However, the oil industry rarely encounters temperatures above 150\u00b0C and hardly ever approaching 250\u00b0C. The goal of HITI is to develop and build instruments and methods capable of operating in a reliable manner at 300\u00b0C and potentially above that limit. Marginal demand for such instruments exists from the oil industry, while the geothermal industry is not large enough to pay for such developments. Mechanical tools to measure high temperatures have been used successfully, but are of less quality in the sense that the temperature resolution is low and the measurements are relatively time- consuming. If harnessing supercritical geothermal systems proves successful, the demand for down-hole instruments at temperatures envisaged by HITI will go up dramatically. On such occasions, European companies will be able to provide both instruments and the experience of using high- temperature down-hole equipment. In summary the overall industrial, societal and scientific impact of the project can be: (cid:129) Increased knowledge on the utilisation of unconventional geothermal wells and reservoir for electricity production (cid:129) Actual evaluation of economic factors (cid:129) Opening new ways to utilise environmentally friendly geothermal energy (cid:129) Reinforcement of European leadership in the design and worldwide sale of high-temperature down-hole instruments (cid:129) Better understanding of the structure and dynamics of hot to supercritical geothermal reservoirs from unprecedented in situ mea - surements and laboratory experiments.

        "Challenges The exploration of geothermal resources aims at the detection and delineation of thermal anomalies and the macroscopic geological structures, such as large-scale permeability or intensely fractured zones, which determine the productivity conditions of the geothermal reservoir. Indeed, many geo - thermal reservoirs are associated with fractures characterised by high permeability, which are quite often heterogeneously distributed. Nowadays the identification of subsurface zones characterised by high temperatures and high temperature gradients is not a major concern, since many methods and tools are available to estimate the temperatures at depth. The major issue, not yet satisfactorily solved, is the detection of fractures and high-permeability zones. More than 30% of exploitation wells worldwide have been drilled into promising targets, in terms of rock formations at high temperature, but lacking sufficient permeability to sustain commercial pro- duction. This percentage of failures significantly increases for exploration wells. The search for high-permeability zones is not limited to geothermal exploration, but is equally important for hydrocarbon exploration and the detection of deep aquifers. However, a unique challenge to geothermal exploration is posed by the rock environment of geothermal reservoirs. The salinity of geothermal fluids is usually high and temperatures are close to the liquid/steam transition point. High temperature and fluid salinity potentially change rock transport properties even during production. The behaviour of rocks with increasing pressure and temperature has been studied by many laboratory measure- ments and seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) field tests. However, these peculiar features of geothermal areas have never been studied in detail until now. O B J E C T I V E S I - G E T Integrated Geophysical Exploration Technologies for Deep Fractured Geothermal Systems 96 The I-GET project aims at developing an innovative strategy of geophysical exploration. This strategy integrates all the available knowledge, from rock physics to seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) data processing and modelling, and exploits the full potential of seismic and electromagnetic exploration methods to detect permeable zones and fluid-bearing fractures prior to drilling. The ultimate goal is to minimise the mining risk by developing a method tailor-made for geothermal reservoirs. The proposed geothermal exploration approach is applied in European geothermal systems with different geological and thermodynamic reservoir characteristics: in Italy (high enthalpy, metamorphic rocks), in Iceland (high enthalpy, volcanic rocks) and in Germany and Poland (low-to-middle enthalpy, sedimentary rocks) Project structure The work is subdivided into seven work packages. Four main topics are identified: (cid:129) Construction of a petrophysic a l a nd geome- ch a nic a l d a t a b a se obtained from laboratory experiments on geothermal reservoir rock samples belonging to the various geothermal systems under study. The elastic and electric rock properties at the reservoir condition up to the steam/liquid transition of the pore fill- ings are determined. (cid:129) Field a cquisition a nd d a t a processing of seismic a nd MT field experiments at several test sites. (cid:129) Geotherm a l reservoir numeric a l modelling. Results from (1) and (2) are integrated with the elastic and anisotropic models and with the reservoir engineering well-testing data, in order to verify the presence of fluid-bearing zones inferred from seismic and magnetotelluric experiments. Local 3D models will be built on the basis of field data and laboratory meas- urements, in order to produce the static image of geological structures and identify the fluid- dynamic behaviour of the fracture system from available well tests.

The case studies that are analysed in this project are: (cid:129) The Travale (Italy) geothermal system, where the exploration targets are mainly located in metamorphic and magmatic rocks up to 4000 m depth, characterised by a high degree of heterogeneity and anisotropy and by high temperatures. (cid:129) The Hengill (Iceland) geothermal system, where the exploration targets are mainly located in volcanic centres (up to 2000 m depth), within a rift zone characterised by both porous and fissure-oriented anisotropic permeability. At present, geothermal fluids are mainly mined at a depth of about 2 km, but the ongoing Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) aims at extracting supercritical fluids from a depth of about 4 km. (cid:129) Gro\u00df Sch\u00f6nebeck (Germany) deep sedimentary reservoir, representative of large sedimentary basins all over Europe with a borehole currently used as an in situ geothermal laboratory. (cid:129) Skierniewice (Poland), a prospective geothermal reservoir especially representative of low- enthalpy applications in Eastern and Central Europe. The different case studies require adaptation of existing techniques and methodologies. Advanced petrophysical and geophysical aspects will be applied in the projects, and all data will be integrated. The results will be used as input for static and dynamic numerical models, which will be verified by well data, where available, and compared to existing reservoir models. Expected results The newly developed methodology will be a mile- stone for the future development of geothermal energy. It will represent a fully integrated exploration methodology able to detect favourable prospects, highlight the spatial distribution of petrophysical and geomechanical properties and predict the fluid-dynamic behaviour within a potential reservoir. The result can be applied in reservoir exploration of natural and/or enhanced geo - thermal systems, and in exploration of deep aquifers. ",
        "Challenges Ocean energy can in the future replace a significant part of the fossil fuel used today if the principles for conversion can be successfully demonstrated and put into mass production. Presently only a few systems are being tested on a pre-commercial scale and providing initial practical experience. Within the Co-ordinated Action on Ocean Energy, this new knowledge and the research results emerging on wave and tidal technologies are disseminated, promoted and shared. The partners must agree on definitions, standards in design, costing, and be ready to present the performance results of the systems involved. This approach is expected to provide comparable presentations of different methodologies and accelerate the development of ocean energy systems. Project Structure The Co-ordinated Action on Ocean Energy includes 41 partners from 15 countries. The partners of this co-ordination action are the leading force in the field of ocean energy, while the SME organisations are pioneers on the road to commercialisation of these systems. An additional 20 partners have registered as associates during the first year. The project is organising five interactive work- shops over a three-year project period. The themes for the five workshops are: (cid:129) Numerical modelling and tank testing (cid:129) Components and power take-off (cid:129) Structural design (cid:129) Performance assessment (cid:129) Environmental impact. O B J E C T I V E S C A - O E Ocean Energy, Wave and Tidal Power 98 The main objectives of the Co-ordinated Action on Ocean Energy are to enable cooperation between developers and interested parties in the sector of ocean energy, to promote and disseminate knowledge on ocean energy technologies, to develop a common knowledge base for coherent development R&D policies, to bring a coordinated approach within key areas of ocean energy R&D, and to provide a forum for the longer-term marketing of promising research deliverables. The project also addresses issues like revising and implementing guidelines and standards for monitoring and presenting the performance of ocean energy systems, and guidelines and standards related to safety of structure, personnel and electrical systems. The workshops provide a forum for the different research organisations and the fledgling ocean energy industry to interact and co-ordinate ongoing R&D efforts in the field of wave and tidal energy on a European and international level. New academic knowledge can be shared and disseminated between all interested parties, and promising methodologies and technologies can be transferred to the market. Expected Results The Co-ordinated Action is expected to promote and disseminate promising methodologies and technologies for the conversion of ocean energy into electricity and further generate awareness among a wider public. Frequent workshops attended by the partners involved, combined with exchange of personnel, are expected to generate clusters of research groups that will focus on research activities of common interest: (cid:129) Dissemination and promotion of ocean energy (cid:129) Roadmap for ocean energy development (cid:129) Terminology definitions (cid:129) Folder on ocean energy technologies (cid:129) Establishment of an European Ocean Energy Association.

Group work then followed, and the partners exchanged their experiences in relation to the topic and provided focused input on priorities for further R&D. ",
        "Challenges To arrive at an economically efficient wave energy converter design, and more specifically at an optimised prototype, is a complicated task. Several issues have to be investigated, as there is: (cid:129) A technological risk: although the technology is proven in scale tests, it still has to be proven in full scale in real-sea conditions. (cid:129) A commercial risk: the commercialisation will be dependent on cost-effective production and operation. In order to overcome this, each optimisation found within this project will be tested for its financial viability as part of the whole outcome of this project. (cid:129) A political risk: a commercial development is dependent on political support to introduce new technologies to the market. In the case of renewable energy systems, there is a strongly positive attitude at a European level on promoting renewable energy systems. Project structure The initial work on the FO 3 wave energy converter started in 2001, with the objective of developing a cost-effective and environmentally friendly technology for wave energy conversion. Initial research was conducted at the Department of Mathematics (University of Oslo) and at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. O B J E C T I V E S S E E W E C Sustainable Economically Efficient Wave Energy Converter 100 The general objective of SEEWEC is to assist in the development of a second-generation FO 3 wave energy converter through extensive use of the experience from monitoring a 1:3 laboratory rig (Buldra), the single system test station (SSTS) and a first-generation 1:1 prototype. The project will focus on robust cost-effective solutions and design for large-scale (mass) manufacturing. The long-term objective is to be able to produce electricity at a cost competitive to electricity from other renewable sources. The first step is to become competitive to offshore wind. A project group was established and key patents were filed in 2003. Following conceptual design and theoretical modelling, the general design was developed. A 1:20 scale model of the FO 3 was tested in the wave tank of the Ocean Basin Laboratory of Sintef in Trondheim in early-2004. The scale model was tested both in operational conditions and for survival/extreme sea conditions. The tests confirmed the production concept. The 1:3 laboratory rig (Buldra) started sea trials in February 2005. A single system test station (SSTS) will be monitored from spring 2006 onward. The prototype full-scale first-generation device is planned to be launched by autumn 2007.

Some work packages are initial tasks (preparing and supporting), others are syn- thesising and concluding, the final work package exploiting and disseminating. The core work pack- ages are what can be called scientifically and tech- nologically productive. The SEEWEC consortium involves 11 partners from five EU members (Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the UK) and one associated country (Norway). As a group, the partners have relevant experience of field testing, local sea conditions, material design and development, wave impacts on structures, behaviour and interference of structures in open seas, power conversion systems, manufacturing of materials and marine construction.

        "Challenges The Wave Dragon is an offshore wave energy converter of the overtopping type. The development work is, to a large extent, built on proven techno - logies and Wave Dragon is by far the largest wave energy converter known today. Each unit will have a rated power of 4-11 MW or more, depending on how energetic the wave climate is at the deployment site. In addition to this, Wave Dragon - due to its large size - can act as a floating foundation for MW wind turbines, thus adding a very significant contribution to annual power production at a marginal cost. By using the overtopping principle for energy absorption, there is no upper limit on device size and rated power for Wave Dragon, as opposed to technologies that rely on moving bodies etc. (like buoys, hinged bodies and oscillating water columns) for energy absorption. Wave Dragon\u2019s competitive advantage lies in its scale and hence capital cost: only nine units are required to make a 100 MW power station, compared to 100-1000 units required by most technologies, and the few moving parts improve reliability and reduce maintenance costs. The design simply reapplies a well-proven existing technology that has been around for 80 years. Wave Dragon is essentially a floating hydro- electric dam. Developers of wave energy converters face a series of major challenges: first we have to develop machinery that can operate and survive in this very tough environment and, secondly, we have to optimise operation and maintenance O B J E C T I V E S W A V E D R A G O N Pioneering Technology for Bulk Generation of Wave Power 102 This project will realise the Wave Dragon technology and develop it from the tested all-steel-built 20 kW prototype to a full-size composite-built 4-7 MW unit and, by comprehensive testing, validate its technical and economic feasibility. The RTD part of the project will develop Wave Dragon\u2019s energy-absorbing structure, the low head turbine power take-off system and the control systems; develop cost-effective construction methods and establish the optimal combination of in situ cast concrete, post-stressed reinforcement and pre-stressed concrete elements; develop a cost-effective 250-440 kW hydro turbine system; demonstrate reliable and cost-effective installation procedures and O&M schemes; and establish the necessary basis for design codes/recommendations for offshore multi-MW devices. systems to make wave power plants a viable solution. Wave energy converters have to com- pete with other renewable energy technologies. It has become obvious that wave power can be much cheaper than, for instance, photovoltaic power and there are good reasons to believe that in a few years it will be a serious competitor to offshore wind power. Project structure This project is organised in seven operative work packages, each with clearly defined deliverables: (cid:129) Scaling-up/design \u2013 Development and design of full-size power producing unit and sub- systems (cid:129) Construction, manufacturing and deployment (cid:129) Establishment of monitoring system, operation and maintenance (cid:129) Design parameter analysis (cid:129) Power production and control strategy (cid:129) Life cycle / Environmental Impact Assessment and socio-economic aspects (cid:129) Dissemination and exploitation All the R&D-related work packages are covered by this project. Work package 2 \u2013 construction and deployment \u2013 is funded from other sources. This project will realise the Wave Dragon technolo- gy, developing it from the tested all-steel-built scale 1:4.5 prototype to a full-size composite-built 4-7 MW unit and, by comprehensive testing, validate its technical and economic feasibility. OCEAN The Wave Dragon is a floating device consisting of two parabolic arms that reflects and enlarges waves towards a ramp. Wave energy is absorbed passively by overtopping water that is collected and short-term stored in a reservoir behind the ramp. \u00a9 E a r t h V i s i o n .

All R&D activities in this project will be carried out in relation to a 7 MW Wave Dragon device that will be constructed and deployed off the South-West Welsh coast. During long-term testing in a real-sea environ- ment, the Wave Dragon prototype has progressed to the point where it is now producing electricity 80% of the time. This real-sea testing has also proven its seaworthiness, floating stability and power production potential. Operation of the device in a harsh offshore environment has led to a number of smaller component failures: all of these have been investigated and technical solutions have been found, thus preventing costly (in both time and money) problems from occurring in the future. The work done up to now has confirmed that the performance predicted on the basis of wave-tank testing and turbine model tests will be achieved in a full-scale prototype. This project will develop the technological basis for a commercially viable solution to the bulk generation of renewable power and thus add to Europe\u2019s ability to tackle the problems of security of supply and greenhouse gas emissions. Expected results The quantitative objectives refer to a 24 kW/m wave climate: (cid:129) Higher energy production of each unit to a total of 10 GWh/y, resulting in a total improvement of 12%; where 5% is from improvement by a better control system and 7% is from the new power take-off system. (cid:129) A reduction in the overall installation capacity cost of 5% compared with the state-of-the-art. (cid:129) A reduction in operation and maintenance costs of 5%. The test programme will demonstrate the availability, power production predictability, power production capability and medium-to long- term electricity generation costs at \u20ac 0.052/kWh in a wave climate of 24kW/m, which can be found relatively close to the coast in the major part of the EC Atlantic coast. In a 36kW/m wave climate, the corresponding cost of energy will be \u20ac 0.04/kWh Wave Dragon marks a sig nificant breakthrough towards commercial exploitation of the abundant energy concentrated in ocean waves. Seagoing trials of the Wave Dragon prototype have proven its off shore sur vivability since March 2003 and more than verified the potential for commercial feasibility of large-scale power gene ration below the costs of off shore wind power. Wave Dragon is unique among wave energy converters as it harnesses the energy of waves directly via water turbines in a one-step conversion system and not via moving bodies or air chambers. It is housed in a very simple construction in which, importantly, the turbines are the only moving parts. ",
        "Challenges The main challenge is the development of the innovative and patented multi-stage turbine in order to obtain a high efficiency with the lower- stage 1,5 meter head and to design a seal with low leakage rate and minimum friction. There is also a certain project risk involved in the design and production of prototype components for the multi-stage turbine: these components often need to be changed subsequent to the first series of tests. Therefore workshop testing is planned and a contingency is also allowed for any re-design, re-production and re-testing that may be necessary before the final prototype components are installed in the pilot plant. Project structure In order to carry out the project in a structured manner the following ten work packages are identified: WP 1 Development of surveillance, control and data acquisition system: this WP will be headed by AAU, which has substantial experience in measuring performance data from the Wave Dragon project. WP 2 Design, manufacturing and testing of the turbine: this WP is considered a technical development activity and will be headed by TUM, which has substantial experience in design, testing and verification of turbines. WP 3 Design of generator equipment and SW development: the generator equipment and SW development will need to be tailor- made for the project. Design and SW development work will be technical development activities. GANZ will head the WP and be assisted by IKM with regard to local conditions. O B J E C T I V E S W A V E S S G Full-scale Demonstration of Robust and High-efficiency Wave Energy Converter 104 The main objective of the present project is to operate at full-scale one module of the SSG converter, including turbine, generator and control system, in 19kW/m wave climate. The full-scale technical prototype of the SSG includes three reservoirs for capturing the ocean energy and is constructed as a robust shoreline device. The patented multi-reservoir concept ensures that a variety of waves are utilised for energy production, resulting in a high degree of efficiency. The Kvitsoy municipality has 520 inhabitants and is one of 10,000 islands in Europe where wave energy can quickly be developed into a cost-effective energy production alternative to existing diesel generators. The pilot project features a 10m-wide civil structure module of the SSG which will be completed in 2006. WP 4 Production and testing of generator equipment. WP 5 Installation and commissioning: NTNU will be in charge of the WP and will be assisted by IKM for local installation of the turbine and generator equipment, and ultimate grid connection. WP 6 Long-term testing: WEAS will be in charge of the day-to-day follow-up and supervision of the pilot plant. WP 7 Performance evaluation: AAU will head this activity based on its detailed experience from performance evaluation and follow- up of the Danish Wave Dragon prototype. WP 8 Innovation-related activities. WP 9 Assessment of progress and project results: during the work with the individual WPs, progress reports will be submitted every three months. The proposed steering com- mittee will assess the progress and results every six months and, after 12 months, a design review with decision milestone will be held. WP 10 Consortium management.

        "Challenges Processes using steam as a working medium require isothermal energy storage to reach high thermal efficiency. While the application of latent heat concepts is an obvious solution, no commercial storage system is available today for the temperature range between 200\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C which is relevant for solar steam genera- tion. Even experience from lab-scale latent heat storage units is limited and not sufficient for the design of energy storage systems integrated in the next generation of solar-thermal power plants based on Direct Solar Steam Generation. The dominant problem is the limitation of power resulting from the transport properties of candi- date materials for latent heat storage systems. The values for the heat conductivity of these materials are similar to values characteristic of thermal insulators. Essential for the successful implementation of latent heat storage systems is the development of cost-effective materials and storage design that are able to meet the power requirements. Project Structure The DISTOR project is organised in three conse - cutive phases. The initial phase provides the essential knowledge concerning material research and first physical models describing the storage systems. The boundary conditions O B J E C T I V E S D I S T O R Energy Storage for Direct Steam Solar Power Plants 106 Energy storage is a key issue for successful market implementation of concentrated solar power (CSP) technology. Advanced thermal storage technology based on phase change materials (PCM) has been identified to meet the requirements of solar steam generating plants. Energy storage systems using latent heat have often been proposed, but never carried out on a large scale, due to low thermal conductivity and non-efficient internal heat exchange of salt systems to be used as PCM. The DISTOR approach to solving the heat transfer limitations includes several innovative aspects: advanced storage materials, reflux heat transfer and new design concepts. The technical targets of DISTOR to be achieved within this project are the development of innovative composite phase change materials, the identification of the most effective storage design for high efficient heat transfer, and proof of the storage material and storage design by on-sun testing of a 100 kW storage module. resulting from the integration of the storage system into a solar-thermal unit are also identified. Based on these results, lab-scale storage units are designed, manufactured and tested in the second phase. Characteristic of the DISTOR project is the parallel research on various storage concepts to promote the identification of the most cost- effective one. This approach results from the limited knowledge at the beginning of the project, which was insufficient to select a single storage concept as the most promising. Different fundamental concepts will be investi - gated to increase the heat transfer rate. The effective thermal conductivity of the storage material is improved by adding highly conductive expanded graphite (EG) to the PCM. Various manufacturing routes for the composite material will also be investigated. A second approach uses an extended heat transfer area between storage material and working fluid. Here, the macro-encapsulation of the PCM in containers is one option to limit the average distance for heat transfer within the storage material. Another alternative for increasing the heat transfer area is the integration of fins made of expanded graphite into the PCM. In the so-called \u2018sandwich\u2019 concept, parallel layers of expanded graphite are arranged vertical to the steam pipes. Reflux Heat Transfer Storage represents the third fundamental storage concept.

The different concepts show a varying demand for development effort: the most mature concept will be selected for the next storage module with increased storage capacity and power, to be installed at the DISS test facility to gain solar operation experience. The results of the experiments will enable the comparison of the different storage concepts. Expected Results Expected achievements are the development of a new cost-effective storage subsystem to be integrated in DSG solar power plants, ensuring solar electricity cost reduction, to reach the long-term target of \u20ac 0.05/kWh. The advantages, resulting from the availability of a storage system for DSG parabolic trough power plants, can be grouped in several categories: (cid:129) Ability to contribute significantly to further cost reduction of electricity production. (cid:129) Increased solar electricity production, thus reducing greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions. (cid:129) Solving grid stability problems of grid-connected solar power plants. (cid:129) Enabling realisation of stand-alone solar thermal plants in remote or island power parks. (cid:129) Providing the missing storage component for DSG solar power plants and helping to exploit the full potential of the advanced DSG technology. (cid:129) Contributing to create European technical leader ship and expand its strong position in solar thermal power systems. Progress to Date In the initial phase the fundamentals needed for the design and manufacture of the lab-scale storage modules have been elaborated. Various manufacturing routes for PCM/graphite composite materials have been examined and the influence of production parameters has been characterised. Models describing the heat transfer for the dif- ferent storage concepts have been developed. Based on these models four different lab-scale storage units have been designed. The manufacture of the lab-scale storage units, based on the external design (PCM/graphite composite), the macro-encapsulation concept and the \u2018sandwich\u2019 concept, has been completed. The feasibility of the \u2018sandwich\u2019 concept and the macro-encapsu- lation has been demonstrated in the lab-scale experiments. Regarding the current results, the \u2018sandwich\u2019 concept is considered to provide the basis for cost-effective storage systems integrated into solar-thermal power plants. The \u2018sandwich\u2019 concept was selected for the design of the storage unit intended for solar operation at Almeria.

        "Challenges Recognising both the environmental and climatic hazards to be faced in the coming decades and the continued depletion of the world\u2018s most valuable fossil energy resources, Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can provide critical solutions to global energy problems within a relatively short timeframe and is capable of con- tributing substantially to carbon dioxide reduction efforts. Among all the renewable technologies available for large-scale power production today and for the next few decades, CSP is the one with the potential to make major contributions to clean energy because of its relatively conventional technology and ease of scale-up. Today\u2019s technology of CSP systems results in the production cost range of 15-20 eurocents/kWh. In the conventional power market, it competes with mid-load power in the range of 3-4 eurocents/kWh. Sustainable market integration as predicted in different scenarios can only be achieved if the cost is reduced to a competitive level in the next 10-15 years. Competitiveness is not only impacted by the cost of the technology itself but also by a potential rise of the price of fossil energy and by the internalisation of associated social costs such as carbon emissions. Therefore it is assumed that in the medium to long-term competitiveness will be achieved at a level of 5-7 eurocents/kWh for dispatchable mid-load power without carbon dioxide emissions. Project Structure The ECOSTAR roadmap for Concentrating Solar Power Tech nologies was designed to give an overview of the existing technology concepts and their options for technical improve ment in further R&D activities, with the focus on cost reduction to achieve cost competitiveness with fossil power generation. In this context seven reference CSP systems have been considered: (cid:129) Parabolic trough technology using thermal oil as the heat trans fer fluid. (cid:129) Parabolic trough technology using water/ steam as the heat transfer fluid. (cid:129) Central receiver system (CRS) using molten salt as the heat transfer system. O B J E C T I V E S E C O S T A R European Concentrated Solar Thermal Road-mapping 108 The main goal of the project was the identification of the R&D activities necessary to achieve cost-competitiveness with fossil power generation. The study was conducted by leading concentrated solar power research institutes in Europe. (cid:129) CRS using saturated steam as the heat transfer fluid. (cid:129) CRS using atmospheric air as the heat transfer fluid. (cid:129) CRS using pressurised air in combination with a solar hy brid gas turbine. (cid:129) Dish-engine systems using Stirling or Brayton cy cles. The methodology is based on common assump- tions on the site, meteorological data and load curve. It includes the calculation of the annual electricity production hour-by-hour, taking into account the instant solar radiation, load curve, part load per formance of all components, and operation of thermal energy storage as well as parasitic energy requirements. The reference size of all systems is assumed to be approximately 50 MWe net. The operation mode considered for the evaluation of the impact of innovations is full-load operation in solar-only mode from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. This means that the plants may deliver electricity to the grid during this time period, from zero up to their design net output, depending on the available solar resource and/or the storage content. The essential technical innovations which con - tribute significantly to the R&D-driven cost reduction poten tial were collected. These data, as well as the associated cost information, were taken from several sources: from industrial quotes as well as from recent studies on some of the technologies. The cost in formation about the technical improvements was evaluated within the methodology. Finally the sensitivity of the electricity cost to innovations, mass-production and environmental factors was determined by levelled electricity costs (LEC). Results The most promising options for each system were combined to evaluate the overall cost reduction potential. Figure 1 shows the cost reduction potential of all seven CSP technologies through technical innovations and development, as calculated using the above-mentioned methodology.

Based on the limited number of approaches sug- gested in the scope of this study, cost reductions of 25-35% due to technical innovations and scaling up to 50 MWe are feasible for most of the technologies. These figures do not include effects of volume production or scaling up of the power size of the plants beyond 50 MW unit size, which would result in further cost reductions. These accumulated cost reductions can bring down costs of electricity from today\u2019s 12-18 eurocents/kWh to 5-7 eurocents/kWh, depending on the radiation resource. This is regarded as a competitive cost level for dispatchable mid-load power without carbon dioxide emissions. About 10- 15 years will be necessary for such a development, in parallel to continuous market implementation. A general recommendation is that short and mid-term research should focus on modular components like concentrators or modular receivers. Medium and long-term development is needed mainly in the areas of thermal storage and the integration of larger and more efficient power cycles. Both pathways must be followed in order to reach the cost target. Concentration of research or demonstration plant funding on certain technologies should be avoided because this would lower the cost pressure caused by competition between the different technologies.

        "Challenges The harnessing of the huge energy potential of solar radiation and its effective conversion to chemical fuels such as hydrogen via the dissociation of water (water splitting) is a subject of primary technological interest. The integration of solar energy concentration systems with systems capable of splitting water is of immense value and impact for energetics and economics worldwide; some consider it the most important long-term goal in solar fuels production to cut hydrogen costs and ensure virtually zero CO 2 emissions. Through the FP5 project HYDROSOL, the partici- pating research team has developed an innovative solar reactor for the production of hydrogen from the splitting of steam using solar energy, constructed from special refractory ceramic thin- wall, multi-channelled (honeycomb) monoliths optimised to absorb solar radiation, coated with highly active oxygen \u2018trapping\u2019/water-splitting materials (based on doped oxides exhibiting redox behaviour). The \u2018proof-of-concept\u2019 of the technology has been demonstrated beyond any doubt in a pilot scale solar reactor designed, built and operating at the DLR solar furnace facility in Cologne (Germany), which is continuously producing \u2018solar hydrogen\u2019. The aim of HYDROSOL-II is to develop and build an optimised pilot plant (100 kWth) for solar hydrogen production based on this novel reactor concept. The project involves further scale- up of this technology and its effective coupling with solar platform concentration systems, in order to exploit and demonstrate all potential advantages. Specific challenging problems to be solved include: (cid:129) The enhancement and optimisation of the metal oxide-ceramic support system with respect to long-time stability under multi- cycle operation (more than 100 cycles). O B J E C T I V E S H Y D R O S O L I I Solar Hydrogen via Water Splitting in Advanced Monolithic Reactors for Future Solar Power Plants 110 Hydrosol II aims at further scaling-up the advanced innovative solar thermal reactor technology already developed: this consists of monolithic ceramic honeycombs coated with active redox pair materials, an enhancement and optimisation of the metal oxide-ceramic support system with respect to long-time stability under multi-cycle operation (> 100 cycles), and the development and construction of a complete pilot dual absorber/receiver/reactor unit in the 100 kWth scale for solar thermo-chemical splitting of water. Effective coupling of this reactor to a solar heliostat field and a solar tower platform for continuous solar hydrogen production within an optimised pilot plant (100 kWth) will be tested, and the technology and design of a solar hydrogen production plant for mass production of solar hydrogen on a commercial scale (1 MW) with costs competitive to that of other hydrogen production methods and potential for hybridisation with combined plants, including solar power generation, hydrogen storage and use, will be assessed. A reduction of production costs for renewable hydrogen in the mid- to long-term (reduction to less than 12 cents/kWh(H 2 ) in 2006 and to less than 6 cents/kWh in 2020) is expected.

Such sustainable, zero-emission, solar hydrogen production will promote economic development and people\u2019s quality of life, especially in many economically depressed regions of southern Europe with sufficient insolation. Evaluation of the economic potential of the process and detailed cost analyses indicate that technical improvements provide the potential to reduce the hydrogen production costs from 20 euro- cent/kWh (HHV) to less than 10 eurocent/kWh in the long-term. Progress to Date During the first six months of the Project, new iron-oxide-based material families, expected to feature improved water splitting performance and better long-term stability, have been synthesised in large quantities. Coating techniques are currently employed for the preparation of multi-layer, multi-functional coatings on large-scale porous ceramic honeycomb supports (\u00d8 25mm, 90 cpsi, length 15-50 mm), meeting the thermo- mechanical operation demands of solar reactors. The first solar campaign on a two-chamber continuous solar hydrogen production reactor with the new batches of materials is expected to take place during the summer of 2006. ",
        "Challenges The main scientific and technical challenges are: design and operation of high-temperature solar chemical reactors (10 kW th and 50 kW th ) con- taining nano-size particulates, production of two valuable products (hydrogen and carbon black) in the same reactor, and proposal for a methodology for solar reactor scaling-up based on modelling and experimental validation. The reactor will operate in the 1500K-2300K temperature range, which also poses severe material issues. The production of both hydrogen-rich gas and carbon black with desirable end-use properties is also a big challenge because the operating conditions satisfying both specifications are likely to be narrow. Project Structure The project includes five main tasks. Solar reactor design and modelling Solar heating of natural gas cannot be achieved directly because hydrocarbons absorb radiation in the visible spectrum poorly. Thus, solar reactor concepts must involve either opaque heat-transfer walls that absorb solar radiation and then heat up the gas by gas-solid convection (indirect heating) or a transparent window that permits direct heating of particulate material by solar radiation (particulate material can be CB). The indirect heating concept avoids particle deposition on the window, but it requires high-temperature material specifications. Both concepts will be studied, in particular with respect to thermal resistance of materials (up to 2300K) and to particle deposition on the optical window. The solar reactor design to be modelled will be selected in month 24. O B J E C T I V E S S O L H Y C A R B Hydrogen from Solar Thermal Energy High Temperature Solar Chemical Reactor for Co-production of Hydrogen and Carbon Black from Natural Gas Cracking 112 The SOLHYCARB project addresses the development of a non-conventional route for potentially cost-effective hydrogen production by concentrated solar energy. The novel process thermally decomposes natural gas in a high-temperature solar chemical reactor. Two products are obtained: a H 2 -rich gas and a high-value nano-material, carbon black (CB). The project aims at designing, constructing, and testing innovative solar reactors at different scales (5 to 10 kW th and 50 kW th ) for operating conditions at 1500-2300K and 1 bar. 3 sm 3 /h H 2 and 1 kg/h CB are expected at the 50 kWth scale. Three main scientific and technical problems are concerned: design and operation of high temperature solar chemical reactors containing nano-size particulates, production of two valuable products (hydrogen and carbon black) in the same reactor, proposition of a methodology for solar reactor scaling-up based on modelling and experimental validation. Solar reactor testing and qualification Solar reactor testing will be achieved using the partners\u2019 solar facilities. First, various designs of receiver/reactor will be tested in small scale (<10 kW th ). Two different prototype-scale (5 kWth and 10 kW th ) reactors based on the direct and indirect heating concepts will be developed. These reactors (in operation in month 10) will be tested, and the experimental results will be critically analysed in order to define, in month 24, the solar reactor concept that leads to the highest performances with respect to reactor thermal efficiency and maximal conversion of CH 4 to H 2 . This analysis will be strongly linked with the heat transfer modelling and the fluid dynamic analysis related to the carbon deposition problem. Based on the solar reactor concept retained in month 24, the second step of the project will consist of designing, constructing and testing a 50 kW th pilot reactor (SR50). The two key milestones of the project are: (cid:129) Month 24: choice of the concept for SR50. (cid:129) Month 30: SR50 ready for operation and RTD activities focusing on SR50. Performance evaluation will include: (cid:129) Heat and mass balance (resulting in reactor thermal efficiency) in the 1500-2300K operating temperature range (cid:129) Determination of conversion (80% CH 4 con- version is targeted) (cid:129) Measurement of produced gas composition (H 2 and CxHy); CB characteristics vs. operating temperature (cid:129) Comparison with model predictions.

Adapted filtering media will be defined and installed at the test facilities. Gas separation routes will be studied as an associated unit operation. The device for filtering the gas-CB mixture and for separating H 2 will be proposed in month 18. Characteristics and properties of carbon black A key point of the cracking process economics is the added value of the resultant CB. The selling price depends on the product nano-structure and may vary from \u20ac 0,6/kg for standard CB (used in tires) to \u20ac 2/kg and even up to \u20ac 30/kg for high grade conductive CB. Thus, the determination of CB properties is a very important issue of the project. This will include standard tests (specific surface area, particle size, chemical analysis, etc.), and application tests in the fields of polymer composites (rubber, plastics) and primary and secondary batteries. Industrial solar plant design and prospects. An industrial-scale solar plant will be designed on the basis of the reactor prototypes and the results of product testing, reactor modelling, separation unit operation, in addition to the existing tools for the design of solar concentra ting systems. Typical industrial solar plant sizes of 50 kW th (decentralised units) and 10/30 MW th are targeted. The solar process economics will be assessed as a function of the uses of both products: hydrogen-rich gas and CB. Expected Results The targeted results are: methane conversion over 80%, H 2 yield in the off-gas of over 75%, and CB properties equivalent to industrial products. Quantitatively, 3 sm 3 /h H 2 and 1 kg/h CB are expected at the 50 kW th scale. Potential impacts on CO 2 emission reduction and energy saving are respectively: 14 kg CO 2 eliminated and 277 MJ per kg H 2 produced, with respect to conventional NG steam reforming and CB processing by standard processes. The expected cost of H2 for large scale solar plants depends on the price of CB; \u20ac 14/GJ for the lowest CB grade sold at \u20ac 0.66/kg and decreasing to \u20ac 10/GJ for CB at \u20ac 0.8/kg. ",
        "Challenges Dispatchable renewable power generation is usually associated with expensive storages or additional back-up systems. Solar-hybrid sys- tems combine solar energy and fossil fuel and thus provide power that is reliable and, if bio- fuels are used, also 100%-sustainable at zero net emissions. Systems based on gas turbines are suited for cogeneration or combined cycles, making them very efficient and cost-effective. The SOLHYCO project focuses on the development of a prototype solar-hybrid microturbine conver- sion system for cogeneration. The unit power level will be 100 kWe. The innovations in the project are: (cid:129) Development of a solar-hybrid microturbine prototype unit based on a commercial micro- turbine (see scheme in fig. 1). (cid:129) Development of a new receiver based on a new high-performance tube technology. (cid:129) Development of bio-fuel combustion system capable for operation with bio-diesel. Integrating a commercial microturbine cogene - ration unit with a solar receiver system provides a solar-hybrid cogeneration system that offers a very high total efficiency of about 45% for solar- to-total power conversion, at full dispatchability. In fossil mode, the overall efficiency will be up to 80%. Solar-to-electric efficiency is expected to reach 16%, which is also an excellent value for such a small system. Solar-hybrid cogeneration systems of this capacity are suitable, for example, for facilities in the tourism sector (polygeneration with power, water heating and air conditioning) and for small business parks. To reduce the temperature gradients a \u2018profiled multilayer (PML)\u2019 tube, consisting of three metallic tube layers has been developed: this comprises a high-temperature alloy outside, copper as an intermediate layer and another high-temperature alloy layer on the inside. The function of the copper, with its much higher heat conductivity, is to distribute the heat by conduction from the irradiated side to the entire inner surface. The outer layer provides the struc- tural strength, the inner layer protects the copper from corrosion at high temperatures. A European patent application was filed in 2004, covering a manufacturing technology for multilayer tubes and applications like solar air receivers. O B J E C T I V E S S O L H Y C O Solar-hybrid Power and Cogeneration Plants 114 The main objective of SOLHYCO is the development of a highly efficient solar-hybrid microturbine (SHM) system for power and heat generation with dual solar power and fuel input. Amongst the specific technical objectives are for example the design and manufacture of a prototype solar-hybrid cogeneration unit by modification of a commercial 100 kWe microturbine and integration with an innovative tube receiver; development of an innovative \u2018profiled multilayer tube\u2019 receiver; a solar-hybrid combustion system for bio-diesel for 100% renewable operation of the test system; evaluation of performance and economic data for optimised solar-hybrid cogeneration systems and large solar hybrid combined-cycle power plants; and verification of the long-term cost reduction goal of \u20ac 0.05/kWh. Preliminary calculations for a solar receiver showed that the temperature gradient in the tube wall could be significantly reduced, as well as the maximum temperature of the tube. Fig. 3 shows the temperature distribution in standard (left) and multi-layer absorber tubes (right). Such tubes will have particular advantages in high-temperature operating conditions with high non-uniform heat loads and make it possible to increase the air outlet temperature range to more than 800\u00b0C. To further reduce net CO 2 emissions, a new fuel combustion system will be developed to permit combustion of bio-diesel. The innovation is to allow operation with bio-fuel combustion in a wide range of fuel-to-air ratios at varying high air inlet temperatures, especially down to very low fuel-to- air ratios typical for a solar-hybrid combustor. Project Structure The development of the pre-commercial solar- hybrid microturbine unit follows on the successful development of solar receiver components (REFOS) and the combination of a solarised heli copter gas turbine with solar receivers in a solar-hybrid system test (SOLGATE). SOLHYCO is the link between these projects and the future exploitation of the technology, with the aim of developing a solar-hybrid system that can be mar- keted later in cogeneration appli cations without major changes. Implementing such small systems in commercial applications will allow step-by-step upscaling of power levels. For solar-hybrid cogen- eration systems the marketable power level is 100 kWe-5 MWe, for highly efficient solar-hybrid combined-cycle plants the expected power level will go up to more than 50 MW. The SOLHYCO system will therefore be the linking element between system development and market intro- duction. The project is the work of a consortium of nine industrial and research partners from seven coun- tries. The work is structured in eight work packages. In WP 1, the solar receiver components are developed. After the first milestone, the manu- facturing method of PML tube samples will be approved, confirming the technique of combining different material layers to decrease the tempe - CONCENTRATED SOLAR THERMAL a ir in 550\u00b0C 900\u00b0C he a t exch a n g er for co g ener a tion rec u per a tor comb u stor receiver sol a r ener g y 300\u00b0C a irin 550\u00b0C 900\u00b0C he a texch a n g er forco g ener a tion rec u per a tor comb u stor receiver sol a r ener g y 300\u00b0C P a =100kW Figure 1: Schematic of the solar-hybrid microturbine cogeneration system ",

At the second milestone, the tube samples will be successfully tested and receiver design initiated. The milestone will not be considered as accomplished if the receiver tube sample test fails to guarantee a gas delivery temperature of at least 800\u00b0C in the completed receiver. WP 2 will terminate with a milestone completing development of the bio-fuel system. When this is accomplished, all components such as the injector, instrumentation and modified control system will be in place and preparations for the hybrid bio-fuel tests will have been initiiated. WP 3 provides for successful completion of development of the bio-fuel system with the delivery of a functional prototype system that can be transferred to future pre-commercial systems. A test campaign under real conditions will demonstrate the correct functioning of the bio-fuel system and the turbine control. In WP 4, a commercial 100 kWe microturbine (TURBEC T100) will be modified and integrated with a solar receiver to obtain a pre-commercial solar-hybrid cogeneration system. The microturbine control, combustion system and mechanical inter- faces will be modified, and an appropriate emer- gency system added. A 350 kWt receiver for this system will be designed and manufactured, based on the innovative PML tube technology developed in WP 1. WP 5 will provide test and evaluation results of the solar-hybrid microturbine unit. The system will be installed on the tower facility at Plataforma Solar and intensively tested in solar, fuel and hybrid mode over a 6-month period. The completion of this work package will be marked by the last milestone of the project, providing a proven system ready for pre- commercial appli cations such as technology demonstration plants. In WP 6, the commercial system layout and cost analysis will be realised. The analysis will use previously developed tools and enhance them for the evaluation of industrial cooling processes, driven by the hot turbine exhaust gas (cogene - ration). Then, optimised system configuration for several applications will be established. A detailed performance analysis will be made to obtain design point and annual energy yields. Cost data will be developed to enable determi- nation of specific system and O&M costs. For combined-cycle power plant, the previous studies will be extended to power levels of 50-100 MWe. In WP 7, a market assessment will be conducted, identifying appropriate market niches for initial commercialisation of the solar hybrid cogeneration unit and future market potential for solar hybrid power plants (>20 MWe). This will be focused on the Mediterranean markets. A standardised accounting scheme for solar-hybrid power gen- eration will be developed and a variety of measures taken to improve public awareness of the technology. Project coordination is covered in WP 8. The coordinator, together with the eight partners, will ensure the proper dedication of project funds and efficient management of the programme. Expected Results The expected result of the SOLHYCO project is the successful development and test of a complete hybrid prototype cogeneration unit, with its new components, for a 100% renewable operation. Based on the results of the market assessment, an exploitation plan will be developed by the consortium for a first demonstration plant. The SOLHYCO technology is well suited as a first step towards the replacement of fossil fuels by renewable \u2018fuels\u2019. The combination of solar and biofuel sources increases the flexibility and dispatchability at zero emissions. This technology offers high conversion efficiencies and promises reduced generation costs, due to the high tem- perature level. Concepts are provided for the introduction of small cogeneration units into initial niche markets, and a perspective is offered for large combined-cycle plants based on hybrid power generation. Progress to Date The project started recently. In the opening months, a project website (www.solhyco.com) has been designed and provided for public and internal access. ",
        "Challenges Profitability determines whether a new techno - logy has a chance to reach the market. Therefore, several modifications and improvements to the state-of-the-art solar reformer technology (see schematic and picture) will be introduced before large-scale and commercial systems are developed. These changes will primarily apply to the catalytic system, the reactor optimisation and operation procedures, and the associated optics for con- centrating the solar radiation. Project Structure The work proposed with SOLREF is based on the activities undertaken in the previous SOLASYS project, where the technical feasibility of solar reforming has been proven. Since the main partners (Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. and The Weizmann Institute of Science) involved in the SOLASYS project will also participate in SOLREF, the experience and know-how acquired in SOLASYS will be applied efficiently in SOLREF, thus ensuring a significant step towards the integration of this new technology. With the catalysis group (JM, APTL, DLR, WIS) headed by the industrial partner Johnson Matthey FC Ltd, it is feasible to investigate the wide spectrum of catalysis and coating technologies, leading to the development of the best catalytically active absorber capable of solar reforming with various feedstocks. DLR and HyGear will develop an advanced solar reformer. ETH will lead the thermo - chemical analysis and system modelling group. The involvement of the Italian SME SHAP and the opportunities offered byn the south of Italy for renewable energy provide an excellent opportunity to realise the first solar reforming prototype plant, which will be pre-designed in this project, after completion of the SOLREF project. Expected Results The SOLREF project is aimed at developing the second generation of the SOLASYS reformer. This second generation reformer will attempt to solve the problems encountered in the previous project, SOLASYS, and will provide the necessary modifications to advance the solar reformer to the pre-commercial phase. O B J E C T I V E S S O L R E F Development of a Solar Reformer for Hydrogen Production 116 The project aims at developing an advanced 400 kWth solar reformer that will be more cost-effective than a state-of-the-art receiver for several applications, such as hydrogen production or electricity generation. Depending on the feed source for the reforming process, CO 2 emissions can be reduced significantly (up to 40% using NG), because the required process heat for this highly endothermic reaction is provided by concentrated solar energy. A further aim is to modify the catalytic system without decreasing the absorptivity of the ceramic absorber so as to operate at high temperatures (up to 1050\u00b0C) and with various feedstocks, and to improve the operation of the plant. Other objectives are to modify the test set-up used by the SOLASYS reactor for faster start-up with simulation of various feedstocks, to provide a sufficiently long period of testing, to develop a pre-design of a 1 MW th prototype plant, and to conduct a market study including cost and system analysis of a large-scale application in the Mediterranean area in solar-only mode. For the advanced catalytically active absorber, various catalyst systems will be investigated in respect of: (cid:129) High catalytic activity with high resistance to coking (cid:129) Good absorption for thermal radiation (cid:129) Acceptable mechanical strength and thermal shock resistance (cid:129) High gas permeability and mixing of gases, as well as low pressure drop (cid:129) Low costs. The ceramic absorber will be prepared using various techno logies. The best catalytically active absorber will be determined by competition. In parallel with fabrication, a model will be develo ped to simulate transport and reaction processes in the porous absorber, thereby determining the steam reforming kinetics. The simulation will help to maximise the effective use of the catalytic coatings in the absorber system. A new and more compact solar reformer will be designed and manufactured with a new flange containing less material, an advanced insulation configuration with steam protection, and an improved ceramic absorber. The nitrogen purge, which was used in the SOLASYS project, will be replaced. A thermodynamic and thermochemical analysis will be performed to support the system design phase \u2013 headed by ETH. The SME HyGear B.V. will provide the detailed design based on the layout from DLR and will manufacture the solar reformer. The existing solar test facility will be modified to include a new purge gas preparation system and a gas mixing system that permits operation of the solar reformer with gas mixtures representative of a variety of possible feedstocks. The new operation strategies will be evaluated. The results of the test campaign will provide input to the pre-design of the prototype plant. The test data will be evaluated and compared with simulation tools in order to verify calculations and identify potential problems. In the pre-design phase, the technical specifi - cations of a 1 MW th prototype reforming plant will be determined for a Mediterranean site.

For the upstream part of the reforming loop, the operation with different gaseous feedstocks (natural gas, weak gas, bio-gas, landfill gas), as well as concepts for gas cleaning and gas treatment will be assessed. The solar reformer can be located either on the top of a tower or on the ground using a beam- down installation. These two concepts will be compared with a view to identifying the optimal solar optical configuration. For the dissemination of solar reforming techno logy, the regions targeted first are in southern Europe and North Africa. The potential markets will be assessed. The environmental, socio-economic and institutional impacts of solar reforming technology exploitation will be assessed with respect to sustainable development. Based on a market analysis, a preliminary model for the cost evaluation of the main plant components will be provided. This model will be used in further system evaluation. Detailed cost estimates for a 50 MW th commercial plant will be determined. Progress to Date A comprehensive range of precious and base metal-containing steam reforming catalysts has been prepared by several conventional and more advanced methods. Their thermal durability has been assessed. The absorptivity of the catalyst system for solar radiation has also been assessed. A testing protocol has been defined and used by the collaborating partners to collect activity data (using several methane-rich fuels), and this has been used to determine the final catalyst choice for SOLREF. Activity testing is continuing on the SOLREF catalyst as part of a kinetics study. The SOLREF catalyst has been scaled up and the final reactor foam sections coated and supplied. In parallel, a thermochemical analysis and a system model of the existing test plant at WIS have been realised. A steady-state system model for the WIS test plant has been implemented and tested. The model can be used to predict the results of changes in the system layout. A dynamic model of the existing test plant has been developed to investigate the transient behaviour of the solar reforming plant: this model focuses on the tran- sient behaviour of the solar chemical receiver during solar operation, and is a tool for imple- menting reactor controls, optimising start-up and shut-down routines and assessing the influence of design changes on reactor dynamics Based on the boundary conditions at WIS, the layout of the solar reformer has been drawn up (see 3D drawing). Absorbed power is approx. 400 kW th , gas temperatures are approx. 450\u00b0C/900\u00b0C for inlet/ outlet, and the optimal operating pressure is 10 bars. The construction of the solar reformer was investigated in three main respects: (cid:129) Advanced holding structure of the absorber dome: based on different concepts and material tests, a light structure was selected. (cid:129) Vessel/front flange interaction: new concepts were assessed for reduction of mass com- pared with the SOLASYS reformer. The ves- sel/front flange has to have sufficient strength to resist plastic deformation while, for the window, the front flange has to be suf- ficiently even and planar. (cid:129) Inside insulation of the vessel with steam condensation protection: different methods have been evaluated and special construction solutions selected which minimise steam dif- fusion into the HT-insulation material. Furthermore, a purge gas flow through defined sites on the insulation can stop the diffusion of the steam-containing process gas. A purge gas is needed for the start-up and shut- down procedures and to avoid steam condensation. CO 2 could be the choice for a new design of solar reforming plant. Due to the specific boundary conditions at WIS, hydrogen was selected: a small hydrogen purification line using the product gas was designed for this purpose.

        "Challenges Sustainable development requires the use of cleaner energy resources. The connection of new decentralised and clean energy resources to the grid can help reduce the environmental impact of power production (CO 2 reduction in particular). Furthermore the introduction of new technologies can improve the performance of the network, improve the reliability and quality of the supply, and offer a more flexible and efficient service. However the integration of these new energy resources and technologies requires an important research, development and testing effort in order to: (cid:129) Make the most effective use of the new energy concepts, including generation from renewables, \u2018active\u2019 distribution networks and where appropriate use of energy storage. (cid:129) Guarantee the highest level of reliability and quality of supply, essential in a critical infra- structure such as the power system. As these new elements are integrated into the distribution network, it will be necessary to use laboratory tests to validate the new concepts for analysis, planning, control and supervision of electricity supply and distribution, in order to take these new components into account in the performance optimisation of the whole system. O B J E C T I V E S D E R L A B A Network of Excellence of DER Laboratories and Pre-standardisation 118 DERlab is a Network of Excellence (NoE) of independent laboratories, working in the area of the integration of distributed energy resources (DER) and the preparation of standards for DER. The main goal of the NoE DERlab is to support the sustainable integration of renewable energy resources (RES) and DER in the power supply system. Key activities focus on the development of common requirements across the EU with respect to grid connection, safety, operation and communication of DER and RES, and development of quality criteria, as well as activities concerning preparation of standards. Integration across Europe of research and testing activities on DER, including its integration into the electricity grid, is needed particularly because of: (cid:129) The large number of uncoordinated research and associated testing activities on this topic, resulting from national research programmes and standardisation activities. (cid:129) The clear need for Europe-wide solutions through promotion of common standards for integration of distributed energy resources (DER). (cid:129) The integration of the experience and facilities of a number of excellent laboratories with impres- sive activity profiles, and the opportunities this offers for building a network that can claim world leadership in testing certification and pre- standardisation activities in the area of DER technologies and their integration into networks. The DERlab Network of Excellence (NoE) will provide critical support for the development of a common European research and development platform focused on DER integration in the power system, taking into account the needs and concerns of EU utilities and manufacturers. It will also strongly support the consistent develop- ment of DER technologies and contribute to the creation of a European competence through highly skilled human resources working at the leading edge of DER technology. Project Structure The DERlab Joint Programme of Activities (JPA) is divided into the following four parts, which are required to perform the network successfully: JPA 1: Integration activities This concerns all activities aiming at integration of the partners.

Expected Results A distributed world-class DER laboratory for Europe The objective is to develop a pan-European laboratory which will be recognised as a leading laboratory in the field of integration of DER. This will be achieved by mutual specialisation and systematic completion of the partners\u2019 laboratories, and by developing a common test portfolio. The test capabilities, together with the test facilities, will establish a test environment for DER. This will enable DERlab to provide European testing services for industry, utilities etc. Support for the development of European and international standards This will be achieved by exemplarily executing research activities in specific fields and by initiating new research activities to provide required technical information and input to the standards. The tech nical areas covered by DERlab are: (cid:129) Requirements concerning connection, safety, operation and communication of DER com- ponents. (cid:129) Requirements for the effective and economic operation of sustainable power systems. (cid:129) Quality criteria for DER components.

Progress to Date One of the first common activities was the elaboration of a proposal concerning the extension of the currently existing laboratory facilities. The proposed research infrastructure for DER inte- gration into the European grids will enable tests at a component as well as a system level, and will be accessible for the European research community, industry and grid operators. Secondly DERlab internal working groups have been set up, working on the topic of intercon- nection requirements for DER.

(cid:129) Market barriers, where new business models must be designed and validated to show that DER solutions can be profitable within acceptable payback times, in a win-win-win situation for different market actors. (cid:129) Regulatory barriers, where new market frame- works must be created to allow for the massive deployment of DER units, bringing significant benefits to society in a sustainable way. The EU-DEEP project adopts a demand-driven, market-oriented approach to validate the rele- vance, by 2010, of a portfolio of DER technology and business models in identified promising segments across Europe, thus promoting the deployment of DER solutions. O B J E C T I V E S E U - D E E P The Birth of a European Distributed Energy Partne that will help the large-scale implementation of distributed ene 120 Co-ordinated by Gas de France, EU-DEEP develops methodologies to study and remove barriers to the implementation of DER in Europe, validates DER technologies that address the needs of market segments in the commercial, residential and industrial sectors, and combines market, technology and regulatory issues into winning business models for DER in Europe Project structure EU-DEEP is based on a set of eight intertwined technical development work packages. They interact iteratively to produce, for five promising market segments, adequate portfolios of DER technologies and business models: (cid:129) A set of simulation tools (market size and energy demand typical of client behaviours) is developed and used to increase the knowledge of the market (segmentation of the European market, ranking of segments, etc.) and select the five promising segments that will be studied in the project (for commercial, residential and industrial applications) with a methodology that can be replicated to study other promising segments in the future (WP 1). (cid:129) A systemic analysis of the impacts of massive DER deployment on grid operation is conducted (WP 2), using another set of simulation tools. Positive and negative grid impacts are detailed and quantified, together with proposals for innovative \u2018use of system\u2019 charge allocation schemes. (cid:129) Local dynamic energy management schemes are studied (WP 3) to measure the benefits of local electricity trading mechanisms, and to use novel DER control technologies facilitating market and grid operations. Trading rules are defined, involving most probably some inter- mediary structures such as aggregators, to make intrinsically costly DER solutions more affordable for end-users. (cid:129) Five full-scale experiments are designed, implemented and run for one year (WP 4 & 5). They aim at removing technical barriers that cannot be addressed by simulation, validating the different results achieved by other WPs, and pinpointing the remaining uncertainties that could slow down the massive deployment of DER solutions by 2010. These experiments are \u2018technology-neutral\u2019 and will involve both renewable and classical solutions.

        "121 (cid:129) A portfolio of innovative business models for each of the five segments is assembled within the concluding optimisation work package (WP 8). These business models will show the benefit of implementing DER/LTS systems for different stakeholders (end-users, ESCOs, etc.). This work package integrates all the findings and new knowledge produced by the project. (cid:129) In parallel, training and dissemination tasks (WP 6 & 7) are implemented to deliver usable knowledge to players in the energy sector that will face DER investment options in the very near future. Both tasks aim at reducing the hetero- geneity of opinions about DER, most often based on a lack of a systemic approach to DER deployment. Expected results There are four classes of exploitable results attached to the EU-DEEP project: (cid:129) Increased knowledge about the European market based on sharing data amongst utilities and other partners. (cid:129) A portfolio of technologies and business models based on extensive experimental evidence in five promising market segments (two commercial, two residential, one industrial). (cid:129) A set of methodologies that can be replicated to study other promising segments in the same three areas of activity. (cid:129) Training materials that will be delivered commercially much before the end of the research project, in order to support the deployment of fast-track options and to obtain early feedback on the portfolio of business models by market end-users of the resultant knowledge. rship rgy resources in Europe ",
        "Progress to date The following barriers defined at the start of the project have been nearly removed: (cid:129) The lack of European wide knowledge about the market was tackled by: (cid:129) sharing commercial data between utility companies and other partners of EU-DEEP; (cid:129) studying market segments both in terms of market potential and energy demand features. A new descriptive language of market features that favour or hamper DER deployment has been agreed. Simulation tools for energy demand, generation and end-use have been developed. They use detailed physical descriptions of energy exchanges for residential and commercial end-users. They allow understanding where flexibility in the demand occurs. The intro- duction of storage functionalities and heat/electricity trading strategies is simulated to pinpoint where and when DER solutions can be made profitable. Aggregating such results allows one to draw leopard-like market maps for DER solutions in Europe. So far, four out of five market segments have been chosen in the residential and commercial sector. E U - D E E P The Birth of a European Distributed Energy Partne that will help the large-scale implementation of distributed ene 122 (cid:129) Initial reluctance of grid operators to allow for massive DER deployment has been shown to be too pessimistic under standard grid architecture configurations: simulation tools have been used under the lead of Tractebel Engineering \u2013 Suez to determine the DER penetration ratio up to which grid mana - gement can be performed safely without any major loss of system reliability. (cid:129) A systemic understanding of massive DER deployment has been implemented to grasp the impact of DER on overall system costs. Present distribution systems can support significant levels of DER penetration with few changes. Cost reduction could even be expected in the long run, but old-fashioned management techniques must be abandoned and new control practices must be adopted. \u2018Anti-islanding\u2019 protection must fully integrate interconnected system requirements. (cid:129) DER-based solutions are put into a systemic perspective that will help stakeholders build meaningful comparison between competing energy solutions. Change management approaches have been implemented in the prototype training curricula. Combined mar- ket description techniques and simulation techniques will provide trainees with the rules to make fair economic comparisons between several energy options in a given end-use segment. The simulation tools used are outcomes of two critical work packages (WP 1 and WP 2), while packaged to meet training time and cost constraints. The following barriers have been addressed, but still remain to be removed demonstrably by mid- 2007: (cid:129) The role of regulations, and the design of innovative market rules, that will facilitate a more efficient deployment of DER. Work is in progress to suggest new market rules to use DER favourably within local approaches throughout Europe and develop a EU framework where util- ities, end-users, manufacturers and investors address the energy market issues of DER in a coherent way.

Three routes are explored in parallel: (cid:129) the use of the new market rules as suggested above; (cid:129) the valuation of electricity (both electrical energy generated and flexible loads) sell-back to local intermediaries (aggregators) or retailers. This may lead to larger DER units to take advantage of sell-back opportunities within pre-specified conditions; (cid:129) the interactions between DER use and grid management techniques, where DER can be favourably valued by grid operators. (cid:129) The meaningful validation of concepts, tools and technologies must be prepared with care: the five experiments foreseen in EU-DEEP are in the design phase. Experiment locations and technology choices (generator and enabling connection and control equipment) have been made for the commercial and residential sectors. Further work is still needed to design each of the one-year experiments that will generate new knowledge needed to validate the portfolio of technologies and business models. Inter - connection between testing sites is considered in order to investigate the aggregation concepts and technologies. (cid:129) Common and coherent valuation rules for DER investments and their related business models remain to be developed. They involve optimisation techniques via: (cid:129) the maximisation of the Net Present Value for any project, taking into account the extra added-value linked to the management flexibility of the investments; (cid:129) the accounting of extra impacts for grid operators, intermediaries and the public in general, involving market and grid con- straints developed in WP 1/WP 2 and WP 3. In the first two years of research and development, the EU-DEEP players have also underestimated the communication and cultural barriers: (cid:129) There is still an excess number of opinions about the role and impacts of Distributed Energy Resources, while, at the same time, there is a shortage of evidence about their future benefits to the European economy. (cid:129) There is a need for concise, clear-cut and practical communication about DER, in order to fight the heterogeneity of opinions, while stepping up the offering of evidence. This is why increased dissemination actions will be launched in the next three years of the project to help stakeholders grasp better the complexity of technology and business portfolios delivered by EU-DEEP. ",
        "Challenges In the last decade, the EU has been deploying significant amounts of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) of various technologies in response to the climate change challenge and the need to enhance fuel diversity. However, conventional large-scale power plants remain the primary source of control of the electricity system, assuring integrity and security of its operation. Levels of DER penetration in some parts of the EU are such that this is beginning to cause operational problems (Denmark, Germany, Spain). This is because, thus far, the emphasis has been on con- necting DER to the network rather than integrating it into overall system operation. Indeed, previous and current research projects have been focusing on developing techniques to accelerate the deployment of DER, and rightly so as this has been a necessary phase in the evolution towards a sustainable electricity supply system. In practice, current policy of connecting DER is generally based on a \u2018fit and forget\u2019 approach. This policy is consistent with historic passive distribution network operation and is known to lead to inefficient and costly investment in distribution infrastructure. Moreover under pas- sive network operation DER can only displace the energy produced by central generation but cannot displace the capacity, as lack of control- lability of DER implies that system control and security must continue to be provided by central generation. O B J E C T I V E S F E N I X Flexible Electricity Networks to Integrate the Expected \u2018Energy Evolution\u2019 124 FENIX aims at enabling Distributed Energy Resources (DER) to make the EU electricity supply system cost-efficient, secure and sustainable through aggregation into Large Scale Virtual Power Plants (LSVPP). The development of intelligent interfaces for commercial and grid integration of DER into LSVPP, the development of novel network services and new DMS and EMS applications to include LSVPP in system operation, and the development of new commercial and regulatory solutions to support LSVPP are other objectives. Validation will be through two large field tests in Spain and the UK. FENIX interacts with stakeholders through an advisory group. We are now entering an era where this approach is beginning to: (cid:129) Adversely impact the deployment rates of DER (cid:129) Increase the costs of investment and operation (cid:129) Undermine integrity and security of the system. In order to address this problem, DERs must take over the responsibilities from large conventional power plants and provide the flexibility and control lability necessary to support secure system operation. Although Transmission System Operators (TSOs) have historically been responsible for system security, integration of DER will require Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to develop active network management in order to participate in the provision of system security. This represents a shift from traditional central control philosophy, presently used to control typically hundreds of generators, to a new distri - buted control paradigm applicable for operation of hundreds of thousands of generators and controllable loads. Motivated by the wide range of challenges asso- ciated with operating the electricity system of the future, leading TSOs and DSOs, manufacturers and research establishments in the EU have formed a consortium of 19 partners to undertake a four-year project, codenamed FENIX, whose over- all aim is: to conceptualise, design and demonstrate a technical architecture and commercial framework that will enable DER- based systems to become the solution for a future cost-efficient, secure and sustainable EU electricity supply system.

        "Challenges The increasing number of renewable energy sources and distributed generators requires new strategies for the operation and management of the electricity grid, in order to maintain or even to improve power supply reliability and quality in future. Furthermore, the liberalisation of the grids leads to new management structures in which the trading of energy and power is becoming increasingly important. This trend is accompanied by new structures for communication and trading, leading finally to digitally controlled interactive electricity grids. The preparation for the transition from conven- tional to future grid management requires an interdisciplinary approach involving research, industry, utilities and consumers, and taking into account technical as well as socio-economic and regulatory issues. There are four running and seven completed projects supported by the European Commission and dealing with the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Distributed Generation (DG). In order to concentrate efforts and maximise critical mass, these projects were bundled into a research cluster in January 2002. This cluster represents more than 100 participating insti - tutions from research, industry and utility sectors, all contributing to this common activity. The object of the IRED coordinated action (CA) is to extend existing cluster activities in such a way as to achieve real added-value by mobilising research which will be a major contribution to the ERA. This extension will be realised by the inclusion of forthcoming projects supported by FP7, national and regional activities. O B J E C T I V E S I R E D How Can we Face the Changes in the Operation and the Management of the Electricity Grids for the Future? 126 The objectives of IRed are making stakeholders aware of the increasing importance of RES and DG compared to conventional centralised systems, contributing to remove technical, economical and regulatory barriers to grid connection of RES and DG, and creating a favourable environment for socio-economic acceptance of intermittent RES and DG grid solutions without risks to quality or safety. In contrast to the creation of a Network of Excellence (NoE), this CA will be more feasible since research on the integration of RES and DG will not be fragmented but structured from the very beginning. The most important elements of the CA will be the following: (cid:129) The systematic exchange of information and good practice by improving links to relevant research, regulatory bodies and policies and schemes on a European, national, regional and international level. (cid:129) The setting-up of strategic actions such as transnational cooperation, the organisation and coordination of common initiatives on standards and testing procedures, and the establishment of common education and training. (cid:129) Identification of the highest priority research topics in the field of integration and the formation of appropriate realisation schemes.

(cid:129) The internal communication inside the cluster projects is organised in WP 3 laboratory experiments and WP 4 pilot installations, whereas communication with actors outside Europe is managed by WP 6. WP 5 highlights the socio-economic and environmental issues. First steps for the future harmonisation of national and regional policies and programmes are coordinated by WP 7, and the setting-up of an internet-based communication platform is realised in WP 8. (cid:129) Lastly, the overall CA project coordination is performed in WP 9 and conferences, work- shops and exchange with experts will be organised in WP 10. All work packages are active during the full running period of the project. Expected Results By increasing dynamic in research and the transformation of the current electricity grid into an interactive one, multiple benefits can be expected such as the creation of innovative products by European industry which in turn will lead to increased exports. Also, the realisation of an (electronic) e-energy market will ensure very much higher flexibility in matching supply and demand, and will thus allow a higher integration rate of RES and DG into the electricity grid. With regard to the substantial increase of renewable energy supply stated in the White Book of the European Commission, the coordinated action provides the infrastructure necessary for the realisation of the targets stated in this White Book. Finally, increased economies in the production, transmission and distribution of electricity will lead to more attractive energy prices for the benefit of all, from industry to the private consumer.

O B J E C T I V E S M O R E M I C R O G R I D S Advanced Architectures and Control Concepts for More Microgrids 128 The operation of microgrids offers distinct advantages to customers and utilities, i.e. improved energy efficiency, minimisation of overall energy consumption, reduced environmental impact, improvement of reliability and resilience, network operational benefits, and more cost-efficient electricity infrastructure replacement. This project aims at the increase of penetration of microgeneration in electrical networks through the exploitation and extension of the microgrids concept, involving the investigation of alternative microgenerator control strategies and alternative network designs, development of new tools for multi-microgrids management operation (involving Distribution Management System architectures and new software adaptation), and standardisation of technical and commercial protocols. Project Structure The work is organized in eight work packages: WP A Design of micro source and load controllers for efficient integration The main objective of this WP is to develop microcontrollers for micro sources and loads capable of providing more efficient voltage and frequency control in the event of islanded ope - ration. These controllers will deal efficiently with frequency variations during transitions from interconnected to islanded operation. Moreover, the microcontroller software will be enhanced with local agents, able to handle participation of the \u2018microplayers\u2019 in energy markets in a highly decentralised approach. WP B and WP C Development of Alternative Control Strategies (hierarchical vs. distributed) The objective of this WP is to develop control strategies based on centralised and fully distri buted technologies and compare them with each other. The large opportunities provided by the wide appli- cation of next-generation ICT technologies, espe- cially communications infrastructure, will be investigated. WP D Technical and Commercial Integration of Multi-Microgrids The integration of several microgrids in MV operation then needs to be carefully investigated in terms of electrical interactions, considering the operational and physical restrictions of these active cells, either in terms of normal steady- state operation or for emergency conditions. WP E Standardisation of Technical and Commercial Protocols and Hardware The main objective of this WP is to propose standards that will allow easy installation of micro sources with \u2018plug and play\u2019 capabilities. Research will deal with standardisation of interfaces between the microgenerator and the distribution network.

In particular, operation in inter- connected and islanded mode and the transition from interconnected to islanded mode and vice versa will be experimented. The centralised and decentralised control strategies developed within WP B will be evaluated on a number (three) of actual microgrids. The candidate microgrids represent rural LV networks and industrial or commercial networks. WP G Evaluation of the System Performance on Power System Operation The main objective of this WP is to quantify the microgrids\u2019 benefits regarding power quality and security of supply, reduction of losses, economics of operation and environmental benefits at the regional, national, and European levels. To achieve this, participating utilities will provide data on representative residential, commercial and industrial feeders, like economics and reliability of supply. The advantages of wide deployment of microgrids will be quantified using established and new software tools. Results will be projected at the regional, national and if possible European levels, providing quantified data for policy making decisions. WP H Impact on the Development of Electricity Infrastructures (Expansion Planning) The overall aim of this WP is to quantify the impact of a widespread deployment of microgrids on the future replacement and investment strategies of the EU transmission and distribution infra - structures.

        "Challenges The liberalisation of the electricity market, combined with the international pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions, has led to new architectures for future electricity networks with a large penetration of distributed energy resources, in particular from renewable sources. But the integration of distribu ted energy resources for the time being is performed in such a way that their intermit- tency impacts strongly on the grids, and this leads to increasing concerns in terms of power quality and of security of supply for end-users. Reciprocally, poor power quality from the grid impacts on the PV systems and leads to losses of production: moreover this impacts on the end- user, his production, services and comfort. Project Structure In order to reach the objective, the work to be performed within SoS-PVI has been divided into nine work packages. In WP 1, the precise technical and non-technical characteristics are defined. In WP 2, the design of the inverter will be completed and all functions will be developed. In WP 3, the storage systems will be integrated, using the best existing technologies. Within WP 4, a demand side management function will be developed. In O B J E C T I V E S S O S - P V I Security of Supply PhotoVoltaic Inverter Combined UPS, Power Quality and Grid Support Function in a Photovoltaic Inverter for Weak Low Voltage Grids 130 The purpose of this project is to prevent power quality events and networks weakening, by decreasing the impact of PV generation on the grid, by providing grid support on demand via special demand side management or via injection on the grid, using the energy provided by a storage unit included in the SoS-PV inverter. With its unique functionalities, the SoS-PV inverter will allow PV integration by moving away from the present \u2018connect and forget\u2019 situation where DER resources are connected to the grid without taking care of their impact on it. The second major purpose of the SoS-PV inverter project will be to protect the end-user from short and long duration faults by virtue of its voltage regulation and UPS function. The UPS function is based on lithium-ion technology or on hybrid systems combining the lead-acid technology with supercaps. WP 5, the integration and validation of the global PV inverter will be undertaken. WP 6 is the place for field validation of the SoS-PV inverter. In WP 7, the life cycle analysis is performed and the life cycle cost calculated. In WP 8, further functionalities of the SoS-PV inverter are defined, while WP 9 deals with the day-to-day management of the consortium. Expected Results The results of the project will be: (cid:129) To validate the SoS-PV inverter on five proto- types, which will then be available for demonstration systems. (cid:129) To prove that the SoS-PV inverter is less than 30% more expensive than conventional PV inverters (excepting storage components) and has a low environmental impact and high energy efficiency, maximising PV production in comparision to conventional PV inverters. (cid:129) To study the feasibility of additional func- tionalities e.g. for integration in virtual power plants. (cid:129) To identify barriers to the exploitation of the full benefits of the SoS-PV inverter.

        "Challenges This project intends to develop a consistent and comprehensive picture of the full cost of energy, and to make this crucial knowledge available to all stakeholders. A complete and consistent assessment of the full cost of energy sources, which includes the external cost plus the private cost, is of paramount importance for energy and environmental policy-making. Energy policy- making is concerned with both the supply side and the demand side of energy provision. On the energy supply side, deciding on alternative investment options requires the knowledge of the full cost of each energy option under scrutiny. On the demand side, social welfare maximisation should lead to the formulation of energy policies that steer consumers\u2019 behaviour in a way that will result in the minimisation of costs imposed on society as a whole. Demand side policies can benefit significantly from the incorporation of full energy costs in the corresponding policy formulation process. The geographical dimension is also important since environmental damage from energy production crosses national borders. Moreover the EU enlargement process and the liberalisation of energy markets have highlighted the impor- tance of a systematic harmonisation process, in which cost formation mechanisms and price- setting must become transparent and reflect the total, real costs of energy provision across the continent and beyond. In turn, this requires the adoption of a common set of methods and values. Hence a consistent set of energy costs allows a better understanding of the inter- national dimensions of policy decisions in these areas. Naturally, differences in estimates exist between countries, sources of energy, and technology used in the generation of the energy. But the present state of knowledge is disparate and some gains can be made by clarifying when and where particular estimates can be applied. Moreover, costs are dynamic. The private costs and the external costs are changing with time, as technologies develop, knowledge about the impact of energy use on the environment increases, and individual preferences for certain environmental and other values change. Perhaps, the least well and least systematically covered area of external cost is that related to energy security. Even within one country, estimates of O B J E C T I V E S C A S E S Cost Assessment for Sustainable Energy Systems 134 The CASES project aims at compiling coherent and detailed estimates of both external and internal costs of energy production for different energy sources at the national level for the EU25 Countries and for some non-EU Countries under energy scenarios to 2030. Hence, private and external costs are integrated within one dynamic framework, to arrive at agreed ranges of estimates for different countries of the full cost of each energy source, including the external cost and the private cost. Policy options for improving the efficiency of energy use will be evaluated, taking account of full cost data. Moreover, the social and fiscal implications of a given policy measure, especially on poor and vulnerable groups, will be assessed. Research findings will be disseminated to energy-sector producers and users and to the policy-making community. the energy security costs of different types of energy remain somewhat elusive. A common methodology has not been applied to derive estimates for a range of countries. Yet this is a major area of policy debate, and key decisions are being taken to increase energy security and reduce dependence on foreign sources. Therefore, without undertaking primary research in terms of data collection, the project devotes significant resources to applying existing models across a range of countries and arriving at a common set of estimates of the costs of energy insecurity, as defined by a common set of parameters. Project structure This project builds on the formidable amount of research that has been done on measuring the full costs of the use of different energy sources such as fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewable energy sources. The internal costs, the private costs and the full cost are calculated and analysed in seven inter-linked work packages that evaluate, compare and harmonise the system costs associated with alternative energy technologies, covering exhaustively the whole range of relevant production, social and environ- mental costs involved. The project focuses on cost-benefit and multi- criteria decision analysis, and makes a set of projections of energy demand by energy source and country. To this end, it uses existing models for estimating such demand and adapts them so that they are responsive to different projections about the prices that suppliers receive and the prices that users pay. These are critical to the policy analysis, which is investigated in four work packages that evaluate the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments in internalising social and environmental external costs, and the degree of integration of these costs into policy and investment decision-making. For this activity to be of practical benefit, the assessment is carried out with energy suppliers as part of the team, so that real-world problems of applying the different instruments are reflected in the evaluation. This means that the hidden costs of implementation of policy \u2013 the adoption of new rules and regulations by the different actors \u2013 are reflected in the analysis.

The comparative cost data is used to address a set of clearly defined goals for policy analysis. The political analysis investigates the comparative assessment of investment and operational costs of different energy options, taking account of private costs only and of private plus external costs. This assessment is dynamic and will provide the implications of different levels of internalisation on investment decisions and on key social indicators. Moreover the political analysis includes the impact of the use of different methods of decision-making on the selection of projects, the implications of different policies on reducing energy insecurity, now and over time, and the implications of different taxes/charges on energy and/or emissions on the degree of internalisation and the comparative cost comparisons, now and in the future. Different instruments to promote renewable energy sources are then compared in terms of the degree to which they internalise the positive externalities associated with renewable energy use, and the use of externality-based taxes for internalising externalities is compared to the effectiveness of emissions trading instruments. The third part of the project is devoted to dissemination. Once they have been evaluated and brought into a coherent framework, the results of the different components of the project are of great interest to the energy sector producers and users, as well as the policy-making community. Dissemination consists of a set of activities to validate and disseminate the project outputs. These activities range from publication of articles in the peer-reviewed literature, project workshops and conferences involving key stake- holders and policy makers, seminars and the presentation of key results at additional meetings, presentations and open discussions with energy producers and user organisations, and the setting up of a dedicated web site for CASES. (See Diagram annexed) Expected results The expected results will feature best predictions about the evolution of private and external costs \u2013 including energy security cost \u2013 of major techno - logies for generating energy, from different sources, in different countries, over the next 25 years. CASES puts particular effort into the integration of private and external costs within one dynam- ic framework, as well as into an estimation of the state of knowledge and the gaps that remain in cost estimation, through a full assessment across EU and non-EU countries. The project intends to ensure that the adoption of externality valuation methods is systematically extended to newly associated and EU candidate countries as well as to other countries beyond the current EU, and that the availability and quality of datasets are brought as close to par as possible. This approach therefore ensures that different local conditions are accounted for. A comparative cost analysis, which includes social and environmental factors, is developed for present and future energy generation alter- natives. In this perspective, a set of clearly defined policy objectives is addressed using the cost data. Policy issues are explored in a dynamic context to provide a comparative assessment of the policy analysis across different countries. In addition the project intends to look at how much of the external costs each policy option internalises, using a broad set of variables of interest. The project also underlines the greatest uncertainties and indicates where future research effort should be concentrated. Finally the success of the project is assessed in terms of the acceptability of the estimated energy costs by the scientific and policy communities and by the use made of these costs in a policy context.

        "Challenges The overall objectives of the MAXIMA project were to translate and present the ExternE (Externalities of Energy) quantification approach and ExternE estimates for power-sector externa - lities outside the scientific community, and to improve the applicability and acceptance of the ExternE methodology and results. Project Structure In the first step a concept for internalisation of external costs of electricity production was developed, identifying optimal internalisation strategies. External cost values as required by the internalisation instruments were calculated with the impact pathway approach, based on the latest scientific knowledge. This included the synthesis and comparison of existing results on the external costs of energy in the European Union, both in the EU15 and new member states. A principal means for disseminating and discussing the ExternE methodology and results was the hosting of a number of workshops at which representatives of the energy industry, NGOs and the policy-making community could meet with the ExternE team to express reservations and make suggestions regarding methodology, values and potential internali- sation instruments. The discussions centred on three stakeholder workshops arranged progressively. Workshop discussions were documented, with efforts to identify areas of consensus as well as those where agreement could not be reached or where issues were open-ended. The first workshop took place in Krakow, 28 February \u2013 1 March 2005, with participants predominantly from the new member states of the European Union. The second workshop, held in Paris 10-11 May 2005, brought together participants from industry O B J E C T I V E S M A X I M A Making Electricity External Costs Known to Policy-makers 136 Quantification of externalities from electricity production has made considerable progress; however, internalisation of external costs has not been implemented broadly, due to a lack of information on the concept and its application as an aid to policy. Even though the impact pathway approach (IPA) developed in ExternE (Externalities of Energy) is accepted as the best way to calculate energy external costs, results show considerable uncertainties and variations with different basic assumptions in certain areas. The scientific task of reducing uncertainties is currently addressed in several projects; identifying the assumptions to be used for decisions, however, requires consensus with stakeholders. The main objective of this project was to translate and present the concept of externalities, the quantification approach and results outside the scientific community. Furthermore, it was the aim to initiate a discussion of the pros and cons among representatives of the energy industry, policy-makers and NGOs in order to reach a consensus on methodology and values. and NGOs, predominantly from Western Europe. The third workshop, held in Brussels, 14 September 2005, was oriented to participants who had attended one of the previous work- shops, in order to build on previous discussions. A final symposium summarising results for policy-makers as well as other stakeholders was held on 9 December 2005 in Brussels, and was attended by more than 130 people from all relevant stakeholder groups. Results Questions, concerns and comments received at the workshops and associated exchanges with stakeholders were compiled, summarised and analysed, together with responses from the ExternE team. The overall impression was that those who attended the workshops valued the ExternE method, and had already found it or its results useful or, especially for participants from new member states, were very interested in using ExternE or its results. The concerns and reservations expressed were less about shortcomings of the method or disputes about assumptions made, although there were some of these. Rather, questions were raised about the practical applicability of the method and results in policy-making, the representativeness of results, as well as reservations about uncertainty, monetisation and completeness relative to what information was considered important to the environmental policy- making process. Many of the comments and questions expressed by stakeholders during the work- shops related to the use and interpretation of ExternE results in a real-world policy context, as opposed to the more technical aspects of the ExternE method and results.

The discussions helped reveal a few areas where ExternE\u2019s role could be clarified, high- lighted some points on which the ExternE method or results drew controversy or discomfort, and identified some topics in which participants thought more research or effort would be useful.

        "Challenges The Accession Treaty, on the basis of Directive 2001/77/EC and 2004/8/EC, obliges the NMS governments to increase their renewable electricity share from 12.5% in 1997 to 18.13% in 2010 on average and to actively promote co-generation. To reach this ambitious goal, these countries will have to focus on higher utilisation of renewable energy sources potential, large-scale integration of renewable electricity sources (RES-E), and co-generation from renewable energy sources (RES) in energy supplies. During realisation of this target, the NMS may encounter difficulties of a technical, financial, policy and socio-economic nature, characteristic of economies in transition. A number of problems are common to all Central European NMS: (cid:129) Problem 1: Insufficient development of large- scale integration of renewable energy sources and co-generation in energy supplies Such problems may arise not only from different economic and technical circumstances in the countries of the CEE region, in compa - rison to the EU15 Member States, but can be O B J E C T I V E S C E E R E S Potential of and Barriers to Large-scale Integration of Renewable Electricity and Co-generation into Energy Supplies in the Central European New Member States 140 The objectives are to enhance large-scale integration of renewable electricity and co-generation with energy supplies in Central European new member states (NMS) by identifying particular difficulties and drawbacks of the large-scale integration of renewable energies and defining areas for further research. Another objective is to increase participation of the Central European new member states\u2019 energy market participants in the European Framework Programmes, by building consortia for further projects in these programmes and providing feedback to the EU on potential partners for future consortia and interesting research questions. also caused by the lack of well-established policies optimised to local conditions. Discussing and defining major NMS problems in the field of large-scale renewable energy integration with energy systems, and trans- lating this into potential research themes, will be a valuable asset to elaborating a strategy for overcoming area-specific barriers. (cid:129) Problem 2: Inadequate participation of the CE-NMS energy stakeholders in the EU Framework Programmes Stakeholders from Central European NMS research centres are not adequately repre- sented in the international research commu- nity.

In practice, however, stakeholders such as users, NGOs or local public authorities might have different (and possibly conflicting) visions of the innovation and of the future world where the innovation will apply. If these diverging views are neglected, project implementation may face severe societal resistance in the implementation phase. So there is a need for empirically based analytical research to provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between stakeholders. The project CREATE ACCEPTANCE aims to improve the conditions for RES and RUE by developing a tool for assessing and promoting the societal acceptance of the related technologies. The project builds upon a prior EC-financed research project, Socrobust, that aimed at developing a tool to measure the social robustness of innovations in general. Socrobust provides technology developers with two maps in terms of users, producers, regulation, and science. One map visualises the present situation; the second map visualises the desired future world. On the basis of discrepancies between the two maps, the technology developer can start altering the innovation to fit the future world or focus on creating a more enabling context for the innovation, for example through changing institutions and regulations. Socrobust needs revision before it can be used as a tool to assess and promote societal accept- ance of RES and RUE. More specifically, the tool needs to be enhanced from an innovator\u2019s tool into a multi-stakeholder tool. For this purpose Socrobust is: (cid:129) Critically reviewed. (cid:129) Supplemented with recent insights from relevant scientific fields such as large socio-technical systems, system innovations and participatory methods. (cid:129) Applied to five demonstration projects covering several (renewable) energy technologies in various European regions. O B J E C T I V E S C R E A T E A C C E P T A N C E Assessing and Promoting the Societal Acceptance of Energy Innovations: Towards a New Multi-stakeholder Tool 142 The project aims at assessing a previously developed tool (Socrobust) for its suitability in contributing to societal acceptance of RES and RUE technologies by mapping its potential and limitations. It will determine the key elements of societal acceptance of RES and RUE technologies by assessing (recent and past) societal acceptance of such technologies in several European regions. The Socrobust tool platform will be enhanced as a multi-stakeholder tool by integrating knowledge gained in the first two objectives, and by designing the necessary instruments and procedures. The multi-stakeholder tool will be validated in five selected demonstration projects, covering a wide range of RES and RUE technologies as well as various regions of Europe. The preliminarily selected demonstration projects are a hydrogen project in the Nordic countries, a biomass project in Eastern Europe, CCS in Western Europe, a wind project in Hungary and a solar thermal project in the Mediterranean region. Project structure The project is divided in five work packages: WP 1: assessing Socrobust WP 1 aims at critically reviewing Socrobust and deciding which aspects need further improvement and adjustment in order to assess and promote societal acceptance of RES and RUE technologies. WP 1 delivers conclusions on how to modify the Socrobust tool. WP 2: historical and recent stakeholder attitudes WP 2 aims to do empirical research on social processes shaping the (non-)application of new energy technologies at a local/regional level. The goal is to provide a better understanding of these processes in specific European regions. Experiences gained from past participation and communication efforts are analysed in detail. On the basis of this analysis, earlier successes and failures are identified so that lessons can be drawn from those experiences. The empirical results enable (together with the results from WP 1) the development of a regional specific multi-stakeholder tool. WP 2 delivers a compendium of best practices for managing societal acceptance of RES and RUE technologies in the energy sector. WP 3: tool development WP 3 integrates the results from WP 1 and WP 2. The result will be a new multi-stakeholder tool. Several preliminary issues have already been identified as important for further adjustment: (cid:129) Socrobust works well from an innovator\u2019s perspective, but lacks the multi stakeholder perspective necessary for the present project\u2019s focus on societal acceptance. (cid:129) Socrobust does not provide instruments or strategies that might help align the future visions of different stakeholders. One of the strategies often mentioned in literature is early stakeholder involvement. Another strategy is experimenting in early niche markets.

        "Challenges The main challenge of the project is to facilitate the participation of the NMS and ACC in the 6 th Framework Programme and encourage participa- tion in the 7th Framework Programme. The first specific challenge is to promote the European energy research priorities of clean energy production, distribution and use, and new energy technologies aimed at developing and increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources. It is also essential to make a significant contribu- tion to the international effort of ensuring security of energy supply and conservation of the environment. The project should help in solving new MS and ACC energy problems, such as restructuring of an energy sector formerly based on coal, counteracting CO 2 emissions and increasing dependence on imported fossil fuels, as well improving the efficiency of the generation, distribution and use of energy. One of the specific objectives of the proposal is to map the activities of the research groups in the ACC and MS working on future energy technologies and to establish international expert groups. Moreover, it is essential to organise a series of profiled regional infodays and seminars in the new MS and ACC, together with brokerage events for prospective newcomers to the Framework Programme. Finally there is the preparation and dissemination of training materials devoted to consortium building, partner searches, proposal preparation, project management, financial and contractual aspect by project website. Project Structure The project is divided into three work packages comprising eight tasks. Regional infodays, linked with brokerage events and associated with well established conferences, will be organised in the countries concerned. The events will help potential participants get off to a good start on FP7. One of the support activities of the proposed project, as defined in WP 1 and WP 2, is to map research groups in the NMS and ACC, and identify groups of experts in the old member states. Consequently, the international expert groups will have to be established by then. Moreover, three national infodays in Poland, the Slovak Republic and Romania will be organised and a project website designed. The publication O B J E C T I V E S F E T - E E U Future Energy Technologies for Enlarged European Union 144 The main objective of the project is to carry out activities which will contribute to the integration of the research and technology development groups in the new member states (NMS) and associated candidate countries (ACC) and old member states in the area of future energy technologies. One of the general integration and structuring objectives of the proposal is to identify the best energy-sector research centres and potential industry and SME partners in the NMS and ACC open to new energy technologies, to define their profiles, strengths, weakness and needs, and to identify research and industry groups and experts in the old member states. The second objective is to improve knowledge in the NMS and ACC of the Framework Programmes, the participation rules and instruments, and to develop the skills needed for project preparation and management. of promotion material is also essential as a support activity for the project. Expected Results The strategic impact of the proposed project is at several levels. The first level is its contribution to the European Research Area by integrating and structuring energy research in the enlarged European Union. This will be achieved through the identification of research groups working in new and advanced energy technologies in the NMS and ACC, and classification of the target groups. Secondly, there is the mobilisation of the human and material resources in the area of new energy technologies in the NMS and ACC, and full integration of the research community in the field of new energy technologies in the enlarged European Union. The second level is the scientific contribution to energy sector transformation in the NMS and ACC through decreasing the share of fossil fuels in the total balance of energy generation and increasing the use of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency and ensuring security of energy supply. This can also be done through stimulating the interest of research groups in the NMS and ACC in such not yet widely disseminated energy technologies as fuel cells and hydrogen. Moreover, the new concepts for reducing the costs of RES production and exploitation will be introduced. The third level is the contribution to solving environmental problems in Europe through the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants, in particular through CO 2 capture and sequestration. Another expected result is to adopt fuel sources for energy generation that are neutral for the environment. The fourth level is the contribution to the societal and economic needs of the new members of the EU through the indication of new forms and fields of employment in the new energy techno - logies sector. A scientific contribution to the analysis of societal acceptability for new energy technologies is also envisaged. Finally there is the impact on gender issues, foreseen in the participation of 15 women in the main project team.

        "Challenges Sustainable energy uptake in Europe is not achieving the targets set either at a Community level or at a level targeted by most member states (MS) or the candidate accession states (CAS). Ten years after Rio (promoting local participation in sustainable development), with policy frameworks setting targets for renewable energy, combined heat and power, the rational use of energy with a major focus on reducing greenhouse gas emis- sions, and with hundreds of millions in investment at a Community, MS and CAS level, Europe is not meeting its targets. While macroeconomic and Community, MS and CAS policies are necessary to promote investment in sustainable energy technologies and projects, they are not sufficient if local authorities, local communities, citizens, investors, developers and financiers are unable, for whatever reasons, to invest in and develop these projects. While research and development and pilot projects are necessary to set the path and the framework for investment, they are not sufficient to guarantee that key actors will adopt them and disseminate and commercialise them on a large scale. Developing a number of models and tools in the field of sustainable energy does not ensure their adoption by local authorities and local actors; such tools must be developed specifically for local level use, and must be replicable for a wide variety of different local communities throughout Europe, and not developed simply as one-off projects. One of the reasons for this is a basic lack of understanding of, and familiarity with, these techno logies and tools at a local level. This is largely due to the fact that local authorities have not been engaged at nearly the level that Community and national leaders have in the discussions, the debates and demonstrations of these technologies and approaches. Secondly, specialists have dominated the scene, speaking in terms and using tools that are alien and unfamiliar to local authorities, local planners, local politicians and key local actors/stakeholders. This means that these approaches and technologies are often not understood or even known at a local level. Finally, and most importantly, local authorities have numerous priorities, particularly social priorities, from education to health, from public housing to public transport, from water provision to waste disposal that have not been addressed from O B J E C T I V E S L E T I T Local Clean Energy Technology Implementation 146 The main objective of LETIT has been to provide local authorities across Europe with a framework within which they can identify and assess the sustainable energy potential of the many assets that they are responsible for. Local authorities own, manage and control a wealth of resources that are not usually viewed in terms of sustainable energy, such as buildings, transport, land and waste. Such assets could potentially be developed to generate or provide a demand for clean energy and, by viewing them in this way, local authorities are well positioned to initiate projects that could bring social, economic and environmental benefits to themselves and their communities. a sustainable energy standpoint by those promoting sustainable energy at a Community or national level. Moreover, financial and human resources to deal with their priorities are limited. Promoting sustainable energy in its own right, without demonstrating how sustainable energy addresses key local priorities, seems to local authorities as yet more burden for no understandable benefits. While energy is important in each of these areas \u2013 health, education, other social services, transport, waste management, etc. \u2013 few local authorities and their experts see the link between these services and the supply and management of energy in a unified framework or approach. The tools, models, frameworks and information to make such a link, and act upon it, hardly exist. This applies even more to sustainable energy, as it is even more removed, more alien, to local authorities and actors than conventional energy. Indeed, until local authorities and local actors fully engage in the process of valuing their sustainable energy assets and integrating them into their plans, and finally promote them in order to reduce their own and investors\u2019 risks in developing them, there is no chance Europe will meet its targets. Project Structure ESD was the project coordinator for a network of national project teams in four EU member states (UK, Portugal, Italy and Germany) and two candidate accession states (Poland and the Czech Republic). Each of those six country teams comprised one technical partner, at least one local authority, and at least one industry, investor or project developer partner with a strong energy- technology focus. The six country teams were led by technical partners, each of which is a company or institute with considerable experience with SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY, BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES AND INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION RELATED TO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY RTD ",

The six country teams represented a range of geographic areas in Europe (including two candidate countries), differing sizes of local authority, and different levels of sustainable energy development. Each has been keen to work on the project to enable them to identify and categorise their local energy assets, examine the options for developing each, identify leading or future technologies for exploiting those energy assets, and define in a systematic manner the externalities (benefits and costs) of developing each asset and technology, and the risks associated with such development. Each has been keen to undertake this assessment and then analyse future technology investments in light of local needs and priorities. Expected Results LETIT will provide valuable support for local governments in the assessment of new energy technologies in terms of their costs, benefits and risks. The tools will enable any local government to make informed decisions about the impacts of a technology in the local community in terms of a number of wide-ranging externalities, from local emissions and greenhouse gases to employment generation and local revenues. The frameworks that will be designed through the LETIT project will be highly replicable and will help local governments across Europe evaluate local sustainable energy development and policy. Its practical results are: (cid:129) A methodology, usable at a local authority level, that identifies all possible assets (housing, land, transport, water, waste, electricity and heat generation, etc.) that can be used to plan medium- to long-term technology investments. (cid:129) A matrix that identifies all technologies that could be developed to develop local sustainable energy assets. (cid:129) A tool to assist the assessment of the benefits and costs (externalities) of each technology option. (cid:129) An electronic self-help \u2018toolkit\u2019 for local authorities to follow the LETIT methodology without external support. (cid:129) Wide dissemination of the results and the methodologies, frameworks and model developed during the project to as wide an audience in Europe as possible. Progress to Date Since the start of the project, the LETIT team has carried out six work packages, the outputs of which have been consolidated to form a single planning framework and toolkit. Each work package combined primary research, stakeholder review and the production of practical tools that can be used by local authorities across Europe. The work packages covered the following areas: Stakeholder identification and engagement, asset profiling and prioritisation, technology identification, socio-economic review, risk assess - ment and strategic planning. LETIT reached its technical completion in June 2006, following a successful dissemination event held at the representation of the government of Greater London in Brussels. The event was held to describe the practical outputs of the project, namely the LETIT web-based toolkit and to illustrate its use by presenting: (cid:129) The experiences of local authority partners in identifying assets they would like to use to develop sustainable energy locally, and the benefits of using the LETIT framework (cid:129) Practical insights into how local authorities can build working relationships with project developers to implement sustainable energy projects, and the policy tools that can be used to support this activity. The event was used to launch a consultation amongst local authority representatives based in Brussels in order to obtain feedback on the functionality and usefulness of the toolkit for local authorities in their respective countries. This consultation led to improvements that have now been incorporated into the final product, which is available through the project website. In addition to the toolkit and the resulting activities in the local authorities participating in LETIT, the team have also compiled implementation plans outlining how those partner authorities will continue this process beyond the lifetime of the LETIT project.

        "Challenges Existing studies dealing with renewable energy in emerging and developing countries (e.g. EREC, WEC, IEA) aim at giving a global view of the situation and possibilities in a region of the world. The European Commission pointed out a lack of a com prehensive and complete set of data, and there fore asked the RECIPES team to bring these data together and draw pragmatic recommendations. A crucial starting point in this process is the 'triple-win objective'. The consortium is dedicated to finding ways to implement RES that will benefit the local socio-economic situation and the local and global environment, and offer opportunities for European companies. Any recommendation that will not incorporate all three aspects will not be taken into account. Consequently, the project has the ambitious goal of bringing together the demand and supply sides of renewable energy in emerging and developing countries. The only way that the project can realise this ambition is by ensuring that the recommendations developed are broadly accepted by the stakeholders involved. The parties (that could possibly be) involved in the imple- mentation of RES in emerging and developing countries are therefore actively requested to validate the chosen approach and to assist in the development of the recommendations made during the project.

        "Challenges Despite being neighbours and grouped around a commonly shared sea, the M a re Nostrum , the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries (SEMCs) are not equally endowed with energy resources. Few of them are hydrocarbon-exporting countries while most are energy-dependent. In addition, the SEMCs are facing rapid demo- graphic growth, rapid urbanisation and high socio-economic development, all of which translate into new and growing needs for energy services, related infrastructures and financing means, and into environmental impacts. At the same time, all of them have a high potential for renewable energy resources (especially wind and solar) and also a high potential for improving their energy use and efficiency, thus ensuring security of supply (or savings in hydrocarbon resources for producing countries) while contri - buting to more sustainable energy development in the region. However, the full potential and advantages of these renewable energy resources are not fully realisable at present in this region because of the existence of many barriers. For these energies to achieve their market potential, policy frame- works and financial instruments are necessary that give financiers the necessary assurance and incentives to shift investment away from carbon- emitting conventional technologies to investment in clean energy systems. Also technology transfer, capacity building and know-how transfer are very important. In this context, regional cooperation is essential and can significantly benefit the sus- tainable development of the region, while playing an important role in meeting Kyoto targets. The REMAP research project can play an important role in this regard. This project will compile renewable resource information from various previous projects and initiatives, in order to compile a bigger and more comprehensive atlas for the whole Southern and Eastern Mediterra - nean area. In addition, it will enhance the status of sustainable energy in the Mediterranean countries by providing a clear vision of the priorities to be addressed in order to develop the two most important and promising RE technologies in the region \u2013 wind and CSP \u2013 and by featuring the O B J E C T I V E S R E M A P Action Plan for High-priority Renewable Energy Initiatives in Southern and Eastern Mediterranean Area 150 The objectives of the REMAP project are to work with key stakeholders in order to achieve the following: the compilation of a solar and wind energy resource atlas for the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean area, identifying and prioritising potential demonstration sites for wind and concentrated solar projects in Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan and Turkey; recording a set of commitments to be made by major stakeholders to develop several wind and concentrated solar thermal energy projects in the region; proposing a credible financing scheme for identified priority renewable demonstration projects in the region; elaborating an action plan for a few well-identified initiatives suitable for implementation; and disseminating the results of the project to as wide an audience in Europe and the Mediterranean region as possible. commitments by major stakeholders in these countries to advancing the development of such projects. The project will thus serve to encour- age decision-makers in these countries to better define the best practices regarding energy and to attract investments in the RE sector. Project Structure The REMAP proposal is structured in terms of five main work programmes and related deliverables: (cid:129) State-of-the-art and synthesis of the renewable energy Atlas for the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean area. The objective will be to gather the existing information on potential renewable energy resources in the region, specifically wind and solar, and to synthesise this information in the form of a regional atlas. (cid:129) Identification and prioritisation of potential demonstration sites for wind and concentrated solar projects in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean area. The countries covered by the REMAP research project are Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan and Turkey. As far as possible, the projects to be studied will also include water desalination applications. This WP will allow the project to identify a portfolio of the most promising wind and CSP projects in the participating countries. Also the need (if any) for further research/activities regarding project identification and design will be identified. (cid:129) Commitments on wind and concentrated solar thermal energy integration in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean region. The work will involve putting on record a series of commitments to be made by energy agencies, utilities, energy manufacturers and banks. This would be achieved through the organisa- tion of national and regional workshops, with the participation of the major stakeholders. By the end of this WP, the stakeholders committed to the selected projects will have been identified. Also barriers (if any) to commitments by investors will be recorded, together with activities designed to address these barriers.

A website for the project will be developed and extensively used for commu- nication between partners and with potential users of the results. The aim will also be to elaborate an action plan for financing and implementing wind and concentrated solar thermal projects. Further activities to be undertaken will be considered separately for CSP and wind projects and included in the action plan. The complete results will also be synthesised in the REMAP action plan scheduled for the end of the project. A supporting event will be organised at the end of the project, with the participation of the actors involved in wind power and solar energy technologies in the European countries and Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries. Expected results The REMAP project will provide and disseminate better knowledge of the wind and solar energy resources available in the Mediterranean region and opportunities to invest in wind and CSP projects. It will offer clear information about the priorities set by the different countries with regard to these technologies. It will also provide decision-makers with suitable tools and infor- mation to allow them to develop adapted, targeted and effective policies in the field of wind and solar project development, in accordance with the specific needs and policies of each country. It will also provide a portfolio of potential CSP and wind power projects to be implemented. The final objective of the project is to elaborate an action plan for high-priority renewable energy initiatives in the Southern and Eastern Mediterra - nean area. The implementation of this action plan will have a very strong impact on the develop- ment of renewable energy in the Mediterranean countries, along with the economic, social and environmental implications, and a strengthened euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the field (transfer of know-how, transfer of technology, investments, etc.).

There is also a wealth of experience available over the past decade, especially with demonstration projects. Numerous (development) organisations and programmes are in place to stimulate the increase of new renewable energy technologies in emerging and developing countries, at inter - national and national levels (e.g. the EU Energy Initiative for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development EUEI, the EU Coopener programme, UNDP programmes, Inforse programmes, INCO, the Global Environmental Facility, the European Partnership and Dialogue Facility, the JREC Patient Capital Initiative, GTZ, Energy4 Development and REEEP). Some of these are focussed on improving access to energy and poverty alleviation, others on demonstration of renewable energy techno logies, capacity-building or creating the preconditions for renewable energy. However, so far, the increase of renewable energy production in emerging and developing countries is slow compared to developed countries. The 2003 renewable energy volume in 115 emerging and developing countries is estimated as 95 Mtoe, large hydro excluded (Figure 1). Under present policy this volume is anticipated to double in 2020. Tripling of the RES volume in 2020 under the \u2018maximum scenario\u2019 is possible, but there is still a long way to go for all RE technologies other than large hydro. There is a clear need for ambitious targets for these technologies, sup- ported by reliable measures in order to nurture sustainable RE industry and create the situation where RE could make a real impact on security of supply and imported fuel dependency. O B J E C T I V E S R T D 4 E D C Renewable Energy in Emerging and Developing Countries: Which Role for European RTD&D? 152 The main objective of the RTD4EDC project is \u2018to provide recommendations and a synthetic and accessible information basis on lessons learned regarding the implementation of renewable energy technologies in emerging and developing countries, the impact of RTD&D in this perspective and the opportunities for EU industry.\u2019 Market growth varies significantly between individual countries and between the three continents involved (Figure 2). In Asia renewable energy volume growth is anticipated to be high, due to ambitious domestic policy programmes. In Latin America growth is lower due to the high volumes already in place. In Africa growth is anticipated to be high, in the context of low energy consumption and the consequently greater impact of increased RE capacity, but the overall volume will remain very low. For poor countries the effort to bring modern and renewable energy to the people costs much more per energy unit produced than in more industrialised countries where larger installations can be established. Initiatives traditionally focus on technology transfer through demonstration, capacity- building and networking, through various funding mecha nisms. Which role could European RTD&D play in increasing the share of renewable energy technologies in emerging and developing countries? What are the lessons learned of best and worst practices in this perspective? What could be a realistic export potential for EU industry to emerging and developing countries, and how could RTD&D help to realise this potential? These questions are addressed in the RTD4EDC project.
