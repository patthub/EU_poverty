        "Introduction Migrant integration 6 Introduction Changing migratory patterns, which may occur suddenly and vary greatly in terms of size and composition, pose great challenges to host societies and policymakers, who need quality information on which to base their decisions. Information on the basic demographic characteristics of migrants is not sufficient to fulfil those needs. More specific socio-economic statistics on migrants and their descendants are of utmost relevance to reflect the complexity of these patterns and the nature of the migrant integration process. This publication provides an overview of the European Union (EU) statistics on the integration of migrants. Successful migrant integration into the society of host countries is the key to maximising the opportunities of legal migration and making the most of the contributions that immigration can bring to EU development. Statistical measurement of the level of migrant integration is aimed at providing policy-makers with reliable and comparable statistical information. This in turn facilitates reaching appropriate and targeted policy decisions. Based on available data, migrant integration in this publication is presented in terms of employment, education, social inclusion and active citizenship in the hosting country. This publication is made up of this introduction and two main chapters. The introduction provides information on the development of EU migrant integration policy, indicators to monitor migrant integration, key concepts, data sources and their limitations. In addition, it provides a brief insight into latest migratory patterns in the EU including migration flows and stocks of immigrant population. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to EU statistics on the integration of migrants. Chapter 2 is based on data collected by Eurostat from the 2014 Labour force survey ad-hoc module on the \u2018Labour market situation of immigrants and their immediate descendants\u2019. The previous 2008 LFS Ad-hoc module on the \u2018Labour market situation of immigrants\u2019 was also used to compare data over time. Policy background The continued development and integration of the European migration policy remains a key priority to meeting the challenges and harnessing the opportunities that migration represents globally. The integration of third-country nationals living in EU Member States legally has gained importance in the European agenda in recent years. The Common Basic Principles for the Immigrant Integration Policy, which were adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council in November 2004 and reaffirmed in 2014, form the foundations of the EU\u2019s policy cooperation on integration. They also form the basis for the member countries to assess their own efforts. They include the main aspects of the integration process, including employment, education, access to institutions, goods and services, and to society in general. Most importantly, the Common Basic Principles define integration as a two-way process of mutual accommodation by all migrants and by residents of the EU Member States. In July 2011, the Commission proposed a European agenda for the integration of third- country nationals, focusing on actions to increase economic, social, cultural and political participation by migrants and emphasising local action. This new agenda highlights challenges that need to be addressed if the EU is willing to fully benefit from the potential offered by migration and the value of diversity. On 7 June 2016 the European Commission adopted an Action Plan on the integration of third-country nationals. The Action Plan provides a comprehensive framework to support Member States\u2019 efforts in developing and strengthening their integration ",
        "Introduction Migrant integration 7 policies, and describes the concrete measures the Commission will implement in this regard. While it targets all third-country nationals in the EU, it contains actions to address the specific challenges faced by refugees. The Plan includes actions across all policy areas that are crucial for integration: \u2022 Pre-departure and pre-arrival measures, including actions to prepare migrants and the local communities for the integration process; \u2022 Education, including actions to promote language training, participation of migrant children to early childhood education and care, teacher training and civic education; \u2022 Employment and vocational training, including actions to promote early integration into the labour market and migrant entrepreneurship; \u2022 Access to basic services such as housing and healthcare; \u2022 Active participation and social inclusion, including actions to support exchanges with the receiving society, migrant participation in cultural life and fighting discrimination. Measuring migrant integration The 2009 Stockholm Programme for the period 2010\u201314 embraced the development of core indicators for monitoring the results of integration policies in a limited number of relevant policy areas (e.g. employment, education and social inclusion). The Zaragoza declaration adopted in 2010 by the European Ministerial Conference on Integration in Zaragoza identified a number of policy areas relevant to migrant integration and agreed on a set of common indicators to monitor the situation of immigrants and the outcome of integration policies. In 2011, the European Commission in the pilot study Indicators of immigrant integration examined proposals for common integration indicators and reported on the availability and quality of the data from agreed harmonised sources necessary for the calculation of these indicators. The following report Migrants in Europe \u2014 A statistical portrait of the first and second generation provided a statistical analysis on a broad range of characteristics of migrants living in the EU and EFTA countries. The proposals in the pilot study were further developed and elaborated in a project, the conclusions of which were presented in the report Using EU indicators of immigrant integration published in 2013. The project\u2019s objectives were to boost the monitoring and assessment of the situation of migrants, along with the relative outcomes of integration policies. In July 2015, the European Commission, jointly with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), released the report \u2018Indicators of Immigrant Integration 2015 \u2014 Settling In\u2019. While in the thematic chapters of this publication the analysis is focused on the foreign- born population, there is a specific chapter dealing with the situation of non-EU citizens in the EU, aimed specifically at monitoring the Zaragoza indicators. ",
        "Introduction Migrant integration 8 Key concepts Key concepts of migrant integration statistics are explained at the beginning of each chapter where they are used. For the purpose of this publication the data on migrants are generally presented for the following age categories: \u2022 15\u201329: this group represents the population of young migrants and is targeted by the EU Youth Strategy \u2022 20\u201364: this group has been selected because it is relevant to the first Europe 2020 target (employment of 75 % of this population by 2020); \u2022 25\u201354: this is considered as the most appropriate group for the analysis of the situation of migrants of working age as it minimises the effect of migration for non- economic reasons (e.g. study or retirement) and forms a more homogeneous group, large enough to produce reliable results; \u2022 55\u201364 and 55 years or over: these age groups focus on the older migrants. Data sources Data used for the indicators on migrant integration come mainly from the EU labour force survey (EU- LFS) and the EU statistics on income and living conditions survey (EU-SILC), complemented by administrative data sources. As regards the dimensions of employment and education, the data are based on the results of the EU-LFS. The EU-SILC covers topics relevant to social inclusion: people at risk of poverty or social exclusion, income distribution and monetary poverty, living conditions and material deprivation. The EU-SILC also provides data on the health status of the foreign population, in the form of \u2018selfperceived health status\u2019. EU migration statistics are collected on an annual basis and are supplied to Eurostat by the national statistical authorities of the EU Member States. Most EU Member States base their statistics on administrative data sources such as population egisters, registers of foreigners, registers of residence or work permits. The EU labour force survey The main source of information on the structure and trends of the EU for labour market is the EU-LFS. EU- LFS is a large quarterly sample survey that covers the resident population aged 15 and above in private households in the EU, EFTA (except Liechtenstein) and candidate countries. It provides population estimates for the main labour market characteristics, such as employment, unemployment, inactivity, hours of work, occupation, economic activity and other labour related variables, as well as important socio-demographic characteristics, such as sex, age, education, household characteristics and regions of residence. Regulations set by the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission define how the LFS is carried out, whereas some countries have their own national legislation for the implementation of this survey. ",
        "Introduction Migrant integration 9 The LFS 2014 ad hoc module on the labour market situation of migrants and their immediate descendants The LFS 2014 ad hoc module on the labour market situation of migrants and their immediate descendants was an improvement of the LFS 2008 ad hoc module on the labour market situation of migrants, aiming at boosting the quality of the data, and in particular the cross-country comparability and implementability of the module. The target population of the LFS 2014 ad hoc module consisted of all persons aged 15\u201364. The ad hoc module variables were collected for all persons in the household in the target group age. The collection of data on the COB of the father and the mother enabled the identification of second- generation migrants. Other variables of the LFS 2014 ad hoc module relevant to the migrant integration indicators are: \u2022 level of educational attainment of the parents; \u2022 over-qualification; \u2022 obstacles to getting suitable jobs; \u2022 language skills in the host country language and participation in language courses. EU statistics on income and living conditions The EU-SILC survey is the main source for the compilation of statistics on income, social inclusion and living conditions. It provides comparable micro data on income, poverty, social exclusion, housing, labour, education and health. EU-SILC is implemented in the EU Member States, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. It provides two types of annual data: cross-sectional data pertaining to a given time or a certain time period with variables on income, poverty, social exclusion and other living conditions and longitudinal data pertaining to individual-level changes over time, observed periodically over a four-year period. Eurostat migration statistics Eurostat produces statistics on a range of issues related to international migration flows, non- national population stocks and the acquisition of citizenship. Data are collected on an annual basis and are supplied to Eurostat by the national statistical authorities of the EU Member States. Since 2008 the collection of data has been based on Regulation (EC) No 862/2007. Together with the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 351/2010, they define a core set of statistics on international migration flows, population stocks of foreigners, the acquisition of citizenship, residence permits, asylum and measures against illegal entry and stay. Although EU Member States may continue to use any appropriate data according to national availability and practice, the statistics collected under the Regulation must be based on common definitions and concepts. Most EU Member States base their statistics on administrative data sources such as population registers, registers of foreigners, registers of residence or work permits, health insurance registers and tax registers. Some countries use mirror statistics, sample surveys or estimation methods to produce migration statistics. ",
        "Introduction Migrant integration 10 Data sources: advantages and limitations As already mentioned, the production of migrant integration indicators is generally based on sample surveys or on population registers/registers of resident foreign citizens. A key advantage is the exploitation of data from the EU-LFS and EU-SILC. Both surveys are highly harmonised and optimised for comparability. However, for both types of data sources (administrative and survey data) there are certain limitations. With regard to survey data, limitations arise with respect to the coverage of migrant populations. By design, both the EU-LFS and EU-SILC target the whole resident population and not specifically the migrants. Coverage issues of survey data arise in the following cases: \u2022 Recently arrived migrants: this group of migrants is missing from the sampling frame in every hosting country resulting in under- coverage of the actual migrant population in the EU-LFS and EU-SILC. \u2022 Collective households: the EU-SILC only covers private households. Persons living in collective households and in institutions for asylum seekers and migrant workers are excluded from the target population. This also results in under-coverage of migrants in the survey. \u2022 Non-response of migrant population: a significant disadvantage of the surveys is the fact that a high percentage of the migrant population does not respond to them. This may be due to language difficulties, misunderstanding of the purpose of each survey, arduousness in communicating with the interviewer, and fear on behalf of migrants of a possible negative impact on their authorisation to remain in the country after participating in the surveys. \u2022 Sample size: given the nature of the EU-LFS and EU-SILC as sample surveys, these cannot fully capture the characteristics of migrants in EU Member States with very low migrant populations. \u2022 Information on COC and COB: this information is asked from all persons in private households sampled in the EU-LFS, whilst in the EU-SILC this information is collected only for those aged 16 and over, resulting in an under-estimation of the number of migrants by COC and COB. With regard to administrative data, one main problem refers to the comparability of the data used to estimate migrant integration indicators. The administrative data sources are not harmonised and there are also variations in methods and definitions. For example, some countries produce estimates for the migrant population to account for non-response, while others leave this problem untreated. Coverage gaps are reported by certain EU Member States with regard to some types of excluded international migrants (e.g. asylum seekers). In other cases, there are significant numbers of departed migrants not covered by the registration systems. ",
        "Introduction Migrant integration 11 Immigration in the EU-28 Migration is influenced by a combination of economic, environmental, political and social factors: either in a migrant\u2019s country of origin (push factors) or in the country of destination (pull factors). Historically, the relative economic prosperity and political stability of the EU are thought to have exerted a considerable pull effect on immigrants. In destination countries, international migration may be used as a tool to solve specific labour market shortages. However, migration alone will almost certainly not reverse the ongoing trend of population ageing experienced in many parts of the EU. Figure I: Number of immigrants, EU-28, 2006\u201315 (millions) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Source: Eurostat (online data codes: migr_imm1ctz) A total of 4.7 million people immigrated to one of the EU-28 Member States during 2015, while at least 2.8 million emigrants were reported to have left an EU Member State. These total figures do not represent the migration flows to/from the EU as a whole, since they also include flows between different EU Member States. Over the last decade, intensity of immigration flows varied. About 3.7 million people immigrated to one of the EU-28 Member States during 2006. This number increased to 4.1 million during 2007 when it reached its peak. Over the following two years the number of immigrants gradually decreased and in 2010 it levelled off at 3.3 million where it remained until 2012. In 2013 the number of immigrated people started increasing again, with growth accelerating in 2014 and 2015. During 2015 the number of immigrants reached 4.7 million, representing the highest value since 2006 as well as the highest year to year increase (+ 900 thousand compared with 2014). ",
        "Introduction Migrant integration 12 Among the 4.7 million immigrants of 2015, there were an estimated 2.4 million non-EU citizens, 1.4 million citizens of a different EU Member State from the one to which they immigrated, around 860 thousand people who migrated to an EU Member State of which they had the citizenship (for example, returning nationals or nationals born abroad), and some 19 thousand stateless persons. Germany reported the largest total number of immigrants (1 543.8 thousand) in 2015, followed by the United Kingdom (631.5 thousand), France (363.9 thousand), Spain (342.1 thousand) and Italy (280.1 thousand). Germany reported the highest number of emigrants in 2015 (347.2 thousand), followed by Spain (343.9 thousand), the United Kingdom 299.2 thousand), France (298.0 thousand) and Poland (258.8 thousand). A total of 17 EU Member States reported more immigration than emigration in 2015, but in Bulgaria, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Latvia and Lithuania, the number of emigrants outnumbered the number of immigrants.

        "Introduction Migrant integration 14 There were 35.1 million people born outside the EU-28 living in an EU Member State on 1 January 2016, while 19.3 million people had been born in a different EU Member State than the one they were residing in. In Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Cyprus, the number of persons born in another EU Member State was higher than the number born outside the EU-28. The number of people residing in an EU Member State with non-EU citizenship on 1 January 2016 was 20.7 million, representing 4.1 % of the EU-28 population. In addition, 16.0 million persons were living in an EU Member States on 1 January 2016 with the citizenship of another EU Member State. In absolute terms, the largest number of non-nationals living in the EU Member States on 1 January 2016 was found in Germany (8.7 million), the United Kingdom (5.6 million), Italy (5.0 million), Spain (4.4 million) and France (4.4 million). Non- nationals in these five Member States collectively represented 76 % of the total number of non- nationals living in all of the EU Member States, while the same five Member States had a 63 % share of the EU-28\u2019s population. In relative terms, the EU Member State with the highest share of non-nationals was Luxembourg, as non-nationals accounted for 47 % of its total population. A high proportion of non-nationals (10 % or more of the resident population) was also observed in Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Austria, Ireland, Belgium and Germany.

        "1 Migrant integration Migrant integration 16 Introduction This chapter provides an introduction to the EU statistics on the integration of migrants. The successful integration of migrants into the society of the host country is key to maximising the opportunities of legal migration and making the most of the contributions that immigration can make to EU development. Migrant integration is measured in terms of employment, health, education, social inclusion and active citizenship in the host country. Two different concepts can be used to define the migrant population: \u2022 the concept of country of birth (COB); \u2022 the concept of country of citizenship (COC). Based on these concepts, two broad groups of migrant population can be defined. The data analysis in the articles on migrant integration is performed either by COB or COC, based on data availability and reliability per case. According to the concept of COB, the population can be divided into the following groups: \u2022 Native-born: the population born in the reporting country; \u2022 Foreign-born: the population born outside the reporting country, of which \u00ba EU-born: the population born in the EU, except the reporting country; \u00ba Non-EU-born: the population born outside the EU. Foreign population by COB is the population most commonly described as migrants, as these persons have migrated to their current country of residence at some stage during their lives. It includes persons with foreign citizenship as well as persons with the citizenship of their country of residence, either from birth or acquired later in life. According to the concept of COC, the population can be divided into the following groups: \u2022 Nationals: the citizens of the reporting country; \u2022 Foreign citizens: the non-citizens of the reporting country, of which \u00ba EU citizens: the citizens of the EU Member States, except the reporting country; \u00ba Non-EU citizens: the citizens of non-EU Member States. Foreign population by COC are foreign citizens residing in the EU Member States and EFTA countries. As citizens of another country, the members of this group are in a different situation than nationals with regard to their legal rights. This is particularly the case for non-EU citizens (third- country nationals). Persons in this group may have migrated into their country of current residence or may have been born there. ",
        "1 Migrant integration Migrant integration 17 1.1 Labour market The activity rate of the EU-28 population varies significantly according to citizenship. As illustrated in Figure 1.1, during the last eight years, citizens of non-EU countries have systematically recorded lower activity rates than the nationals and mobile foreign EU citizens. Since 2009, this gap has been increasing noticeably. Comparing nationals and non-EU citizens, the gap increased from 3 percentage points (pp) in 2008 to 8 pp in 2015 (and from 6 pp in 2008 to 12 pp in 2015 compared with mobile EU citizens). In 2015, the activity rate of non-EU citizens amounted to 69.8 % (a decrease compared with 70.5 % in 2014). There is an opposite trend amongst mobile EU citizens, for whom the activity rate increased from 81.3 % in 2014 to 81.6 % in 2015. The activity rate represents the economically active population (i.e. employed and unemployed persons) as a percentage of the total population.

This is even more evident for migrant women, since at EU-28 level, women with non-EU citizenship have a lower activity rate than male non-EU citizens by 25 pp, illustrating a wide gap in the labour participation of the migrant population by sex (see Figure 1.2). At country level, in 2015, the largest gender gaps in labour participation for non-EU citizens were observed in Luxembourg (35 pp), Malta (32 pp) and France (31 pp).

The cross-country comparison of the share of long-term unemployment in 2015 depicts a situation that varies significantly across those EU Member States for which data are available. In nine countries in particular, the share of long-term unemployment was lower for the foreign-born population aged 20\u201364 compared with the native- born population. By far the most significant gap in long-term unemployment between foreign- born and native-born population was observed in Cyprus, where the percentage of long-term unemployment of the foreign-born population was almost 11 pp lower than for the native-born. In the majority of the other EU Member States however, the foreign-born population has been more affected by long-term unemployment than the native-born population. The largest gaps were found in Denmark (14 pp), Sweden and Latvia (both 13 pp) and the Czech Republic (12 pp) (see Figure 1.5).

By contrast, the proportion of temporary employment for the young native-born population increased slightly, from 29.7 % in 2008 to 32.6 % in 2015. At Member State level different patterns stand out when COB and gender are analysed (see Figure 1.9). The highest proportions of temporary employment in the young non-EU-born population were found in the Netherlands (62.6 % for men), Cyprus and Portugal (both around 60 % of total employment for both genders, regardless of the COB \u2014 the rate for young women in Cyprus even exceeded 70 %). In 2015, 35.0 % of non-EU-born young women were temporary workers versus 33.6 % of native- born young women.

In Cyprus, regardless of gender, the gap in youth temporary employment between native- and non-EU-born was the highest of all countries for which data are available (around 36 pp for men and 49 pp for women). From the perspective of population groups by COC, the proportion of part-time employment among the foreign employed population (mobile EU and non-EU citizens) was higher than for nationals. At EU level, foreign citizens held a significantly higher proportion of part-time employment at the age of 20\u201364 than the nationals (25.8 % vs 18.4 %, respectively). Furthermore, the highest percentages of part-time employees were observed for foreign citizens with non-EU citizenship (28.3 %). However, in some EU Member States the trends were reversed (see Table 1.2). Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United Kingdom reported higher part-time employment among the employed nationals than among foreign citizens, with differences reaching a high of 7 pp in Luxembourg.

As can be observed in Figure 1.11, the highest proportion of people having completed at most lower secondary education (i.e. having attained only pre-primary, primary or lower secondary education) was observed among the non-EU-born population (35.5 %) in 2015. This share was 16 pp higher than for the native-born and 14 pp higher than the EU-born (except the reporting country) population. The proportions were reversed for educational attainment at the level of upper secondary and post-secondary education, at 33.2 % for the non- EU-born population, 15 pp lower than for the native-born population. At the level of tertiary education, the EU-born population recorded the highest share of such graduates (36.7 %). This proportion was 4 pp higher than for the native-born population and 5 pp higher than for the non-EU-born population. (2) The highest level of education completed successfully is associated with obtaining a certificate or a diploma, when there is a certification. In cases where there is no certification, successful completion is associated with full attendance.

One of the objectives of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training and the Europe 2020 Strategy is to make sure that the proportion of 30\u201334-year-olds with tertiary educational attainment should reach at least 40 % by 2020. Migrants will have a vital role to play in reaching this goal since in some EU Member States they form a significant proportion of the resident population. As can be observed in Figure 1.14, in some EU Member States such as Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, the abovementioned target has already been met by both the native- and foreign-born populations.

Available data showed that in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Portugal and the United Kingdom, more non-EU-born people aged 25\u201354 participated in lifelong learning than the native-born. Note that the participation in language courses and other integration-focused learning activities was also included in the concept of lifelong learning. The lowest rates (in EU Member States for which data are available) for the non-EU-born population aged 25\u201354 were reported iwn Cyprus (4.0 %), the Czech Republic (3.6 %), Croatia (2.8 %) and Greece (1.5 %).

However, it needs to be cautiously considered with other characteristics that are specific to the country of residence and certain features of that country\u2019s entire population.

        "1 Migrant integration Migrant integration 42 The foreign-born population is generally more likely to live in an overcrowded household than the native-born population. The overcrowding rate is usually correlated with other social inclusion indicators, in particular on income, and similarly to those indicators this rate is higher for the foreign- born population. In 2015 in the EU, the overcrowding rate for the foreign-born population aged 20\u201364 was 22.2 % compared with 16.5 % for the native- born population. Among the foreign-born, the non-EU-born population recorded a significantly higher overcrowding rate (24.5 %) than the migrants born in one of the EU Member States (17.9 %) (see Table 1.4). The highest overcrowding rates for the foreign- born population were observed in Hungary (51.2 %), Greece (50.8 %) and Italy (47.1 %). In contrast, Cyprus (2.9 %), Belgium (4.2 %), Malta (4.5 %), Ireland (6.3 %) and the Netherlands (6.4 %), with rates below 10 %, reported the lowest overcrowding rates of the foreign-born. The overcrowding rate is defined as the percentage of the population living in an overcrowded household. A person is considered as living in an overcrowded household if the household does not have at its disposal a minimum of rooms equal to: \u2022 one room for the household; \u2022 one room per couple in the household; \u2022 one room for each single person aged 18 and more; \u2022 one room per pair of single people of the same gender between 12 and 17 years of age; \u2022 one room for each single person between 12 and 17 years of age and not included in the previous category; \u2022 one room per pair of children under 12 years of age.

        "1 Migrant integration Migrant integration 43 The rate illustrates changes to the living conditions of individuals, e.g. decreases in disposable income or increases in living costs. The evolution of the housing cost overburden rate is thus used to illustrate the changes in housing cost during the last seven years for which data are available (see Figure 1.19). The housing cost overburden rates for nationals were significantly lower than those of non-EU citizens. The gap in the housing costs overburden rates between nationals and non-EU citizens decreased regularly from 2010 to 2013, falling from 21.4 to 16.7 pp. However, from 2013 to 2014 the housing cost overburden for non-EU citizens increased substantially (far more than for nationals), resulting in the widening of the gap to almost 2010 levels (19.3 pp). During the following year the gap slightly closed and in 2015 it stood at 18.8 pp. Figure 1.19: Evolution of housing cost overburden rate by groups of country of citizenship (total population aged 20\u201364), EU-28, 2009\u201315 (%) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Non-EU citizens EU citizens (except reporting country) Nationals Note: EU-27 for 2009.

        "1 Migrant integration Migrant integration 45 Using available data for 2015 for the age group 18\u2013 59, the rate of people living in households with very low work intensity in the EU was 11.0 % for nationals, compared with 12.4 % for all foreign citizens and 14.9 % for non-EU citizens (see Table 1.5). At country level, the highest rates of foreign citizens living in households with very low work intensity were reported in Belgium (26.3 %) and Finland (24.9 %). Luxembourg (5.6 %), Slovenia (6.0 %), Italy (6.5 %) and the Czech Republic (6.7 %) reported the lowest rates among the EU Member States. As regards non-EU citizens, the highest rates \u2014 among EU Member States with reliable data \u2014 were observed in Belgium (41.2 %) and Finland (34.3 %), while the lowest rates were found in the Czech Republic (0.5 %) and Slovenia (5.0 %). 1.5 At risk of poverty and social exclusion People living in households with very low work intensity are those living in households where the adults have worked less than 20 % of their total work potential during the past year. The \u2018at risk of poverty or social exclusion\u2019 (AROPE) refers to the situation of people who are either at risk of poverty, or severely materially deprived or living in a household with a very low work intensity. The AROPE rate, the share of the total population at risk of poverty or social exclusion, is the headline indicator monitoring the EU 2020 poverty target. It is defined as the share of people with an equivalised disposable income (after social transfer) below the at- risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. This indicator does not measure wealth or poverty, but low income in comparison to other residents in that country, which does not necessarily imply a low standard of living. ",

        "1 Migrant integration Migrant integration 49 While foreign EU citizens have higher median incomes than the nationals, the median incomes of non-EU citizens seem considerably lower. As shown in Table 1.7, at EU level (4) the median income of nationals was higher (EUR 17 131) than the corresponding income of the foreign citizens (EUR 15 380) in 2015. Looking at individual EU Member States, the greatest gaps between median income of the nationals and foreign citizens were found in Luxembourg (EUR 12 084), Sweden (EUR 10 548), Austria (EUR 8 920) and Denmark (EUR 8 231). The smallest gaps (below EUR 900) were observed in Malta, Latvia, the Czech Republic and Croatia. As for the gap in the median income among the foreign citizens\u2019 population, in all EU Member States for which data were available, the foreign EU citizens aged 20\u201364 had a higher median income than the non-EU citizens. (4) The income reference period is a fixed 12-month period (such as the previous calendar or tax year) for all countries except the United Kingdom for which the income reference period is the current year of the survey and Ireland for which the survey is continuous and income is collected for the 12 months prior to the survey.

        "1 Migrant integration Migrant integration 50 Children (aged 0\u201317) with a migratory background are exposed to a particularly high risk of poverty. A child is considered to have a migratory background if at least one of the parents living with him/her is a foreign citizen. A child is considered to be national if both parents living in the household are nationals or, if there is only one parent in the household, that parent is a national. As children usually do not have incomes of their own, they are assumed to share the income of their parents and others in the household. The at-risk-of-poverty rates for children with a migratory background are significantly higher than for children whose parents are both nationals at the EU level and in most of the EU Member States. While the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children of nationals was 18.9 % in 2015, the corresponding rate for children with migratory background stood at 37.4 % (see Figure 1.21). Spain (53.3 %), Sweden (52.6 %) and Greece (52.4 %) reported the highest at-risk-of-poverty rates for children with migratory background. On the other hand, the children\u2019s poverty rate was lowest in the Netherlands (16.8 %). It should be noted that in Latvia and the Netherlands children with migratory background had the smallest gaps in at-risk-of- poverty rates compared with children of nationals, while the largest gaps between migrant children and children of nationals were recorded in Sweden, Denmark, Slovenia and Greece.

        "1 Migrant integration Migrant integration 51 The in-work at-risk-of-poverty rate represents the employed population facing the risk of poverty. In 2015 in the EU it stood at 8.4 % for the native-born population aged 20\u201364 compared with 18.2 % for the foreign-born population, i.e. the rate of the foreign-born population was 9.8 pp higher than that of the native-born population (see Figure 1.22). The greatest differences between foreign- and native-born populations were found in Spain (21.1 pp), Greece (18.0 pp), Italy (16.4 pp) and Cyprus (15.5 pp). However, Ireland, Latvia and Lithuania had differences below 2.0 pp, meaning that both foreign- and native-born populations were exposed to a similar level of in-work at-risk-of-poverty rates. The in-work at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of persons who are at work and have an equivalised disposable income below the risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income. The material deprivation rate is an indicator that expresses the inability to afford some items considered by most people to be desirable or even necessary to lead an adequate life. It distinguishes between individuals who cannot afford a certain good or service, and those who do not have this good or service for another reason, e.g. because they do not want or need it. The indicator represents the percentage of the population that cannot afford at least three of the following nine items: \u2022 pay their rent, mortgage or utility bills; \u2022 keep their home adequately warm; \u2022 face unexpected expenses; \u2022 eat meat or proteins regularly; \u2022 go on holiday; \u2022 television set; \u2022 washing machine; \u2022 car; \u2022 telephone. Those who are unable to afford four or more items are considered to be severely materially deprived. Material deprivation plays a key role in defining the poverty and social exclusion goal of the Europe 2020 Strategy, which is to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million. As seen in Table 1.8, foreign citizens tended to face higher rates of severe material deprivation in the EU than the nationals, with the highest rates for foreign citizens in Greece (52.4 %). In Malta, Ireland and the United Kingdom the patterns were inverted, with the nationals having slightly higher rates of severe material deprivation. Within the population of foreign citizens, severe material deprivation tended to be most widespread among non-EU citizens (17.9 %). Among the countries with sufficiently reliable data, by far the highest rates of severe material deprivation of non-EU citizens were observed in Greece (55.6 %), followed by Portugal (29.8 %), Belgium (29.4 %) and Italy (25.2 %). The lowest were recorded in Sweden (5.3 %), the Czech Republic (6.7 %), Malta (8.3 %) and the United Kingdom (8.8 %). ",

        "1 Migrant integration Migrant integration 53 1.6 Active citizenship The acquisition of citizenship represents evidence of effective migrant integration and recognition in the hosting countries, offering them fully active citizenship rights. In 2014 around 890 thousand foreign citizens received citizenship of the hosting country out of a total of 34 million foreign citizens residing in EU-28 Member States (stateless and unknown citizenship categories included). The ratio between these two categories, defined as the naturalisation rate, was 2.6 % in 2014, slightly lower than the 3.0 % recorded in 2013. Ireland with 10.5 % and the Netherlands with 8.7 % were the two EU Member States which recorded the highest naturalisation rates of prior non-EU citizens, while two other Member States had a naturalisation rate above 7 %: Sweden (8.1 %) and Spain (7.5 %). The highest naturalisation rate for prior EU citizens was observed in Hungary (8.3 %), followed by Sweden (3.7 %), while Luxembourg, Malta, Finland and Latvia also presented naturalisation rates of at least 1.0 %. Only Hungary and Latvia recorded a higher naturalisation rate for prior EU citizens than for prior non-EU citizens (see Figure 1.23).

Non-EU citizens are usually granted a residence permit with a certain length of validity in the host country, depending on the national legal framework. A long-term residence permit is understood to have a validity length of 5 years or more and consequently offers safer residence status to non-EU citizens and by extension, more similar socio-economic rights and responsibilities to nationals (advanced active citizenship rights). Around 7.7 million long-term residence permits were issued to non-EU citizens and were valid in the EU at the end of 2015, i.e. 12 % more than at the end of 2014 when 6.9 million long-term residence permits were valid. The ratio between the number of long-term residents and the total of residents with residence permits at the end of the year i.e. \u2018the share of long-term residents\u2019 was 40.9 % in 2015, slightly higher than in 2014 and 2013 (38.8 % and 36.3 % respectively). Figure 1.24 presents the share of long-term residence for nearly 40 different citizenships which recorded shares of long-term residence of over 30 % at EU level. Recognised non-citizens represent a special category of non-EU citizens, living mainly in Estonia and Latvia, having similar rights as nationals (with some exceptions related for instance to the exercise of EU rights like free travel within the Schengen area). This explains a high share of long-term residents (97 %) of this category at EU level. Ecuador was the citizenship with the second highest share of long-term residents at EU-28 level with 67 %, followed by other seven citizenships with a significant share (with 50 % or greater): Somalia, Albania, Peru, stateless, Moldova, Nauru and Burkina Faso.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 56 Introduction This chapter looks at the first- and second- generation immigrant populations living in the EU and analyses separately those of EU and non-EU background. \u2018First-generation immigrants\u2019 are people born in a country other than their country of residence and whose residence period in the host country is, or is expected to be, at least 12 months. \u2018Second- generation immigrants\u2019 are native-born persons with at least one foreign-born parent. In addition to this breakdown by generation, the chapter looks into the differences between people with an EU and a non-EU migration background. In this context, the migration background of first- generation immigrants are based on their country of birth as follows: \u2022 \u2018EU background\u2019 if the country of birth is in the EU and \u2022 \u2018non-EU background\u2019 if it is not. \u2018EU mobile citizens\u2019 refers to people born in the EU, who live in another Member State than the one they were born in as a result of the free movement rights granted to EU citizens. Therefore, the terms \u2018first-generation immigrant born in the EU\u2019 and \u2018EU mobile citizens\u2019 are used interchangeably in this chapter. The migration background of a native-born resident is based on the country of birth of her/his parents as follows: \u2022 if neither parent is foreign-born, the native- born resident has a native background. \u2022 if at least one parent is foreign-born, the native- born resident is considered to have: \u00ba an EU background if at least one parent is born in the EU (including in the reporting country), and \u00ba a non-EU background if both parents are born outside the EU. In summary, a person\u2019s migration status together with their migration background results in the following five immigrant populations: \u2022 first-generation immigrants born in the EU (born in a country other than their country of residence and whose residence period in the host country is, or is expected to be, at least 12 months); \u2022 first-generation immigrants born outside the EU (e.g. born in a non-EU country); \u2022 second-generation immigrants of EU origins (e.g. native-born population with at least one foreign parent where at least one parent is born in an EU country, including the reporting one); \u2022 second-generation immigrants of non-EU origins (e.g. native-born population with both parents born outside the EU); \u2022 native-born of native background (i.e. native- born population whose parents are both also native-born).

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 57 2.1 Main characteristics The EU immigrant population (1) (including those born abroad and their immediate descendants) reached about 55 million in 2014, up from about 40 million in 2008. This period comes immediately after the flow of East European immigrants following the EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007. Accordingly, the EU immigrant population increased by almost two fifths (37.2 %) between 2008 and 2014, while the EU native-born population with native origins decreased by 2.8 % during the same period (see Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1: Relative difference across time by migration status and background, 2014 compared with 2008 (%) First-generation immigrants, born within the EU 58,7 First-generation immigrants, born outside the EU 53,7 Second-generation immigrants, of EU origin 11,8 Second-generation immigrants, of non-EU origin 33,4 Native-born with native origins -2,8 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Note: missing data for Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 58 Overall, in 2014, at least one in six people (or 17.6 %) residing in the EU was an immigrant, compared with about one in seven people (or 13.2 %) in 2008 (see Figure 2.2). Analysing the immigrant population as a whole shows that 44 out of every 100 immigrants in the EU were first-generation immigrants born outside the EU. This was the largest group of immigrants, and accounted for 7.7 % in the total EU population. By contrast, second- generation immigrants of non-EU origin were the smallest of the four groups of immigrants: only ten in a hundred immigrants (or 9.5 %) were second- generation of non-EU origin. In 2008, this figure was only 0.4 pp higher (9.9 %). This actually represents a 33.4 % increase in numbers for this category, as the proportion of the immigrant population as a whole in the total has increased significantly. In 2014, second-generation immigrants represented 6.1 % of the total population in the reporting countries, 0.9 pp more than in 2008. The total numbers of first-generation immigrants of both EU and non- EU origins on the other hand increased by at least 50%, and combined they represent 11.5 % of the total population of the reporting countries in 2014. This represents 3.5 pp more compared to 2008.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 59 In 2014, almost four fifths (or 79.7 %) of immigrants in the EU were living in just five Member States, namely Germany (20.5 %), the United Kingdom (19.4 %), France (19.3 %), Italy (10.8 %) and Spain (9.7 %) (see Figure 2.3). These five were also the largest Member States in terms of population, and together they accounted for 65 % of the total population aged from 15 to 64 and living in the 25 Member States that took part in the survey.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 60 Comparing the median age of the five migration groups shows that, in both reference years, the youngest group was second-generation immigrants whose parents were both born outside the EU. At EU level, 2014 estimates indicate that these immigrants\u2019 median age was 32.3 years, compared with 40.4 years for the native-born population without any migration background (see Figure 2.4). On average, the second-generation immigrant population was younger than all other migrant groups, despite the fact that those of EU origin were significantly older than those of non-EU origin (37.6 years and 32.3 years, respectively). Moreover, this migration group was the only one whose median age decreased slightly between 2008 and 2014, while for \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 the median age increased by up to 1.2 year. The median age of the first-generation immigrant population and the native-born population with a native background were similar.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 61 In 2014, native-born immigrants of non-EU origin were about eight years younger (median age) than both the foreign-born population and the native- born population with a native background. As a natural consequence of this, the share of the core working-age (25\u201354) population among native- born immigrants of non-EU origin was lower than among the other two populations. On average, 57.2 % of second-generation immigrants were aged from 25 to 54, compared with about 73.9 % of first- generation immigrants and 62.9 % of the native- born population with a native background (see Figure 2.5). Furthermore, the second-generation immigrant population of non-EU origins had the lowest share of young workers (54\u201364) with only 4.6 % compared with 20.7 % in the native-born population with a native background, which was the highest share.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 62 The fact that the first-generation immigrant population had a larger share of core working-age workers (25\u201354) at the expense of both young workers (15\u201324) and older workers (55\u201364) was the main factor differentiating them from the native- born population with a native background. Thus, 74.3 % of first-generation immigrants born outside the EU were in the core working-age group (25\u201354), which is 1.2 pp more than among first-generation immigrants born in the EU and 11.4 pp more than among native-born people with a native background. In a similar way to median age, the share of young workers (15\u201324) increased slightly between 2008 and 2014 for second-generation immigrant of \u2018EU origin\u2019 (1.7 pp), while being approximately constant for those of \u2018non-EU origin\u2019 and decreasing for all other groups.\u201d In 2014, the gender ratio for the native-born population of native origin was balanced, with only 0.2 pp more men than women (see Figure 2.6). By contrast, the proportion of women among the immigrant population, irrespective of the generation or migration background, was clearly higher than the proportion of men. The only exception was among second-generation immigrants of EU origin, where there were 0.2 pp more men than women. Therefore, there were about 3 pp more women than men among second-generation immigrants of non-EU origin, while for the foreign-born population, irrespective of migration background, the difference doubled to 6.6 pp (also in favour of women).

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 63 Looking at the trends over time, we see that the gender ratio was more balanced in 2008 than in 2014. Only the native-born population of native and EU origin was stable over time with an almost perfect gender balance. In contrast, the proportion of women in all migration groups except \u2018first- generation immigrants\u2019 increased. The increase was greatest among first-generation immigrants born outside the EU where the relative difference between women and men almost tripled from 2.4 pp in 2008 to 6.6 pp in 2014. Figure 2.7 indicates the strong tendency of the immigrant population towards settling in cities where labour markets are larger and infrastructure (e.g. hospitals, schools, universities, commodities) is better consolidated. Thus, in 2014 about three fifths (61.3 %) of immigrants of non-EU background were living in cities as opposed to almost a quarter (24.7 %) in towns and one seventh (13.9 %) in rural areas. Just under a half (47.6 %) of immigrants of EU origin were also living in cities compared with only about two fifths (38.5 %) of the native-born population without any migration background. A little more than half of each generation (56.3 % of first-generation and 53.1 % of second- generation) was settled in cities. This preference becomes clear when considering that, at EU level, the native-born population with native background was distributed more or less proportionally across the three urban areas, with only a very slight preference for cities (38.5 % in cities, 30.5 % in towns and 31.0 % in rural areas). The share of immigrants living in towns differed only slightly across the four migration groups, but immigrants of EU origin, irrespective of the generation, were more likely to settle in rural areas than those of non-EU origin: 23.0 % of immigrants of EU background and 13.9 % of immigrants of non-EU background were living in rural areas. Some 18.2 % of the total immigrants in the EU lived in rural areas. This was 12.9 pp less than among the native-born population with a native background.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 64 Citizenship expresses the relationship between an individual and a state and gives the individual specific legal rights and duties. The most important rights associated with citizenship are the protection by the state and unrestricted access to the territory and implicitly to the labour market. Even if alternative statuses (e.g. residence permit, work permit) may provide sufficient security of residence and strong protection against expulsion, ultimately it is \u2018naturalisation\u2019 that transforms a foreigner (2) into a citizen. Citizenship also brings additional privileges, such as diplomatic protection, the right to vote and access to public sector jobs, to name but a few. In the EU, not all foreigners have the same interest in obtaining the citizenship of their host country. More exactly, the acquisition of citizenship only secondarily concerns foreigners who are already EU citizens (i.e. citizens of an EU Member State). This is because EU citizens are already protected by legislation in force in all Member States and, with a few exceptions, should have largely the same legal rights as the citizens of the reporting country. Thus, the citizenship issue primarily concerns foreigners who are not EU citizens.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 65 Figure 2.8 shows that slightly over half of the first- generation immigrants born outside the EU were not EU citizens (they were citizens of a country outside the EU). It can then be approximated that the other half of first-generation immigrants born outside the EU obtained the citizenship of their host country. It is also possible that some of them obtained the citizenship of an EU Member State other than the country of residence, giving them the right to circulate freely inside the EU. But it is reasonable to assume that these cases are negligible. Following the same reasoning, a quarter of first-generation immigrants born in the EU also obtained the citizenship of their host country, which confirms the expectation that there is little incentive for EU citizens to acquire the citizenship of another EU Member State (in which they reside). In the overwhelming majority of cases, second- generation immigrants received the citizenship of the country in which they were born: 92.2 % of native-born immigrants with foreign origins were citizens of their reporting countries. At the same time, some 3 % of second-generation immigrants were citizens of an EU country other than the reporting one and another 4.1 % were citizens of a country outside the EU. Almost five in seven foreign-born immigrants had been living in the country for 10 years or more (69.4 %). The rest were almost equally divided between those who arrived in the country in the last five years (14.8 %) and those who had lived in the country for between 5 and 10 years (15.1 %) (see Figure 2.9).

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 66 Mainly social reasons made people move from their country of birth. In 2014, about half (49.5 %) of the people who decided to move from their country of birth to another country did so for the purpose of family reunification (see Table 2.1). The economic reason came in second: about three in ten (29.2 %) foreign-born people decided to move in order to find work in a country other than their country of birth. Many of them migrated without having previously found a job (20.4 %), while a few had already found one (8.8 %). The third reason to migrate was for educational purposes (6.6 %) followed closely by international protection and asylum (5.1 %). The order of reasons to migrate remains the same when analysing jointly the reason to migrate by sex and by length of stay, separately. However, the proportions differ. Thus, the proportion of foreign-born women (58.2 %) who decided to migrate for family reasons was a fifth (17.8 pp) more than the corresponding proportion among foreign-born men (40.4 %). Conversely, 15.1 pp fewer foreign-born women than men decided to migrate for work. In addition to this, we note that the proportion of foreign- born men who decided to migrate for family reunification (40.4 %) was similar to the proportion migrating for work (36.9 %), while the proportion of foreign-born women who decided to migrate for family reunification (58.2 %) was almost three times higher than the proportion migrating for work (21.9 %). Breaking down the reason to migrate by duration of stay shows that foreign-born immigrants who have been living in a country for less than 10 years migrated in similar proportions for both family reunification (39.8 % for less than five years and 34.3 % for six to nine years) and work (42.6 % for less than five years and 42.5 % for six to nine years). However, the proportion of foreign- born immigrants who have been living in the country for 10 years or more and who migrated for family reunification (53.7 %) was double the proportion of those who migrated for work (25.5 %). Also, the proportion of foreign-born immigrants who have been living in the country for 10 years or more and who migrated for educational purposes (4.9 %) was at least half of the corresponding proportion of those who migrated for education purposes and arrived in the country during the last five years (13.9 %).

Two separate household definitions are used, each of them being presented in detail in the glossary. In 2014, the EU had around 55 million immigrants aged 15\u201364, which made up 17.7 % of the corresponding EU population. These people lived in around 16.7 million \u2018immigrant households\u2019 and 9.4 million \u2018mixed households\u2019. These households made up 14.2 % and 8.0 % respectively of all households in the EU (see Figure 2.10). Looking at the national share of households with at least one immigrant adult, regardless of generation (i.e. \u2018immigrant households\u2019 and \u2018mixed households\u2019 taken together), Luxembourg recorded by far the highest proportion of such households, with about three quarters of all households in the country (74.4 %) belonging to this category. However, Luxembourg accounted for only 0.5 % of the total households in the EU with at least one immigrant adult. In the remaining countries for which data are available, the national share of households with at least one immigrant adult ranged from about two fifths in Latvia (39.8 %) and Estonia (38.8 %) to 0.3 % in Romania. The large share of \u2018immigrant households\u2019 observed in Latvia and Estonia is largely explained by the high proportion of what are called recognised non-citizens (mainly former Soviet Union citizens who are permanent residents in these countries but have not acquired Latvian/ Estonian citizenship or any other citizenship) in these two Baltic countries.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: lfso_14hhcompcob) Similarly to immigrant distribution across countries, households consisting only of immigrants (regardless of generation and combination of generations) were unevenly distributed across Member States. This is due to the fact that three quarters of them were hosted by just four reporting countries: the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. To put the statistic into context, these four countries accounted for 60 % of all households in the Member States that took part in the survey (see Figure 2.12). Moreover, 14 out of the 24 Member States with available data each held 1 % or less of the total \u2018immigrant households\u2019 living in the EU and all together accounted for only 6.6 % of all \u2018immigrant households\u2019 living in the EU.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 71 Looking at household composition, households consisting solely of immigrants tended more to be \u2018single-adult households\u2019 than the households consisting solely of natives with native background. Among \u2018immigrant households\u2019, the \u2018second- generation immigrant households\u2019 showed the largest proportion of \u2018single-adult households\u2019, namely 71 %, which is 39.1 pp higher than among \u2018native households\u2019 (see Figure 2.13). \u2018Mixed immigrant households\u2019 and \u2018mixed households\u2019 cannot be \u2018single-adult households\u2019. This is because they are composed of a minimum of two adult members. For \u2018mixed immigrant households\u2019, this could mean at least one first- generation immigrant and at least one second- generation immigrant. For \u2018mixed households\u2019, this could mean at least one native-born adult with native background and at least one immigrant adult, regardless of the generation. Nevertheless, \u2018mixed households\u2019 tended to be couples (76.9 %) more than \u2018mixed immigrant households\u2019 (52.2 %) did. The predominance of this type of household composition came at the expense of other types of households (i.e. with a minimum of two adults in the household for this particular case, but with no family links or links other than marital links). Among all household groups where all compositions are possible, \u2018native households\u2019 and \u2018first-generation immigrant households\u2019 were mostly couples. The largest proportion of \u2018couples with children\u2019 (46.2 %) was observed among \u2018mixed households\u2019 (i.e. consisting of immigrant adults alongside native- born adults with native background). By contrast, the largest proportion of \u2018single adults without children\u2019 (53.2 %) was noted among \u2018second- generation immigrant households\u2019.

A little more than half of \u2018first-generation immigrant households\u2019 had no children (52.0 %), which was 4.8 pp less than in households consisting solely of native-born adults with native background. As regards background (i.e. the country of birth of foreign-born adults in the households and of parents of native-born adults in the household), it is noteworthy that almost two thirds (or 62.8 %) of households consisting solely of adults with a non-EU background were \u2018long-term settled households\u2019 (see Figure 2.14). The \u2018EU background households\u2019 and \u2018mixed background households\u2019 were also mainly \u2018long-term settled households\u2019 (37.8 % and 45.7 % respectively).

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 73 2.3 Labour market indicators The activity rate represents the economically active population (i.e. employed and unemployed persons) as a percentage of the total population. For the population aged 25\u201354, the activity rate in 2014 was 86.2 % for the \u2018native-born with a native background\u2019 or 0.7 pp higher than in 2008. Similar activity rates were found amongst \u2018second- generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018EU origins\u2019 (recording a slightly higher activity rate of 87.4 %) and \u2018first- generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018EU origins\u2019 (85.6 %). For both, increases were recorded from 2008 to 2014 (of + 0.4 and + 1.8 pp respectively). On the other hand, activity rates of the \u2018non- EU\u2019 migrant groups were significantly below the figures for the \u2018native-born with a native background\u2019 (8.4 pp lower for the immigrants born in a non-EU country and 2.9 pp for \u2018second- generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019). While foreign-born residents of non-EU origin registered a decrease between 2008 and 2014 (\u2013 0.8 pp), the native-born residents of non-EU origin registered an increase (+1.7 pp). When analysing data by sex (see Figure 2.15), in 2014 the activity rates of males aged 25\u201354 stood at more than 90 % for all the groups analysed, ranging from 90 % for both \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second- generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 to 93 % for \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018EU origins\u2019. The activity rate of those \u2018native-born with a native background\u2019 was in between, at 91.7 %. Overall for males there was a slight decrease compared with 2008, which impacted \u2018second- generation immigrants\u2019 the strongest in absolute terms (\u2013 0.9 pp). The labour market participation of women, on the other hand, although slightly higher than in 2008 for all categories except \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 born outside the EU, was still much lower than that of men in 2014 for all the migration statuses analysed. Specifically in 2014 this gap ranged from 7.5 pp for \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018EU origins\u2019 to 23.4 pp for \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019. The percentage of women in the latter category active on the labour market stood at 66.5 % in 2014 (down from 67.2 % in 2008), compared with 79.0 % for the women born in another EU country and 80.7 % of the \u2018native-born with a native background\u2019. Another interesting feature when analysing the activity rates by migration status and gender is that activity rates slightly decreased for men across all the migration statuses, while in the case of women significant increases (above 1.9 pp) were recorded in all statuses except the \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018non-EU origin\u2019.

In 2014, an estimated 81.1 % of the active population aged 25\u201354 belonging to \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018at least one parent born in the EU\u2019 was employed (see Figure 2.16). This employment rate was 2.5 pp above the rate presented by the \u2018native-born with a native background\u2019 and 15.6 pp higher than the employment rate of \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019. Immigrants with \u2018EU origins\u2019 presented higher employment rates than immigrants with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 in both the first (11.6 pp difference) and second-generation (7.1 pp more) groups. Between 2008 and 2014, the ranking did not change among the various migration statuses and origins, and the overall EU employment rate decreased in all groups except for foreign-born of non-EU origin for which there was an +0.7 pp increase. The decrease magnitudes were specific to the \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018non-EU origin\u2019 (\u2013 4.7 pp). The decrease in employment rates was less apparent within the migrant groups with \u2018EU origins\u2019 (less than 1.0 pp), while the \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 experienced a 2.2 pp drop between 2008 and 2014. When looking at trends in the employment rates of those 25\u201354 by educational attainment (see Figure 2.17), all groups experienced decreases in employment rates between 2008 and 2014, with the exception of \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018EU origins\u2019 with a \u2018high\u2019 level of educational attainment (for which there was an increase of 0.5 pp). Natives and \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 with a \u2018low\u2019 level of education registered sharp decreases in their already low employment rates (reaching 7.4 pp for the \u2018first generation\u2019 with \u2018non- EU origins\u2019 and 7.1 pp for the native-born with native background). The decreases were more moderate for those with a higher level of education, ranging from 3.8 pp in the case of \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 to 1.5 pp for \u2018first- generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018EU origins\u2019. Highly educated \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018EU origin\u2019 even registered a small increase of +0.5 pp. The impact of the global financial and economic crisis was strongest on the immigrants with \u2018non- EU origins\u2019 and lowest on those with \u2018EU origins\u2019. These findings can be translated into increases in the gap between those with \u2018low\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019 educational attainment levels in most migration statuses (except the \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018EU origins\u2019), confirming the main tendency of greater employability within the population pursuing higher academic education. In 2014, the employment rates of the population 25\u201354 with \u2018low\u2019 educational attainment varied from 54.6 % to 55.5 % in \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second- generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 to 65.5 % to 68.2 % in \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second-generation immigrants with \u2018EU origins\u2019. The employment rate of \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 with at most lower secondary education completed stood between that of immigrants with \u2018EU origins\u2019 and \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 (60.1 %). In the case of the highly qualified, employment rates were higher than 85 % for \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018EU origins\u2019 and \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 (89.4 % and 87.1 % respectively) and lower than 75 % for those born in a non-EU country (namely 74.3 %).

In 2014, the employment rates of \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 increased substantially with their duration of stay, from 52.1 % for those having been in the country for less than 5 years to 68.3 % for those that already resided for more than 10 years. This was not the case for immigrants born in another EU country, as their employment rates were relatively stable (from 75.6 % to 76.3 %) and did not vary much based on their duration of stay. The same patterns can also be observed for the year 2008. In terms of trends, an overall decrease in the employment rates between 2008 and 2014 can be noted for all the groups analysed, but it was particularly steep for immigrants with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019. The magnitude of the decrease lowers with the time spent in the resident country, as it ranges from \u2013 12.0 pp for the most recently settled (less than 5 years) to \u2013 4.6 pp for the ones that have spent more than 10 years in the host country.

It was higher than 17 % for all migration statuses, reaching as high as 28.9 % for immigrants with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019. Another general characteristic of youth unemployment, observed in all migration statuses, was the steeper increase of the unemployment rates between 2008 and 2014, as the unemployment rate almost doubled for this age group, while it was slightly more moderate for those aged 25\u201354. On the other hand, a similar trend as for those aged 25\u201354 was observed, as the highest increases in the unemployment rates were noted for immigrants with \u2018non-EU origins\u2019, regardless of the generation (of around 10.5 pp to 1.2 pp).

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 80 2.4 Employment The International standard classification of occupations (ISCO) classifies the occupation status of employed persons into 10 major categories. Four broader categories of employees can be distinguished (armed forces are excluded): \u2022 high-skilled white collar (ISCO codes 1,2 and 3) includes legislators, senior officials and managers, professionals and technicians and associate professionals; \u2022 low-skilled white collar (ISCO codes 4 and 5) includes clerks and service workers and shop and market sales workers; \u2022 high-skilled blue collar (ISCO codes 6 and 7) includes skilled agricultural and fishery workers and craft and related trades workers; \u2022 low-skilled blue collar (ISCO codes 8 and 9) includes plant and machine operators and assemblers and elementary occupations. In terms of occupational structure, the \u2018native- born with native background\u2019 and the \u2018second- generation immigrants\u2019 showed a more similar pattern, while the comparison with \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 was more divergent (see Figure 2.21). This difference comes from the general tendency of \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 to work in less qualified jobs (elementary occupations and service workers were the two most common occupational categories for them in 2014), while both \u2018second- generation immigrants\u2019 and \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 were engaged in a larger proportion in jobs requiring higher qualifications (especially professionals and technicians). \u2018Second- generation immigrants\u2019 were much more often employed in highly skilled occupational categories (which frequently require tertiary education), even when comparing with the \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 (52.4 % work in ISCO codes 1\u20133 occupations, compared with 42.0 % of the natives). On the other hand, \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 tend to be younger, and therefore more qualified on average, compared with the \u2018native-born with native background\u2019. In 2014, more than one in four \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 in the EU was employed in \u2018unskilled blue collar occupations\u2019 (\u2018plant and machine operators and assemblers and elementary occupations\u2019). These occupational categories include jobs which in general require a low level of qualifications (i.e. primary education). By comparison, in both the \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 and \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 groups, only 13 or 16 out of every hundred employees undertook this kind of occupation. On the other hand, almost 1 in 3 \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 in the EU were employed in highly skilled office occupations (\u2018senior officials, managers\u2019, \u2018professionals\u2019 and \u2018technicians\u2019). These occupational groups consist generally (but not always) of highly qualified workers with a first or second stage of tertiary education, leading to an advanced research qualification. By contrast, a little more than half of \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 and 4 in 10 \u2018natives with native background\u2019 worked in these highly qualified occupations. This shows that the labour market conditions of \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 were much better compared with those of the first generation. It is interesting to note that, while the percentage of those employed in low skilled white collar occupations (administrative and service jobs) was the same for all the migration statuses (around 26.0 %), a smaller share of immigrants, especially of \u2018second-generation\u2019 worked in skilled blue collar occupations (8.7 % and 13.1 %, compared with 16.5 %). The latter comprises the categories ",

Part of the explanation could be that these activities are linked to family labour force and to resources (land, ships and tools) passed down through generations of \u2018native- born with native background\u2019. Another possibility is that the labour force working in these areas (especially skilled agricultural and fishery workers) is more concentrated in countries in which fewer immigrants exist. The structural change of the economy over the 2008\u201314 period had a stronger impact on the occupational structure of immigrants (especially the second generation), while for \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 the changes were minimal. The general trend consisted of an increase in more professionalised and service oriented jobs (so called \u2018white-collar\u2019 jobs), accompanied by a decrease in low skilled occupations linked to production and other manual jobs, noted especially in the case of immigrants. The proportions of those employed in \u2018white- collar occupations\u2019 presented an increase within all migration statuses, reaching a growth of 5.1 pp among \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 for highly skilled non-manual jobs and 3.7 pp among \u2018first- generation immigrants\u2019 and 2.3 pp among natives for the low skilled ones. On the other hand, the percentages of people working in \u2018unskilled blue collar occupations\u2019 was lower in 2014 than in 2008, especially for the second (\u2013 3.0 pp) and first (\u2013 1.5 pp) generations of immigrants. The same trend can be noticed for skilled manual jobs, for which the decrease was even stronger in both relative and absolute terms (\u2013 3.6 pp for the second generation and \u2013 4.3 pp for the first one).

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 83 When analysing the distribution of employment by type of activity among the three migration statuses, the difference between \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 and \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 was less than when analysing their occupational structure. As can be seen in Table 2.2, in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Croatia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland the most common activity sector of a \u2018first-generation immigrant\u2019 worker was \u2018manufacturing\u2019. Hungary was the only Member State where \u2018wholesale and retail\u2019 ranked first and only Italy, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg did not have it in their top three activity sectors. It was the second most common activity sector for \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 to be employed in the overall EU aggregate. France, Sweden and the United Kingdom were the EU Member States where it was more likely for \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 to work in \u2018human health and social work activities\u2019. The high number of immigrants in France and the United Kingdom placed this activity sector in third place within the EU aggregate. The \u2018activities of household as employers\u2019 were the most common for \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 in Spain and Cyprus, and the second most common in Italy. Greece and Malta had the greatest share of their foreign-born immigrants working in \u2018accommodation and food activities\u2019 \u2014 linked to the importance of the tourist sector in these economies. Luxembourg\u2019s situation was particular among EU Member States with its top three activities reflecting the predominance of its specific and specialised economy: \u2018financial and insurance activities\u2019, \u2018activities of extraterritorial organisations and bodies\u2019 and \u2018professional\u2019 activities. Self-employed persons work in their own business or professional practice; in 2014, they made up 18.9 % of the employed EU \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 population \u2014 the highest value among the five migration statuses being analysed (see Figure 2.22). \u2018Second-generation immigrants\u2019 were the group least likely to be self-employed (ranging from 14.6 % for those of \u2018EU origins\u2019 to 11.5 % for those with both parents born outside the EU). The self-employment share of \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 was also higher among immigrants of \u2018EU origins\u2019 (16.7 %) than among those of \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 (15.5 %). Since 2008, there has been a general tendency towards an increasing share of self-employment, \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 presenting the largest increase (from 14.0 % in 2008 to 15.5 % in 2014) while for \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 only a slight increase (+0.2 pp) was observed.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 85 In 2014, 11.9 % of the EU employees who were \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 had a temporary contract, meaning that their main job would terminate after a pre-defined period, or after the completion of a given task (see Figure 2.23). This value was only lower in the case of \u2018second- generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018EU origins\u2019 (10.8 %). For \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 the share of employees with temporary contracts was 13.0 % while in the case of \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019, the values were 14.9 % for those of \u2018EU origins\u2019 and peaked at 17.0 % for those of \u2018non-EU origins\u2019. Regardless of the generation, immigrants of \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 were more likely than those of \u2018EU origins\u2019 to hold temporary employment contracts. It should be noted that \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019, regardless of their origin, were more likely to have a temporary employment contract as opposed to \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 or \u2018native-born with native background\u2019. From 2008 to 2014, there was a slight increase in the share of temporary contracts among \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 employees, while there were contradictory trends among the immigrant groups. The outcome was more positive in the case of \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019, given the decrease in the share of temporary contracts. The opposite was true for \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019, for whom the proportion of those having a temporary contract increased from 10.7 % to 10.8 % (\u2018EU origins\u2019) and from 12.5 % to 13.0 % (\u2018non-EU origins\u2019). Although the trend is positive, amongst \u2018first- generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018non-EU origin\u2019 there is still the highest proportion of temporary contract amongst employees. Part-time employees are persons whose usual working hours are less than the normal working hours. It can be either voluntary (e.g. for family reasons) or involuntary (when the person would like to work more hours but cannot find a suitable contract). This analysis does not distinguish between the two because of sample size limitations. Figure 2.24 shows the predominance of part- time work in the EU female population across all immigrant statuses, with differences always exceeding 18 pp compared with the male population. \u2018First-generation immigrants\u2019 of both \u2018EU origins\u2019 and \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 showed the highest rates of part-time employment, reaching over one third in the case of female employees and 6.7 % (\u2018EU origins\u2019) and 12.7 % (\u2018non-EU origins\u2019) of male employees in 2014. Among men, the \u2018first- generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 were the category with the highest share of part-time work, which was more than triple that of the native men of native origin. The share of part-time workers amongst employees was higher for \u2018second- generation immigrants\u2019 than in the case of \u2018native- born with native background\u2019 and lower than amongst \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019. This was the case regardless of the gender, with the exception of men whose both parents were born outside the EU and accounted for the second highest share of part-timers. Also, regardless of the gender and the generation, the proportion was higher amongst immigrants of \u2018non-EU origins\u2019 than those of \u2018EU origins\u2019. Given these patterns, it is likely that the share of the employees working part-time who are not in this situation by choice is higher in the case of immigrants, particularly when they only have \u2018non-EU origins\u2019. The prevalence of part-time work increased in all categories except for \u2018native-born with native background\u2019 and \u2018second-generation immigrant\u2019 women of \u2018EU origins\u2019, for which it decreased. The gender gap showed diverging trends, as it increased for \u2018second-generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018non-EU origin\u2019 (by 10 pp) and \u2018first-generation immigrants\u2019 of \u2018EU origins\u2019 (by 1.1 pp only), while it decreased for the other categories.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 87 2.5 Education and obstacles to work People need skills and qualifications if they are to participate successfully in the labour market; this is particularly true for immigrants. Skills can be acquired through education and training (including training on the job). Data on qualifications, measured by highest level of educational attainment, are an important indicator of the skills on offer in the labour market, as they provide a wide range of information on individuals\u2019 attributes and chances of getting a good job. When looking at the highest level of educational attainment, significant differences can be noticed between first- and second-generation immigrants and native-born residents with native backgrounds (see Figure 2.25). In 2014, the highest proportion of tertiary graduates was observed among second- generation immigrants (38.5 % for those of EU and 36.2 % for those of non-EU origin), while the lowest was among first-generation immigrants born outside the EU (29.4 %). The proportion of tertiary graduates among EU mobile citizens was between that of native-born residents with foreign and those with native backgrounds. Overall, the EU attracts quite a high proportion of highly skilled immigrants.

The trend over time is similar for all groups, in line with the general increase in the proportion of tertiary graduates and a decrease in the proportion of those with up to lower secondary education. The biggest relative increase was among second-generation immigrants of both \u2018EU origin\u2019 (+ 6.7 pp) and \u2018non- EU origin\u2019 (+7.3 pp).

The over-qualification rate is the number of over-qualified people as a percentage of the labour force. Two indicators of over-qualification are presented: \u2022 objective over-qualification (the proportion of tertiary graduates working in jobs for which a degree is not required, ISCO levels 4\u20139); and \u2022 subjective over-qualification (the proportion of employed persons declaring that their qualifications and skills would allow them to carry out more demanding tasks). ",
        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 89 In 2014, over a third of first-generation immigrants with a tertiary degree worked in a job that did not require that level of education (ranging from 34.3 % for those born in the EU to 36.2 % for those born elsewhere), as compared with around a fifth of native-born residents with native backgrounds and second-generation immigrants (see Figure 2.26). Compared with 2008, this applied to slightly fewer first-generation immigrants born outside the EU (\u20131.3 pp), but significantly more EU mobile citizens (+ 7.2 pp). This may be related to the increased number of citizens from the countries that joined the EU most recently (Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia) who were subject to labour market restrictions in some countries until 2014. There was also an increase in the proportion of over-qualified native-born residents (+ 1.6 pp) and second- generation immigrants of whom both parents were born outside the EU (+ 1.9 pp). Figure 2.27 shows the percentage of people in each migration group who perceived themselves as over-qualified for their main current job, based on a comparison of their qualifications and skills with the tasks they carry out. All respondents who had a job were asked about this, regardless of whether they were actually doing it in the reference week. At aggregate level, the resultant values and pattern seem to be very similar to those obtained by analysing objective over-qualification, even though the reference populations differ (all the employed population for the subjective and employed tertiary graduates for the objective measure) and the coverage is therefore not the same in all cases. First-generation immigrants are much more likely to declare themselves as being over-qualified for their job (almost a third, as compared with around a fifth of those born in their country of residence, regardless of background). The percentage declaring themselves to be over-qualified is slightly higher among first- and second-generation immigrants of non-EU origin than among those of EU origin. Second-generation immigrants with at least one parent born in the EU are the migration group with the lowest percentage.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 93 As expected, there was a correlation between better language skills and educational attainment, but it was less evident than that between better language skills and time spent in the host country (see Figure 2.31). On average, around 80 % of tertiary graduates were native or proficient speakers of the host country\u2019s main language, while this applied to just over one half of foreign-born residents with only primary education. The differences by migration background were insignificant. In 2014, the proportion of highly skilled persons was higher among immigrants than among native-born with native background. Despite a high level of education, two major indicators showed difficulties which immigrants, especially first-generation immigrants, faced on the EU labour market: their unemployment and over- qualification rates were higher than those of native-born residents with native background. Migration-specific work obstacles like language and communication barriers, lack of recognition of foreign credentials and experience, restricted rights to work and discrimination on social and religious grounds may have contributed to this situation. With regard to work obstacles, there were substantial differences between first- and second- generation immigrants. As second-generation immigrants were raised and educated in the host country, they did not face the same obstacles as their immigrant parents or other first-generation immigrants. Therefore, the two generations should be dealt with separately.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 94 However, both generations had two things in common. About half of first-generation immigrants and about two thirds of second-generation immigrants did not mention any particular obstacle to finding a suitable job, this being the most common response for both generations (see Figure 2.32). Also, just under a third of both generations, regardless of having EU or non-EU origins, encountered a work obstacle other than the four migration-specific ones. As the analysis from this point on will primarily look at specific difficulties faced by immigrants in finding a suitable job, we disregarded the groups\u2019 responses of \u2018no particular obstacle\u2019, \u2018other obstacle\u2019 and \u2018unknown\u2019. That being said, we noted that the lack of language skills was the most common obstacle preventing first-generation immigrants from finding a suitable job, affecting about 1 in every 10 foreign-born immigrants, irrespective of where they came from. Regarding the lack of recognition of qualification obtained abroad \u2014 the second most common migration-specific work obstacle \u2014 it is interesting to note that first-generation immigrants born outside the EU were more affected than their counterparts born within the EU, which is not surprising given the progress on standardising European degrees under the Bologna system. In any event, the relative difference was small, at 2 pp. Similarly, first-generation immigrants born outside the EU were more affected by work restrictions as they do not have the same civil and work rights as EU/ EEA citizens. Only 1.4 % of EU mobile citizens ( ) cited this as their major problem in finding a suitable job, compared with 3.7 % of first-generation immigrants born outside the EU. However as an obstacle, work restrictions came after discrimination on social and religious grounds, which affected 2.4 % of EU mobile citizens and 4.3 % foreign-born residents of non-EU origin.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 95 Just little over 2 % of first-generation residents encountered obstacles to work but could not identify a specific/main one. The situation was very different for second- generation immigrants. Less than 1 % experienced language or communication barriers. This could be due to their level of education rather than migration background. However, the fact that 3.5 % of second-generation immigrants with at least one parent born outside the EU faced discrimination on social and religious grounds can surely be explained by their migration background. The proportion of second-generation immigrants who encountered obstacles to work without identifying a specific/ main one is about twice that of those facing no particular obstacle. Analysis of the different age groups reveals that about three fifths of both young (aged 15\u201324) and older (aged 55\u201364) foreign-born workers faced no particular obstacle, compared with two fifths of foreign-born workers in the core working age group (aged 25\u201354) (see Figure 2.33). As for the first-generation immigrants who are in the core working age (aged 25\u201354) or older workers (aged 55\u201364), the structural distribution of the four migration-specific obstacles analysed follows the overall pattern: the most common obstacle was the lack of language skills, followed by lack of recognition of qualifications, discrimination on social and religious grounds and restricted right to work. By contrast, young foreign-born workers (aged 15\u201324) faced mainly language or communication problems and to a similar extent problems related to lack of qualifications, work restrictions and social and religious discrimination. The few second-generation immigrants who faced one of the four migration-specific obstacles were concentrated in the core-working age group (aged 25\u201354). Similarly with first-generation immigrants, mainly younger (aged 15\u201324) and older workers (aged 55\u201364) among second-generation immigrants faced no particular obstacles.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 96 Figure 2.34 shows that there was no notable difference between men and women when analysing obstacles to work as a result of migration background. The only difference arose when looking at second-generation immigrants encountering social and religious discrimination, where men seemed to be somewhat more affected than women.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 97 Looking at foreign-born residents, the higher the education level, the higher the proportion of those facing difficulty in gaining recognition of their qualifications (see Figure 2.35). However, the higher the education level, the lower the proportion of these immigrants encountering language barriers. Therefore the most common migration- specific work obstacle among first-generation immigrants with high-level education was lack of recognition of qualifications obtained abroad while among those with low-level education the most common obstacle was lack of language skills. Among first-generation immigrants with medium- level education the two obstacles had a similar importance. This situation could be due to the fact that language skills improve with the education level, and because of the lower need to recognise foreign qualifications for jobs that do not require higher education. The social and religious discrimination varied slightly with education level, with the most affected being foreign-born residents with medium-level education. As expected, the work restriction obstacle was not correlated with education. The highest proportion of those who did not experience any work obstacle was seen among first-generation immigrants with low-level education.

        "2 First- and second-generation immigrants Migrant integration 98 Among second-generation immigrants, there was no significant structural difference in the obstacles people experience based on which of the three major educational attainment levels they had reached. For both generations in all three education levels, the most common response remained \u2018no particular obstacle\u2019 followed by \u2018other obstacles\u2019. However the differences in proportions were affected by changes in the total proportion of migration-specific work obstacles rather than by the education level itself. Work obstacles are correlated with the length of stay in the host country. As Figure 2.36 shows, the longer the number of years spent in the host country, the smaller the proportion of foreign-born residents affected by one of the four migration- specific obstacles. In fact, the total proportion of those facing migration-specific work obstacles was reduced to about half, from 33.3 % for those who had lived in the host country for 5 years or less to 17.5 % for those who had lived there for 10 years or more. The largest decrease was seen for command of the main host country language: only 6.2 % of foreign-born residents who had been living in the host country for 10 years or more still faced linguistic barriers, compared with about a fifth of those who arrived during the last 5 years. Work restrictions due to citizenship or residence permits were also reduced by 3.3 pp. On the other hand, the proportion of foreign-born immigrants facing religious and social discrimination increased by about 1 pp for each group, broken down by each category of time spent in the host country.

In order to improve readability of this statistical book, only the most significant meta-information has been included under the tables and figures. The following symbols are used, where necessary: Italic data value is forecasted, provisional or estimated and is likely to change; : not available, confidential or unreliable value; \u2013 not applicable. Breaks in series are indicated in the footnotes provided under each table and figure. This publication generally presents information for the EU-28 (the 28 Member States of the EU), as well as the individual EU Member States. The order of the Member States in tables and figures generally follows their order of protocol; in other words, the alphabetical order of the countries\u2019 names in their respective original languages; in some of the figures the data are ranked according to the values of a particular indicator. The EU-28 aggregate is provided when information for all of the countries is available, or if an estimate has been made for missing information. Any incomplete totals that are created are systematically footnoted. When available, information is also presented for EFTA countries, candidate and potential candidate countries. In the event that data for any of these non-member countries are not available, they have been excluded from the tables and figures presented. If data are not available for a particular country, then efforts have been made to fill tables and figures with data for previous reference periods (these exceptions are footnoted); generally, an effort has been made to go back at least two years, for example showing data for 2013 or 2014 if data for 2015 are not yet available.

The successful integration of migrants into society in the host country is key to maximising the opportunities of legal migration and making the most of the contributions that immigration can make to EU development. In this publication, migrant integration is measured in terms of employment, education, social inclusion and active citizenship in the host country. The analysis is based on 2015 statistics from the Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) and Eurostat\u2019s migration statistics. In addition, this publication provides an analysis on the labour market situation of migrants and their immediate descendants based on the outcomes of the 2014 ad-hoc module of EU-LFS. Data are presented for the European Union and its Member States as well as for the EFTA countries. For more information http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ "
