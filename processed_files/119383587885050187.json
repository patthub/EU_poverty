        "vii Abstract Access to energy is a crucial pre-condition for further economic development of the African continent. Sub-Saharan Africa is blessed by an array of renewable energy sources which together provide a strong potential. Even though the current penetration of renewable energy in SSA is limited, apart from biomass and hydro, the future potential is substantial. Biomass, solar energy (PV, solar thermal as well as CSP) and hydropower can all play their part, while wind and geothermal have strong roles to play as well \u2013 all depending on the geographic context. This potential is currently underutilised due to limited demand, non-existing or incomplete grids, and policy frameworks which require substantial advancement. Despite previous investments in renewable energy in the region, the knowledge about their effectiveness and efficiency is partial and fragmented. EU-SSA research cooperation in this area can contribute substantially to medium- to long-term renewable energy take-up in the region. It can also strengthen the market position of EU players in areas where they are strong and globally competitive. RET-specific research themes have thereto been proposed, including traditional and advanced bioenergy (biofuels, biogas, bioenergy value chains), various solar technologies (PV, solar heating and cooling, CSP), small-scale hydro and geothermal energy. Transversal research topics proposed include support to research infrastructures, resource mapping and assessment, impact assessment, innovative SMES and grid improvements (including energy supply modelling and smart hybrid mini-grids). The assessment of research themes suggests there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019. The variety of themes suggested calls for a tailor-made approach, where a menu of instruments could be deployed: \uf0b7 Axis 1: Dedicated SSA capacity building (e.g. dedicated H2020 Network actions); \uf0b7 Axis 2: Enhanced mobility of researchers (e.g. Marie Sklodowska-Curie); \uf0b7 Axis 3: Dedicated EU-SSA research cooperation (e.g. dedicated H2020 Africa call); \uf0b7 Axis 4: Mainstream research cooperation (e.g. H2020 Calls for proposals); \uf0b7 Axis 5: Targeted EU development cooperation (e.g. DEVCO, including EU-ACP cooperation); \uf0b7 Axis 6: Targeted bilateral cooperation (in targeted areas). Evidently, the right sequencing of these research themes is crucial. We recommend that the initial focus is on dedicated SSA capacity building (including enhanced mobility of researchers), accompanied by selected participation in mainstream research cooperation (e.g. in CSP) and targeted EU development and bilateral cooperation in complementary areas. In the medium-term, dedicated EU-SSA research cooperation (e.g. a H2020 Africa call) could focus on bioenergy. Such an initiative would need to build on e.g. a Technical network on Bioenergy. In the longer term, this would strengthen the potential of the SSA-region to participate in mainstream research cooperation as well.

        "ix Executive summary Purpose of the study For several decades already, Europe has invested in renewable energy in the SSA region through traditional development-aid cooperation. The aim of DG R&I is however to identify whether there is a basis for true partnership \u2013 which is a radically different starting point. Promotion of sustainable energy is a major issue for both the EU and Africa. It represents an opportunity to engage with global players and to strengthen international partnership initiatives. EU cooperation with Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) can therefore be intended as a two-way process: 1. The EU can play a supportive role in upgrading the means of development by enlarging and enhancing the energy access, namely in rural areas, and by supporting the improvement of capacities in the deployment of innovative technologies in the field; 2. Sub-Saharan Africa can become a strong partner in energy production, as well as a market to export innovative technologies and capitalising on research investments of EU institutions and businesses by providing new markets for EU actors. Against this background, the objective of this study is to generate the information needed to enable the formulation of a clear answer to the question whether and how to launch a research and innovation programme related to SSA energy needs and RE potential, that would be equitable and beneficial for both the EU and the Sub-Saharan region, in the area of renewable energy. Methodology and approach The study consists of 8 tasks, which build on each other and which have all been carried out in order to reach the aims of the study. This Final Report presents the key findings regarding the Tasks 1 to 8. It is built up from four different building blocks: \uf0b7 Building block 1: Regional scoping : two Scoping reports have been produced in the period February \u2013 April 2014 with the aim to understand the global picture with regard to RE potential across the region. A report has been made for South Africa and Other Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 as the situation in the two parts of the region is quite different. These reports have been complemented by an assessment of RE potential in 14 selected countries to a sample including about 150 organisations: universities, research centres, government agencies, NGOs, and a few private businesses; \uf0b7 Building block 2: Thematic research : 7 Renewable Energy Technology (RET) reports have been produced in the period May \u2013 July 2014 on biomass, hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, ocean energy and grids. They have been carried out according to a harmonised research format and structure, assessing current and future penetration, drivers and barriers, research needs, and existing research supply; \uf0b7 Building block 3: Field visits and regional workshops : a total of 9 field visits and three regional workshops have been held in the period October \u2013 November 2014. Country visits were made to Burkina Faso, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, Mauritius, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. Regional workshops with leading academics, government officials, energy operators, private sector representatives and NGOs were held in West Africa (Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso), South Africa (Johannesburg) and East Africa (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); ",
        "x \uf0b7 Building block 4: Matching with EU needs \u2013 research needs identified in the SSA region have subsequently been matched with EU needs through the development of research fiches and reviewed during a validation workshop in Brussels (February 2015), in the presence of industry associations, leading academics, government representatives and NGOs. Results and findings Substantial potential for future renewable penetration in SSA Even though the current penetration of renewable energy in the SSA region is limited apart from biomass and hydro, the future potential is substantial. Bioenergy (in particular traditional fuels) will remain the most important source of energy for a majority of SSA countries over the next decades. The main changes will come from afforestation and diversification of resources: biomass-energy will be produced not only from firewood and charcoal, but also from agro-industries\u2019 biomass residues, biofuels and biogas from agricultural and urban waste. There is substantial potential to more efficiently use these resources for households (improved cook stoves). Collective and domestic biodigesters are tested in several pilot projects in Mozambique, Mauritius, Uganda, Ethiopia, Ghana, etc. Substantial potential exists for the further use of waste \u2013 e.g from industries using biomass, such as sugar cane factories, bakeries or tea industries. Research in the region is focusing on cellulosic biomass (wood and straw residues), non-food crops, organic part of urban waste, etc. There is also significant potential in SSA for scaling up a market-based cogeneration model as a supplier of rural electrification and industrial services. Liquid biofuels could play a more important role in the fuel mix of SSA countries, for transport, industrial use and for power generation and cooking, particularly in areas with significant rainfall. With the support of international donors, a great number of projects are on the way and show the interest for these technologies. The cost competitiveness and maturity level of hydropower has made this technology a leading RET in SSA, with a current capacity of 24 000 MW. In many countries the potential sites for large hydropower plants have been tapped, but there is still a very significant potential, especially at the small/mini/micro scales. When assessing the possible hydropower capacity by 2040, the total is estimated to be nearly 60 000 MW. Solar power offers a variety of opportunities. Solar home systems are now moving from a development-aid supported market to a commercial business activity with many manufacturers providing products designed for African customers. The market for hybrid PV-diesel systems is slowly growing in some countries, mainly thanks to development aid. In Mali the market is growing fast because of a strong government will. Considering current trends and announced projects, it is aimed for that in a couple of years the annual market for large multi-megawatt PV power plants in SSA will cross 0.5 GWp per year. The market for solar water heaters in SSA is mainly concentrated in South Africa, and the same applies to concentrated solar power (CSP) where South Africa is strongly committed to. Wind energy offers potential particularly in Southern and Eastern Africa. A number of projects are currently being constructed (954 MW across the region) or in concept phase (765 MW). Provided that 80 % of projects currently being in development phase are completed with the proposed capacity, a further 760 MW power will be generated - a 118 % increase of the current capacity (644 MW). ",
        "xi Africa\u2019s geothermal power potential is concentrated in the Rift Valley countries and the theoretical potential is estimated as high as 15 000 MW, though more conservative and realistic, estimates are between 7-9 000 MW. The commercially viable potential is estimated at 3-5 000 MW. Only around 200 MW of this potential has been developed for electricity generation. Major investments are now taking place in Kenya. Geothermal potential has also been identified in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The outlook for ocean energy in SSA is that in the coming years more and more devices will be put in the water for long-term testing. By 2020 the first real power plants should be in the water to provide a first understanding of the real costs until 2025. By 2030 the deployment should be ready. A need to focus on countries with basic policy framework conditions in place The IEA Medium-term Renewable Energy Market Report 2014 1 reiterates that renewable energy investments can only grow if policy frameworks are in place \u2013 which is often not yet the case. This report corroborates with these findings and has demonstrated that the large-scale uptake of renewable energy requires an advanced policy framework (accompanied by a stable investment climate) which needs to be developed consistently over a longer period of time. It requires ownership unbundling and sector regulation in the power sector; the removal of hidden subsidies for power generation from fossil sources and appropriate Feed-in tariffs; an assessment of RE potentials and subsequently defined planning approach for RE deployment, and suitable instruments for the promotion and support of RE technologies including a set of financial incentives. It also requires the cooperation of a whole range of actors, including policy makers, energy regulators, municipalities, foreign and domestic investors as well as access to public and private financing. As demonstrated by the presentation of policy initiatives in South Africa, the development of renewable energy requires above all political will to reform the energy sector and to create appropriate structures and financing channels. It is indeed the government\u2019s role to push forward the necessary regulatory reforms and the promotion of RE. We consider the following countries to be most advanced in their regions: Ghana, Mali, Cape Verde (West Africa), Cameroon (Central Africa) Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda (East Africa), South Africa, Mauritius, Mozambique and Namibia (Southern Africa). Take into account the limited but growing R&I capacities in Renewable energy While many SSA countries share similar characteristics and face similar challenges, there are also wide disparities, South Africa being most advanced. Although carried out in several places, basic research in renewable energy is rather rare in the SSA region \u2013 and most activities focus on technology conversion and \u201cfrugal\u201d innovation. A large part of R&I activities revolves around domestic and rural energy needs (e.g. off-grid electrification, efficient cooking, efficient lighting). Offering low-tech, low-cost solutions to poor and remote communities is crucial. Due to the focus on the adaptation of RE technologies to the local capacities and needs, the outreach of most SSA- based R&I activities remains limited to a local audience. African scientists and researchers are not well represented in the international arena: they have few publications, few patent applications, and demonstrate only limited participation in international conferences. The legal protection of patents is limited across the SSA region as well, and its enforcement is often problematic. However, Africa is also characterised by its dynamics of change. While enrolment in tertiary education in SSA is dramatically lower than in any other part of the world, it also has the fastest growth rate. And if the number of players actively involved in RE remains small, with energy now recognised as a major instrument for economic development, several universities and research 1 IEA (2014) \u201cMedium-Term Renewalbe Energy Market Report\u201d See http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/MTrenew2014SUM.pdf ",
        "xii centres were created in recent years. All these changes will undoubtedly contribute to dramatically improve R&I capacities in SSA in the coming years. Build on the interest of existing R&I players: improvement of living conditions The main focus of existing R&I players is energy access in view of improving living conditions . Hence, most activities revolve around domestic energies, small-scale applications and biomass management. A lot is done to adapt existing technologies to local materials, to local markets, according to the principles of \u201cfrugal innovation\u201d. Many SSA players have the required capacity to work on high impact, high visibility research projects in these fields; cooperation with European research institutions is already in place. However, the outreach of most R&I activities conducted in SSA is very limited : few publications, few patents applications. As mentioned, African researchers and inventors lack visibility at the global level. It seems sometimes that, due to lack of efficient capitalisation and dissemination mechanisms, the wheel keeps being reinvented over and over. On a positive note, the structures that could help improving the visibility are already in place: namely, international cooperation networks and Africa-based scientific journals. RET needs in the SSA region: technology conversion and \u2018frugal\u2019 innovation The overview of RET specific needs confirms the overall importance of applied research, demonstration and testing (including plans for new or improved products, processes or services) rather than basic research. Key terms are \u2018technology conversion\u2019 and \u2018frugal\u2019 innovation. These actions should however be developed together with private sector players, who need to invest in the development of business models that are adapted to the SSA needs. Access to resource mapping is key, and there is a strong interest in learning about the impacts of renewable energy technology \u2013 thus confirming the commitment to R&I actors to contribute to the improvement of living conditions. There appears ample scope for mobility initiatives , however these need to be carefully positioned within the broader brain drain forces that are exerted over the region. Within this context it would be worthwhile to explore how the role of South Africa as a knowledge hub can be exploited \u2013 e.g. cooperation programmes which would include EU actors, South African actors and other SSA actors \u2013 thus producing mobility solutions that could be more effective than mainstream solutions. In addition to the above RET-specific needs, we have identified a number of transversal R&I needs that deserve separate coverage. These are power control technologies, smart meters, energy limiters and storage solutions. Progress in each of these domains can substantially improve conditions for the take-up of RE technologies in the SSA region. Sustainable renewable energy development needs to be accompanied by rigorous Impact assessment Renewable energy in itself is not necessarily positive or negative for the economy, society or environment. Much depends on how and where renewable energy technology projects will be designed, built, operated and financed. Clearly, positive impacts can be strengthened and negative impacts can be dampened by a thorough project preparation, solid business models, engagement of local expertise and population, etc. Impact analysis is therefore called for \u2013 not only by international donors and renewable energy experts but equally so by local SSA stakeholders. Such analysis of impacts is especially important in the SSA region where many citizens and stakeholders are not well-placed to engage, and where such impacts can be unprecedented in size and scope if not well-thought through. Indeed, the ",
        "xiii development of RE projects requires such assessments as part of feasibility studies, project preparation and site selection, especially as impacts can be so different depending on the specificities of the projects. The EU \u2013 as global leader in sustainable development practices \u2013 has a reputation to keep up in this area and can position itself clearly from other global players active in the region. However, information about these impacts in the specific context of the SSA region is limited and it proves difficult to work with long term baseline scenarios in the context of SSA and to formulate assumptions. When thinking through economic impacts , it could well be that limited progress in the RE field to date has to do with vested market interests and structures: there are substantial economic interests related to the fossil fuel economy \u2013 both in legal as well as illegal parts of the economy \u2013 and many of these players are not particularly keen to give up their positions for the sake of renewable energy. Thus, renewable energy roll-out can also be seen as a powerful instrument to produce structural economic change, to break energy monopolies and to bring more transparency and competition to markets. Depending on the type of technology, the scale of roll-out and the ability to build up local competences, renewable energy can generate substantial employment \u2013 even though employment losses in traditional fuel economy may need to be accounted for as well. Also important are health as well as educational effects , as well as broader social and gender aspects. Renewable energy deployment can also produce powerful environmental gains , mostly related to the reduction of fossil fuels usage. However, substantial differences exist between RE technologies, and care should be taken in promoting those with unforeseen and unexpected detrimental effects, including use of valuable land and water . Overall, small-scale projects are favourable over large-scale, because this allows for more flexibility when mitigating detrimental effects, especially so in the field of hydropower. Engage with regional cooperation structures that work Across the SSA region, various regional cooperation initiatives exist, and some are more effective and advanced than others. Clearly, there are strong differences in institutional set-up between the sub-regions and it is important to take note of this variation. Across the SSA region, the African Union Commission provides the strategic framework for pan-African socio-economic development (NEPAD), and Research and Development (Science and Technology) is considered crucial to inform policy making. Three Regional Renewable Energy Centres exist in the region and these are considered promising. The ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) is by far the most developed \u2013 as it is in place since 2010 and at an already advanced stage in its programme implementation including in the field of R&I activities. The other two regional centres for the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency (EACREEE and SACREEE) are not yet operational. In Southern Africa, the SADC plays a key role in the regional cooperation as well. The South African government is committed to investments in Science and Technology as well. Across the region, several institutes and universities are currently working towards networks of excellence. The Regional Power Pools are less well-placed to coordinate renewable energy research development, but are crucial for promoting cross-border grid connectivity \u2013 especially important for accommodating large-scale hydropower plants. International cooperation: a challenge to prevent overlap, fragmentation and demonstrate the value added of true partnership Promoting Renewable Energy in SSA is becoming a major objective, if not the priority, of most IFIs including the World Bank, AFdB and EU (DEVCO and EIB). There is a multitude of initiatives, with still some overlapping in spite of the coordination efforts at local level. In itself, there are plenty of financial resources available from the World Bank, the EIB and others. ",
        "xiv Needs related to energy programming, identifications of projects, policy reform, institutional development and capacity building are pretty well covered (even with some overlapping). Funds are available to finance RE pilot projects with the following main constraints: \uf0b7 The private sector is still reluctant to invest in RE; \uf0b7 Knowledge of RE potential, technologies or success stories is not widely diffused. This creates doubts on the advantages of investing in RE projects, especially from the private sector, the energy utilities and the public authorities; \uf0b7 There is a lack of good private sector project proposals and a limited local capacity in making pre/feasibility studies; \uf0b7 Even if not perfect, cooperation is developing. For example, AFD/KFW and EIB are frequently associated in the funding of SSA RE projects; \uf0b7 Financial resources for feasibility studies are unknown or information about them is confusing. However, the focus of most international cooperation initiatives in the area of renewable energy is currently on hard investment. At the same time, \u2018soft\u2019 actions (often taken by the EU) are often not targeted to the renewable energy sector. This leaves substantial room for additional initiatives which focus on EU-SSA research cooperation and capacity building in the area of renewable energy . Identification of areas of potential common interest between SSA and the EU A package is presented through two complementary angles: RET-specific research cooperation (13 research themes) and transversal research cooperation (7 themes). For each of the resulting themes, the following information is provided: 1) Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation; 2) Justification/background information; 3) Scope of possible research and cooperation; 4) Benefits/Impacts for SSA; 5) Benefits/Impacts for Europe; and 6) Possible Cooperation Forms.

A first assessment ",
        "xv shows that all research themes identified have positive scores on several of the criteria identified. Although there is some variation, none of the themes presented has a poor score which would allow it to be ignored for further assessment. Towards a menu of research cooperation The assessment of research themes suggests there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019. Instead, the variety of themes suggested requires a tailor-made approach, where a menu of instruments could be deployed: \uf0b7 Axis 1: Dedicated SSA capacity building (e.g. dedicated H2020 Network actions); \uf0b7 Axis 2: Enhanced mobility of researchers (e.g. Marie Sklodowska-Curie); \uf0b7 Axis 3: Dedicated EU-SSA research cooperation (e.g. dedicated H2020 Africa call); \uf0b7 Axis 4: Mainstream research cooperation (e.g. H2020 Calls for proposals); \uf0b7 Axis 5: Targeted EU development cooperation (e.g. DEVCO, including EU-ACP cooperation); \uf0b7 Axis 6: Targeted bilateral cooperation (in targeted areas). Towards a staged research cooperation Evidently, the right sequencing of these research themes is crucial. We recommend that the initial focus is on dedicated SSA capacity building (including enhanced mobility of researchers), accompanied by selected participation in mainstream research cooperation (e.g. in CSP) and targeted EU development and bilateral cooperation in complementary areas. In the medium-term, dedicated EU-SSA research cooperation (e.g. a H2020 Africa call) could focus on bioenergy. Such an initiative would need to build on e.g. a Technical network on Bioenergy. In the longer term, this would strengthen the potential of the SSA-region to participate in mainstream research cooperation as well. Key success factors An efficient programme to support long-lasting scientific cooperation in RE should activate several levers in a coordinated manner: joint research projects but also joint publications, communications, conferences; student and researcher exchange programmes; professional networks; capacity building; etc. These various actions call for different instruments, so coordination among these instruments towards a shared goal is a key success factor.

        "1 Introduction Promotion of sustainable energy is a major issue for both the EU and Africa. It represents an opportunity to engage with global players and to strengthen international partnership initiatives. EU cooperation with Sub-Saharan Africa can therefore be intended as a two-way process: 1. The EU can play a supportive role in upgrading the means of development by enlarging and enhancing the energy access, namely in rural areas, and by supporting the improvement of capacities in the deployment of innovative technologies in the field; 2. Sub-Saharan Africa can become a strong partner in energy production, as well as a market to export innovative technologies and capitalising on research investments of EU institutions and businesses by providing new markets for EU patenting and standardisation. It is therefore of vital importance for the EU to fully understand the energy needs and development potentials across Sub-Saharan Africa based on the promising range of renewable resources available across the continent. The objective of this study is to generate the information needed to enable the formulation of a clear answer to the question below on whether and how to launch a research and innovation programme related to SSA energy needs and RE potential, that would be equitable and beneficial for both the EU and the Sub-Saharan region, in the area of renewable energy. Both ToR and proposal distinguish a range of 8 tasks, which build on each other and which have all been carried out in order to reach the aims of the study. This Final Report presents the key findings regarding the Tasks 1 to 8. It is built up from four different building blocks: \uf0b7 Building block 1: Regional scoping : two Scoping reports have been produced in the period February \u2013 April 2014 with the aim to understand the global picture with regard to RE potential across the region. A report has been made for South Africa and Other Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 as the situation in the two parts of the region is quite different. These reports have been complemented by an assessment of RE potential in 14 selected countries to a sample including about 150 organisations: universities, research centres, government agencies, NGOs, and a few private businesses; \uf0b7 Building block 2: Thematic research : 7 RET reports have been produced in the period May \u2013 July 2014 on biomass, hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, ocean energy and grids. They have been carried out according to a harmonised research format and structure, assessing current and future penetration, drivers and barriers, research needs, and existing research supply; \uf0b7 Building block 3: Field visits and regional workshops : a total of 9 field visits and three regional workshops have been held in the period October \u2013 November 2014. Countries visits were made to Burkina Fasso, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, Mauritius, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. Regional workshops with leading academics, government officials, energy operators, private sector representatives and NGOs were held in West Africa (Burkina Fasso), South Africa (Johannesburg) and East Africa (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); \uf0b7 Building block 4: Matching with EU needs \u2013 research needs identified in the SSA region have subsequently been matched with EU needs through the development of research fiches and reviewed during a validation workshop in Brussels (February 2015), in the presence of industry associations, leading academics, government representatives and NGOs. This Report follows closely the tasks from the ToR and has been structured as follows: Overview of renewable energy policy (Chapter 1, Task 1); Overview of RE penetration (Chapter 2, Task 2); Impacts of RE penetration (Chapter 3, Task 3); Overview of R&I capacities (Chapter 4, Task 4); ",
        "2 Overview existing regional cooperation (Chapter 5, Task 5) and international cooperation (Chapter 6, Task 6). The report then focuses on the Identification of areas of potential interest between SSA and EU in the area of RES (Chapter 7, Task 7) and Conclusions and Recommendations for EU- SSA international cooperation in the field (Chapter 8, Task 8). This report has two sets of Annexes: \uf0b7 Annex report \u2013 Tables and listings providing the evidence for findings; \uf0b7 7 RET reports each under separate cover (Biomass, Hydropower, Solar energy, Wind energy, Geothermal, Ocean energy and Grids). The information and views set out in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official opinion of the Commission. The Commission does not guarantee the accuracy of the data included in this study. Neither the Commission nor any person acting on the Commission\u2019s behalf may be held responsible for the use which may be made of the information contained therein. ",
        "3 1 Overview of renewable energy policies This chapter provides and overview of the main national renewable energy policies in place in the region. It is a response to Task 1 from the Terms of Reference which \u201c requests an overview for the current and planned policies regulating energy, energy infrastructure, and renewable energy based on the work being done in other relevant projects\u201d. The Chapter starts with an overview of existing RE policies, plans and instruments in the SSA region (Chapter 1.1). Specific attention will then be paid to the situation in South Africa (Chapter 1.2) due to the relevance of the country when it comes to the RE market development and the related regulatory framework. A short overview of the investment climate is provided (Chapter 1.3), while conclusions are finally drawn (Chapter 1.4) on the main characteristics of the existing RE- related regulatory framework across SSA. Renewable energy policy is not only shaped at national level, but also through existing regional and international cooperation initiatives. These will be reviewed later in this report (Chapters 5 and 6). More detailed policy fiches are provided in Annex 1 (under separate cover). 1.1 Existing RE policies and plans in the SSA region Rationale and ambitions The most propitious contexts for RE deployment are found in countries that have: i) Implemented ownership unbundling and sector regulation in the power sector; ii) Removed barriers related to hidden subsidies for power generation from fossil sources, iii) Assessed their RE potentials and subsequently defined a planning approach for RE deployment, and; iv) settled in place suitable instruments for the promotion and support of RE technologies including a set of financial incentives. These evolutions are only possible in countries which have achieved a certain level in their electrification rate. In the cases of countries where this rate is low, the priority is to extend the grid for supplying least-cost power (e.g. fossil-based electricity) to urban centres and to adapt the generation capacity to cope with fast growing power demand. In such environment, RET are just seen as an option for providing basic services to rural communities, based on small-scale technologies such as solar home systems, solar or wind-powered water pumping systems, pico- hydro systems and improved cooking stoves. i) Ownership unbundling and sector regulation The unbundling of African power markets, where in many cases a state-owned utility had been the active arm of the government for developing electricity generation and distribution throughout the country, started in the late 1990s. West African coastal countries such as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Togo and Nigeria have developed a dense and interconnected grid achieving significant results in terms of electrification rate. Sectorial reforms were implemented in these countries with particular success in Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire where power generation, transmission and distribution has been unbundled and only transmission kept under the public umbrella. This is also the case in Cameroon. In Kenya and Uganda, agreements are in place with private entities for power generation but transmission and distribution remain under the responsibility of state-owned utilities. In an unbundled energy market, the next steps for the participation of the private sector in power generation are: i) The free and properly regulated access to the grid for the IPPs, and ii) The possibility to sell at a suitable rate through PPAs. This is generally well achieved through the creation of an independent regulatory body with a clear mandate to set and enforce tariffs and ",
        "4 regulations. The mandate of an effective regulator covers the issuance of concessions licenses for generation, transmission and distribution, the definition and approval of tariffs, the rules and regulation enforcement and dispute settlements. A well-resourced and independent regulator, as well as suitable tariff structure are key enablers for the involvement of independent project developers for grid-connected RE systems. Such well-established regulators are found in Ghana, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Kenya and Uganda and there are regulators in most of the Southern African countries. ii) Removing barriers: a favourable tariff environment In many countries hidden subsidies are given to fossil fuels, either through government aid to national utilities which sells power at prices below their generation costs or through tax cuts/subsidies on fuels for power generation. The selling tariffs to end customer are often artificially kept low because of social pressure towards governments. In such environment the development of RE generation with higher costs is strongly hampered, and among RETs only hydropower can attract investors. The removal of hidden subsidy to national utilities is a necessary step, even for the sustainability of the utilities themselves. Except for Namibia which has undertaken initiatives to make conventional energy tariffs cost-reflective and a recent tariff increase in Ghana, the actual progresses are very slow in this matter. Undervalued tariffs represent a serious barrier for RE development in the distributed generation segment, especially in countries where a uniform tariff is applicable to urban customers served by the national grid and rural customers served by minigrids. In the minigrids segment, higher investment required for RET makes the commercial activity of IPP unsustainable in such tariff environment. The implementation of suitable Feed-in tariffs (FiT), pertaining to the grid-tied segment is also quite slow in Africa, while this instrument is recognised as a highly effective mechanism if well implemented and managed. The following countries have implemented or are progressing in the implementation of FiT: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Namibia, Ethiopia, Botswana, and Nigeria. Recently Ghana has published its FiT, unfortunately adversely affected by the depreciation of the cedi. Commenting a December 2012 study on the development of FiT schemes in Africa 2 , the head of the NEPAD programme highlights that \u201cnothing is more effective in the development of a renewable energy policy than learning from those countries that went through the same exercise, and to access their lessons learned and experiences gained.\u201d South-South and North-South cooperation regarding the effective design of suitable FiT measures would be very valuable for improving effectiveness of such initiatives in Africa and their replication. iii) Assessing RE potential and planning The first step of a planning approach for RE development is the assessment of the various RE potentials. Highly valuable work has been done by the JRC and IRENA in this domain, but continued in-depth analyses of the RE potentials are still required. Furthermore, access to information about RE potentials needs to be accessible to decision-makers and stakeholders involved. Based on these assessments, development goals can be set, including targets, master plans and implementation strategies. We will return to the issues of assessing RE potential in the subsequent analysis of research needs (Chapter 4). 2 World Future Council (WFC), the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation (HBF) and Friends of the Earth, \u201cPowering Africa through Feed-in tariff Policies Advancing renewable energy to meet the continent\u2019s electricity needs\u201d, Dec 2012. ",
        "5 iv) Instruments and actors In many countries the only public institutions in charge of renewable energy are the Ministries of Energy, sometimes with a dedicated department. Some countries have put in place dedicated public agencies or structures. This is the case in Mali with the ANADEB (for biofuels) and plans to establish a National Agency for Renewable Energies that will include the existing CNESOLER research centre, in Ghana with the Renewable Energy Fund (not yet funded), in Namibia with the Solar Electrification Revolving Fund, in Cameroon the creation of such RE Agency is planned under a 2011 law. In Kenya there is no agency but activities related to geothermal energy are conducted through the state-owned Geothermal Development Co. Generally, there are rural electrification public structures that are implementing electrification projects that include RE components, mainly solar PV. In some cases the Ministry of Environment has a say in RE, in parallel to Ministry of Energy, which may create confusion and delays in planning and decision making. The investments in the African power sector remain quite conventional with a predominant share of development aid (ODA) funding. The same pattern is valid for RE. Private investments are so far very limited and mainly concentrated on investments in hydropower. As an example, in ECOWAS, investment in the power sector amounted in 2011 for \u20ac 1.9 bn, spread as shown in the table below. Table 1.1 ECOWAS investment in the power sector by funding source (2011) Source Year 2011 (\u20ac bn) Share Public sector 0.69 36 % ODA 0.55 29 % Non-OECD financiers (China, India and other) 0.60 31 % PPI 0.08 4 % Source: ECOWAS, Baseline Report for the ECOWAS Renewable Energy Policy (EREP), Oct. 2012 Public investments are largely tax \u2010 financed and executed through central government budgets, in the form of grants and soft loans. Grants are used for pre \u2010 investment activities (e.g. measurements, feasibility studies, financial structuring) as well as the investment phase (investment subsidy, interest rate subsidy, element of soft loan). While operation and maintenance expenditure is largely financed from user charges and executed via state \u2010 owned utilities. It is necessary to distinguish the financing of large \u2010 scale RE projects from those of medium to small \u2010 scale. Whereas most of the large \u2010 scale projects are commercial, smaller RE project require other financing models. The lack of appropriate regulatory framework enabling the development of large renewable energy projects constitutes a barrier for private investors. The generally tense financial situation of ",
        "6 the public utilities and the reluctance in pro-active tariff adjustments are also limiting factors in the confidence of potential investors. Furthermore, the rates charged to residential, commercial or industrial consumers do not enable full cost recovery. To balance these deficits, subsidy policies have been implemented in almost all countries. The World Bank considers that these hidden costs are absorbing in Africa 1.9 % of GDP on the average 3 . Most of the time this type of large projects gather together actors into consortia, that implement the project. In general such a consortium comprises a manufacturer; an operator specialized in power generation, and a pool of banks. Of course the key factors for projects\u2019 promoters are economic and financial viability. The two key elements of sustainability are (i) the selling price per kWh produced and the purchase guarantee by either the national operator or by a new operator in the field of distribution (ruled by the PPA) and (ii) the access conditions to the transmission/distribution grid securing the delivery of produced energy (wheeling rules). These two conditions then require contractual commitments that are clear and stable over time to understand and monitor, and being part of a national favourable regulatory framework. Furthermore RET access to the grid requires clear technical regulations, that need to be approved by the regulatory authority and applied to the sectors operators. This securing framework is not yet really implemented in Africa. Feed \u2010 in tariff policies can provide a favourable environment for investors, but they need to be adjusted continuously. In Europe, the challenge has been to offer just enough incentive to attract the private investment but not so much that free \u2010 riders are involved. This well-tuned regime is yet to be developed in Africa. Small-scale RE projects within the rural electrification segment are facing low energy consumption density and limited power purchase ability when compared to investment required. These projects are often requiring high level of capital and transaction costs during their preparation and implementation (organisational and social engineering and intermediation, difficulty of managing a broad customer base). These conditions are not attractive for large utilities. Financing and developing this segment through either a national electricity company or private utilities is only possible in countries that have an electrical industrial sector which is somewhat advanced. That is why the model based on a dedicated rural electrification agency and/or fund has been promoted in many countries in Africa. But the present situation of these funds shows 4 that many of them are still not operational today and few are the ones that really act as financing institutions having a status of credit institution. Even if some are allowed to borrow, these funds appear incapable of securing available resources from cooperation institutions that finance the conventional electrical sector, with or without State guarantee. In addition, they generally have limited capacity to offer suitable financing products like concessional loans, guarantees, acquisitions of holdings, etc. Their activities are often limited to the distribution of subsidies without security, sometimes in the absence of business plans. Only a few 3 Brice\u00f1o \u2010 Garmendia and others, 2008 4 An analysis of the achievements of rural electrification agencies and funds is available in \u201cFinancing rural electrification programs in Africa\u201d, Club-ER, Dec 2010 ",
        "7 of them have integrated renewable energy solutions into their scope of activities (e.g. mini \u2010 grids, stand \u2010 alone systems). It is important that their tasks and orientation be re-examined, and that with proper staff and expertise, their prime area of focus becomes rural electrification using renewable energy resources. Rural electrification private operators are not investing as anticipated. They hesitate to take the risks and commercial banks are hesitant due to the small size of the investments. Operators generally rely on rural electrification agencies/funds to help them finance investments through direct granting of subsidies or loans. That is why development aid is very active in the small \u2010 scale RE segment. Multilateral and Bilateral Development Banks play a key role in the development of RET in this segment. The World Bank Group remains a major contributor in financing projects with small capacities. Indeed, these institutions can help countries in designing such programs and projects by using their technical expertise in the domain of rural activities and encouraging international networks to help these countries to find creative ways to finance such renewable energy projects as well as to design cost \u2010 effective procurement standards and procedures. Additionally ODA support may concern capacity building, market monitoring activities, coordination, public information programme, support to business development, support and funding rural electrification funds. 1.2 Overview of South African policies Within the SSA region, South Africa plays a crucial role as it is in many ways the most advanced country and the largest market for RE on the continent. It has also an advanced RE policy and it is important to pay particular attention to its various components, namely the evolving policy framework, and the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). We will also provide some information on the main actors and funds. An evolving policy framework The RE policy framework in South Africa has gradually evolved over a period of 15 years already. It has led to an accumulated 30 policy/acts/accords on this subject. The overview is more complicated by the fact that all three tiers of Government (i.e. National, 11 Provinces and 280 municipalities) as well as energy provider Eskom have their own views, policies and initiatives. Although the National Development Plan provides a thin line binding the many policy initiatives together, interpretation and implementation differs between actors involved. The original White Paper on Energy Policy (1998) has been written so as to clarify government policy regarding the supply and consumption of energy for the next decade. The policy strengthened existing energy systems in certain areas, called for the development of underdeveloped systems and managed to bring about extensive change in a number of areas. It ",
        "8 addressed international trade and co-operation, capacity building, and the collection of adequate information. The document is comprehensive, addressing all elements of the energy sector as practically as it can. The White Paper on Renewable Energy Renewable (2003) was concerned with meeting the following challenges: 1) Ensure that economically feasible technologies and applications are implemented; 2) Ensure that an equitable level of national resources is invested in renewable technologies, given their potential and compared to investments in other energy supply options; and 3) Address constraints on the development of the renewable industry. The key policy principles for renewable energy were defined as follows: \uf0b7 Full cost accounting (pricing policy based on the real cost of renewables); \uf0b7 Equity (equitable access to basic services to meet needs and ensure human well-being); \uf0b7 Global and international cooperation and shared responsibilities; \uf0b7 Allocation of functions (for the most effective achievement of governmental objectives); \uf0b7 Participation (equitable and effective participation through inclusion of all stakeholders). An important enabler has been the Municipal Finance Management Act (2002-2004) , aiming to secure sound and sustainable management of the fiscal and financial affairs of municipalities and municipal entities by establishing norms and standards. The National Energy Act (2008) outlines the strategic objectives of the Department of Energy, which formerly was part of the Department of Minerals and Energy. Notably, the act officially established the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI). The Electricity Regulation Act (2006, amended 2007/2008/2009) established a national regulatory framework for the electricity supply industry. It makes the National Energy Regulator of South Africa the custodian and enforcer of the national electricity regulatory framework. This act was amended subsequently to accommodate IPP\u2019s (see below). The Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP-2) including South African Renewables Initiative (SARi) (2011) addresses renewable energy from an industrial policy perspective, presenting the multiple opportunities to create jobs and value-adding industries. IPAP 2 focuses on the manufacturing aspects of the Green Economy; namely Green Industries and Industrial Energy Efficiency. It draws in international concessional funding to achieve greater critical mass of renewable energy generation hand-in-hand with localisation of manufacturing related to renewables. Building on the above initiative, the Government signed off a Green Economy Accord (2011) to mobilise the private sector, organised labour, communities and government in a strong partnership to promote the green economy in the country as a platform for creating at least 300 000 new jobs by 2020. The accord included several commitments in the area, of solar water heaters, procurement of renewable energy, biofuels, energy efficiency, waste management and capacity building (amongst others). The Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (revised 2011) is a policy particularly important to provide potential international investors in RE programmes an understanding of pre- qualification of Government tenders. The National Development Plan (2012) is an important framework for current actions. It includes aims such as building an economy-wide carbon price by 2030; zero emission building standards by 2030 and at least 20 000 MW of renewable energy should be contracted by 2030. ",
        "9 Adding to this, a non-grid electrification programme (2012) is designed to temporarily give deep rural communities\u2019 access to limited electricity until such time that grid connections are possible. Solar Home Systems (SHS) are given to households as part of the non-grid electrification programme. Similarly, a Free Basic Alternative Energy programme has as objective to support indigent households in un-electrified areas by providing them with free basic energy to meet some of their basic needs such as cooking etc. This intervention by government is therefore aimed at alleviating some of the difficulties associated with access to energy in those households. The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) By far the most important and powerful instrument of South Africa\u2019s renewable energy programme is the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. However, before rolling out this programme, a number of supplementary regulatory initiatives were required. The Electricity Regulations on New Generation Capacity (2009, amended) are to facilitate planning for establishment of new generation capacity; the regulation of entry by a buyer and a generator into a power purchase agreement; to set minimum standards or requirements for power purchase agreements; measures to ensure a reasonable return based on the risks assumed by the buyer thereunder and to ensure transparency and cost reflectivity in the determination of electricity tariffs; and the provision of a framework for implementation of an IPP procurement programme and the relevant agreements to be concluded. The regulation provides the framework of approving the IPP bid programme, the procurement process, the REFIT programme, and the relevant agreements to be concluded. In 2011, the Department of Energy DoE released the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) which was designed to procure 3 725 MW by 2016. The allocation to the various renewable energy technologies was as follows: \uf0b7 1,850 MW for onshore wind generated power; \uf0b7 200 MW for concentrated solar thermal generated power; \uf0b7 1,450 MW for solar photovoltaic generated power; \uf0b7 12.5 MW for both biomass and biogas generated power; \uf0b7 25 MW for landfill gas generated power; \uf0b7 75 MW for small hydroelectric generated power; \uf0b7 100 MW for an unspecified number of small-scale IPP projects of less than 5 MW. The following Feed-in-Tariffs reflect results of round three of the Department of Energy REIPPP programme. Although future bid windows which allow for additional allocation of RE IPP\u2019s are set to continue over the next 2 years, the likelihood of the FiT tariffs increasing is low. FiT prices are rather expected to continue to drop as RE developers continue to push for a share of the South African RE market. The following prices have been established: \uf0b7 Solar PV (base Apr \u201813): R 0.99/kWh (\u20ac 0.07/kWh); \uf0b7 Wind (base Apr \u201813): R 0.73/kWh (\u20ac 0.05/kWh); \uf0b7 CSP (base Apr \u201913): R 1,64/kWh (\u20ac 0.11/kWh); \uf0b7 Landfill Gas (base Apr \u201813): R 0,94/kWh (\u20ac 0.06/kWh); \uf0b7 Biomass (base Apr \u201813): R 1.40/kWh (\u20ac 0.10/kWh); \uf0b7 Small Hydro (base Apr \u201812): R 1.03/kWh (\u20ac 0.07/kWh). ",
        "10 There are three ways in terms of which shallow connection works can be undertaken to connect the IPP Facility to the System: \uf0b7 In the first instance, the Grid Provider is responsible for and undertakes the connection works to connect each IPP Unit physically to the relevant System, and the IPP Developer pays the Grid Provider for undertaking the connection in accordance with the cost estimate and budget quote provided by the Grid Provider; \uf0b7 In the second instance, the IPP developer is responsible for and undertakes the connection works to connect each IPP Unit physically to the relevant System, and once completed the IPP developer transfers the connection works to the relevant Grid Provider in terms of an agreement with the Grid Provider; \uf0b7 In the third instance, the IPP developer is responsible for and undertakes the connection works to connect each IPP Unit physically to the relevant System, and the IPP developer retains ownership of the connection works once completed. A total of 5 bidding rounds are foreseen, of which rounds 1 to 2 have been completed, proposals under round 4 are being assessed and round 5 is to be expected in August 2015 (if required the Minister can decide to rollout the RE process after 2015). In order to submit a bid, a proponent is required to have obtained an Environmental Authorization (EA) in terms of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulations as well as several other authorisations or consents. The REIPPP has provided a substantial boost to the penetration of renewable energy in South Africa (see also Chapter 2), with major investments made in PV, Solar Water Heating, Wind power as well as various types of biomass notably biodiesel. Actors and players The Department of Energy is the department of the South African government responsible for energy policy. It was established in 2009 when the former Department of Minerals and Energy was divided into the Department of Energy and the Department of Mineral Resources. The Department also provides policy as to rural electrification and will subsidies 80 % of the total capital cost of the systems installed. This subject to the projected been motivated by the local municipality and energy service providers been vetted. NERSA's functions include issuing licences, setting and approving tariffs and charges, mediating disputes. NERSA\u2019s mandate is further derived from written government policies as well as Regulations issued by the Minister of Minerals and Energy. NERSA is expected to proactively take necessary regulatory actions in anticipation of and in response to the changing circumstances in the energy industry. Its mission is to regulate the energy industry in accordance with government laws, policies, standards and international best practices in support of sustainable development. Eskom has been appointed The Single Buyer Office (SBO) and will issue Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) to qualified IPP holders. The SBO deals with all IPP programmes (historical, formal and unsolicited). The following programmes fall within the accountability of the SBO: \uf0b7 Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer (RE IPP) programme Require up to 3 725 MW of renewable energy capacity as specified in the IRP 2010; \uf0b7 Medium Term Power Purchase Programme; the power purchase agreements for approximately 400 MW of co-generation and generation capacity, approved and concluded; \uf0b7 Municipality generation and short term contracts for security of supply; \uf0b7 Small Renewable IPP programme; the DoE has initiated the small renewable IPP (SRIPP) programme by releasing a request for information (RFI) in order to test the market appetite for ",
        "11 small projects and assess the readiness of (onshore wind, solar PV, biomass, biogas, or landfill gas) projects within the 1 to 5 MW capacity band; \uf0b7 Regional Import IPP programmes; currently Eskom is supporting Government led initiatives in the region without providing financial commitment. National Treasury : The DoE, with the support of the National Treasury, has embarked upon the creation of an enabling environment conducive for private sector investment in the energy sector as well as the procurement of the renewable energy programme from independent power producers (IPPs). The National Treasury also supports the procurement of renewable energy through its role as lead department on public finance, which includes involvement in indirect and direct support of the programme, and through the technical advisory support that has been provided through the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) function. Local municipalities are the legal entity that will be involved with the rollout of the non grid electrification project and will motivate such to the Department of Energy. Through the Free Basic Electricity policy, the local municipality will subseries 80 % (or R 48/m) of the ongoing operational costs, the balance to be collected from consumers. Funding programmes A number of RE-specific public funds have been put in place. Green Fund : The Government of South Africa, through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) has set aside R 800 m to establish the Green Fund. This allocation represents the initial resources available for disbursement by the Green Fund. The DEA has appointed the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) as the implementing agent of the Green Fund. A Green Fund Management Committee comprising representatives of the DEA, the DBSA and the National Treasury provide the direction and make final decisions on applications made to the Green Fund DBSA : The Department of Minerals and Energy (DME), together with the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), has established a renewable energy market transformation programme (REMT) to assist investors in overcoming some of the obstacles and barriers preventing growth in the renewable energy sector. Some $ 8.3 m in funding has been made available for the programme, and this came from government ($ 2.3 m), and global financial institutions, namely the World Bank, through its global environment facility ($ 6 m). However, the project was worth some $ 17.3 m, as about $ 9 m of already installed capacity from the private sector was contributed. Green Energy Efficiency Fund : In order to support and promote energy efficiency and renewable energy investments the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and the German Development Bank (KfW) have partnered, under the framework of the South African-German Financial Cooperation and established a R 500 m facility for energy efficiency and small scale renewable energy projects. IDC Low Debit Fund for Renewables : Companies wishing to develop or improve renewable energy projects can approach the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) for finance at low-cost debt. Projects ranging from R 1 m and R 5 m can secure debit at prime minus 2 % for up to 15 years. IDC Renewable Fund : As South Africa moves to a low-carbon economy, IDC has earmarked R 25 bn over the five years to 2015/16 for the development of green industries within the country. The bulk of this funding will be disbursed by the Green Industries SBU. ",
        "12 Eskom IDM Standard Offer programme (SOP) : The proposed rebate is pegged at R 1.20 per kWh over a 3-year period, with a disbursement as per SOP rules (70 % on commissioning, thereafter 10 % at end of years 1,2 and 3). A Measurement and Verification (M & V) procedure will apply, which will likely include a 2-3 month baseline study to determine the projected energy savings over the 3 years and thus the overall rebate amount. Renewable energy programmes are well supported by the four largest commercial banks in South Africa. A number of smaller financial institutions have also provided debit and equity funding for IPP rollout. To provide an understanding of the commitment, please find below statements from the four large commercial banks of South Africa: BOX 1: Commercial banks support to RE ABSA : Two renewable energy deals worth a combined R 14.7 bn (\u20ac 1.01 bn) led by the Corporate and Investment Banking division of Barclays Africa has secured four top international awards, confirming the bank\u2019s position as a market leader in Africa\u2019s energy sector; in November 2013, Barclays Africa secured mandates to provide R 10.8 bn (\u20ac 740 m.) worth of debt funding to a total of six projects, including Wind, Solar PV and Concentrated Solar Power under the government\u2019s third Independent Power Producer (IPP) Procurement round. This was approximately a third of the total debt that is being committed by South Africa\u2019s commercial banks, positioning Barclays Africa as one of the largest funders under the third round of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. FirstRand \u2013RMB : RMB has already closed and committed to over R 14 bn (\u20ac 1 bn) to nine solar and wind projects in the first two rounds of the REIPP and has underwritten senior and mezzanine finance to support a further 17 bids in round three of the program. Nedbank : Investment bank Nedbank Capital, which currently has an R 18 bn (\u20ac 1.24 bn) debt exposure to 23 of the 64 approved renewable-energy projects in South Africa, expects to complete a review of the portfolio in early 2014, with the intention of allowing the bank to continue with its high-level participation in future private energy opportunities that are expected to arise in the coming few years. Standard Bank : Standard Bank has signed a R 20 bn (\u20ac 1.38 bn) funding support agreement for renewable energy projects in South Africa with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). ICBC is Standard Bank\u2019s single largest shareholder with a 20 % stake. Standard Bank and ICBC will jointly provide debt financing on a project finance basis to companies that are awarded preferred bidder status under the government's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement (REIPPP) Programme. Standard Bank is underwriting R 9.4 bn (\u20ac 650 m) for preferred bidders in the first phase of the REIPPP Programme, representing an installed renewable energy capacity of 573 megawatts. In the second phase of the REIPPP Programme, a total of 79 bids were received and 19 preferred bidders were selected. Five of the bids Standard Bank supported were selected, representing an installed renewable energy capacity of 328 megawatts and a total financing requirement of R 6.1 bn (\u20ac 420 m). 1.3 Investment climate Closely related to stability of the policy framework is the overall investment climate. The SSA region scores poorly compared to other parts of the world, with the majority of countries studied being in the bottom half of in terms of ranking of Doing Business 5 (World Bank). Only Mauritius (20 th out of 189 countries), South Africa (41 st ) and Ghana (67 th ) demonstrate remarkably high scores. However, progress in various aspects of the investment climate can be noticed as of late. The time required 5 World Bank Doing Business \u2013 Historical Trends and Data set: Date of extraction: 24/4/1 ",
        "13 to start a business, to deal with construction permits and to register property have gone down in many countries, and so have the time to expert and the total tax rate for businesses. Major hurdles in the investment climate remain the strength of investor protection and the time it takes to enforce contracts \u2013 thus hinting at serious problems in areas of rule of law and governance. Only Ghana and Mozambique show acceptable levels of investor protection, with South Africa and Mauritius scoring good (see Table 1.2 overleaf). 1.4 Conclusions The most propitious contexts for RE deployment are found in countries that have an advanced political and regulatory framework that takes into consideration renewable energy. However, the evolutions in the RE political and regulatory frameworks are only possible in countries which have achieved a certain level in their electrification rate. In the cases of countries where this rate is low, which is still the reality in many SSA countries, the priority is to extend the grid for supplying least- cost power (e.g. fossil-based electricity) to urban centres and to adapt the generation capacity to cope with fast growing power demand. In such an environment, RETs are just seen as an option for providing basic services to rural communities, based on small-scale technologies such as solar home systems, solar or wind-powered water pumping systems, pico-hydro systems and improved cooking stoves. The lack of an appropriate regulatory framework enabling the development of large renewable energy projects constitutes a barrier for private investors. Small-scale RE projects within the rural electrification segment are facing low energy consumption density and limited power purchase ability when compared to investment required. These projects often require high level of capital and transaction costs during their preparation and implementation compared to the returns they generate. The generally tense financial situation of the public utility and the reluctance in pro-active tariff adjustments are also limiting factors in the confidence of potential investors. Therefore, bilateral and multilateral donors and banks remain the key actors for the development of RET in SSA. This chapter has demonstrated that the large-scale uptake of renewable energy requires an advanced policy framework, which needs to be developed consistently over a longer period of time. The framework requires ownership unbundling and sector regulation in the power sector; the removal of hidden subsidies for power generation from fossil sources and appropriate feed-in tariffs; an assessment of RE potentials and subsequently defined a planning approach for RE deployment, and suitable instruments for the promotion and support of RE technologies including a set of financial incentives. It also requires the cooperation of a whole range of actors, including policy makers, energy regulators, municipalities, foreign and domestic investors as well as access to public and private financing. As demonstrated by the presentation of policy initiatives in South Africa, the development of renewable energy requires above all political will to reform the energy sector and to create appropriate structures and financing channels. It is indeed the government\u2019s role to push forward the necessary regulatory reforms and the promotion of RE. The South African REIPPP programme can be considered a good practice and it can be tempting to roll out such a programme to other countries in the region. Despite these initiatives, doubts remain amongst South African experts as to how strong the long-term commitment of the government is to renewable energy in light of the urgent need to install capacity and the availability of alternatives (notably coal- and nuclear power plants). ",
        "14 Other good examples of renewable energy policy in the region exist as well. In West Africa, the example of Mali should be highlighted. The country has no domestic fossil fuels, no significant hydro resource and no access to the sea, but benefits from very high solar irradiation which is very suitable for powering remote towns scattered in the vast eastern and northern areas of the country. The strong political will pushed forward the development of large PV/Diesel hybrid systems putting Mali at the forefront of this technology in SSA. In Kenya, the commitment to geothermal energy is particularly strong. In Mauritius, building on the omni-presence of sugarcane, the long-term commitment to bioenergy has led to a large installed capacity in co-generator electricity generation. Annex I of the Annex Report provides further details on the institutional framework, regulatory context and overall policy pertaining to renewable energy deployment. ",

        "17 2 Overview of RE penetration This Chapter provides and overview of the Renewable energy penetration in the SSA region. The Terms of Reference (Task 2) require the \u201creporting on Sustainable RES potential, comparison with fossil fuel energy sources; RES penetration, current and planned as well as industrial actors operating currently in SSA\u201d. This chapter responds to these requirements by providing an overview of the current situation (Chapter 2.1), followed by our assessment of the future penetration including the trends (Chapter 2.2). It then includes an analysis of the drivers and barriers (Chapter 2.3) and concludes with a prioritisation of countries and RET technologies (Chapter 2.4). 2.1 Current situation in SSA The characteristics of SSA energy markets are: \uf0b7 Fragmented regional and continental markets for energy trade. Cross border power trade has yet to take off. Power trade is less than 5 % of total consumption; \uf0b7 Low capacity to attract commercial financing for investment needs; private sector financing contributed only \u20ac 350 m (10 % of total investments) in 2009 compared with \u20ac 50 bn in other developing regions; \uf0b7 Great variations in magnitude of size of power systems in SSA; more than half of the power systems in SSA countries are less than 200 MW; \uf0b7 Poor grid connectivity and large number of standards; grids cover only parts of the continent and the large number of standards; \uf0b7 Strong differences between urban and rural situations; typical for SSA is that not only individuals in rural areas are without electricity, but that whole communities are cut off (contrary to for example India); \uf0b7 Lowest GHG emissions per capita: SSA countries represent only a small fraction\u2014less than 3 % - of the world\u2019s GHG emissions per year, even though it has 14 % of the world population. Primary energy resources and consumption : Out of total SSA consumption, traditional biomass (wood fuel) and waste still represent the greatest share. Hydrocarbon based energy is still close to 40 % of primary energy consumption and coal is also important, particularly in the southern part of Africa (South Africa, Botswana); gas plays an increasing role but it is still marginal. Hydro represents a very small proportion of the total primary energy, even though it is nearly 30 % of electricity generation, and other forms of renewable energy play an insignificant role in the current energy mix. Energy consumption is modernizing, with modern fuels (coal, petroleum products, gas) representing presently nearly 40 % of primary energy consumption, whereas this proportion was less than 1/4 in 1971, although the change is slow. The share of biomass is slowly decreasing but remains dominant; from 3/4 of consumption in 1971 to less than 60 % today; petroleum products and natural gas are fast increasing forms of primary energy in SSAs, mainly imported and raising concerns with energy security. Renewable energy still plays a marginal role in energy supply. Low access rates to basic electricity services continue to affect about 400 million of the 700 million people in SSA countries. Only South Africa (75 %) Nigeria and Ghana have access rates in excess of 50 % while nearly half of the 48 SSA countries have access rates below 20%. Of these, ",
        "18 almost 80 % of the population live in rural households, where access to electricity is only 12 %. Access to electricity also varies dramatically among countries and corresponds strongly to GDP. In Chad, Liberia, and Burundi, more than 95 % of people lack electricity access, while 70 % have access in South Africa, and even more than 90 % are plugged in in Mauritius. Table 2.1 Access to electricity in SSA Source: ACP report EU-RAL2013 Compared to the rest of the world, the SSA countries have the lowest access rates to electricity, both in terms of direct access by persons (to a service at home) and the rate of electrification of localities. In SSA, the much less extensive electricity infrastructure generally reaches less than 20 % of the localities. Hydropower represents more than 32 % of power generation in SSA, with huge variation from 0 % for 10 countries (Botswana, Cape Verde, Djibouti, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Madagascar, Niger, Somalia and Chad) to 90 % and above for 6 countries (DR Congo, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zambia). The remaining part for power generation is using fossil fuels (petrol, gas or coal). Total capacity installed represents 75 GW of which 24 GW for hydropower. Power plants in Africa are generally small, reflecting the fragmented nature of African power systems. This observation, applicable to both thermal plants and hydro plants, imposes a cost penalty on African power systems. Investment in energy from renewable sources remains low in SSA countries and focused on electricity generation: Investments mainly originate from IFIs and public sources in the form of grants and soft loans or debt financing to address the issue of insufficient commercial debt financing for RE projects. South Africa RE penetration We zoom in on South Africa, as it has higher electricity access rates and a leading role in renewable energy transition. Currently, about 95 % of South Africa\u2019s generation capacity is from non-renewable resources. The majority of the total electricity is generated by coal-fired power stations (90 %). Most of the remaining 5 % is generated by a single nuclear power plant, which is ",
        "19 located near Cape Town 6 . This is the only commercial nuclear power plant on the entire African continent. Other fossil fuels currently only play a minor role in electricity production, although large scale shale gas is under development and available within the near future.

Among these facilities is a significant storage and pumped hydro production capacity of 1 580 MW. The contribution of solar energy is primarily coming from PV technology. The contribution of small scale PV and heating and cooling systems is more difficult to quantify because of production behind the meter. CSP currently does not produce energy, but is under construction: five projects with a total capacity of 400 MW \u2013 which is unique in the SSA region. In addition , wind energy has in recent years become more important, with a current capacity of 387 MW. The wind farms are mostly located at the Western and Eastern Cape, in the Southern parts of South Africa. Small wind turbines are usually installed behind the meter or in remote areas (e.g. for telecommunication). Biomass power production plays a small role, with typical prospected installations having a capacity ranging from 2-10 MW. However, domestic use of biomass does of course have a high penetration. All in all, the majority of renewable generation capacity is currently made up of hydro, solar and wind.

Extracted from this study\u2019s Inception Report 2.1.1 Bioenergy For SSA, traditional energy refers to biomass, directly burned wood, charcoal, agriculture residues, etc. for thermal applications, being mainly for cooking, water and space heating (depending on climate zone and altitude). On the other hand, modern biomass energy is generally processed into compacted (briquettes) and dried solid fuels or converted into liquid or gaseous fuels. Fuel wood and charcoal Sub-Saharan Africa is characterised by a high dependency upon biomass, fuel wood and charcoal for domestic consumption, raising acute problems in the field of security of energy supply, energy efficiency, environmental impact and health. Biomass (mainly from wood origin) is the most important energy resource actually for SSA countries (except from South Africa). The situation varies from one country to another and even some equatorial countries consume more than the natural reproduction (leading to deforestation). ",
        "21 Sub-Saharan Africa produces around 600 million m3 of fuel wood per year. This covers a large share (an estimated 50-60 %) of the energy needs. During the last decade, demand has remained stable. Around 90 % of rural households use firewood (example 700 kg/year per capita in Kenya) while efficiency of usual wood stoves (the \u201cthree stones\u201d) is very low (10-15 %). Charcoal is mainly used by urban households (around 80 % consuming 150 kg/year per capita). The traditional earth kilns to produce charcoal are inefficient (10-20 %) compared to bricks kilns (30-40 % recovery). The demand for firewood is mainly for rural areas and free collection, urban areas consume more sold charcoal. Table 2.4 Fuel wood as Percentage of Households Energy Consumption Source: solarcooking.org/fuel wood.htm 2010 In many Sub-Saharan Africa countries, prospects confirm the important role of biomass in the energy supply by 2030, 2050 and even further. Considering that many of the 700 million people today (and projected 900 million by 2030) in SSA are highly dependent on solid fuels (mainly fuel wood and charcoal) for cooking, the potential for energy conservation for cooking is particularly attractive and a priority to reduce health diseases (linked with firewood cooking inside homes). Sub- Saharan Africa (except South Africa) is characterised by acute problems in the field of security of energy supply, energy efficiency, environmental impact (deforestation) and health. During the past decades, several types of actions have been implemented: \uf0b7 Dissemination of improved stoves in order to increase the efficiency of stoves, reduce demand and reduce collection duration and frequency; examples: Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mauritius, Senegal and projects in Ethiopia (target 9 million efficient cook stoves by 2018), Uganda (2.3 million new efficient cook stoves by 2017), RDCongo (Project ProBEC), Nigeria; \uf0b7 Energy substitution to modern fuels because of higher thermal efficiency, reduced cooking time, fighting indoor air pollution, and saving women time for more productive activities. Examples: Burkina Faso, rice husk for home cooking, LPG substitution in Senegal and Mauritania; \uf0b7 Trees plantation and afforestation in order to manage and maintain these resources. Examples: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Namibia (invader bush). The conversion efficiency from firewood to charcoal is low (10-20 %) in SSA countries. It depends on many factors such as kiln type, wood moisture content, tree species, etc. Some 60-80 % of firewood\u2019s energy is lost using traditional kilns, but charcoal is easier to transport, to sell, and to ",
        "22 use. If African Governments want to encourage the use of charcoal, the conversion efficiency must be improved by using modern kilns. Wood and forestry products for heat and power generation Forestry biomass (and by-products) remains the most important source: logging residues, wood harvest residues (brash: top of trees and small branches), sawdust, woodchips. Eucalyptus is the most common tree for afforestation but it is water consuming and other species are now planted. There are other possible uses of wood and other biomass resources consumed in SSA such as wood residues and by-products for agro and manufacturing industries. Sustainable forest management at the local level, agro-forestry systems, community wood-based biomass production are examples of successful actions for the development of biomass-energy supply. Agro-industry wood and waste Residues, by-products and waste represent an important potential: crop residues on the fields are the by-products of the agricultural system, industries residues and waste (bagasse, coconut shells, oil palm) and municipal wastes (garbage, waste water, trees pruning, etc.). They can be split into two types, dry and wet. Wet residues can be used in bio-digesters (biogas). They are used for anaerobic digestion/fermentation. Due to the weight of water, it is preferable to process them close to production. Typical wet residues are animal slurry and farmyard manure, grass silage. Moisture content must be driven off before combustion or gasification (requiring low moisture content under 10-15 %). Dry residues consist of parts of arable crops that are not used for the primary production of food or fibre. Included in dry residues are straw, poultry litter, rice and coffee husks, corn stover, etc. Depending on tropical agricultural by-products and the moisture, the net calorific value varies from 7 to 20 MJ/kg. Hence, these wastes have the potential to enhance productive capacity, increase revenues, and generate heat and/or power. The best example in several countries is power generation from bagasse (refer co-generation). The agro processing sector in SSA is large and produces huge quantities of energy valuable wastes. Most of the sector, suffers from frequent energy shortages and many of them already have their own stand-alone diesel generator. They have another opportunity for enhancing their productive capacity and increasing their revenues, using their own residues to generate heat and/or power. Some examples of opportunities: \uf0b7 Coffee, for every ton of beans produced, about one ton of husk is generated; \uf0b7 Sisal, per ton of sisal produced. The process generate about 120 m3 of wastewater and 25 tons of solid wastes plus the same amount of post harvest waste. Just for Kenya and Tanzania, sisal activities generate 20 million m3 of wastewater, 5 million tons of solid wastes plus 4-8 tons of harvest wastes (sisal stems and sisal boles) Commercial and Industrial residues (wastes or co-products) of organic origin, can be potentially used or converted to biomass fuel. Residues from industries and commerce from process and manufacturing operations could be woody wastes (same characteristics as wood fuel such as saw dust or furniture industry residues) or non woody such as residues from paper/pulp, or textiles industries that can be combusted, gasified or pyrolysed. They can be used as wood fuel and burnt for heating, power or co-generation (CHP) or they can also be gasified. For wet residues, it is more convenient to get methane (bio-digesters producing biogas) better than burning. It is estimated that about one third of industries residues is combustible. Such bioenergy potential exists in most SSA countries. ",
        "23 In order to use these agro-industrial wastes and/or by-products efficiently, one solution is co- generation (combined heat and power- CHP). Numerous users consume biomass and fossil fuels simply for purposes of cooking (for example, bakeries), heating or producing industrial steam. Most of these applications could be supplied by means of small co-generation facilities. The most common residues, already used for cogeneration throughout the world, are wood wastes, sugar cane bagasse, palm oil fibre and shells, rice or coffee husks, corn-cobs, etc. Built on the success of Mauritius\u2019 cogeneration project based on bagasse (40 % of the country\u2019s power supply comes from co-generation), the project \u201cCleaner Energy for Africa\u201d (COGEN) aims to scale up the use of efficient co-generation in Eastern and Southern African countries. The objective is to lead the development of 60 MW of COGEN projects and stimulate the installation of an additional 200 MW capacity. Today 20.8 MW has been constructed and commissioned. Liquid biofuels Liquid biofuels are made from biomass and can be used as gasoline, diesel or other petroleum\u2013 derived fuels. Today, there are two dominant liquid biofuels: bio-ethanol and biodiesel. In principle, this biomass resource is available in many SSA (except in desert and sub-desert areas, northern and southern Africa). However, the main drawback is that \u2013 apart from sugarcane ethanol (by- product bagasse) and jatropha biodiesel (by-product glycerine) \u2013 the production of biofuels based on available technologies would compete with food production (arable land, water and/or farming), with limited expansion potential in some countries or regions. The difference between 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation biofuels has been defined on the basis of the technology development and output products. First generation biofuels are derived from food crops such as sugarcane but also non-food crops such as jatropha to produce bioethanol and biodiesel. The so-called second generation biofuels (commodity chemicals, butanol, jet fuel, ethanol, acetone, furfural etc.) are produced in bio-refineries from non-food crops (agricultural residues and by-products, grass and tree crops) with more advanced technology. Third generation biofuels are highly advanced biofuels produced rom e.g. algae. Being less land and water intensive than first-generation counterparts, 2nd and 3rd generation biofuels promise to have high greenhouse gas savings, without competing with food production. Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils derived from soybeans, rapeseed, palm seeds, jatropha, etc., based on esterification of vegetable oils after chemical or mechanical extraction. Theoretically, some vegetable oils could be used directly in motors as a fuel, but this presents some risks if they are not specific/adapted motors. Biodiesel can be used for cooking, lighting, mechanical needs (pumping, grinding, etc), by craftsmen or for local transportation. Also, jatropha-curcas has been developed at agro-industrial scale in Mozambique, while some prospects forecast its spread cultivation over SSA, namely in Ethiopia and Nigeria. However, seed size can vary considerably from plant to plant depending on many factors including amongst others the availability of water, nutrients and heat, soil quality and the age of the plant. Bio-ethanol can be produced from sugar cane plantation which may be found in many SSA countries, from Malawi to Senegal including Mozambique and Mali. It could follow the Brazilian pattern in order to supply the transport sector. However, growing sugarcane is water-intensive. High yields require a suitable humidity level to be maintained throughout the growing period, causing an obvious competition for water and land with food cultivation. In certain producing countries, sugarcane ethanol represents a potentially viable solution. The technology is competitive with oil prices around $ 80-100/bbl and ethanol blending (normally up to 10 %) may be considered. Some programmes are underway, using blended fuel in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Nigeria. The use of ethanol as an \u201cown fuel\u201d in adapted heaters is being carried out in Ethiopia and ",
        "24 will commence in Tanzania and Ghana. Attempts are made to make this alternative to firewood sustainable through specific national policies and subsidies. Municipal waste, landfill and biogas Landfill gas is the result of the degradation of municipal solid waste by micro-organisms. The technical issues are gas recovery, gas quality (methane content), gas-capturing optimisation. Non- technical considerations include regulatory framework and meeting the market expectations. The quality of the gas depends on the composition of the waste, presence of oxygen, temperature, physical geometry and duration since waste disposal. In anaerobic conditions \u2013 typically in landfills \u2013 methane (50-60 %) and CO2 are by-products. Several countries, such as South Africa, have developed landfill methane recovery projects. In SSA countries, batch systems may be more successful because they do not need substrate pre- treatment (no separation of inert solids) that facilitate the process and lower the production costs. For landfills, the technical issues are gas recovery, gas quality considerations, optimum gas capture, and non-technical considerations including regulatory framework and meeting the market expectations. An example sketches the use of waste for biogas: consider 1 million tons of solid waste produced every year, of which 60% is collected / stored in a landfill. The dry matter would vary between 30 - 60%, depending on season and rainfall. The estimated methane potential is 200-250 m3/ton VS (average of 85million m3/year equivalent of 72 000 tons of oil), providing a power capacity of 38 MW (350 GWh thermal generation and 300 GWh electric generation). Domestic biogas digesters turn waste, such as kitchen scraps and cow dung, into methane gas that can be used mainly for cooking and heating. Although tests have been launched many years ago, there is not much dissemination, in contrast to other global regions such Nepal, China and India where advancements in this respect have been greater.. However, some new projects are on the way in Uganda (100 000 digesters by 2017), Ethiopia (4 700 digesters), Ghana and Madagascar, largely due to the support of EU and international donors in the recent years. In South Africa, there is an estimated potential for at least 300 000 households, mainly rural, to benefit from biogas digesters. 7 2.1.2 Hydropower Within the interconnected grid, the cost competitiveness and maturity level of hydropower has made this technology leading in SSA. In many countries, the potential sites for large hydropower plants have been tapped, although there is still a very significant potential, especially at the small/mini/micro scales. Small-scale hydro-power Small-scale hydro-power (including Pico- Micro and Mini- Hydro) is in most cases \u201crun-of-river\u201d; in other words the dam or barrage is quite small, usually just a weir, and little or no water is stored. Therefore, run-of-river installations do not have the same kinds of adverse effect on the local environment as large-scale hydro. Carefully-designed mini-hydro schemes take only a limited amount of water from a river or stream, have a small storage volume, and return the water a short distance downstream, thus have very little environmental impact. Several small hydro systems have less environmental impact than a single large hydro scheme supplying the same power. 7 http://www.za.boell.org/web/climate-change-614.html ",
        "25 Micro and Pico hydro installations are mostly found in developing countries for energy provision to isolated communities where the national electricity grid is not available, while mini-hydro tends to be grid connected. Micro and pico-hydro also differ from Mini-hydro due to their extended possibility of using local materials and labour. Mini hydro typically involves more traditional engineering approaches, i.e. they divert some of the water flow through civil works into a turbine, which drives a generator producing electricity. This technology might need, for example, heavy access roads for delivery of materials and electro-mechanical equipment. These applications include base, peak and stand-by power production or stand-alone applications. SHP installations commonly last without the need for major replacement costs for 30+ years. Within the limits of water resources available, small scale installations are characterized by reliability and flexibility of operation, including fast start-up and shut-down in response to rapid demand changes. Electricity can be tailored to the needs of the end-use market, avoiding balance and power reliability concerns. In particular, pico hydropower is the only form of small renewable energy production which works continuously without battery storage. A pico-hydro plant incorporates all of the electro-mechanical elements into one portable device and is typically installed on the river or stream embankment and can be removed during floods or low flow periods. Where applicable it is the most cost efficient solution to supply electrical energy. Pico turbines can provide power for small clusters or even single households. This technology is ideal for small and poor isolated communities. The manufacturing and installation costs of these turbines are low and might be a good way for poor and isolated communities to start using electricity. In Vietnam and China, for example, which are the largest markets for pico-hydro systems, the most common size range is 100-1 000 Watts for domestic lighting and/or battery charging. The units are small and cheap (in the range of US$ 25 for 200 Watts; up to US$ 580 for 1 000 Watts) and are typically owned, installed and used by a single family or household. Large scale hydro (over 10 MW) Large scale hydro is characterised by the possibility of energy storage in a reservoir which permit to manage the production in the best economic interests, to store energy during off-peak hours and to release it during peak hours. This storage opportunity is particularly interesting in combination with other sources of energy with volatile (e.g. wind, solar) or base-load production (e.g. nuclear, coal). A major disadvantage of large hydro is the high degree of uncertainty in earning back the required investment: the upfront construction costs are huge, the requirements for transmission are significant and the project needs to function for a long period of time. Another major disadvantage is major environmental and social impacts and complex licensing procedures. In many countries, potential sites for large hydropower plants have been tapped or are under development. Nonetheless, only a small fraction of the SSA\u2019s total hydro potential has been so far developed, with a total installed capacity of about 24 000 MW or 32 % of installed capacity as of 2010. Importantly, there are wide variations depending on the country, from a maximum of 97- 100 % in the case of DRC, Zambia and Mozambique, to 0 % in the case of arid countries.

        "27 2.1.3 Solar energy Solar photovoltaic Over the past 10 years, solar PV was the fastest \u2010 growing renewable power technology worldwide. In SSA the technology has been used since the 1980\u2019s initially for rural electrification with community PV systems and home systems. It was estimated 9 that in 2009, installed capacities of off-grid solar power were 7 MWp (each) for Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria, and 5 MWp for Senegal. The present trend for providing electricity to remote localities in SSA is to add a PV component to installed diesel generators already supplying power to a local mini-grid. This hybridization process helps reducing operating costs that are directly linked to oil prices. PV has also a role to play as a distributed grid-tied solution in urban and peri-urban environments in Africa, which are high local solar resource and are often subject to power cuts due to poor quality of the grids. The market for large multi-megawatt scale PV power plants, which started in Europe and US ten years ago, is now taking up in SSA, with installations in South Africa and large projects in other regions. The annual installations of large-scale PV power plants in Middle East and Africa amounted in 2012 to 410 MWp and only 1 MWp four years before 10 . The price for PV in SSA countries is still higher than the prices presently in Europe. This is due to the small size of the market and high logistics costs. In many SSA countries, PV is already a competitive addition to diesel generators 11 , in particular in remote areas in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is no alternative to high cost HFO or Diesel fired generation. Presently, the cost of private sector financed solar PV plants is about 1 500 \u20ac/kW installed in countries with easy logistics, plus the financing costs. The tariff, based on existing PV plants with a capacity of 35 MW in high income emerging markets, is about 0.15 \u20ac/kWh at the plant. Large scale (grid-connected) solar PV (> 10 MW): As of today, large solar PV plants have not yet been developed in SSA except in Burkina Faso (Zagtouli 33 MW) and Senegal (expected project 10 MW). This is mostly due to the continuing high cost of PV, in general, and, in Africa, to the competition of lower cost technologies. In C&P countries and landlocked countries, large solar PV may be an economical option, but would need to be examined on a case-by-case basis. PV-Diesel Hybrid systems: Solar PV plants, including power storage capacity for night consumption, are still expensive at about 6 to 10 \u20ac/Wp installed. Hybrid systems can reduce the cost of investment as the combination of solar PV production and diesel generation save the cost of storage capacity and the cost of fuel when solar energy is available. The cost of a hybrid solar system with storage was about 6-7 500 \u20ac/MWp for a solar plant in Sahel countries, depending on the size and geographical situation (road and grid infrastructure). Hybrid systems remain a promising technology for isolated systems in SSA countries. Solar Home Systems (SHS) and Pico Solar PV systems: SHS or solar pico PV systems can help in the provision of a few essential energy services, provided the financing issues are addressed. In particular, solar pico PV systems 12 have experienced significant development in the last few years, 9 IEA, Solar Energy Perspectives, 2011 10 EPIA, Global market outlook for photovoltaics 2031-2017. 11 PV cannot guarantee reliable power supply by itself as a stand-alone system. It becomes competitive when its production cost is less than the fuel cost of thermal generation. Consequently, when PV is available, it is economical to shut down diesel units and use PV power, the fuel savings being higher than the cost of PV. However, it is important to emphasize that both technologies are necessary to ensure reliable power supply. This is the case in small countries and in landlocked countries of Africa. 12 PVPS 2013, Pico Solar PV Systems for Remote Homes ",
        "28 combining the use of very efficient lights (mostly LEDs) with sophisticated charge controllers and efficient batteries. With a small PV panel of only a few watts, essential services can be provided, such as lighting, phone charging and powering a radio. Expandable solar pico systems have now entered the market. Households can start by buying a small kit, later adding an extra kit, allowing extra lights and services to be connected and even a small TV to be considered. The costs of the smallest systems are between $ 10 and $ 50, which is affordable for people living in remote areas. The price of photovoltaic panels has started to decrease since early 2009 13 . However, the cost of the panel is only about 30 % of total system cost. This is especially relevant for isolated systems, which require additional costs for storing the electrical energy produced during daylight hours (e.g. batteries for lighting or a water tower for pumping). The segment of solar home systems is now moving from a development-aid supported market to a commercial business activity with many manufacturers providing products designed for African customers. The market for hybrid PV-diesel systems is slowly growing in some countries, mainly thanks to development aid, except in Mali where this is growing very fast because of a strong government will. The growth of grid-tied solar PV in the urban environment is directly linked to government policies in terms of regulation and tariffs. Solar thermal technologies The relevant technologies and associated applications using direct solar thermal collection for SSA are: \uf0b7 Solar water heaters (SWH) for domestic use in houses, hotels and other types of building is a mature technology with commercial products available globally. The demand for solar water heaters in SSA has been consistent through the past 15 years for installations in urban areas on institutional and commercial buildings. It is estimated that by end of 2011, there was 0.9 GWth of cumulated installed capacity in Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe 14 ; \uf0b7 Solar thermal cooling through adsorption chillers or desiccant evaporative systems is still in the R&D phase, could help reduce the electricity peak demand associated with conventional cooling, as maximum solar radiation occurs when cooling is needed. The market for solar water heaters in SSA is mainly concentrated in South Africa, where this sector is going through a consolidation process with a decrease in the number of registered installers. In other SSA countries, specific market segments could emerge: SWH for hotels and office buildings, if promotion and support programs are implemented. But there are no real signs that such pro- active programs will be implemented. Concentrated solar power for electricity generation There are three major types of CSP: \uf0b7 One is the parabolic trough , which uses long sections of parabolic-curved reflective material oriented toward the sun. These troughs don\u2019t need to orient on the vertical axis, since some portion of the sun is always hitting some part of the trough. They do orient horizontally, or perpendicularly, from morning to evening to match the sun\u2019s crossing the sky; \uf0b7 A second type is a power tower , which uses heliostats (mirrors) to concentrate solar energy onto a collector at the top of a tower. This method can require less level ground, and generate higher temperatures than parabolic-trough solar collection; 13 It is uncertain whether the unit price for PV will continue to decrease since recent low prices for PV was the result of a dumping policy from larger companies that are now bankrupt. 14 http://www.iea-shc.org/solar-heat-worldwide ",
        "29 \uf0b7 A third type, called dish design , uses the same mirror principle, as a collection of parabolic mirrors in a roughly circular shape, to focus solar energy on a central receiver located at the focus point of the dish. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) stands out among other renewable technologies for technical features such as dispatchability through storage and hybridization. Some governments have set up incentive programs to promote the development of large-scale CSP plants in recent years. These support mechanisms have largely contributed to the rapid growth of the global market since 2007. While Spain and USA remain leaders, representing most of the current \u00b1 2.5 GW in operation, other countries have emerged within a short time as very ambitious players, least of all: the South African DoE has already allocated 400 MW towards CSP development with a potential pipeline of a further 1 GW over the next few years. 2.1.4 Wind energy This technology is currently experiencing a growing interest across SSA, with many countries being in the process of engaging or seeking to engage with international partners to establish wind farms in their territory. Consistent political will, certainty of long-term off-take (power purchase agreements, grid security) and effective public private partnerships (PPP) are certainly key elements for successful project completion in the future years. An inventory of installed wind capacity in the SSA region including South Africa leads us to an estimate of 644 MW installed, 954 MW under construction and 765 MW in concept phase (notably, offshore wind technology has not been developed in SSA). South Africa is certainly the most advances country in the region, with a widespread network of grid-connected wind farms already implemented. Other countries where wind energy is gaining momentum are Kenya and Ethiopia. The former is constructing the second largest single wind farm in the continent at Lake Turkana, while the latter hosts the largest operational plant (Ashegoda) and has several others operations currently being planned. Other countries such as Tanzania and Cape Verde have wind projects already operational, however these are largely single-unit wind turbines as opposed to medium to large sized connected units introduced in the other countries. It is worth noting that due to the low-scale of grid infrastructure in the region, these single-unit turbines may be more affordable for local communities than engaging in a larger grid extension process. In SSA, the price is higher as the capacity of a single machine is presently limited to 850 kW, due to the lack of heavy cranes needed to install higher capacity units. The cost of the Cape Verde 25.5 MW wind farms presently installed was about 2 000 \u20ac/kW. The generation cost is in the range of 0.08 to 0.10 \u20ac/kWh. However, wind remains an intermittent source of electricity, requiring complementary investment in back-up thermal or hydro capacity. As it is just beginning in SSA, we have no figures for a yearly production but the load factor for selected sites is 30% or more. The investment cost for such projects is estimated to be 1 500 \u20ac/kW with generation costs in the range of 8-10 \u20ac cents/kWh, which could be in accordance with the existing feed-in tariffs. 2.1.5 Geothermal Shallow Geothermal Energy (for heating and cooling) In shallow geothermal energy, the geothermal energy is removed from the region of the earth close to the surface (usually up to 150 m, but not more than 400 m deep, temperature in the range of 20- 30\u00b0C all year long), e.g. with geothermal heat collectors, geothermal probes, groundwater wells or energy piles. In 2009, the first geothermal heating and cooling system in Southern Africa - and probably in Africa - went live in the MyPond Hotel, Port Alfred in the Eastern Cape. ",
        "30 Shallow geothermal penetration is today limited to South Africa for heating and cooling. Future penetration could be more important if a real market exists, depending on: needs for heating and cooling buildings (commercial and residential), affordability compared with other solutions and availability of technologies in the SSA countries. Concerning the latter, technologies are available and reliable on the world market , but penetration in SSA depends on the population income and tourism industry mostly. Deep Geothermal Energy (for power generation) Deep geothermal energy comprises systems in which the geothermal energy can be accessed via deep boreholes. It is common practice to speak of deep geothermal energy (in the strict sense) only from depths of more than 1,000 metres and temperatures greater than 60\u00b0C. Areas with ascending thermal waters represent a special case, like in Iceland, and is limited to a number of countries in SSA located near the Great Rift Valley. Deep geothermal energy includes hydrothermal systems with high enthalpy (use of steam or two-phase systems for the generation of electricity) which is the technology experimented in Kenya. The 45 MW geothermal power plant Olkaria I in Kenya was put into operation in 1981. It was the first power station of this kind in Africa. Kenya has made significant institutional efforts to harness this potential and develop this resource. See for example the \u201cKenya Geothermal Development Act of Parliament\u201d. Up to 2010, other countries of the East African Rift Valley have no strategy and inadequate legislative and regulatory frameworks for the development of the geothermal subsector. Some regional initiatives are focusing on exploration and site/project-specific activities such as (pre-) feasibility studies, project implementation planning, negotiation of power purchase agreements. 2.1.6 Ocean energy No ocean energy devices are deployed in SSA at this moment, however research projects have been on-going and particularly in South Africa. The Stellenbosch University started working in this RET area since the 1970s, but interest of researchers has notably increased since 2007. In this year in fact the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI) has also started sponsoring some research projects 15 and South Africa\u2019s utility company (Eskom) has promoted specific studies on wave energy (including the measurement of the Agulhas current potentials), Amongst other SSA countries, Ghana has also recently raised its interest and efforts with regard to ocean energy. From a technological point of view, wave and (particularly) tidal are the most advanced research areas. The expected development of OTEC (as well as osmotic energy) is more long term future oriented than for tidal and wave. Some interest also exists in cold Seawater Airconditioning (SWAC), for example from the University of Mauritius. 2.2 Future penetration: trends and potential Potential is considered here as the orientation towards the future evolution. There are different types of potential, including resources (physical constraints), technical, economic and market potential and environmental/sustainability potential. In this section, just the technical potential is considered. In the inception report of this study, the term \u201cpotential\u201d has already been defined as follows: 15 Van Niekerk (2014): Potential of ocean energy to contribute to a sustainable energy future in South Africa ",
        "31 \uf0b7 The theoretical (resource) potential for renewable energy is derived from the physical supply of RES and represents a theoretical upper limit to the available energy supply. Only a part of this potential can be tapped due to technical, economical, structural or administrative restrictions; \uf0b7 The technical potential refers to the percentage of theoretical potential that can be used given current technical possibilities: available technologies, their efficiency, site availability, environmental impact, and other non technical barriers; \uf0b7 The economic potential for renewable energy use refers to the share of the technical potential that can be used economically considering the context of the country. The economic potential is competing with other energy supply depending on the application areas and on the fuel price as primary source of energy; \uf0b7 The realisable (market) potential refers to the expected contribution for using RES. Most of the time the realizable potential is lower than economic potential however, it can be greater if RES are subsidized. The realisable (market) potential therefore depends much on the cost of RES in relation to traditional energy sources. Here it is important to note that costs of electricity are high in Sub- Saharan Africa and often higher than in the rest of the world. The main reasons for this are: (1) the majority of SSA countries are dependent on imported oil; (2) high transport costs of petroleum products; (3) poor quality of electricity supply in many regions (technical and non-technical losses); (4) significant share of the population served by distributed, inefficient power generation systems; (5) thermal and hydro power plants in Africa are generally small, reflecting the fragmented nature of African power systems which impose a cost penalty on power systems.

The study has collected recent studies assessing bioenergy potential in Africa, compared their various methodologies, benchmarked the results, and identified the key dimensioning elements for those assessments. As a first result of this analysis it appears that energy crops, residues and waste may represents two or three times more potential than forestry biomass. In terms of energy supply that means that a huge biomass potential is existing but poorly exploited today. Fuel wood and charcoal Biomass and traditional fuels will remain the most important source of energy for a majority of Sub- Saharan Africa countries over the next decades. The main changes will come from afforestation and diversification of resources: biomass-energy will be produced not only from firewood and charcoal, but also from agro-industries\u2019 biomass residues, biofuels and biogas from agricultural and urban waste. These resources have a double advantage: energy production and reduction of environmental impacts such as GHG emissions. In terms of demand, the objective is to more efficiently use these resources for households (improved cook stoves), but also for industries still using biomass, such as bakeries or tea industries. In SSA, biomass resources have the potential to reduce the differences between rural and urban areas in terms of access to modern energy. Comparing fuel wood production to available biomass reveals important contrasts depending on the country. Some countries harvest and collect far more firewood than they can sustainably replace. Agro-industry wood and waste The agro industry can restructure itself (concentration) in a few years only and foreign investors renting or buying large agricultural areas in Africa can set up new power plants rapidly. The co- generation plants often sell surplus of electricity to the grid and they could potentially supply rural mini grids. There is significant potential in SSA for scaling up a market based cogeneration model as a supplier of rural electrification and industrial services. Cogeneration is more popular for isolated agro-industries to self-generate electricity and thermal energy where national grids are ",
        "33 lacking or insufficiently reliable. Such plants could stimulate growth of industrial activity. With feed stock security, proven combustion technology and policy support such as Feed-in Tariffs, a biomass co-generation plant can be both an anchor client and a supplier of electricity. Both the technical and the economic potentials of biomass cogeneration can considerably increase in a few years. The potential is therefore extremely important. Some examples: \uf0b7 25 potential sites (37 MWe) in Cameroon mainly for wood industries (18 sites, 35 MWe) + rice husks, maize (corn) stalks; \uf0b7 200 projects identified by the Cogen for Africa programme in East Africa representing a total capacity of 879 MWe and 2 577 MWth in various sectors; \uf0b7 2 700 MW is the potential estimated for South Africa over the next 10 years at a competitive cost. Liquid biofuels Overall, biofuels could play a more important role in the fuel mix of SSA countries, for transport, industrial use and for power generation and cooking, particularly in areas with significant rainfall. It is important to keep in mind that according to in-depth studies on biofuels, their potential for replacing petroleum products would be in the range of a significant average 5/10%.(if optimally developed). Research is ongoing on the development of second and third generation biofuels produced from non-food, cellulosic biomass: wood and straw residues, non-food crops, organic part of urban waste, micro-algae, etc. These kinds of feedstock require capital intensive processing, and the technologies have to be confirmed for sustainable production. The economic viability depends on the price of the biomass and oil-based fuels. Broadly, biomass used for biofuel production as a by- product of main agriculture activity can be made price competitive without massive subsidies. However, cultivation of plants for biofuel production alone is still generally non-competitive without government subsidies or an additional cost to consumers within the context of SSA. In spite of a real political will in many countries, the barriers for development of biofuel production in SSA are: the high upfront investment costs, longer investment payback time, poor infrastructure and utilization of value chain potential (valorisation of by-products), lack of know-how and a political framework to support the development of the sector. National energy policies have to create a promotional policy framework including subsidies, tariff policies and incentives for development of relevant specific crops and cultivations methods: small scale grower model for jatropha, camelina, cator beans, etc. (depending the country\u2019s soil and rain fall conditions) which would not compete with food production. 16 Municipal waste, landfill and biogas Landfill gas is a starting practice in South Africa, as well as industrial bio-digesters, although energy potentials of solid municipal, wet agro-industrial wastes and waste waters for anaerobic digestion can largely vary, depending on the following elements: \uf0b7 Amount of waste (tons per year); \uf0b7 Seasonal availability of the waste (for biogas production a residue should be available during the whole year or should be storable); \uf0b7 Dry matter (DM) content of the waste (% fresh matter, FM); \uf0b7 Volatile solids (VS) content (% DM). 16 An example of small scale and extensive applications is using biofuel crops for fencing. ",
        "34 Considering the expected trend in growing urbanisation and consequent urban-waste production, the relevance of Municipal waste-to-energy technologies is expected to grow significantly in the next decades. Nonetheless, managing the urban waste streams is a complex practice and serious barriers can emerge in the fulfilment of such potentials due to suboptimal urban management, regulations and economic incentives provided by policy. So far, biogas technologies are mainly developed in East and West Africa (Kenya/Ghana), but are increasingly growing across SSA (e.g. Mozambique, Mauritius, Uganda, Ethiopia) due to the support of International donors. Although the majority of technologies installed refer to micro- digesters (200,000 estimated across SSA of the power of up to 10/15 kW each), the most promising in terms of economic impact and potentials generated seem to be sector-related digesters (200 estimated across SSA of power generated up to 150 kW each). Due to different stages of current penetration, micro-digesters may be expected to double in the next decade and then slightly stabilise in the following ten years (e.g. about 600,000 installations in 2025), whilst sectorial digesters may have the potential to quadruplicate in each decade for the next twenty years (e.g. about 25,000 installations in 2025). A mix of too costly technology, lack of financial support and high entry costs for local grids (e.g. Kenya) - or too limited access by the local population (e.g. Mozambique) - may prevent further development in the short terms. Also, the actual capacity to provide maintenance through time to such installation is limited, with consequent risk of a limited performance of installed devices. 2.2.2 Hydropower Large hydropower Africa has a large hydropower potential and possesses some of the largest waterways of the world, including the Nile, Congo, Niger, Volta and Zambezi river systems. However, it currently uses only a fraction of it. The technical hydropower potential of Africa is around 200 000 MW 17 . This is slightly higher than the hydropower potential of Europe or about 12 % of the global potential. Africa\u2019s economically feasible potential is around 114 000 MW 18 , while only a very small percentage of this potential is exploited. This suggests a significant potential for long term development of Hydro in SSA. The future large-scale hydro penetration is made up of projects which are under development. In 2010, ten regional hydroelectric projects were programmed in SSA, to be commissioned before (or in) 2018, with a total of 8 862 MW 19 . In addition, sixteen further hydro projects with a capacity of 6 254 MW, for which preparation studies are completed, are to be commissioned after 2015. When assessing the possible hydropower capacity by 2040, the total to be realised capacity is estimated to be nearly 60 000 MW 20 . The planned capacity is significant, although obviously usually not all projects make it to completion. Small hydropower The potential from small, mini and micro run of river sites (less than 10 MW per site) must be added to this potential for large hydropower. For SSA, it is estimated that the underdeveloped small and mini hydropower potential totals around 15 000 MW with an average energy production of around 60 000 GWh/year. The potential for small hydropower in Africa is estimated to be in the range of 17 GVEP 2011 3.1 18 WAEA 2008 19 Technical Study for the ACP development report 2013 on the theme Energy for Sustainable Development- RAL 2013 20 Idem ",
        "35 4 000 to 10 000 MW of which less than 0.5 % is currently developed. In East Africa only Ethiopia has a reasonably high installed capacity of 80 MW of small hydropower plants 21 . 2.2.3 Solar energy Solar photovoltaic The segment of solar home systems is now moving from a development-aid supported market to a commercial business activity with many manufacturers providing products designed for African customers. The market for hybrid PV-diesel systems is slowly growing in some countries, mainly thanks to development aid, except in Mali where this is growing very fast because of a strong government will. The growth of grid-tied solar PV in the urban environment is directly linked to government policies in terms of regulation and tariffs. Presently, net-metering and feed-in-tariffs policies are scarce in SSA. Because utilities are suffering from undersized generation capacity, the development of small PV production (for which investments are made by customer) could be seen as a good technological option to be promoted by governments and utilities. Regarding large-scale PV power plants, analysis 22 done on the technical potential that can be competitively injected in the interconnected grids of the West-African Power Pool shows that by 2025 GWp could be installed in WAEMU countries. At present, advanced projects in the WAEMU region totals 264 MWp of PV capacity 23 . Considering current trends and announced projects, it is reasonable to think that in a couple of years the annual market for large multi-megawatt PV power plants in SSA will cross 0.5 GWp per year. Solar thermal technologies The market for solar water heaters in SSA is mainly concentrated in South Africa, where this sector is going through a consolidation process with a decrease in the number of registered installers. In other SSA countries, specific market segments could emerge: SWH for hotels and office buildings, if promotion and support programs are implemented. But there is no real sign that such pro-active programs will be implemented. Regarding solar cooling, there are still technical barriers to overcome before this technology could enter an active market-development phase. The need for process-heat in large industries could benefit from research topics common to both large solar cooling and large solar heating done in Europe. Further investigation is required for assessment of actual market potential. Concentrated solar power for electricity generation Within SSA, it is clearly South Africa that leads the early development of CSP. Within its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 2010-2030, the South African Government undertook to increase the country\u2019s total installed electricity capacity by 170 % to 454 TW by 2030, 3 725 MW of which would come from renewable energy technologies. Southern Africa is seen by multiple analysts as one of the most important regions to develop renewable energies globally. Recently, 200 MW of CSP renewable projects were granted preferred bidder status under the last round of South Africa\u2019s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Programme (REIPPP). Namibia is preparing its first 50 MW concentrated solar power project and Botswana has plans to include renewable energy amongst its energy portfolio. 21 WAEA 2008 22 The potential for PV solar in West Africa: Hybrid systems and large scale power plants, G.L\u00e9na, presentation at CSS West Africa, May 2014, Dakar. 23 Overview of policies and initiatives in the West African Region, M.Kappiah, presentation at CSS West Africa, may 2014, Dakar ",
        "36 2.2.4 Wind energy A range of wind energy projects is currently being constructed (954 MW across the region) or in the initial concept phase (765 MW). However, taking into consideration that the initial phase of finding the appropriate location and coming to an agreement with local authorities can take anywhere from 4-9 years, it is difficult to estimate what share of the planned project would come to see a successful implementation. Provided that 80% of projects currently being in development phase are completed with the proposed capacity, within the next decade 763.2 MW power will be generated using wind energy resulting in a 118% increase of the current capacity (644 MW). On the longer term, the ability of the national governments to create effective feed-in tariffs and price settings for wind energy will strongly determine future developments for the sector. This includes policy stability necessary for investors to provide certainty for off-take of produced electricity. In terms of resource availability, though, the potentials for wind energy are stronger in South Africa and the Great Rift Valley but generally limited when it comes to offshore wind, In fact, although offshore wind speed is considerably higher than inland wind, especially so in the sub-desert regions, high costs in the implantation pose serious obstacles to the full exploitation of the technology in the region. Although specific policy initiatives are announced in South Africa, these are expected to materialise only beyond 2020. 2.2.5 Geothermal Africa\u2019s geothermal power potential is concentrated in the Rift Valley countries and the theoretical potential is estimated as high as 15,000 MW, though more conservative, and realistic, estimates are between 7-9,000 MW. The commercially viable potential is estimated at 5,000 MW. Around 500 MW of this potential has been developed for electricity generation (Kenya\u2019s installed capacity is 470 MW in 2015). While geothermal development to date has been exclusively developed for national electricity markets, geothermal energy, if fully exploited, could also benefit to regional electricity markets, in particular in Eastern Africa. In Ethiopia, about 7.5 MW has been developed, geothermal potential has also been identified in Djibouti, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Kenya\u2019s potential is estimated 5,000MW by 2030. Rwanda recently committed funds to start drilling in order to harness (310 MW by 2017) some of its estimated 700MW potential. Other objectives have been identified in Uganda (45 MW by 2017) and in Ethiopia (450 MW by 2018 and 1,000 MW by 2030). Investment costs are in the range of 3,000 \u20ac/kW installed and generation costs in the range of 10 \u20ac cents/kWh but it is expected to decrease these costs and reach 6\u20ac cents/kWh affordable with feed- in tariffs within less than 10 years. \uf0b7 Kenya : The government is actively developing its geothermal resources, which already supply about 20 % of Kenya\u2019s electricity. More-than-1 000 megawatts of geothermal projects are under development. Geothermal energy is expected to provide half of all the country\u2019s electric needs by 2018. But the investments are huge and there is no government risk guarantees; private partners are encouraged to get it from the World Bank\u2019s Multilateral Guarantee Agency. Innovative projects are limited by collecting steam from numerous wells and duration of large geothermal plant construction. Kengen began building temporary geothermal plants (5 MW for the pilot plant- portable station for rural and remote areas) within six months instead of 4 to 10 years for large plants; \uf0b7 Ethiopia: The design of a geothermal energy master plan is ongoing financed by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the potential of 18 sites will be tested. The extension of the Aluto-Langano geothermal energy resources and power plant to 70 MW has also been ",
        "37 launched at the same time. In 2013, with US (Power Africa Initiative)-Icelandic company, Ethiopia signed a 3billion euros deal to develop the 1 000 MW Corbetti geothermal energy farm (200 km south of Addis Ababa). The Corbetti project will be one of the lowest cost in the world and aims at generate electricity both for Ethiopian communities and for export; \uf0b7 Tanzania : According to the African Development Bank, the Tanzanian potential is estimated of 650 MW, and the country hopes to develop 50 geothermal locations. The company, Geothermal Power Tanzania, plans to invest \u20ac 260 m to explore the different fields and develop a 140MW geothermal plant by 2018 in the Mbeya Region. Tanzania expects to reap the rewards of Kenya\u2019s geothermal expertise, experience and equipment. Training of 1000 Tanzanians on geothermal technology was financed in 2014 by JICA; \uf0b7 Uganda : A geothermal resources department is starting in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and the creation of a standalone geothermal entity is on the way. JICA is extending its technical assistance to Uganda and 17 sites have been prospected, 25 Ugandans have been trained. Seven companies have been licensed to explore but they are lacking of technical, financial and operation resources; \uf0b7 The Republic of Djibouti is supported by the African Development Group and the Danish Sustainable Energy Fund for the Lake Assal project (\u20ac 25 m); \uf0b7 Rwanda potential is estimated of more than 700 MW according to KenGen 2011 study. Several sites have been identified and three wells have been drilled in 2013. 2.2.6 Ocean energy The outlook for ocean energy in general is that in the coming years more and more devices will be put in the water for long-term testing. By 2020 the first real power plants should be in the water to provide a first understanding of the real costs until 2025. By 2030 the deployment should be ready 24 . According to IEA scenarios the capacity for ocean energy will increase to about 15 GW installed worldwide in 2035 25 . This means that there will be between three and six TWh in 2020 and 32-82 TWh in 2035 (depending on the policy scenario) generated 26 . For Sub-Saharan Africa it is very difficult to make predictions, as there are too many uncertainties at this stage. The IEA does not predict any market pick-up for ocean energy until 2035 at this moment for the whole continent. Individual projects may however prove these scenarios wrong. The long term potential for ocean energy for Sub-Saharan Africa is huge. Worldwide estimates show that wave power alone may generate between 1 000 and 10 000 GW (about world\u2019s total electricity consumption) and tidal energy may generate about 3 000 GW. Given the about 26 000 kilometres of coastline of the continent there is huge potential to develop a market. This is in particular true for Sub-Saharan Africa where waves and tides are stronger. Tidal power is limited to select sites due to economic considerations, requiring a large tidal range and proximity to existing transmission lines to be considered viable 27 . Tidal is expected to pick-up earlier than wave. Current scenarios do not foresee installations of tidal energy in Sub-Saharan Africa. One reason for this is that the Sub-Saharan country showing most interest in ocean energy until now is South Africa, which has due to its location higher hopes in wave energy than tidal. The potential development in other countries with potential such as Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya and Somalia will depend on the one hand side on the creation of the necessary surrounding infrastructure, the attraction of skilled people and the creation of a stable regulatory 24 According to interviews 25 IEA (2012): World Energy Outlook 2012 p.230 26 IEA (2012): World Energy Outlook 2012 p.216 27 IEA (2012): World Energy Outlook 2012 p.230 ",
        "38 framework and on the other hand on the development of tidal energy in more advanced areas. There are currently six main technologies being tested in different locations in the world. Some of them may be implemented also in Sub-Saharan Africa in the future. In general, wave power is seen as the second technology among ocean energy technologies which will strongly develop in the upcoming decades after tidal energy. And despite these recent developments it is expected to still have a time lag of about five years after tidal to be ready for large scale implementation 28 . According to the IEA, wave power has notable potential to contribute to meeting electricity demand in the future, but the relevant technologies are still in their infancy, requiring significant improvements to reduce costs 29 . Therefore, IEA scenarios do not expect any wave power capacity installed in Africa before 2035 30 . Nevertheless, given the higher potential of wave power for Ghana as well as South Africa in comparison to tidal energy, the countries may follow and contribute to further developments of existing technologies to implement them as soon as ready. Interest from Ghana in wave power technology has become acute since an analysis of TC\u2019s Energy Limited showed that waves along the coastline of Ghana are sufficiently strong to economically exploit this resource in the future 31 . The advantage of waves in Ghana is that they are very constant in strength and direction. As a consequence, TC Energy Ltd together with Swede Energy recently signed a contract with the government of Ghana to build a capacity of 1 000 MW in Ghana 32 . The technology to be implemented is coming from the Swedish company SEABASED and first equipment are expected to be shortly delivered and are aimed to be in the water in the early 2015. The technology allows to install individual devices of 2 MW each and to gradually increase the number of devices. The overall project can be completed (under ideal conditions) in 5- 8 years. This would be the largest wave power plant worldwide 33 . 2.3 Drivers and barriers \u2013 a view from the helicopter This section provides an analysis of the main drivers and barriers for the uptake of renewable energy technologies (RETs) in Sub-Saharan Africa. The drivers and barriers identified in the annexed RET reports are taken as the starting point and have been synthesised and categorised. The drivers and barriers are structured in the following themes: 1. Resource drivers and barriers , covering resource competition and land use issues, availability of data and resource mapping; 2. Technological drivers and barriers , covering testing and implementation of new RETs, technological capacity of the SSA labour force and the key enablers that make certain RETs so unique; 3. Business and regulatory environment , covering technology awareness and demand of the SSA population, the environment for developing business and finance and the regulatory framework to support this development; 4. Economic drivers and barriers , containing a supply chain analysis of downstream and upstream activities. 28 Based on interviews 29 IEA (2012): World Energy Outlook 2012, p. 230 30 IEA (2012): World Energy Outlook 2012, p. 610/611 31 http://www.tcenergy-gh.com/project-plan-in-ada/ 32 http://www.offshorewind.biz/2014/06/23/sweden-ghana-to-develop-1gw-wave-energy-project/ 33 Based on interviews ",
        "39 These drivers and barriers serve as the basis for the assessment of the research needs in Chapter 4, and for the identification of areas for cooperation between the EU and SSA in Chapter 7. 2.3.1 Resource drivers and barriers Resource competition and land issues Competition between the use of scarcely available natural resources for RETs and other uses are a major issue in the SSA region. The extent to which RETs compete with other resources results into barriers (intensive competition). A well-known example are the first generation biofuels, where bioethanol production from molasses (sugar cane), maize (corn), cassava, sorghum, soy and other crops drive the competition with available agricultural land for food production. Another frequently mentioned example is jatropha, a crop which needs substantial amounts of water and for that reason often competing with food production. These practices \u2013 often related to recent experiences in the past \u2013 can limit the appetite for renewable energy from governments and civil society alike. Competition for resources is evidently not limited to biofuels or biomass. Other RETs also require significant tracks of land (the most prevalent being hydro power) and/or volumes of water (e.g. hydro, CSP). However the \u2018food versus fuel\u2019 debate is complex and in an SSA-context quite different from other parts of the world. Large parts of the region are not cultivated at all, which allows for energy crops in places less suitable for food crops. Furthermore, access to energy can provide a boost to drainage and irrigation, thus promoting food crops. And electricity generation from bagasse (sugar cane residues) has fertilisers as a by-product. A key advantage of renewable energy is that it dampens the effects of variable global oil prices. Countries that import fossil fuels could switch to the local use of biofuels so as to stabilise consumer purchasing power. This may be more feasible for the rural population at first, as urban areas rely more on international markets. 34 To overcome other barriers, governments and businesses can incentivise farmers to change their practices along several avenues. Examples for biomass include a crop diversification scheme promoting crops that require little water; and using pellets and briquettes made from agro-forestry by-products, replacing Charcoal and Fuel wood biomass in urban areas and industries. An example for hydropower would be to strike agreements between water users across the entire river basin. These agreements can be bolstered by advocating the use of storage systems and controlling river discharge, which reduces flood risk and balances freshwater supply. 35 A more extensive discussion addressing resource-related barriers is provided under Chapter 3, where the mitigation potential for negative impacts is discussed, as well as the RET report on Bioenergy. Data requirements and resource mapping Having data and maps is vital for the assessment of any resource\u2019s potential, and RETs are no exception. Resource mapping can be important to assess the potential benefits of introducing an RET, and to inform governments as to what benefits these RETs would add to their country\u2019s energy mix. 34 OECD, 2008.

        "40 This barrier has been identified for nearly all RETs and examples are numerous. In the field of hydro, the assessment and mapping of especially indigenous small-scale resources is an important activity for SSA-based R&I institutions. For example, Nigeria\u2019s National Centre for Hydropower Research and Development at the University of Ilorin undertakes the assessment of the country\u2019s hydropower resources 36 . Another example is the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) in Cape Verde, which is planning to implement a web-based GIS hydropower resource mapping exercise to facilitate the identification of attractive sites for hydropower generation in the region. For solar power, the availability of DIN data 37 stimulates development of CSP, as this also helps with the identification of attractive sites. The barriers can be significant for RET development: unavailability of data on wind speeds in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria and Senegal greatly hampers deployment. The high costs of data collection in remove areas are a barrier to address unavailability of data, especially for off-grid RET\u2019s. Experiences on RET deployment can also be used to identify and address barriers. For example, a dataset compiled by the Solar Energy Institute of Madrid University on the field performance of 50,000 solar home systems in SSA, Latin America and the Caribbean revealed that technical reliability and appropriate sizing are the main challenges for PV-based rural electrification. Another example is the limited experience with deployed CSP plants (as well as capital expenditures) in SSA, making project funding challenging. In conclusion, not having details on resource mapping and appropriate data can act as a serious barrier to the success of RETs in SSA. Conversely, resource mapping and data collection could lead to new insights in how to overcome the challenges of deployment of RETs, lead to avenues for further research, and identify new opportunities for both governments and businesses to invest in RETs. For more information on the RET-specific resource drivers and barriers, please refer to Table 2.7. 36 We focus here on activities carried out by SSA-based organisations. Stakeholders outside Africa are also active in the mapping of Africa\u2019s RE resources \u2013 the EU\u2019s JRC is one of them. 37 DIN data relates to the positioning of the mirrors and consequently optimization of production potential.

        "43 2.3.2 Technological drivers and barriers The main technological drivers and barriers for RETs in SSA relate to i) technological maturity; ii) technological competences; as well as to the iii) enablers of RETs. Technological maturity Technological maturity is an important driver for the viability of RETs in Africa. Testing and implementation can stimulate RET uptake when the technology is still immature. This seems to be very relevant for biomass, ocean energy, and grids. For example, new and improved top-lit updraft gasifier (TLUD) stoves such as \u201cBURNDESIGN\u201d are being finalised outside of Africa and could bring closer the industrialised-scale production of smoke-free, highly efficient fuel wood and charcoal biomass. This driver could bring large benefits for countries such as Burkina Faso, where the penetration of fuel wood and charcoal is thought to be as high as 90%. 38 Furthermore, the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa is currently developing commercially viable value chains for 2nd generation lignocellulose conversion to biofuels, which could become a technology and services provider to biofuel producers in the rest of Africa. South Africa is also home to a large bio- landfill pilot study 39 , providing the expertise required for implementing bio-digesters in large landfill operations. Technologies that are not yet mature obviously provide scope for improvement, which can become an important driver for its uptake. For example, efficiency levels for first and second generation biofuel technologies can still be significantly improved. Currently, a wide range of technologies is being tested. For example, the Deep Green pilot is testing carbon fibre kites that produce tidal energy in Northern Ireland. If these technologies break through, they can speed up the development of wave and tidal technology. Specific university programmes are set up (e.g. in Stellenbosch) where young and interested people are trained and publicly-funded research projects can act as further drivers to develop break-through technologies. A barrier related to realising sufficient economies of scale is the difficulty of designing and operating broad waste-management strategies for biodigesters. In order to increase a wider uptake in SSA, it may be pivotal to integrate smaller and large waste producers in a hybrid landscape of urban and rural (\u201cperi-urban\u201d) characteristics that integrates different levels of waste production management, from local villages to larger urban landfills. This can stimulate biodigester uptake, but requires a clear strategy. Regarding grids, implementation experiences in Africa have mostly seen successes for Single and Two-Wire Earth Return (SWER and TWER respectively) transmission lines. Both run on the Low and Medium Voltage (LV and MV) grids. Well-known examples for SWER lines can be found in South Africa, Cameroon, Tunisia and Burkina Faso, where the low cost and easy, reliable design of SWER lines are currently being further driven by improvements in phase-phase contacts to lower the risk of fire, which can be a major hazard when equipment is aged. 40 SWER is particularly easy to use, since it uses the earth instead of a second wire as a return path for the current. However, a barrier for SWER lines is that they cannot be deployed in areas where the ground sensitivity for connecting to the earth (\u201cearthing\u201d) is inadequate. TWER lines could offer a solution in this regard; they are a good alternative for electrification of low-density load areas, and some experiences with this technology exist in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Another driver for TWER technology is that it does not require a special design for its lines, insulators, pylons and other goods compared to standard high voltage (HV) grids. Furthermore, it is possible to electrify villages with TWER technology when constructing new HV grids, if it is positioned directly under 38 REEEP Policy Database (contributed by SERN for REEEP. 2012. http://www.reegle.info/policy-and-regulatory-overviews/BF 39 The Ekurhuleni Landfill Gas Recovery Project in South Africa is the largest experience so far and one of the few operating. 40 Victoria, Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission Final Report (2009), section 4.3.5. http://royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Commission-Reports/Final-Report/Volume-2/Chapters/Electricity-Caused-Fire.html ",
        "44 these grids. This is important because the maintenance of medium voltage (MV) grids is more complicated if they are located above the HV grids. In addition, MV and LV grids are generally fraud with balancing difficulties; reduced or instable voltages, or lowered frequency and load shedding when the system overloads because too many SWER branches are connected. These overloads are not uncommon as generation capacity is lower than required in much of Sub-Saharan Africa. Renewable energy (RE) inverters could help maintain voltage levels or keep RE supply (even during short-time faults) by acting as a back-up system or reactive power control. In addition, mini- grids can be used in remote areas where connection to the national grid is not economical. 41 In urban areas, batteries can support the generation of RE by providing a continuous supply; wealthier customers willing to have a back-up supply would be the main drivers in this regard. Technological competences Cheap labour is abundant in Sub-Saharan Africa: close to 80 % of its population is estimated to work in low-productivity, low-income jobs 42 . Development of renewable energy can drive employment in this regard as it creates employment also for less-educated local populations. As an example, short-term employment benefits are present in the separation of organic urban and domestic waste in landfill areas, provided that basic safety and hygienic standards are respected. A recurring barrier is the lack of high-quality, skilled labour (technological and non technological). This is sketched by the failure of many NGO projects for first generation biomass, in which the absence of skilled labour was often critical. The lack of skilled labour is also relevant for many other renewable energy technologies (RETs), in particular small-scale hydropower, wind, geothermal, tidal and wave energy, and grids. Engineering and management skills are required to develop turnkey wind farms, but also to sign complex Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts and service agreements. Drawing the necessary expertise available from other (energy) sectors might prove to be difficult, especially for SMEs (for example, competing with the oil & gas industry for personnel can be expensive). This is confirmed by Adcorp Employment Index 43 , which states that there are currently nearly 830 000 unfilled positions for high-skilled workers in South Africa 44 45 . The shortage is greatest among technicians (430 000) and managers (215 000). The shortage is stressed by increased wages of high skilled labourers by more than 285 % since 2000, and corrected for inflation. 46 These barriers create potential drivers for other RETs; small-scale hydro \u2018only\u2019 requires traditional engineering approaches and water management; pellets, briquettes, fuel wood and charcoal biomass are generally well-adapted to local usage and traditions. A barrier related to the technical capacity of SSA residents is technology complexity. In bioenergy, for example, machines and technologies for pellets and briquettes processing are often imported, and SSA countries generally lack the capacity to maintain them. A better understanding on how to manage and use landfills, industrial and micro-digesters by end users is often lacking. The resulting poor use of technologies can lead to malfunctioning and abandonment. This barrier is exacerbated by the fact that SSA countries often need to compromise between cheap, low-quality, high operation and maintenance risk technologies and more expensive high-quality, low risk equivalents. The SSA context requires cheap machineries that can still last in local conditions and can be 41 RECP, 2014. \u201cMini-Grid Policy Toolkit\u201d.

        "45 targeted to the (often simple) needs of rural areas. This first requires technologies to be customised. This is especially relevant for the EU, as common practice of waste management in the EU requires skilled professionals and managers that are often absent. For many of these practices, it is crucial to learn \u201cwhat works and what does not in the SSA context\u201d. For example, polycrystalline or multi-crystalline solar PV panels (the most widely used panel types in Europe) suffer from low heat tolerance, making them less efficient than mono-crystalline panels in warm climates. 47 Secondly, it requires machinery to be simplified in order to achieve a lower price while still maintaining quality. Enablers Enablers here are seen as the elements (e.g. inputs and infrastructure) required for RETs to be used by the SSA population. The first enabler is deployability, which is particularly a driver for biomass technologies. For example, micro-digesters require only a minimum amount of biomass to operate, making them optimal in the daily use of small households with cattle. Low maintenance requirements for urban and domestic waste, as well as for small-scale hydropower also make for easily accessible technologies. In addition, their standardised, stand-alone design makes micro- digesters easy to adopt in local conditions. Furthermore, multi-node waste management systems allow waste to be recycled locally whenever possible and sent to larger landfills for more complex procedures. Therefore, large transport infrastructures are no longer required. A second enabler is the existence of efficient infrastructures. Concentrated solar power (CSP) is driven in South Africa by the presence of well-developed ports, harbours and national roads, combined with a national grid capable of extracting CSP power (although CSP developers are required to consult Eskom and as it can take a long time to obtain grid access). Turbines for small- scale hydropower can be applied in a large amount of sites, creating scope for efficiency in a wide range of flow and head conditions. 48 Furthermore, the limited development of the grid in some areas has led to the development of hybrid solutions: for example, a PV-diesel system powers a (rural) home with solar PV during the day, after which the diesel engine switches on after the sun goes down. In addition to biomass and solar, there are also several deployability drivers for hydropower technologies: for example, pico- and micro-level hydropower are fairly rapidly build, have some of the lowest overall costs for independently-ran power supplies, and can be sold over- the-counter. Furthermore, they hardly incur any running or follow-up costs, unlike battery packs required for PV systems. 49 A barrier for biomass technologies is the collection of waste. For example, micro-digesters are not ideal for small households in remote areas without cattle, because it would be difficult to acquire the necessary biomass. Transport costs for raw biomass are generally high. Consequently, if well- designed infrastructure for the collection of waste is not available, it will be difficult to deploy bio- digesters and other biomass technologies beyond areas with point sources of significant volumes of biomass. Transport and logistics can be a major barrier, especially for biomass technologies. For example, even though pellets and briquettes biomass are easy to transport compared to regular biomass, transport costs are still high and form a barrier for further uptake. This is more so with other technologies, e.g. transporting wet and bulky substance to gasifiers is difficult. Accessibility is also problematic for other technologies, e.g. geothermal, wind and hydro. The absence of suitable infrastructure and the accompanied complexity of transporting over larger distances may be one of 47 Verbal communications with local PV manufacturers in Namibia. 48 http://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/files/pub39663.pdf 49 https://energypedia.info/wiki/Pico_Hydro_Power ",
        "46 the reasons why first generation biofuels are often still sold in local markets of land-locked countries, or e.g. wind energy is not yet widely deployed in SSA. In addition, transmission grid infrastructural costs increase with scale: the larger or remote a hydropower plant or a wind turbine park are, the larger are the infrastructural barriers. Small-scale solutions, such as pico- and micro-hydro, require less from the grid. But a suitable site relatively close to the location where the new power is needed still requires pre-feasibility checks and a basic knowledge of the technology 50 . Networking and exchange of good practices is needed so to overcome existing barriers and the lack of awareness on these technologies, including greater support to disseminate information through dedicated forums and conferences. For example, the selection of a CSP site requires due consideration since not all HV grids may be able to absorb power from large CSP plants.

        "49 2.3.3 Business and Regulatory Environment: drivers and barriers The main drivers and barriers for RETs in SSA concerning the business and regulatory environment can be found in the areas of i) awareness and demand for RETs; ii) business and finance; as well as in the iii) regulatory framework in which businesses have to operate. Awareness and demand Awareness for renewable energy technologies is on the rise in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and that has become an important driver. For example, mini-grids, geothermal and small-scale hydro technologies are socially highly accepted due to their clean image. Concentrated solar power (CSP) is ideally suited for the South African power demand profile, whereas first generation biofuel burners have seen a rise in popularity due to rising cooking fuel prices. A lack of awareness and trust (e.g. through sub-standard qualities such as in PV) presents a barrier for certain technologies. Due to the high complexity of waste management in its operations, awareness for the possibilities of bio-landfills is still rather limited to the broader public and local business. Government policy can also suffer from a lack of awareness when the policy makers in question view RETs (either in general or only those not connected to the national grid) to be unreliable and inefficient. For grids, there can be a lack of understanding and knowledge on how to implement distributed and decentralised grids that could incorporate local grids of RETs power with the national network of \u201ctraditional \u201cenergy. Small innovative pilot projects could offer a solution by creating visibility and interest on the side of builders, urban planners, waste management operators and financial institutions. Adaptation of pilot initiatives and \u201cbusiness cases\u201d is also essential to convince policy makers and investors, but this is not commonly available. Furthermore, good habits in waste management and recycling are still largely unknown to the SSA population, particularly in urban settlements and large cities. Consumer awareness poses an additional barrier for several technologies. For example, basic knowledge on how to use and maintain micro-digesters implies that only 60 % of installations are actually used by households. Another example is the fact that indirect benefits of solar thermal for water heating are underestimated or not even acknowledged by the SSA population, reducing the potential interest by consumers and resulting in an \u201cinvestor myopia\u201d (i.e. lack of interest on the investors side) for this technology. Overcoming these barriers requires the marketing, promotion, and demonstration of new applications in order to increase awareness levels for both the local population and for planner who direct budgets in the country. An evident and relevant barrier is that demand is often simply lacking. This can relate to the costs of a specific technology, technology-specific cultural issues and/or simply the generic demand for energy/electricity due to limited purchasing power \u2013 not to confuse with \u2018needs\u2019 which are huge. More generally, new business models (payment methods, lease plans, etc.) are needed to address the issues of consumer uptake. Business and finance Market opportunities exist for a large range of specific technologies. For example, a growing interest from local businesses is noticeable to work together with EU businesses in order to draw the attention of local investors. This is essential for example in the support for the relatively costly technology of industrial biomass digesters. Other business opportunities are potentially present for the local assembly of turbines for pico-Hydro, since the required machinery can be sold off-the- shelf. Market opportunities also exist with the urban wealthy population or commercial applications in solar thermal (e.g. hotels), as hot water use is correlated with a household\u2019s standard of living in SSA. ",
        "50 A relevant barrier for several technologies is an insufficient return on investment (RoI). This may be the case for first generation biofuels, as investors demand RoIs within a shorter time frame (e.g. 5 years) than is required for biofuel production (i.e. 10 years). Similar barriers seem to exist for micro- and industry digester technologies, for which a limited RoI is not particularly appealing for investment banks. This in turn requires a continued dependence on international subsidies. Large- scale hydro projects do have the largest energy payback ratios 51 among other electricity generation options, although they tend to suffer from long payback periods (see below). Wind energy also suffers from relatively lower RoIs and internal rates of return (IRRs). Furthermore, the large upfront investments and long payback periods (e.g. geothermal and large- scale hydro) require multi-year high-volume contracts and/or a heavy reliance on donor money. In addition, they require extensive grid infrastructure, limiting client portfolio diversification. Especially this limitation can be detrimental to the bargaining power of large-scale energy producers and significantly harm the feasibility of these projects. Other technologies that seem to suffer from large upfront investments are solar PV and solar CSP. On the other hand, a key driver within small-scale solar PV are pre-payment solutions for solar home systems (SHS), as well as the modularity of pico-PV systems that allow the customer to buy components of the system step-by-step. To overcome this barrier, countries may opt to pool their investment resources to jointly develop technologies. One example is given by the governments of Rwanda and Tanzania, who are currently developing several hydropower projects with the World Bank in the US$ 312 million Nile Basin Initiative. Interregional power pools are an important driver for hydropower development, as regional or domestic markets often have insufficient electricity demand by themselves. An immediate downside of such cross-border developments is however the need for major investments in HV-grid \u2013 currently a major barrier for the Inga Dam expansion in Congo. Regulatory framework As already pointed out in Chapter 1 of this report, an appropriate regulatory framework is a precondition for the successful roll-out of renewable energy. Several SSA governments have shown a strong interest in stimulating RETs. For example, as a response to rising oil prices, several land- locked countries have started supporting first and second generation biofuel production for local use in blend with fossil fuels. A barrier for this is the lack of standardisation for oil-biofuel composition in many SSA countries, which is needed to use the mixed fuel. Another response to high oil prices is the support to micro-digesters, industry digesters, and urban and domestic waste technologies. Natural events, such as the tens of millions of hectares of invader bush across the country of Namibia, have led to a line of academic research focusing on using this type of biomass economically. 52 These technologies are being subsidised by both local governments and international donors, while funding schemes are active at the local level through banks and NGOs. A third example is the national government and international development aid for stimulating pilot projects for mini-grids to enhance rural electrification. Several SSA countries have the political commitments for stimulating RETs, although this tends to vary significantly between countries (see Chapter 1). For example, commitments exist for wind energy in countries such as Cape Verde, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Kenya, as well as for geothermal to cover the risks of exploration. South Africa has a well-developed renewable energy plan with associated legislation for independent public procurement (IPP) and bankable power purchase agreements (PPA). In addition, Cameroon 53 and Uganda have passed laws on the 51 Energy payback ratio is the ratio of energy produced during the normal life span of a power plant divided by the energy required to build, maintain and operate it 52 KAS, 2012. \u201cNamibia\u2019s Energy Future \u2013 A case for renewables\u201d.

        "51 promotion of RETs, as did the government of Kenya in 2008 with a Feed-in Tariff (FiT) to attract investment and development of technologies such as small-scale hydro projects. 54 Below, identified barriers with respect to political commitments are presented in more detail. Donor driven RET support schemes could eventually act as a barrier for certain technologies to penetrate the market and become sustainable. For example, the implementation of micro-digesters or new fuel wood and charcoal stoves such as BURNDESIGN heavily relies on international programme financing (e.g. by USAID in Kenya). It is difficult to make the transition from full public grant funding to a commercially viable product, while maintaining the built-up human capacity and market infrastructure. In addition, local content requirements may deter technologies that require a high technological component while there is no such human capacity amongst the local population. 55 Another potential downside of donor-driven RET support schemes is that they may cause certain remaining technologies from receiving only marginal (perhaps too little) market penetration. Out of the 3 725 MW estimated in South Africa\u2019s renewable energy independent power producer procurement (REIPPPP) programme, only 1 % will be generated from landfill gas (25MW) and biomass/biogas (both 12.5 MW). This unequal political commitment is bolstered by Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) discrimination: landfill gas producers in South Africa are paid \u20ac 0.06/kWh, whereas bioenergy generators are paid \u20ac 0.10/kWh. The risk of such forms of discrimination is naturally inherent to FiTs. Conversely, renewable production can be heavily taxed whilst \u201ctraditional\u201d energy is largely subsidised by the central government. This was identified during some of the field visits (e.g. in Botswana), but is also considered in a number of research papers. For example, in 2013 the IMF 56 estimated that energy subsidies in the SSA amounted to around 1.5% of regional GDP, with subsidies in three countries (Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) exceeding 4% of GDP. Though this can be seen as a barrier for the SSA, it is relatively low to the 8.5% spent of GDP spent on average in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. Overall, the regulatory framework is frequently identified as a barrier for RET uptake. Identified barriers are 1) the absence of clear policies on renewable energy; 2) limited available budget to create enabling environment for mobilising resources and encouraging private sector investment; and 3) the absence of long term viable implementation models that ensure delivery of renewable energy to customers at an affordable price. 57 An example for this is solar PV in rural electrification, where some market segments (e.g. small-scale PV for the rural poor) still need public subsidies to be feasible. This is especially problematic for those technologies requiring long-term political commitments, in particular ocean energy (tidal and wave), geothermal and wind energy. An additional regulatory barrier in remote areas is the limited number of electricity suppliers \u2013 and their subsequent monopolies or duopolies. This allows energy suppliers to have excessive market power, allowing them to ask for higher prices than in grid-connected areas. This negatively impacts RET roll-out when this results into disproportional price differences in relation to the higher cost base in remote areas. 54 Updated least cost power development plan, 2013, p. 91 55 ICTSD, 2013. \u201cLocal Content Requirements and the Renewable Energy Industry - A Good Match?\u201d.

        "52 A final barrier is overall security (e.g. financial, regulatory and even physical) that, if not guaranteed by governments, poses several limitations to the potential technological uptake by business and consumers. Theft remains a real issue for small-scale PV installations. It is also common in the field of MV and LV grids for the neutral conductor, which is often used to connect the electricity supply system to the earth.

        "55 2.3.4 Economic drivers and barriers A distinction can be made between upstream activities (closer to the sources of production), downstream activities (closer to final markets and consumers) and grid-related costs. Downstream activities An important driver for any technology is the sales price charged to consumers. For example, biomass from pellets and briquettes is cheap and feasible. However, the technology tends to suffer from a lack of resellers, as well as concerns over quality and quantity guarantees. Micro-digesters and geothermal energy also have a relatively accessible price. Additional drivers are the proximity of production to end users (for fuel wood and charcoal) and additional revenue potential by tapping into traditional means of transport (e.g. company fleets for Industry Digesters). In these examples, downstream market infrastructure (e.g. a distribution and retail channel) is required to further bring down costs for customers at a larger distance from the energy source. It is important to stress that in SSA the cost of construction materials strongly vary and are usually relatively higher than in Europe. For example, the price of cement and concrete affects technological design optimisation, obviously for large hydropower, but also for smaller-scale technologies like bio-digesters. Upstream activities Cost is as much a driver to one technology as a barrier to another. Increasing energy costs are an important driver for industry digesters to emerging agribusinesses in Kenya and Ghana, as they can be introduced to increase energy efficiency and reduce costs for production. Cost reductions have also caused PV panels, pico PV, and mini-grids to reach competitiveness status versus diesel fuel, fuel wood and charcoal biomass in remote mining and rural electrification markets. However, other RETs such as biodigesters, first, second and third generation biofuels are often still too expensive to compete with low fossil fuel prices. Grid-related costs Cost drivers for grid systems in SSA stem more from being the least expensive alternative rather than actually being cheap by itself. For example, single-wire earth return (SWER) lines are cheaper to upgrade to a 3-phase distribution system than it is to build a new 3-phase line from scratch. Other cost savings can be made from TWER 3-phase (TWER3P) lines if the electrification of loads is located below HV lines. Furthermore, major cost savings can be made for MV and LV grids by having to build fewer conductors and poles per kilometre \u2013 which can also be made smaller and reach more distant loads within a defined budget (for Two-wire MV). Conversely, costs of MV and LV grids may rise when in need of a 4-wire MV network, a more complicated protection plan, or the necessity of a stock of fuse to maintain the protection plan. Finally, mini-grids and off-grid systems can offer economical alternatives to remote areas for which a connection to the national grid is not feasible. We will discuss these systems in more detail in Chapter 4 (research needs) and Chapter 7 (common areas of interest).

        "59 2.4 Conclusions: Assessment of RE short term potential in selected countries In order to assess the development potential of renewable energy in SSA in the short term, a first analysis has been prepared taking into account the specific cases of 15 selected countries, based on the choice made in the inception report of this project. Country selection criteria Following the completion of the desk review and the RES penetration general overview, it seemed unnecessary to analyse the development conditions of all the 48 countries in SSA. A lot of them are not involved in RE projects, for example. For this reason, it was proposed to restrain the analysis only to the most relevant experiences. The selection of countries was based on the following items: a) Information available (IRENA, Global Status, etc.) and data collected about existing projects; b) Importance of RE resources (Ex: Hydropower in DR Congo); c) Best practices identified concerning the use of RETs for various energy needs; d) Constraints/barriers and drivers previously identified in the country, for various RET solutions; e) Ascertain the R&I capacities pre identified. As an outcome, the following 15 countries representing West, Central, East and Southern Africa were selected: \uf0b7 Burkina Faso, Sahel, solar resource, problems with biomass, political will; \uf0b7 Cameroon, equatorial, RE resources except geothermal, medium range for institutions and political will; \uf0b7 Congo DR, equatorial, large country, huge hydro potential and biomass; \uf0b7 Ethiopia, problems with biomass, important RE projects (hydro, wind, geothermal); \uf0b7 Ghana, installed hydro, institutions and political will; \uf0b7 Kenya, important resources for each RE, exemplary RE energy policy, many projects ongoing; \uf0b7 Madagascar, important resources, several/ various existing projects, some political will; \uf0b7 Mali, Sahel, solar, wind and hydro resources, problems with biomass, political will; \uf0b7 Mauritius, island, medium range for resources but political will and institutions; \uf0b7 Mozambique, important resources, existing projects, some financial support; \uf0b7 Namibia, important solar resource and several projects, political will, institutions, financial support; \uf0b7 Nigeria, important RE resources, medium range for political will and institutions; \uf0b7 Senegal, solar resource, decades of experimentation, new projects, limited political will; \uf0b7 South Africa, excellent resources, large number of projects, advanced energy policy (including FiT, IPPPP programme), demand and financial support. \uf0b7 Uganda, good resources, numerous projects, energy policy (FiT, IPPs) and financial support Several Tables and indicators have been created in order to carry out a comparative analysis of these 15 countries and to be able to determine the main RE development trends for the next 5 years. Based on the results of this Chapter 2 \u201cOverview of RES and RET penetration\u201d, a wide range of RE technologies/themes have been assessed in order to provide a detailed overview of the 6 main RE sources in SSA. The selection criteria to determine RE themes/typologies were based on more specific issues, namely: 1. SSA needs (including the Horizon 2020 priorities) and main resources of the region: considerations enabling soc io-economic development of the SSA sub- region; 2. Climate change: Both, Europe and SSA, are confronted to multiple types of constraints and challenges that can only be tackled through a wide variety of information about all the ",
        "60 possibilities regarding energy sources. Special emphasis has been made on the Renewable Energy Technologies with the potential to address climate change; 3. Environmental considerations: Emphasis on Renewable energy technologies with positive environmental impacts; 4. Renewable energy technologies which are/or have the potential to be operational in SSA as well as RET that correspond specifically to SSA resources and needs and are going to be developed within the next 5 years; 5. Contribution to scientific excellence: Emphasis on RE technologies that strengthen the scientific excellence of the EU and SSA. This includes support to the most talented/creative individuals as well as collaborative research that opens up new and promising fields of study; 6. Capacity development potential: Those renewable energy technologies leading to training and education. The results of the desk research regarding the 21 RE themes in the 15 selected countries have been compiled in country fiches (Annex 5 of the Annex Report) and are summarised in the tables below. The information collected in the following table represents the RE potential per country. The different items, except for the column \u201cCurrent Situation\u201d were ranked from 1 to 5: \uf0b7 The item Current situation of RE projects refers to the question whether there are existing projects or not, if so, which is their capacity and how many of them are they (several, numerous, a few); \uf0b7 Resources availability: It is important to mention that the production of energy depends on a variety of conditions that go beyond the resources availability. In the case of solar energy, for example, it is not enough to be in a sunny area to produce electricity out of this resource. The possibility to produce energy will also depend on other conditions such as the conversion technology. Solar photovoltaics (PV) for example, can benefit from total global irradiation. On the contrary, Concentrated Solar Power Technology (CSP) can only use direct solar irradiation. The differences are larger in the case of biomass and other components; \uf0b7 The column \u201cEnabling institutional framework\u201d refers to the synthesis of indicators identified for the chapter 4: Overview of RE policies and networks; \uf0b7 The column \u201cPolitical will\u201d determines if there is a propitious political context depending on the existence of RE targets, plans and incentives. This column was completed based on the results of chapter 4: Overview of RE policies and networks; \uf0b7 The column \u201cExisting projects\u201d was completed with the results from Table 7.2 together with the existence of Investors/Promoters; \uf0b7 The column \u201cFinancial Support\u201d refers to variables such as RE Funds, budget support, available loans, the existence of International financial institutions (IFIs) involved or interested in investing in RE project, etc. From these different criteria, an aggregate note has been given in order to assess the global potential for development within the next 5 years.

        "65 3 Economic, social and environmental impacts of RET uptake 3.1 Introduction In this chapter we present the assessment of economic, social and environmental impacts related to the uptake of renewable energy technologies in Sub Saharan Africa. The Terms of Reference (Task 3) requires \u201cthe assessment of the likely social, economic and environmental impacts of increased penetration of the different best available technologies for renewable energy exploitation, making use of scenarios. Specific attention should be paid to trade-offs that may exist between renewable energy and water availability also considering climate change impact on the water cycle. Measure need to be described on how to minimise negative social and environmental impacts, while maximising positive economic and social impacts, especially at local level\u201d. Paragraph 3.2 elaborates on the broad \u2018horizontal\u2019 or \u2018cross-RET\u2019 impacts, which can be expected in case of increased penetration of these RETs. A lot of the RE potential impacts in fact appear to relate to general characteristics of renewable energy and not specifically to individual technologies. In paragraph 3.3 the focus then shifts towards six specific RET technologies (biomass, hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, ocean energy) and the potential impacts of their substantial uptake. Attention will also be paid to the mitigation measures to minimise negative impacts and optimisation measures to maximise effects. Assumptions about the baseline scenario The SSA region is expected to face substantial socio-economic and demographic change in the decades to come, and it is important to take account of this dynamic context. With over 1 billion inhabitants in 2010, Africa\u2019s population (including Northern Africa) is projected to grow to 2-3 billions by 2050 (UN Population Division, 2008) 60 . In this context, Sub Saharan Africa population is expected to grow to about 2 billion in 2050, therefore covering a large part of the total African population. Across Africa on average 34 % of the population lives in cities, with an urbanisation rate ranging from 18 % in Ethiopia to 50 % in Nigeria to well above 70 % in some of the North African countries (UN Population Division, 2009). Available projections suggest that by 2050 the number of people living in urban settings would almost double in Sub Saharan Africa, with the rural population still growing. The trend is towards a 20 percentage point increase of the urban population by 2050, meaning more than half of the population will live in cities, and doubling the overall urban population 61 . Several scenarios have been developed to structure possible futures, and we have distinguished the normative one\u2019s from strategic management scenarios. Normative scenario\u2019s are based on visions and policy ambitions and in the context of SSA we wish to highlight: \uf0b7 Africa Energy Outlook 2040 (2010) - Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA); \uf0b7 Proposal for Africa Energy Framework (2008) - African Development Bank (AfDB); \uf0b7 REN21 (2013) \u2013 Renewables 2013 Global Status Report. 60 RENA (2011), p. 13 61 RENA (2011), p. 13 ",
        "66 However, for the creation of a baseline scenario we consider the following strategic management scenario\u2019s more useful: \uf0b7 Energy Outlook (2012/2013) - International Energy Agency (IEA); \uf0b7 Energy Access Scenarios 2030 in Africa (2011) - UN Industrial Development (UNIDO); \uf0b7 Scenarios and Strategy for Africa (2011) - International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA); The above scenario\u2019s are somewhat intertwined and provide \u2018business as usual\u2019 options based on the following assumptions. Table 3.1 Assumptions for baseline scenario\u2019s (SSA excluding SA) Main elements 2010 2030 Average rate of annual growth Population \u2013 Electricity poor (0 MW/mln) 571 (million) 638 (million) 0.5% Population \u2013 Non electricity poor (129 MW/mln) 240 (million) 615 (million) 4.8% Electricity demand 31 GW 79GW 4.8% Energy mix (IEA) Mainly coal and gas Mainly coal and gas Source: UNIDO (2012), p.9, IEA World Energy Outlook 2012, p.215 Assumptions about future penetration and energy performance The Terms of Reference refer to several scenarios to be envisaged: \uf0b7 20 percentage points increase of penetration of renewable energy by 2020; \uf0b7 Maximum penetration of each renewable energy sources based on its technical potential. Chapter 2 of this report has provided insights about the future penetration of RETs in SSA on the basis of bottom-up analysis. This future penetration needs to be compared to the above baseline situation where such RET take-up would not take place. It is assumed that the share of renewables will grow in line with the conclusions of our analysis. In order of priority: biomass, hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal and ocean energy. This implies that an increased penetration of RET can have extremely different consequences in terms of energy performance: \uf0b7 Increase in the electrification rate \u2013 especially in off-grid and low-grid/mini-grid circumstances and in rural settings; \uf0b7 Substitution of fossil fuels or reduced need for additional uptake of fossil fuels \u2013particularly in grid-connected areas, e.g. most urban areas; \uf0b7 Change in costs of energy production, either increasing or decreasing depending on the evolution of cost structures \u2013 overall the costs of RE tend to be higher than fossil fuels, however they go down and the cost gap decreases over time; \uf0b7 Energy prices charged to consumers \u2013 depending on the energy policy; \uf0b7 Reliability of energy supply (h/day) \u2013 assuming that introduction of renewable energy sources diversifies the energy mix and contributes to the reliability of supply. Impacts from RETs are likely to differ depending on the energy needs of different user groups, as distinguished in the Inception report (Annex 3 of the Annex Report), namely: \uf0b7 Households \u2013 where RET can lead to socio-economic development and poverty reduction; a distinction may need to be made between urban and rural households; \uf0b7 Public services and utilities \u2013 including hospitals, healthcare providers, schools, street lightning, public transport, urban waste collection and treatment and water network and treatment; ",

Analytical framework for the impact assessment In order to assess the potential impacts of the RET uptake, a general analytical framework has been developed. This analytical framework is based on the main principles of Regulatory Impact Assessments, as carried out by the institutions of the European Union and laid down in the Impact Assessment Guidelines of the European Commission 62 . Beside that, some additional sources have been consulted to generate ideas and improve the feasibility of the European-style impact assessment in the context of the Sub Saharan Africa. The table below presents a short summary of the main impact categories identified, and covering the most relevant areas of impacts identified. Table 3.2 General analytical framework for the impact assessment Dimension Main relevant aspects Remarks Economic - Production costs for firms - Exports and imports / FDI - Access to resources - Market access - Demand for products and services - Public budgets - Household budgets The focus of the economic dimension is on market functioning (firms, market access, demand, import/export), but also on the broader economic environment (public and household budgets). Employment effects are part of the \u2018social\u2019 dimension. Social - Employment - Health and quality of life - Education - Governance and participation [empowerment, corruption] The social dimension covers the aspects related to employment, health and education, but also less obvious aspects related to good governance and participation (e.g. participation of women). Environ- mental - Climate change - Ecosystem damage and land use - Depletion of resources (including water) - Natural hazards The main environmental aspects relate to climate change, the ecosystem (including land use), natural resources (including water) and natural hazards. 3.1.1 Horizontal analysis: the main expected impacts of increased RET-uptake Although the RET technologies differ from one another, the RET uptake as described in the scenarios, will result in a number of impacts which have a more \u2018general\u2019 character and can be assessed and described in horizontal way (cross-RET). 3.1.2 Main economic impacts of increased RET-uptake Rationale and main impacts which can be expected A large uptake of RET will result in a number of economic impacts. These impacts are mainly related to the shift or transition the market(s) will make from a situation based on fossil fuels towards a situation with more room for renewable technologies (besides the continuing use of fossil fuels). This transition will have an impact on the energy market itself, but also on markets which are dependent on or related to the energy market, like for example the industry, services, etc. The following table summarises the main general impacts, which are also described below the table. 62 European Commission, \u2018 Impact assessment Guidelines\u2019, 2009. ",
        "68 Table 3.3 Overview of the main horizontal economic impacts Aspect (economic) Key impacts (examples) Remarks Production costs for firms Impacts related to the functioning of the energy market (and the price), e.g.: - Replacement of traditional energy sources, broadening the energy mix - Creation of energy storage An important remark is that hardly any of the current RETs is cost-competitive against traditional fossil fuels. For most RETs, the situation of cost- competitiveness still takes 5-10 years. Fossil fuels are often subsidised. Exports and imports / FDI - Higher import of equipment (PV, turbines) - Higher foreign direct investments related to large scale projects (CSP, hydro, biomass) - Decrease (or lower increase) in fossil fuel imports / exports Most of the needed equipment, technical knowledge and funds will most likely not be available in SSA. RETs will, however, have a dampening effect on imports of fossil fuels. Access to resources - Shift in the use of resources (biomass, water) - Shift in the use of land and water (biomass, solar, hydro, wind, etc.) The uptake of RETs will also shift the current use of natural resources, e.g. towards the production of fuel crops instead of food. Market access - More small scale local initiatives regarding energy generation (solar, wind, biomass) - Market entry of large multinationals (CSP, hydro, large biomass) Traditionally the energy market is organised \u2018top-down\u2019 (national grid, monopolist). The uptake of RETs changes the market dynamics: more room for bottom-up, small scale and local initiatives. Demand for products and services - Chances for more local production (biomass stoves and kilns) - Creation / strengthening of the retail channel (PV-panels, stoves, etc.) - Large projects, resulting in (temporary) additional demand (CSP, hydro, large biomass) The market transition towards more use of RET will create new market dynamic (new business opportunities, changing demand, etc.). Public budgets - Higher government investments in the power grid in order to strengthen the grid (for grid-connected RETs). - Investments in large scale projects (CSP, hydro, biomass) Often the existing grid is unreliable due to lack of investments. The uptake of RET will increase the urgency for strengthening. Household budgets - Uptake of RET may result in lower household expenditures due to high current costs (depends on circumstances) - Expenditures shift from fossil fuels to RETs The impact depend to a large extent on the current circumstances of a specific household, but also on the future development of RET costs. Market transition from fossil fuels to (more) renewable energy Most of the potential economic effects of RET uptake are related to market shifts: from fossil fuel driven towards increased penetration of renewable energy. Regarding the different impacts, a number of general elements is relevant to mention here. Changing organisation of the market \u2013 First of all, it is important to recognise that the traditional energy markets are organised \u2018top-down\u2019: there is a national energy supplier (often state owned) who controls the whole energy chain from production to distribution and supply. In most cases, the energy mix is based on fossil fuels and energy prices are often regulated (or maximised) by national governments through (explicit or \u201chidden\u201d) subsidies for fossil fuel. The uptake of renewable energy technologies is therefore expected to change the existing market structure. ",
        "69 Increased penetration of grid-connected RET\u2019s (especially large projects, like hydropower, geothermal and CSP plants) is in fact expected to result in the diversification of the energy mix and the reduction of dependency on fossil fuels and (global) energy markets. Increased uptake of bottom-up initiatives, small scale and local initiatives (PV, biomass, small-scale hydropower) can therefore ingenerate new market opportunities in the current (traditional) market organisation. New market opportunities \u2013 The shift towards the use of more RET is also expected to create new business opportunities, although such potential vary largely across the range of possible technologies. Large infrastructural projects like hydro-power and CSP can in fact result in higher foreign direct investments (due to the involvement of multinationals) and market opportunities, although these will mainly be temporary (for example transportation of materials, housing of international experts, jobs during the construction, etc.). On the contrary, technologies with impacts at a smaller scale (e.g. PV-panels, small scale biomass) are expected to ingenerate structural changes in local market and therefore greater opportunities at the local levels. One can think for example of the job opportunities in the creation or strengthening of the retail channel for distribution, installation and maintenance of small-scale equipment (e.g. sales agents, mechanics, installation companies,). Also, in some cases, it might be possible to set-up local production or even assembly units, which exists for example for stoves, kilns and PV-panels. Changing use of resources \u2013 The uptake of RET will also change the current use of natural resources. A lot of different scenarios are possible in this respect, for example: (i) agricultural land which is used for the production of food may be used for the (dedicated) production of fuel crops; (ii) the realisation of a hydro power plant may change the water supply downstream and create a new ecosystem; (iii) marginal lands may be used for crop production or the location for a CSP or PV plant of wind mills; (iv) water supplies may be used for cooling purposes in a CSP plant; etc. These examples shows that the uptake of RET provides new opportunities for the use of natural resources, but simultaneously also creates specific impacts and risks for the current natural environment. Impacts on the household budgets The large uptake of RET will also have an impact on the household budgets, but the scope and the direction (positive or negative) depends on the specific household circumstances and obviously renewable technology. Two main remarks have to be made in this context. First of all, it is important to acknowledge that the use of fossil fuels is (heavily) subsidised in a lot of African countries 63 . As most of the RET are not yet cost-competitive towards fossil fuels, the impact of the RET uptake on household budgets will depend for an important extent on the (dis)continuation of those government policies. Secondly, it is important to distinguish whether households are grid-connected. Large grid- connected projects will impact the national energy market and may result in more stable or even lower energy prices. In situations where households are not connected to the grid, the impact of the RET uptake (PV-panels, small biomass stoves, etc.) will have a more local or even individual character. This impact also depends on the costs of the energy sources the households currently use (e.g. batteries, oil, fuel wood and charcoal). 3.1.3 The main social impacts of increased RET-uptake Rationale and main impacts which can be expected An increased uptake RET will result in a number of generic social impacts, irrespective of the RET. Improved access to cleaner gas (or electricity) sources for example can result in better local sources for cooking and heating (normally fire-wood, kerosene or diesel), resulting in less polluting 63 JRC, \u2018Renewable energies in Africa\u2019, 2011, p. 45. ",
        "70 environments (e.g. cleaner air and potentially less toxic wastes being produced), and therefore more healthy households. Improved gas or electricity use may also result in important time savings. Fuel collection (for cooking) typically affects women most, as long trips to collect fuel sources become redundant (estimated to be about 5 hours per day). It also implies saving in expenditure for energy, as traditional sources are becoming more expensive (resulting in opportunity for greater quality of life), and can contribute to an increased comfort and basic sanitation (e.g. biogas can be a reliable source for cooking, boiling water, etc.). In the table below we present an overview of the main generic impacts which can be expected. Each aspect briefly described in the table is elaborated in the rest of this section. Table 3.4 Overview of the main horizontal social impacts Aspect (social) Key impacts (examples) Remarks Employment - Creation of temporary (construction) and structural employment (operation and maintenance). - Replacement of traditional energy sources, resulting in job losses. A structural change in the energy generation also implies a conversion of the market which may have a negative impact on the traditional energy sources. Health and quality of life - Lower toxic emissions, resulting in a lower rate of respiratory diseases. - Lower energy prices, resulting in affordable refrigeration and cooking. - Time gains, resulting in more time for homecare. The \u2018healthy\u2019 characteristics of RET may result in health improvements. Lower energy prices and improved energy access may also realised via \u2018fossil\u2019 energy. Education - Time gains (less time spent on collection of traditional fuels, increased hours of lighting), resulting in more time for learning - Increase in energy supply, resulting in better access to learning technology These effects relate to better access to energy, which may also realised via \u2018fossil\u2019 energy. Governance and participation [empowerment] - Increase in energy supply, resulting in better access to information technology (radio internet, etc.), resulting in increased participation and choice. - Local energy supply, resulting in a supply controlled and distributed by local community, resulting in increased independence/self-reliance. - Time gains, resulting in the empowerment of women. Again, these impacts may also be realised via \u2018fossil\u2019 energy. The \u2018local\u2019 character of some renewable energy technologies may be an advantage in terms of empowerment. Main impacts on employment Multiple studies 64 suggest that RETs also have (sometimes potential) direct employment effects (i.e. throughout the fuel cycle, manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance). Available statistics and studies in SSA and South Africa suggest that \u201ccoal-based generation provides 330 jobs/TWh, gas 130 jobs/TWh\u201d (p.vi) 65 , while other surveys claim 700 jobs/TWh for coal 66 . RET- related jobs are instead reported as higher, largely due to greater efficiency of mass-production of gas and energy in \u201ctraditional sources\u201d, whilst renewable energy are also associated with micro-to- small local installations, which increase the ratio of jobs created if weighted to the produced energy. This is illustrated in the next table. 64 See for example Akella, A., Saini, R., and Sharma, M. (2009): Social, economic and environmental impacts of renewable energy systems, Renewable Energy, 34, p. 390-396. And Casillas, C. And Kammen, D.

In brief, the decentralised structure of energy/gas generation through RETs has as an effect on the creation of distributed jobs at the local level across the SSA territories. Literature 67 suggests a range of employment of 10 400 Jobs/TWh for Solar thermal, 62 000 for solar PV, 12 600 for wind, 5 600 for biomasses, 23 000 for landfill. Other sources seem to confirm such magnitude, by further expanding the job created per TWh by biomasses to about 7 000 (biodiesel 1 600 jobs/TWh, bioethanol 3 770, biogas 1 340) 68 . The World Bank estimates that \u201cthe charcoal industry in Sub-Saharan Africa was worth more than US$ 8 bn in 2007, with more than seven million people dependent on the sector for their livelihoods. In line with consumption predictions of the IEA, the economic value of the charcoal industry in SSA may exceed US$12 bn by 2030, employing almost 12 million people\u201d (WB 2011, p. ix) 69 . On top of this figure, additional values for other sources such as coal, diesel, etc. should be added. These figures result in a rough estimate of between 6,5 and 11 jobs per each kWh produced by firewood (by assuming 600 million m3 of wood collected per year 70 , an average ratio of 1 700 kwh/m3 71 , and the above projections of jobs created in 2011 and 2030 72 ). Some studies provide additional reference for total employment for traditional energy sources 73 , although no indirect employment estimates seem to be publicly available. Although employment effects are not easy to estimate, when it comes to indirect employment some reference from EU studies 74 can be adopted. In Germany, for example, some rigorous estimation has been provided 75 , resulting in a total gross RET-related employment amount of 380 000 in 2011, of which 70 000 jobs directly created by net effect. The estimate translates into a ratio of 5.4 additional indirect jobs created for each directly employed, therefore suggesting a possibly extremely optimistic ratio of indirect jobs across RETs. 67 http://www.greentalent.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Agama-Report_-EPRESA-Final-Nov-2003.pdf 68 Earthlife Africa/SECCP report 2003 69 http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRREGTOPENERGY/Resources/717305- 1266613906108/BiomassEnergyPaper_WEB_Zoomed75.pdf 70 Biomass RET Report, p. 9 71 http://www.biomasstradecentre2.eu/data/upload/D5_5_Manual_firewood_production_biohousing.pdf 72 http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRREGTOPENERGY/Resources/717305- 1266613906108/BiomassEnergyPaper_WEB_Zoomed75.pdf 73 http://cfsites1.uts.edu.au/find/isf/publications/rutovitzharris2012globalenergyjobsmethycalc.pdf 74 http://iea-retd.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IEA-RETD-Policy-Brief-on-Renewables-and-Employment.pdf 75 http://www.bmub.bund.de/fileadmin/bmu-import/files/english/pdf/application/pdf/ee_beschaeftigung_2010_en_bf.pdf ",
        "72 Such figures should be compared to gross employment generated by \u201ctraditional sources\u201d in Sub Saharan Africa. Some potentially negative impacts on employment are also emerging through the reviewed literature. In fact, although job potentials are high for RETs, it should not be underestimated the fact that some \u201ctraditional\u201d sources of energy (e.g. wood-fire and charcoal) are currently providing basic income to a large amount of people (i.e. 7 to 12 million estimates between now and 2030), especially in rural areas. This job-base may be lost, if not accurately addressed when deploying alternative (or integrated) renewable technologies. This can be an issue for the poorest, receiving some basic income from employment generated by such traditional energy sources. Main impacts on health and quality of life The health benefits of increased energy access in general are numerous. There is not always a distinct advantage of RETs over fossil fuels, but in general it applies that the reduced environmental effects also contribute to the health outcomes of populations, urban and rural. Increased electrification helps to meet a variety of unmet needs that contribute to healthier living. Primarily, there is high potential for substituting \u2018traditional\u2019 biomass, such as fuel wood, which are reportedly \u201ccharacterised by a very low efficiency and high emission rates of toxic / harmful exhaust gasses\u201d 76 . Pollution is not just an issue on the macro-level in terms of climate change, but also on the micro- level within households. Low quality stoves and heating utilities (e.g. open fires and oil stoves) and kerosene lighting, causes an increased rate of respiratory diseases, cancers, eye infections and other illnesses related to pollution, especially in rural areas. In addition to mitigating these effects, RETs also lessen the burden of physical labour by decreasing the need to collect fuel materials such as wood. Besides obvious time gains, several physical effects related to the collection of traditional biofuels can be reduced: \u201cbruising, headache, neck ache, back ache, knee problems and encounters with wild animals and snakes\u201d 77 . These effects predominantly affect women and children, who are traditionally the gatherers of biofuel. Reliable gas or electric stoves also decrease the risk of fire, and the associated risk of early death. Important in this respect is that collection of firewood and cooking techniques are strongly embedded in habits and culture. Harmful cooking techniques and time expenditures are not necessarily perceived as negative, because several non-functional (and similarly or even more important) factors play a role. I.e., cooking on \u2018three-stone cooking fires\u2019 is different in terms of for example temperature control and firewood collection is an important activity for social interaction. This is relevant, because this means that electrification will not automatically lead to the displacement of traditional energy use. Other potential impacts on health and quality of life relate to the safe storage of nutrients (as refrigeration is enabled by electricity), better waste management , access to clean water sources and sanitation , which all contribute greatly to improved health outcomes 78 . Additionally, it may improve the access to healthcare facilities 79 . 76 SNV (2007); Biogas for better life - Domestic biogas in Africa; a first assessment of the potential and need, (p. 7) 77 Parikh, J.

        "73 Main impacts on education The most immediate effect of increased energy access on education is the availability of light sources that extend the time capacity and the mentioned time savings related to a reduced need of biofuel collection. The saved time could be allocated to learning 80 . In a survey, a third of women reported that they spend some of their gained time on social and community work, including education 81 . A study in Vietnam showed a strong correlation between electrification and school attendance of children 82 . Other educational impacts of energy access are indirect effects that also depend on other outside factors. It is important to mention that increased electrification alone is conditional, but not sufficient to an increased access to technology-based learning. Electrification enables the use of computers in schooling, although computers still need to be affordable. Main impacts on governance and participation (empowerment) A number of main general impacts exist in relation to governance and participation. One of the main social impacts of renewable energy is that of assuring greater energy security (access and affordability) , particularly in rural areas and in those large portions of the population disconnected for energy grid (70 to 90% 83 of the entire population, varying by study 84 ). Some behavioural change have been identified both for individual and societal relations, notably \u201cby providing business models and incentives to encourage citizens to implement RETs in their houses\u201d 85 . One hypothesis is that locally developed RETs projects may gain greater community control and empower the local population over the supply and demand chain of energy. This may result in a lower chance of corruption patterns and improved project sustainability. Nevertheless, corruption remains a main issue for any large-scale operation in Africa, RETs included, due to a mix of a large informal market and limited public sector transparency and capability. This can be the case for dissemination of RETs with local application (e.g. biomasses digesters), or large scale projects (e.g. solar, wind or landfill management), where it may be difficult to exercise full control. Self-reliance for local community is another area of potential improvement, with \u201cthe most striking feature of the region\u2019s recent resource boom is how little of the material extracted from the continent has been used locally\u201d 86 . And yet, RETs may not necessarily be a panacea for self- subsistence, due to possible challenges in having local installed RETs fully maintained and operational through time. A mix of poor technical expertise and limited knowledge proper use of such installations may result in less then half installed RETs being operational (e.g. 60% bio- digesters being operational through time as emerged by interviews held in the field in Kenya). 80 ONE (2013): Electrify Africa \u2013 Provising Energy Access in sub-Saharan Africa, an opportunity to alleviate poverty and spur growth: http://one-org.s3.amazonaws.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Energy-Poverty-Policy-Final.pdf 81 Katuwal, H., & Bohara, A.

(2009). Welfare Impacts of Rural Electrification. Evidence from Vietnam. World Bank, Development Research Group. Washington, D.C.: World Bank. 83 Some sources state that \u201c71 per cent of Sub-Saharan African households lack access to electricity (Energy Information Administration, 2010). In rural areas this figure rises to over 90 per cent (Kammen and Kirubi, 2008).\u201d http://poldev.revues.org/744?lang=fr#tocto2n3 84 About 81% of households burn solid fuels, far more than any other region in the world, with about 70% depending on wood- based biomass as their primary cooking fuel (Figure 1). Nearly 60% of urban dwellers also use biomass for cooking (IEA, 2010). 85 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212609013000241 http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/58912/scaling-up-renewable-energy-in-africa-south-africa http://technicalworkinggroup.org/etwg/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/E+TWG-Public-Private-in-SSA.pdf 86 http://poldev.revues.org/744?lang=fr#tocto2n3 ",
        "74 Impact of RETs may also refer to available time for more productive activities or greater social care. Traditional biomasses, such as firewood, in fact require collection activities occupying much time of the day (up to five hours, as reported in the Biomass RET Report, p. 9 87 ) particularly for women and children. For example, some studies on children\u2019s time allocation on natural resource collection in Malawi find that \u201cbeing female is the most significant determinant of a child participating in natural resource collection\u201d (p. 19) 88 , and as such are reported as component of gender inequality . But even time spent by men may be conveyed to more productive activities. Access to the Internet and other information resources can trigger local empowerment, access to information and greater choice by consumers, but it still remains very low across SSA countries, with some peak of 40% in Cape Verde and Seychelles, but the average reaching up to 10-15% of the population based on most recent reliable data (ITU, 2013, p. 6) 89 . And yet, most recent years showed a rapid growth, due to the boom in smart phones and mobile Internet, with an \u201caverage growth in the number of Internet users in sub-Saharan Africa over that period was about 35 per cent, which is relatively satisfactory. However, it conceals significant disparities between countries\u201d (ITU, 2013, p 6). 3.1.4 Main environmental impacts of increased RET-uptake Rationale and main impacts which can be expected An increase in the use of RET is often associated with positive environmental impacts, ranging from a reduction in CO2 emission to the improved biodiversity in forested areas. However, we should guard against unduly optimistic assumptions, as the expected increase in energy demand in SSA cannot be met by an increased use of RET alone. It is reasonable to expect that a large share of the new production capacity will still come from non-renewable sources. In spite of this important caveat, we have identified a number of \u201cgeneric\u201d environmental impacts resulting from an increase in RE penetration of RETs in SSA. An overview of such impacts is provided in the table hereby. Table 3.6 Overview of impact areas, indicators, current and potential estimates Aspect (environmental) Key impacts (examples) Remarks Greenhouse Gas Emission Climate change Sourcing for biomass at a large scale can induce changes in GHG emissions Ecosystem damage and land use change Loss of biodiversity Resettlement and displacement of economic activities Growing fuel crops can have negative impacts on the biodiversity of the land. Often, the change in land use can disrupt the food production of local populations and the displacement of associated economic activities Depletion of resources Loss of (clean) soil and water resources Fuel crops require significant amounts of water and can potentially lead to the erosion of top soils. 87 Recent surveys for SSA countries showed that women and men, engaged in firewood collection, spent an average of 1hour and 30 minutes per day (maximum in Niger 4h/day and Ethiopia 3h/day). Distances travelled to collect firewood depend on resource availability, population density and urbanization rates; for example in Tanzania, distances can vary from 1 to 10 km. The quantity of wood collected is around 20 kg for women and 30 kg for men. 88 http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRREGTOPGENDER/Resources/gender_time_use_pov.pdf 89 http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regulatory-Market/Documents/IIC_Africa_Final-en.pdf ",
        "75 Since second-generation biofuels can be produced from the whole plant or agricultural and forestry residues, they can help considerably reduce overall life cycle emissions and especially emissions related to feedstock production (per unit of produced fuel). A study by IEA compared the emissions of fossil fuels with those of (second generation) biofuels for which the results are graphically presented below. Table 3.7 Comparison of emission changes of different biofuels compared to fossil fuel Source: IEA, 2008c based on IEA and UNEP analysis of 60 published life-cycle analysis studies giving either ranges (shown by the bars) or specific data (shown by the dots). The figure shows a large range for each of the different biofuel options and in some cases first- generation biofuels (mainly bioethanol from sugar cane) have even higher emissions compared to fossil fuels. Second-generation biofuels have the potential to significantly mitigate GHG, but these results have been calculated for theoretical biofuel production concepts that are only just at the pilot/demonstration stage and not yet operating on a commercial scale (OECD, 2008d). The impact of dedicated energy crops on biodiversity can be both positive and negative. The replacement of native forests with mono-cropping plantations, for instance, reduces plant biodiversity and may cause habitat loss for wildlife, but energy crop plantations can also increase biodiversity if former agricultural land is reforested and the replacement improves forest structure (IEA, 2010). The use of agricultural or forestry residues for second-generation biofuel production is expected to have a lower impact on biodiversity although increased competition for secondary residues could lead to exploitation of other biomass resources and would thus have an indirect negative impact on biodiversity. The replacement of cropland for biofuel feedstock production can have important impacts on direct and indirect land use , depending on the feedstock. If available residues are used, second- generation biofuels could help to decrease potential land use competition and reduce the effects of land use change. Box 1: Large-scale jatropha production Large-scale Jatropha production schemes involve the extensive cultivation of jatropha along large tracks of land. This usually entails large-scale land use changes, sometimes involving the conversion of idle agricultural land, or even land under other agricultural uses. Outgrower schemes can also be linked to such large-scale jatropha projects. Switching from food to jatropha production can pose a threat to local food production, and as such threaten food security at the household and the local level.

        "76 Biofuel production can have significant impact on water quality and availability . These impacts may be caused by freshwater consumption for feedstock cultivation, the use of agro-chemicals in intensive production systems, the use of fertilisers (which pose a risk for eutrophication and acidification), and the consumption of water for processing and evaporative cooling in biofuel production. For second-generation biofuel production, the water footprint (i.e. litre water/litre biofuel) is deemed to be considerably lower than that of many current-generation biofuels. 3.2 RET-specific impacts of increased RET uptake 3.2.1 Biomass For Sub-Saharan Africa, biomass, and especially forestry biomass, is the most important source of energy and it is expected that it will remain so for a majority of Sub-Saharan Africa countries over the next decades. Over the last decades the share of biomass and biofuels in the total primary energy consumption (Mtoe) in Africa has decreased from 75 % in 1971 to 48 % in 2009 90 , although there are important regional differences within Africa. Particularly in those countries characterised by high poverty rates, the proportion of biomass is much higher. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects a decline in the total energy share of biomass and wastes by 2030, but expects biomass to remain an important energy resource for Africa in the future 91 . The main developments to be expected, across the various types of RE technologies based on biomass, are the following: 1. Improvement of cooking stoves; 2. Increased use of wood residues and other biomass resources, mostly at industrial scale (biomass power-plants, gasification, co-generation, waste incineration); 3. Introduction of bio-refineries based on liquid biofuels; 4. Uptake of biogas production using waste management technologies (micro digesters, industrial digesters, bio landfills). Identification of impacts The majority of biomass (either as fuel wood or coal) in SSA is used for cooking purposes serving poor rural and urban households. Improvements in the technologies involved will therefore benefit this sizeable group across SSA. Benefits will be mainly social (reduction of harmful air pollutants and contaminants) and environmental (reduced CO2 emissions). The more technologically advanced energy sources, such as co-generation, waste incineration and bio landfills, can be found in urban areas or linked to agro-industrial activities. Like their smaller counterparts, they will also have a positive impact on CO2 emission and in addition, they can have a positive impact on reduced energy imports. 90 RAL, 2013.

Field experiments have shown that savings up to 30 % can easily be obtained although their adoption rates vary across SSA (BTG, 2010 p44). One of the more important outcomes of this development is the opportunity this has given to local manufacturers and service providers. ",
        "78 It has been established that job creation through the introduction of charcoal stoves can be an important source of income for some African countries. Employment opportunities exist in the manufacturing, distribution, retailing and possibly the maintenance of stoves. Depending on the stove design, artisans in clay or ceramic work and metal cladding will be needed. It is estimated that about 830 million people worldwide \u2013 some 166 million households 92 \u2013 currently use improved cook stoves (ICS) 93 . The majority (116 million stoves) are in China, which has established a successful programme to reduce indoor air pollution in rural areas by almost completely replacing traditional biomass-fired stoves with ICS and biogas-burning stoves. It is estimated that there are some 7 million in sub-Saharan Africa. There appear to be no broad-based figures indicating employment in ICS production. Some ICS production takes place on a large scale, with centralised production and widespread distribution channels (some firms mass-produce more than 100 000 stoves annually), whereas in other cases small-scale, local production is often undertaken by trained artisans in rural areas in informal settings. This last option is typically more labour intensive than producing traditional stoves, with employment opportunities arising in the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of the stoves. There is also a growing trend towards semi-industrial production of improved biomass stoves, using imported components which are assembled locally. Although traditional cooking methods remain widespread, ICS has experienced commercial success, particularly in Kenya 94 . The Kenya Ceramic Jiko charcoal stove is used in more than 50% of urban homes and 16 % of rural homes in the country, and the stove has been disseminated to more than 3 million households 95 . The majority of the stoves are produced at a small to medium scale, and production has been sustained commercially, with individual producers building a few hundred per month 96 . In 2012, an estimated 15 major producers operated in Kenya, along with more than 100 independent trained artisans 97 . This production activity is expected to contribute to employment in Kenya\u2019s informal economy, which creates more than 90% of all jobs 98 . Such opportunities will continue to rise as the manufacturing of cook stoves expands and their availability improves in many countries. Backward and forward linkages \u2013 the extent to which enterprises are integrated into a local supply chain and to which downstream businesses are made possible by the provision of energy services \u2013 are important determinants of employment creation. In many cases, activities such as sales, installation, operation and maintenance are more important in terms of employment generation or livelihood support than manufacturing of renewable energy equipment. In the case of improved cooking stoves, the supply chain goes from stove design, through raw materials (metal, clay), stove production, distribution and sales, to home and restaurants use. 92 Based on an estimate of five persons per household. 93 REN21 (Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century) (2011), Renewables 2011 Global Status Report, REN21 Secretariat, Paris 94 GVEP (Global Village Energy Partnership) (2012a), \u201cKenya Market Assessment: Sector Mapping\u201d, www.cleancookstoves. org/resources_files/kenya-market-assessment-mapping.pdf 95 UNDP (2012), \u201cIntegrating Energy Access and Employment Creation to Accelerate Progress on the Millennium Development Goals in Sub-Saharan Africa\u201d.

        "79 For ICS, supply chains are typically more domestic in nature, especially for clay stoves, although large exporting producers are emerging in India, China and Kenya. Imports do play a role for metal stove producers, which often rely on scrap-metal. This is the case for the FAFASO project in Burkina Faso, for instance, where recent price increases in the international scrap metal market have negatively affected producers 99 . BOX 2: Improved cooking stoves in Burkina Faso In Burkina Faso, the FAFASO project, sponsored by the Dutch-German Energy Partnership Energizing Development (GIZ-EnDEV), is working to disseminate improved cooking stoves, mainly in the major towns of Ouagadougou and Bobo. Between 2006 and 2011, some 180 000 improved stoves were sold to households, institutions and productive units. Some 285 metal smiths, 264 masons and 180 potters have been involved in the project. Many of the metal smiths and masons employ apprentices only when needed and create temporary additional employment. Among the makers of clay stoves, most of the potters are women, whose main work remains in the field and in the household. Social structures and traditions also have an impact on employment: in Burkina Faso, pottery is caste-bound work dominated by families that only hire from within and are unlikely to employ external apprentices. Although the importance of the (local) production of ICS is generally acknowledged, the impact of RET technology goes beyond using biomass for cooking purposes. A recent publication by GIZ sums up the opportunities for businesses (both African and European), to get involved in the market of biomass in Ghana. According to GIZ, biomass \u201cis a market with many supply opportunities for plant manufacturers or installers as well as providers for plant equipment\u201d 100 and these are: \uf0b7 Technologies, motors and components of biogas plants from organic waste and wastewater; \uf0b7 Technologies, motors and components for CHPs and exhaust gas systems; \uf0b7 Technology and components for refrigeration from exhaust heat or steam generation. The relevance of biomass technology is confirmed by UNIDO\u2019s statement that, \u201cimproved biomass energy technologies (IBTs) provide an attractive option for small and medium enterprises. IBTs have delivered significant benefits to both the urban and rural poor in Africa. Urban improved stove initiatives deliver several benefits to both the urban and rural poor. First, in terms of jobs created in improved stoves programs and second, in terms of reduced charcoal consumption through the use of improved charcoal stoves\u201d 101 . Key impact 2: Impact on health and quality of life One of the more important effects of using improved cooking stoves are the reduced levels of indoor air pollution. A WHO meta-analysis of 25 studies concluded that cooking with traditional biomass using traditional stoves increases the risk of pneumonia by 80%, compared to clean fuels and improved stoves 102 . Globally, indoor air pollution is responsible for the deaths of 1.5 million people each year, with the majority affected in Africa and Asia 103 . it is important to note that children at a young age are reported 104 to be particularly under threat of indoor pollution. 99 Renewable Energy and Jobs.

        "80 The production of charcoal production causes gaseous emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, ethane and volatile organic compounds (VOC). These emissions are usually released as part of the smoke into the atmosphere, posing an air-pollution problem. The level of emission depends highly on the technology used for the production, the temperature developed during the pyrolysis as well as on the moisture content of the wood. Domac and Trossero (2008) observed that emission levels, especially that of methane, can have a significant environmental impact on both regional and global level. When inhaled the smoke can result in serious health issues of the charcoal producers. The use of cleaner, more efficient technologies in charcoal production can have important health benefits 105 . Key impact 3: Ecosystem damage, land and water use It is widely recognised that the use of biomass to produce energy (biofuels) presents challenges for the environment and especially negative effect in terms of land degradation, impact of monoculture plantations, clearance of forest and use of new or degraded land for biofuels production 106 . Furthermore, the increased production of agricultural feedstocks has raised concerns related to the competition for water resources in water scarce regions 107 . Crops currently grown as feedstock for biofuel production need high quality agricultural land and often demand major inputs in terms of fertilisers, pesticides and water to generate good yields. Like all agricultural cops, any adverse impact of bioenergy crops on soils depends on the farming techniques that are used. Intensive production of energy crop, such as short-rotation coppice, energy grass and intensive production of feedstock requires use of agrochemical inputs on a regular basis to reach the expected yields 108 . As a result, inappropriate cultivation practices can reduce soil organic matter and increase soil erosion by removing permanent soil cover, resulting in loss of soil biodiversity and soil health 109 . Second-generation biofuels make use of residues which do not directly require additional land. However, it is uncertain what fraction of residues can be sustainably removed from forests and fields without consequences for erosion, loss of soil biodiversity and reduced soil fertility. Biofuel plantations are often grown under monoculture cropping systems. This may over time lead to pest and pathogen build-up, as well as declining soil fertility, loss of biodiversity and ultimately, land and natural resource degradation 110 . Rotating and diversifying energy crops is seen as a solution here, as it would give soils time to recover. The relationship between biofuel production and deforestation is complex and difficult to quantify: no global deforestation data and global biofuel feedstock plantation data are available, although estimates can be made for particular areas, based on case studies. (AETSm 2012) metions three of these projects: \uf0b7 Biodiesel from oil palm may have been responsible for up to 2.8% and 6.5% of direct deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia; 105 FAO (2010), Criteria and indicators for sustainable woodfuels. FAO Forestry Paper 160. Rome, Italy 106 The impacts mentioned here represent a selection of the environmental impacts which should reviewed according to the impact assessment guidelines used by the European Commission (EC) to prepare policy proposals. Items to be included in the analysed are biodiversity, flora, fauna and landscapes; water quality and resources; soil quality and resources and land use. 107 OECD- FAO, 2011.

        "81 \uf0b7 Biodiesel from soybean in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso may have been responsible for up to 5.9% of the direct annual deforestation over the last few year; \uf0b7 The direct deforestation resulting from sugar-based ethanol in Brazil and Colombia appears to be negligible. Using so-called \u201cmarginal\u201d lands to grow biofuels is often seen as a viable option, since the land is seen as non-productive. However, apart from the fact that yields and quality will be low they may still supply, in particular for poorer households, food, feed, medical plants, building material, or fuel to local people, not to mention sociocultural dimensions. Furthermore, some of these areas may harbour high levels of biodiversity and constitutes biological corridors. Hence, producing bioenergy on marginal and degraded lands is not always the most sustainable solution 111 . Biofuels accounted for about 1% of all water transpired by crops worldwide, and about 2% of all irrigation water withdrawals 112 . Many of the crops currently used for biofuel production \u2013 such as sugarcane, oil palm and maize \u2013 have relatively high water requirements and, therefore, are mainly cultivated in high-rainfall areas rely on irrigation. The amount of water needed to produce a unit of energy from lignocellulosic biofuel feedstocks is three to seven times lower than the water required producing ethanol from maize, rapeseed, etc. Second generation feedstocks, such as woody biomass, can capture a greater share of annual rainfall, compared to annually sown crops, in areas where much of the rainfall occurs outside the normal crop growing season, and also help reduce soil erosion and bring flood control benefits. While second generation feedstocks offer the potential for reducing irrigation water demand, it is not necessarily a clear outcome, as this may depend on the feedstocks grown, location of production and the reference first generation feedstocks 113 . Mitigation and optimisation potential Increase demand for products and services The (local) production of improved cooking stoves and kilns is seen as benefiting local communities, and the optimisation potential should therefore be sought in providing the best possible environment in which the local entrepreneurs can expand their businesses. This means the availability of finance, the ability to improve skills and the facility to market their products against viable prices. All of these are difficult areas in many SSA countries, and donors and governments have an important role to play in this context. Impact on health and quality of life The introduction of improved cooking stoves (especially combined with an improved fuel source) can lead to significant improvements of in-door air quality. Using batch kilns and continuous operated multiple hearth retorts for the production of charcoal will lead to considerably lower emissions. These technologies allow the collection of the gaseous and liquid smoke, which can be used to increase the efficiency of charcoal production. These technologies, however, have high initial investment costs and require governmental support and possible subsidies for a fully uptake by local end-users. 111 UNDP, 2009.

        "82 Ecosystem damage and land and water use Although the area grown for biofuels tends to grow faster than that of food-crops, there is no inherent difference between the two in terms of their need or resources. Better crop management (cultivation practices) is therefore needed to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of growing biofuels. There is also a need or better understanding of the nexus between the use of water and energy, as it appears that decisions-makers are not always conscious of the close links between energy and water implications when launching major projects, including the production of biofuels 114 . Changes in land use that have a negative effect on human well-being can also be mitigated through careful planning. This is the case for example of impacts on food production, where negative externalities can be mitigated or even prevented through cautious planning, as observed in some available good practices 115 . 3.2.2 Hydropower Within the interconnected grid, the cost competitiveness and maturity level of hydropower has made this technology a leading RET in SSA, with a current capacity of 24 000 MW. In many countries the potential sites for large hydropower plants have been tapped, but there is still a very significant potential, especially at the small/mini/micro scales. When assessing the possible hydropower capacity by 2040, the total capacity is estimated to be nearly 60 000 MW. Identification of impacts The impact matrix below reflects the main categories of technology-specific impacts as a result of developing hydropower. We have included all types of hydropower (from pico to large scale) in one causal chain, to show the range of possible impacts hydropower can have.

Obviously, several of these impacts are only relevant for a certain hydropower design, e.g. one including a storage reservoir. Furthermore, impacts related to preventing damage (flood risk management) or \u2018causing damage\u2019 to assets (land use) are directly related to the specific context. This context can of course strongly vary, which stresses the importance of tailoring the hydropower design and individual impact assessment to a specific context. We have selected three most significant impacts, which are discussed in more detail below. Assessment of the main substantive impacts Key impact 1: Changes in the local content of energy supply The local content is the amount of inputs in the entire lifecycle of the costs, which can be acquired locally and can be presented in terms of a distribution. A high local content means that a high share of the value chain is located locally, stimulating local economic development. The costs of hydropower can be broadly grouped into two major components: 1) civil works for construction of the plant, construction of different types of infrastructure (grid, roads, etc.), project development costs and operation and maintenance; and 2) costs for electro-mechanical equipment. Civil works have a high local content and electro-mechanical a low local content. ",
        "84 This difference in local content has consequences for the local content across different types of hydropower. Usually, developing large-scale hydro requires a higher share of civil works, leading to more employment. This would suggest that large-scale hydro has better employment impacts on the local economy than small-scale hydro. On the other hand, the majority of this employment is temporarily and required in a huge quantity, stimulating temporary import of workers. Furthermore, other impacts of large versus small-scale hydro should be taken into account, for example displacement of economic activities and use of (productive) land. Because of the significant differences for small and large-scale hydro, the two figures below provide a separate breakdown of costs. Table 3.10 Cost breakdown of African small hydropower projects Source: IRENA (2012), Renewable energy technologies, costs analysis series http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf The figure above shows that in small hydropower civil works and logistics, which are more likely to have a local content, make up approximately 30 to 70% of the total costs. The variation in the percentage of civil works depends on whether a new or existing site is being developed and the hydraulic head of the design 116 . Zhang et al. (2012) provide a benchmark on breakdown of costs of approximately of 50 to 60% civil works (see figure below). 116 Zhang, Q.F., B. Smith and W. Zhang (2012) Small hydropower cost reference model http://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/files/pub39663.pdf ",
        "85 Table 3.11 Capital cost breakdown of high and low head small scale hydropower, new sites Source: Zhang, Q.F., B. Smith and W. Zhang (2012) Small hydropower cost reference model, based on data from IDEA (1996), \u201cManuales de Energias Renovables: n\u00b01 Minicentrales hydroelectricas.\u201d Altener Program, Madrid. For large hydropower, cost breakdowns of large projects specifically in SSA are not publically available. Nonetheless, a generic estimate can be made on the local content of large hydropower. Black and Veatch (also see figure below) estimate a civil works share of 60 to 70%, which can be used as an indicator for the local content. Table 3.12 Cost breakdown of a standard greenfield large hydropower projects Source: Black and Veatch (2012), Cost and Performance Data for Power Generation Technologies , Black and Veatch Corporation, Kansas. An additional quantitative indication, providing figures of jobs per MW, is provided in the text box below, which discusses the employment effects of a 13MW hydropower plant in Uganda. Box 3 Project Bugoye Hydro Power Project (BHPP) in Uganda BHPP is a 13 MW run-of-river hydro plant, located in Kasese District, western Uganda. Direct and indirect employment have been researched, resulting in the following table. The amount of person years versus ",
        "86 jobs indicates that the majority of the (direct) jobs is temporary and related to construction. In conclusion, hydropower has a high local content, indicating a moderate capital leakage and significant positive local employment impacts. Both small and large hydro can reach a local content of up to 70%. However, the local content of small hydro is more variable and generally lower. Key impact 2: Land use The amount of land use can be used as an indicator for the majority of the mostly negative impacts of hydropower. For run-of-river hydro, the land use is negligible and large-scale hydro of course has extensive land use in absolute terms. Extensive research has been done on the impacts of hydropower in relation to land use. The IEA did a worldwide review in 2010 117 and provides a land use benchmark of 0.2 to 15.2 (avg 6) ha/GWh/year. The more recent and African GIBE III project (see text box below) has lower than the average land use, with 3.22 ha/GWh/year. Due to favourable local climatic and logistical conditions, the productivity of flooded land is usually relatively high, amplifying negative impacts hydropower land use. For this, the resource prices can be used as an indicator. They reflect the value of required and/or newly provided resources, which includes land and freshwater. These values can be used to indicate whether the volumetric effects (land use, freshwater availability) are significant in a specific context. They are of course highly context-specific.

Statistics based on nearly 200 observations provided in the table above give additional insight, showing a clear relation between the size and capacity of hydropower plants. This relation would favour large over small hydro. However, the flexibility to take mitigation measures is more limited for large-scale hydro. The most reliable conclusion is that the negative impacts of run-of-river hydro are very limited. With respect to other hydropower, the wide range of land use / GWh / year and the two counteracting mechanisms of size of hydropower plants and resulting impacts emphasize that hydropower impacts are case-specific. Nonetheless, these key ratios can be used to compare the impacts with other renewable energy technologies. 117 IEA (2012), Hydropower and the environment, present context and guidelines for future action, http://www.ieahydro.org/reports/HyA3S5V2.pdf ",
        "87 Box 4 Project large-scale hydro, GIBE III GIBE III is a large hydropower in Ethiopia, with the following main characteristics: the surface area = 20 599 ha, the volume = 15,245 m3, the water resident time = 6 months, energy produced annually: 6 400 GWh and Flooded area per unit of energy produced annually = 3.22 ha. The estimated GHG emissions are 13.6 t/GWh. The primary benefit of the dam is electricity generation, supplemented by flood protection, seasonal balancing of freshwater supply and fish productivity. The damages resulting from the 2006 floods (return time unknown) provide an indication of the flood protection benefits. Over 350 people were killed, 15,000 people displaced and damages were over at least US$ 17 m. Fish productivity is estimated to provide job opportunities for up to 400 fishers (0.02 fishers / ha), although this figure doesn\u2019t include impacts on migratory river fish species. Key impact 3: Freshwater use A storage reservoir leads to an increase in water use due to an increased surface and stagnant water, which increases evaporation. Only since a study from the IPCC in 2012, significant research was conducted on the actual water consumption of hydropower 118 . The published estimates and methods for quantifying the water footprint have been assessed. The primary conclusion is that no agreed upon method is available. The biggest issue is that the majority of the methods overestimate water use by using a simplistic gross evaporation approach. Consequently, only assessing a benchmark providing the (wide) possible range of water footprint seems appropriate.

It clearly shows the extreme variability in relative water consumption, from < 50 to 6 000 m 3 /MWh. It also shows that water use can be potentially very high, stressing the need for tailored ex ante assessment of water use. This is especially the case in these SSA countries that experience significant (downstream) water shortages. Mitigation and optimisation potential In conclusion, hydropower can have severe negative impacts. Hydropower designs with a storage reservoir potentially have higher impacts, primarily due to inundation of land, although a critical factor in this respect is the type of land used. This variability provides scope for mitigation potential, which can be achieved by: \uf0b7 Avoiding locations which have a high (economic, social or environmental) value; \uf0b7 Allocating sufficient resources and placing sufficient focus on resettlement of residents and other functions. Subsequently, optimisation can be achieved by utilising synergies, such as: \uf0b7 Using the storage potential to provide flood protection, balancing seasonal variation in freshwater supply and balancing daily variations in energy demand; \uf0b7 Development of fishing activities in the storage reservoir. Especially for large-scale hydro, benefits are of limited relevance for those communities or even countries that are instead suffering the costs of large-scale implementations. Consequently, the challenge in maximising potentials for this technology lies within assuring the equal distribution of project benefits and promote social acceptance. This can be done by: 1) studying (quantitative) positive and negative impacts of hydropower; 2) being transparent about the study and costs and benefits; and 3) actively steering to minimise discrepancies between costs and benefits. Small-scale hydro technology has more flexibility in avoiding the outlined negative impacts, and especially run-of-river hydro consequences. In addition, small-scale hydro still allows an optimisation of positive impacts. Primarily, small-scale hydro provides more potential for attracting a larger share of the value chain to the region. This is mainly because smaller scale hydro generally requires more mechanical inputs, rather than civil works, in which are the latter has inputs more easily procured in the region. In addition, the small scale of projects is more likely to lead to structural employment, rather than temporary employment from one mega-project. This will stimulate employment, decrease costs and reduce capital leakage 119 . 3.2.3 Solar energy One can distinguish three main types of solar energy, which are (i) solar photovoltaic (PV) systems 120 , (ii) concentrating solar power systems (CSP) for electricity generation 121 and (iii) direct solar thermal collection for heating or cooling applications. As indicated in the RET theme report, the solar thermal technologies have a mature character and its domestic energy production (houses, hotels, etc.) is relatively stable. At the same time it is not expected that the demand or the 119 The International Energy Agency provides a very detailed discussion on mitigation potential due to negative impacts of hydropower. For each impact, the most effective mitigation measures are identified. This elaboration is available via http://www.ieahydro.org/reports/HyA3S5V2.pdf. 120 IEA definition: Solar photovoltaic (PV) directly converts solar energy into electricity using a PV cell made of a semiconductor material. 121 IEA definition: concentrating solar power (CSP) devices concentrate energy from the sun\u2019s rays to heat a receiver to high temperatures. This heat is transformed first into mechanical energy (by turbines or other engines) and then into electricity (solar thermal electricity, or STE). ",
        "89 installed capacity will increase in the coming years. As a result, we will only focus in this chapter on the impact of an increase in solar-PV and CSP and not on solar thermal technologies. Identification of impacts Due to the large differences in the characteristics between these two technologies, impacts will differ as well. At the same time, the technologies (especially solar PV) are used in different situations (and sizes). Potential impacts for the future growth in solar PV (or CSP) can be assessed through a variety of different angles (in terms of magnitude, impacts for specific actors, etc.). On the one hand, local communities can benefit from future developments, as low-income (rural) households without any grid-connection could access electricity through small-scale PV-panels (\u201cSolar Home System\u201d). On the other, large solar PV (or CSP) plants can provide electricity directly to the national grid, with greater potentials for a variety of socioeconomic stakeholders. These different angles also imply that the impacts show a large variety. At the same time it is important to note that some of the impacts have a more \u2018general character\u2019, which was also discussed in the previous section. The uptake of solar PV and/or CSP will for example result in the reduction of CO 2 (or at least reduces the future use of fossil fuels). Improved access to electricity (either via a small off-grid solar PV panel or via a large CSP plant) will generate impacts in relation to health, quality of life and empowerment (time savings due to wood collection, etc.). In the next table we present the main impacts which can be expected in case of an increase in the use of solar PV and/or CSP technologies. The key impacts are marked in the red boxes and are discussed in more detail below the table.

Assessment of main substantive impacts Three main areas of impact can be identified with respect to the uptake of solar PV (low and large scale) and (large scale) CSP: (i) the creation of a new market and value chain with mainly a local character, (ii) the employment impact, and (iii) the increased use of land and water. Key impact 1 and 2: local value chain and employment One of the main characteristics of the small scale PV-panels is that they have a local and individual use. Unlike other renewable energy sources, the small scale PV-panels can be distributed via a network of relatively small retailers (panels are relatively small, they can be transported and stored), bought by individual households (relatively cheap technology), and installed and maintained by small and local technicians (required expertise is relatively limited). As a result, it can be expected that a large uptake of small scale PV-panels will create (or strengthen) the local or regional value chain in order to meet the additional demand for PV-panels and its need for maintenance. It is likely that the majority of the PV-panels will be imported from outside Africa (for example from China) to a country by a few large trading companies and after that distributed to ",
        "91 retailers who have a more regional or even local scope 122 . Also further down the value chain, the needed expertise and services mainly have a local character (local technical expertise for installation, operation and maintenance). The large uptake and out-roll of solar PV may create economies of scale and scope due to the high volume (installation, maintenance) and learning effects. An important negative effect of the large uptake of solar PV may be the capital drain from the (importing) African countries to the panel producing companies (for example China, India). Research of the UNEP Ris\u00f8 Centre in three specific countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda) showed that, due to support and stimulation programmes, the local PV-markets gained over time more maturity and specific expertise and service solutions were developed 123 . However, it is important to note here that the markets in these countries were in the past heavily driven by \u2018distortive demand\u2019 due to government and donor support initiatives. In the last couple of years these countries show a move towards a more market-driven situation, which also results in more involvement of the (local) private sector. The researchers observe in relation to the increasing demand for PV-solutions, two main trends. First of all they see the development of local solar PV industries, which mainly covers assembly activities (for example assembly plants in Kenya, Ethiopia, Senegal and South Africa). Beside that, the researchers observe the development of related (mainly local) economic activities, for example in the provision of batteries and inverters, as well as specialised installation and other services. This also results in local employment 124 . Research by Ondraczek showed that in the last decade in Kenya a relatively mature solar industry developed, which ranged in 2009 from 15 and 40 major suppliers of solar equipment to three manufacturers of lead acid batteries, nine lamp manufacturers, five to eight companies regularly importing solar systems and components and several hundred sales agents and around 2 000 installation technicians 125 . The development of large scale CSP plants will result in a completely different impact. These plants are not only characterised by the large scale, but also by the high investments, the high level of expertise (for installation/construction, but also maintenance) and the relatively small market of international players. These characteristics also imply that the \u2018local sustainability\u2019 of the impacts differs compared to the small scale PV panels. The installation and construction of a CSP plant will result in a large employment effect, but this effect is mainly temporary (installation/construction) and it will also involve a lot of international technicians (not local people). Once a plant is build the need for (local) employees is much smaller and also the related economic demand will decrease (demand for steel and concrete, food supply, transportation, etc.). More or less the same mechanisms are applicable for the development of large scale PV plants. Key impact 3: Land and water use In the case of small scale PV panels, the impact on the use of land for installation of these panels will be very limited and very scattered (a few square meters per household, often installed on top of houses). However, for the uptake of (especially) large scale CSP plants the impact on the use of land and water is important. It is assessed that for a 100 MW solar plant approximately four square kilometres of land is needed 126 , although there exist differences per CSP-technology 127 . Because of 122 As mentioned afterwards, there is also a trend towards (small) local assembly activities in Africa itself. 123 UNEP Ris\u00f8 Centre Working Paper, \u2018Review of Solar PV market development in East Africa\u2019, March 2014, p. 3. 124 UNEP Ris\u00f8 Centre Working Paper, \u2018Review of Solar PV market development in East Africa\u2019, March 2014, p. 3. 125 Ondraczek, J., \u2018The Sun Rises in the East (of Africa): A Comparison of the Development and Status of the Solar Energy Markets in Kenya and Tanzania\u2019, working paper, 2011, p. 2-4. 126 Hans M\u00fcller-Steinhagen (Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR), \u2018Solar thermal power plants\u2019, presentation 2009, see: http://static.tue.nl/fileadmin/content/onderzoek/Eindhoven_Energy_Institute_EEI/EnergyDays/Serie_1_2008_2010/2009_04_0 7/Mueller-Steinhagen-1c.pdf ",
        "92 the need for water and the transportation of the generated electricity, the location of the plant is very important and it will probably not always be possible to locate the plant in \u2018useless desert\u2019. It depends per CSP technology whether there is a need for water (cooling). The parabolic dishes do not need water-cooling, while the other technologies (parabolic troughs, linear Fresnel receivers, towers) have the option to chose (dry or not) but the performance with cooling is better. If water- cooling is chosen, the needed cooling capacity varies from 2 000 liters/MWh (towers) to 3 000 liters/MWh (parabolic troughs, linear Fresnel receivers) 128 . The water use for the towers is more or less comparable with that required for new coal-fired power plants, but is substantially higher than natural gas combined cycle power plants (1 000 liters/MWh) 129 . The use of water for cooling is a source of environmental hazard. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (US) points at the risks of draining treatment water (with chemicals and hih levels of minerals) 130 . Mitigation and optimisation potential Regarding the measures one can take in order to mitigate and optimise the potential of solar power, one can think of the following two elements. First of all, the stimulation of PV-demand is important. The key for optimising the potential of small scale PV lies in the \u2018economies of scale\u2019 and in the massive use of these panels. If the uptake of small-scale PV panels reaches a certain threshold, it becomes interesting for the (private) market to start investing and strengthen the wholesale and retail channel. Two essential elements in this sense are (i) the involvement of households who can afford to invest in solar power, and (ii) the financial \u2018access\u2019 to solar power, for example via new and innovative financing models. Here it is important that one creates a \u2018sustainable environment\u2019, which does not depend (too much) on government or donor initiatives. Secondly, for the realisation of large CSP plants, the \u2018 framework conditions\u2019 for the large investment will be decisive. One can think of the location (land and water use), the access to the power grid, financial or fiscal incentives (feed-in-tariff, VAT-exemptions), tax and living conditions for expats, involvement of the local workforce (training), etc. Additionally, improving the efficiency of dry cooling will mitigate water use. 3.2.4 Wind Wind energy is gaining momentum in several SSA countries, notably South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia (medium to large sized connected units) followed by a range of other countries. Our inventory shows that there is currently an installed capacity of a modest 644 MW, however 954 MW is under construction and an additional 765 MW is in concept phase. Identification of impacts It is expected that smaller wind turbines (15 W to 0.5 MW) will lead to increased electrification, as explained under section 3.1. Larger wind turbines (0.85 > KW) will be grid connected and thus reduce the use of fossil fuels, with positive impact on CO2 emission and energy imports. However, larger wind turbines can have negative impacts on the landscape.

The crucial factor for the SSA region is to which extent this value chain can be localised, thus adding value to the region. Indeed, there is a growing number of local and regional actors (based primarily in South Africa) active in the areas of feasibility studies, research and technical support. These include private enterprises (investors, test laboratories, developers etc.) as well as research centres (e.g. South African National Energy Research Institute, South African Energy Research Institute (SANERI)) and universities (e.g. Cape Peninsula University of Technology, University of Cape Town). ",
        "94 For example, the large Lake Turkana project in Tanzania (310 MW, 365 turbines) is expected to create 2 500 jobs during construction and 200 jobs in maintenance, almost one permanent job per MW, a ratio slightly higher than in advanced countries such as the US 131 . Key impact 2: Biodiversity impacts Biodiversity impacts relate mostly to birds, bats and natural habitats. Birds can be killed by collision with wind turbines, especially those migrating and flying in groups. Despite improvements in the design of the blades, their speed remains simply too high for birds to prevent collision. Also bats face similar issues and are vulnerable, as they do not reproduce fast. Natural habitats on or near hilltops in the tropics can be vulnerable as the wind turbines can affect micro-climates and endanger rare species. Also the construction of roads, needed to transport the turbine and blades, can have adverse impacts on biodiversity 132 . Key impact 3: Visual impacts and tourism Large wind turbines have more visual impact than small one\u2019s. Such impacts can be large in attractive landscapes and/or areas with high touristic potential. This can lead to reduced numbers of tourists and hence reduced income for the local community 133 . However, some research 134 points to the fact that the relation is more complex. After all, tourisms itself requires electricity, and global attitudes towards wind are more favourable than towards some other energy sources. Furthermore, visual impacts of wind farms on tourists are expected to reduce over time. Clearly, the key lies in careful wind site planning and optimisation of benefits. Mitigation and optimisation potential \uf0b7 Employment and economic benefits depend strongly on the ability to localise value chains; to involve local economic actors in the preparation, construction, maintenance and operation of wind turbines; \uf0b7 Good and careful site selection: it is crucial to choose optimum sites and to take account all impacts; thus it is needed to carry out such impact assessments prior to any decision and that site-specific recommendations for optimising the effects are made; \uf0b7 Good construction practices, including the possibility for local assembly thus reducing the need for (new) roads; \uf0b7 Benefit sharing for local residents. The acceptance of wind turbines for local communities depends strongly on the ability to take part in the benefits. Experience from elsewhere suggests that communities that do not benefit directly from the installation of large-scale wind parks show resistance. Therefore, benefit-sharing schemes are recommended to engage local communities. Early engagement is crucial as well. 3.2.5 Geothermal Shallow geothermal penetration is today limited to South Africa for heating and cooling. Future penetration could be more important if a real market exists. Africa\u2019s geothermal power potential is concentrated in the Rift Valley countries (current capacity of 200 MW) and the theoretical potential is estimated as high as 15 000 MW, though more conservative, and realistic, estimates are between 7-9 000 MW. The commercially viable potential is estimated at 3-5 000 MW. 131 Jason P.

The table hereby highlights the impacts considered to be most significant (and further elaborate din the next chapters). Key ratios op other impacts, e.g. land use, water use and emissions are provided in MIT (2006), although these are not further assessed as they are very limited in the case of geothermal energy, if compared to other technologies 135 .

Produced electricity can be transported (with corresponding costs), but produced waste heat is expensive to transport. Consequently, having local demand for heat and electricity can positively affect the business case for geothermal energy. Conversely, a geothermal power plant improves the local investment climate and improves reliable energy (heat and electricity) availability. In addition, geothermal energy requires high tech expertise. This promotes the import of technological expertise and foreign investments in the region. Key impact 2: Water use and effects on water quality The basic water use of geothermal energy is related to drilling, stimulating reservoir circulation and cooling. During operation, the primary water use is for cooling, leading to water consumption and/or lowered quarter quality due to higher water temperatures. In areas with water scarcity, it is possible to apply a closed-loop system and use dry-cooling. This would reduce water use to a negligible +- 20 litres/MWh (Kagel et al. 2007) 136 . The transportation of chemicals required for drilling as well as possible disturbances of the subsurface stratigraphy leads to risks of water pollution. Vehicles transporting required chemicals can be involved in traffic incidents and pollute. This is exaggerated if the transport infrastructure is of a limited quality. In addition, drilling, leaking shafts and changing subsurface pressure regimes can lead to spillage in the groundwater. This can be especially harmful, because it is difficult or clean up these contaminations. Key impact 3: Seismicity during and after drilling / fracking Disturbing the geological subsurface balance can lead to seismicity and soil subsidence. Drilling and especially reservoir enhancement (\u2018fracking\u2019 or fracturing subsurface layers using high water 136 Kagel, A., D. Bates and K. Gawell (2007) A Guide to Geothermal Energy and the Environment http://www.geo-energy.org/reports/Environmental%20Guide.pdf ",
        "97 pressures can lead to seismicity and noise pollution. Subsidence is primarily caused by reducing subsurface through harvesting water. These effects can potentially be substantial. Earthquakes caused by enhancement of a reservoir have been measured at 3.4 at the scale of Richter 137 . In some areas, these activities were forced to stop, because of nuisance and damages to nearby residents (houses). During the peak of noise pollution, noise levels range from 80 to 115 decibels close to the plant 138 . Subsistence rates can potentially be as high as 0.45 m/year (Allis, 1990) 139 , although they can be prevented by reinjection of water or e.g. CO2. Mitigation and optimisation potential The primary mitigation and optimisation potential lies within: \uf0b7 Selecting the right location. This is a location with abundant water resources. In addition, a low population density prevents damage and nuisance due to tremors. In contrast, a high concentration of population and economic activities is beneficial for selling waste heat, selling electricity and the available human capacity. In practice, however, the location strongly depends on the geothermal resource potential and the geological conditions; \uf0b7 Realising safe transport infrastructure to mitigate pollution risk of chemicals during transportation; \uf0b7 Raising community awareness to create acceptance for tremors; \uf0b7 Applying a closed system to prevent pollution; \uf0b7 Applying dry-cooling if water scarcity is an issue. 3.2.6 Ocean energy Despite strong if not huge potential, ocean energy remains in an embryonic stage with worldwide a capacity of 500 MW, of which none in the SSA. Given the embryonic state of this RET, it is too premature to assess substantial impacts. Identification of impacts \uf0b7 Wave and tidal energy are clean and socially highly accepted; \uf0b7 The effect of large-scale tidal power plants on the environment is still rather uncertain. Installations can cause changes in small and large-scale hydrodynamics around the structure, sea bed morphology, sediment transport and ecosystem functioning; \uf0b7 Positive environmental effects \u2013 building on the experience of offshore wind farms \u2013 can come from the prohibition for commercial fisheries and navigation, which can result in the development of relatively bio-productive and bio-diverse refuges around the foundations 140 . Mitigation and optimisation potential \uf0b7 A need for long-term testing to improve the understanding about the impacts on sites of wave as well as tidal, and to collect data over longer time periods; \uf0b7 Good site-selection, taking into account economic, social and environmental impacts; \uf0b7 Public acceptance can be early involvement of stakeholders and enhancement of awareness about the characteristics of the technology. 137 http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/30777.pdf 138 MIT (2006), The Future of Geothermal Energy https://mitei.mit.edu/system/files/geothermal-energy-full.pdf 139 Allis, R.

        "98 3.3 Conclusions: minimising negative and maximising positive impacts A first conclusion is that renewable energy in itself is not necessarily positive or negative for the economy, society and environment. It all depends on how and where renewable energy technology projects will be designed, built, operated and financed. Clearly, negative impacts can be dampened or alleviated by a thorough project preparation, solid business models, engagement of local expertise and population, etc. First of all, such analysis of impacts is imperative as part of the development of RE technologies. This is especially the case in the SSA region where citizens and stakeholders are often not well- placed to engage, and where such impacts can be unprecedented in size and scope if not well- thought through. Indeed, the development of RE projects requires such assessments as part of feasibility studies, project preparation and site selection, especially as impacts can be so different depending on the specificities of the projects. The EU \u2013 as global leader in sustainable development practices \u2013 has a reputation to keep up in this area and can position itself clearly from other global players active in the region. Currently, a gap can be discerned in the impact assessment work related to RE technology deployment. Even though general information is available and international donors require such assessments to take place, relatively limited information is available about these impacts in the specific context of the SSA region. At the same time, involvement of African researchers in this type of work is limited, even though universities and research centres in the SSA region have expressed genuine interest in such work \u2013 their drive is often to learn from previous renewable energy initiatives what has worked and what not. It proves difficult to work with long-term baseline scenarios in the context of SSA. Even though such scenarios exist (e.g. UNIDO, IEA, IRENA), it is very difficult to make any reliable prognosis or development trajectory in the region due to the large number of \u2018unknowns\u2019. In particular, there appears to be a substantial gap between the policy ambitions and the reality \u2013 in terms of investment activity \u2013 on the ground. In any case, it proves essential in this type of work to be specific about the assumptions with regard to additional access to energy/electricity as compared to replacement of fossil fuels. Whilst such replacement is commonly seen to be most important in an EU-context, it seems that the most substantial if not spectacular socio-economic impacts can be derived from additional energy/electricity access \u2013 which is typical for economies in development. Economic impacts need to be thought through in great detail. Amongst SSA stakeholders, the interest in renewable energy as a vehicle for economic and social development is very high. In this respect, some technologies (e.g. wind or CSP) create more direct jobs than others (e.g. solar PV or large-scale hydro). Access to (renewable) energy can also be an important location factor for (agro) industry. When doing economic impact analysis, it is important to take into account existing market structures. Put in simple terms, there are substantial economic interests related to the fossil fuel economy \u2013 both in legal as well as illegal parts of the economy \u2013 and many of these players are not particularly keen to give up their positions for the sake of renewable energy. Thus, renewable energy roll-out can also be seen as a powerful instrument to produce structural economic reforms, to break energy monopolies and to bring more transparency and competition to markets \u2013 and thus contribute to more advanced economies.

Depending on the type of technology, the scale of roll-out and the ability to build up local competences, renewable energy can generate substantial employment \u2013 even though employment losses in traditional fuel economy may need to be accounted for as well. Of utmost important are health and educational effects, as well as social and gender aspects. Renewable energy deployment can also produce powerful environmental gains, mostly related to the reduction of fossil fuels usage. However, substantial differences exist between RE technologies, and care should be taken in promoting those with unforeseen and unexpected detrimental effects, including use of valuable land and water (e.g. in certain biomass areas such as first generation biofuels). Overall, small-scale projects are favourable over large-scale, because this allows for more flexibility when mitigating detrimental effects, especially so in the field of hydropower. Returning to the introductory remarks of this section \u2013 much will depend on the careful preparation and optimisation of projects \u2013 hence sound feasibility studies as well as community involvement.

        "101 4 Overview of R&I capacities and needs This chapter addresses the question what the R&I capacities and needs are in the area of renewable technology. The Terms of Reference (Task 4) requires \u201ca mapping of SSA capacities based on factual information and data in view of providing elements to inform decision making for future S&T cooperation with SSA in the area of renewable energy. Reporting should pay attention to research capacities and needs in the area of RET; national research policy and support framework and researchers mobility within SSA and globally including the role of the diaspora. The analysis should be forward looking (until 2020).\u201d We will approach this vast question through three different angles: a generic overview focusing on the human capacities, R&I activities, R&I players, support to R&I and patents (Chapter 4.1). We then turn to the RET-specific needs that are derived from the RET Thematic reports (Chapter 4.2). This is followed by an analysis of transversal R&I needs, including those in the area of power control technologies, smart metering, energy limiters and storage solutions (Chapter 4.3). The analysis of existing capacities relies on an extensive desk review to identify the main stakeholders relevant to R&I in RE in SSA. The authors established a database and recorded the details of about 150 public and private stakeholders, out of which 70 SSA-based universities, research centres and national research agencies active in RE. A questionnaire was then sent to selected players to get a more accurate picture of their activities. Last, the analysis was reviewed based on the outcome of field visits and regional workshops. 4.1 Overview of R&I Capacities 4.1.1 Human capacities The lack of qualified human resources is widely recognised as an important obstacle to the deployment of RE in SSA. This lack is felt at all levels \u2013 SSA lacks installers, operators, technicians, but also professors, researchers, high-level decision makers. International organisations and local institutions start to realise that the lack of professionals in RE and in energy/electricity at large is a major constraint and that education and training becomes a major issue for RE development as well as interconnections. Higher Education in Africa Although no statistics exist regarding the number of people studying or trained in RE, one may safely assume that it is correlated to the general level of tertiary education in SSA countries. Enrolment in tertiary education in SSA is dramatically lower than in any other part of the world 141 : it is almost nine times lower than in EU countries, four times lower than in East Asia and Pacific countries. But it is also in SSA that enrolment grows fastest, at more than 5 % per year. The table below illustrates the huge differences among SSA countries in terms of higher education and evolution trends. 141 Figures in this paragraph come from the World Bank\u2019s Education Statistics, \u201cGross enrolment ratio.

Nearly all RE projects now under implementation include training or capacity building activities for locals to be able to install, operate and maintain the equipment. For instance the initiative \u201cFormation initiale et continue des op\u00e9rateurs et acteurs d\u2019\u00e9lectrification rurale en Afrique de l\u2019Ouest\u201d, financed under the EU-ACP Energy facility, aims at reinforcing the capacity to develop and operate rural electrification projects \u2013 many of which rely on RE \u2013 in Mali and Burkina Faso. On a broader perspective, vocational training has become a priority and several institutions are actively developing adapted curricula . For instance, Cape Verde\u2019s main university (Uni-CV) opened in 2013 a vocational training course (Cursos de Estudos Superiores Profissionalizantes, CESP) on the installation and maintenance of RE equipment. In Namibia, Windhoek Vocational Training Centre is introducing renewable energies in its syllabus, in particular solar water heating. Engineering degrees (electrical, mechanical) often include at least a short course on RE. However, dedicated BSc in RE remain rare, but are offered for instance at the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR) in Ghana or at ESIBA-IUA in Togo. Training tomorrow\u2019s RE experts Post-graduate education in RE is key to develop SSA\u2019s capacity to increase its R&I activities. As of today, only a limited number of students do a MSc or a PhD in renewable energy. For instance, the following universities have PhD students in RE: Universite de Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), 2iE (Burkina Faso), Kenyatta University (Kenya), University of Mauritius, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane (Mozambique). But it is likely that many students interested in continuing their education in RE go abroad to do so. Although post-graduate education in RE is not seen a major concern by most stakeholders, efforts are ongoing to develop better programmes at MSc and PhD level: for instance with the EU-Edulink II Participia project (Masters programmes in RE in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa in partnership with several European universities). The Africa-EU Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme (RECP) is also initiating EU-Africa cooperation for the development of MSc curricula in RE. ",
        "103 Brain drain \u201cBrain drain\u201d refers to the emigration of a country\u2019s highly educated elite looking for better professional opportunities abroad. Africa is hit particularly hard by brain drain: 13 % of SSA\u2019s skilled workers emigrated 142 \u2013 to be compared to 1 % of North America\u2019s or 5 % of East Asia\u2019s 143 . The prevalence of brain drain varies widely from country to country, with high-skilled emigration rates reaching 63% in Mauritius, 46% in Mozambique, 27% in Ghana and 24% in Kenya 144 . The direct effects of brain drain are well known. While depriving the origin country of much-needed qualified individuals, it is also a kind of a reverse subsidy from poorer countries (who paid for the emigrants\u2019 education) to richer ones (who will reap the benefits of this education). It can even lead to \u201cbrain waste\u201d, or the underutilization of emigrants\u2019 skills in the host country \u2013 think of an African PhD in nuclear physics who ends up working as a taxi driver in New York. However, some argue that the indirect effects of highly-skilled emigration could be more positive than initially thought: indeed, emigrants send money back home, share knowledge, facilitate business relationships and may even invest in their origin country\u2019s economy. The general perception of this phenomenon is usually associated with healthcare professions but scientists and engineers are also affected. . . There is unfortunately little factual data readily available to understand how SSA\u2019s R&I capacities in the RE sector are specifically affected by brain drain. Our survey (see Box 5) shows that, while brain drain exists in the RE sector, it is not considered a major obstacle. Some see it as a problem (depriving the country of much-needed skills), others as an advantage (reinforcing international connections). Box 5: Insights from the questionnaire-based survey The Consultant\u2019s work included a questionnaire-based survey sent in Spring 2014 to SSA -based professors / scientists to gather data about their activities and resources as well as the obstacles they encounter. While the number of respondents (sixteen in total) wasn\u2019t sufficient to get statistically significant data, it still provides useful insights. Obstacles to R&I activities All agree that the lack of public financing at national level is the main issue, and accessing international financing remains extremely difficult. The third obstacle is the insufficiency of training/education facilities for the youth. Political support to research, protection of intellectual property, access to international knowledge and interest from the private sector are seen as lesser problems. Brain Drain Brain drain comes on 7 th of 8 th in the ranking of obstacles to R&I activities. When asked if they often witness occurrences of brain drain within their institutions, respondents offered mixed answers: one-third never witnessed it, one-third said it was rare, one-third that it was a common occurrence. Half of respondents consider it a \u201cmajor issue\u201d while the other half rather sees it as \u201can advantage, as it strengthens international relations and contacts and facilitates knowledge sharing.\u201d Financing Line Ministries are the most frequent source of funding. International institutions such as the European Commission, the African Commission or the World Bank are often cited as financing partners; bilateral agencies (French, Danish cooperation) are present as well. Private partners are less frequent. Two respondents (from DR Congo and Madagascar) reported using their own personal resources to finance research activities. 142 In the present section, we will quantify this phenomenon by comparing the total number of tertiary educated nationals of one given country with the fraction of these tertiary educated who live outside the country. 143 \u201cIs the brain drain good for Africa?\u201d, William Easterly, Yaw Nyarko, Brookings Global Economy and Development, 2009 144 Proportion of tertiary educated migrants over the pre-migration population (defined as the sum of tertiary educated residents and tertiary educated migrants in each source country).

        "104 Call for projects To the question \u201cIf the DG Research of the European Commission were to launch a call for projects focused on Renewable Energies in Africa, would you be interested in participating?\u201d, 100% answered yes. However, only a small number of them knew about, and took part in, the calls launched under FP6, FP7 and the EU-ACP Energy Facility. The visibility of the calls launched by the EC is therefore an important point. Lastly, it must be noted that a minority of the respondents never took part in calls for projects of any kind and hence, would certainly require some guidance or coaching were they to participate in a call launched by the DG RTD. South Africa is a net importer of students The braindrain situation is rather specific in South Africa . Contrary to other countries in the SSA region, South Africa is a net importer of students. Furthermore, the majority of inbound students come from SSA countries. SSA countries are not popular destinations for South African students, with only a fraction (far less than 1 %) of South Africans studying there. This clearly illustrates that South Africa is the SSA\u2019s centre for higher education.

Braindrain from South Africa to the rest of the world is directed towards the United Kingdom, followed by Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland; however since the global recession accelerated in 2011 and 2012, nearly net 360,000 expatriates returned to South Africa 145 . From a South African perspective, diaspora is not considered only as a threat but also as an opportunities \u2013 as South Africans working abroad can strengthen relationships with foreign countries. Also, emigrants obtain new experience which can be brought back to South Africa. Indeed, about 52 % of those returning are hired in management positions, which is the most critical shortage of any skills in South Africa 146 . 145 Adcorp Employment Index (2014); http://www.adcorp.co.za/Industry/Pages/Adcorp'sEmploymentIndex.aspx 146 http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/labour/2014/01/14/expertise-flows-back-into-sa-as-brain-drain-is-reversed ",
        "105 The situation is different when it comes to incoming students from other African countries, as illustrated by the case of Zimbabwean students. A large number of Zimbabweans studying in South Africa are eager to stay due to the limited economic prospects in their own country. South Africa is considered by Zimbabweans as a place to build a new life, rather than a place of temporary respite and quick income. For instance, by 2000, 51 % of all Zimbabwean-trained medical doctors had left their country, with South Africa as the most popular destination. Also Zimbabwean maths and science teachers are in demand in South Africa. Legal entries into South Africa from Zimbabwe rose rapidly from around 500,000 in 2000 to more than 1.2 million in 2008. Also students from other African countries often decide to study in South Africa due to the higher quality of education and if at all possible start to build up their career. 4.1.2 R&I activities The present section is based on our sample of SSA-based institutions active in R&I in renewable energies. Our sample includes about 150 organisations: universities, research centres, government agencies, NGOs, and a few private businesses. 147 Improving energy access is a major objective The mission statements of most SSA institutions active in R&I put an emphasis on improving the living conditions of African populations. Providing access to reliable, affordable energy is a major objective for researchers and inventors who want to make a significant contribution to the development of their country. On a more formal level, R&I strategies often refer to the country\u2019s poverty reduction policy. In countries where 80 % of the population rely on traditional biomass for cooking and where rural electrification rates are under 10 % 148 , designing solutions to answer the rural population\u2019s energy needs is a priority. Hence, a large fraction of R&I activities is geared towards domestic energy uses (off-grid electrification, efficient cooking, efficient lighting) and small-scale productive end-uses (such as the utilization of biofuels to power local workshops). Large-scale energy applications for industry or on-grid power generation are less represented in R&I, as illustrated by the chart below. Table 4.3 Research activities of SSA-based stakeholders: small-scale and large-scale (excl. South Africa) Source: desk research by authors on a sample of SSA-based institutions Applied research and adapted technologies Some institutions are active in fundamental research; for instance, the University of Nairobi (Kenya), as well as the University of Botswana and the Universite Cheikh Anta Diop (Senegal) are 147 The sample excluded South Africa. 148 Those are approximate figures, not related to one country in particular, but illustrating the situation that prevails in many SSA countries.

        "106 conducting fundamental research on the properties of photovoltaic cells. However, most organisations focus on applied research for the adaptation of existing technologies to the local context. In line with the concept of \u201cfrugal innovation\u201d, the objective is to develop solutions that are: \uf0b7 Suited to local needs (e.g. a cooking stove adapted to the local cooking habits); \uf0b7 Based on locally available materials (e.g. briquettes made of locally available agricultural residues); \uf0b7 Adapted to local manufacturing and maintenance skills (which leads to low-tech rather than high-tech solutions) \uf0b7 Affordable for local populations (which implies lowering the costs by all means). While this focus on adapted technologies is extremely relevant to the energy access challenges faced by most African countries, it also has consequences for the global outreach of R&I activities conducted in SSA: local solutions being mostly relevant at local level, the national and international exposure of many stakeholders remains limited. Box 6: African universities working on adapted technologies NCERD, Nigeria: The National Centre for Energy Research and Development (NCERD) at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, developed an adapted version of biogas digesters with a capacity of 10 m3 to 20 m3. This model of digester was then disseminated in Kaduna, Ogun, Lagos, Borno, Anambra, Enugu and Imo states. Biogas digesters developed by NCERD 149 Universit\u00e9 de Ngaoundere, Cameroon: The University conducts applied research in solar thermal, solar photovoltaic and biogas technologies. It developed several prototypes, for instance the solar dryer shown below. The University also conducts real-life testing of its prototypes: a solar water pumping system was installed in a nearby village to provide water for local farming activities.

        "107 Most represented research activities The most represented fields of research are biomass and solar PV \u2013 in line with the energy access concerns described above. It seems that in recent years, technology-driven approaches gave way to multidisciplinary programmes encompassing environmental impacts and socio-economic issues: \u201csoft\u201d research regarding the interactions between energy and the social and environmental background come in fourth position. Only a handful of SSA-based stakeholders work on concentrated solar power, marine energies, geothermal energies and hydrogen/fuel cells. Table 4.4 Research activities of SSA-based stakeholders: most represented fields of research (excl. South Africa) Source: desk research by authors on a sample of SSA-based institutions Table 4.5 Universities and research centres active in testing of RE equipment/appliances (excl. South Africa) Source: research by authors ",
        "108 The assessment and mapping of indigenous renewable energy resources is also an important field of activity for SSA-based R&I institutions. To name a few 151 , Kenya\u2019s Institute of Energy and Environmental Technologies of the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology is developing a wind resource assessment model; Nigeria\u2019s National Centre for Hydropower Research and Development at the University of Ilorin undertakes the assessment of the country\u2019s hydropower resources; Burkina Faso\u2019s Laboratoire Energie Solaire et Economies d\u2019Energie at 2iE works on a geographical information system to identify CSP potential. Lastly, testing activities must also be mentioned. Indeed, the mass dissemination of adapted technologies such as improved cooking stoves or portable solar lanterns can only be successful if the quality of the products meets minimum requirements. As many countries do not have fully functional testing and certification bodies , it is often up to university laboratories or research centres to play this role. Hence, many of them have testing facilities for small-scale RE equipment and appliances (cookstoves, PV panels, picohydro etc). 4.1.3 R&I players Research and innovation in RE in SSA goes back a long time. Mali\u2019s CNESOLER (National Centre for Solar and Renewable Energies) for instance was founded in 1964 just after the country became independent. Many laboratories or research centres have been in operation for more than thirty years. However, recent years have witnessed an increased interest for energy issues and hence, the creation of new R&I facilities dedicated to RE throughout Africa. Universities and research centres An important number of universities and research centres are \u2013 at least nominally \u2013 engaged in research activities in RE across SSA. Our study identified 70 of them in 20 countries and more than twenty in South Africa alone. There are however huge differences among them in terms of actual activity level, outreach, and international exposure. I n our sample, the countries hosting the most active universities and research centres are South Africa, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal. The organisation of research activities at national level also varies widely, with some countries conducting RE research mostly in governmental agencies and state-owned research centres, while in others it is entrusted to universities enjoying a high level of autonomy. A country- wise approach is therefore necessary to get a good understanding of the situation. 151 We focus here on activities carried out by SSA-based organisation. Stakeholders outside Africa are also active in the mapping of Africa\u2019s RE resources \u2013 the EU\u2019s JRC is one of them. ",

Fundo de Energia (FUNAE) Universidade Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) Namibia Namibia hosts some of the rare SSA-based research programmes in marine energies (microalgal biofuels) and concentrated solar power (CSP). Desert Research Foundation of Namibia (DRFN) University of Namibia (UNAM) Namibia Energy Institute (formerly Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Institute, REEEI) Nigeria Most of R&I activities in the energy sector are conducted by a network of six Energy Research Centres under the Energy Commission of Nigeria.

Makerere University Centre for Research in Energy and Energy Conservation (CREEC) Private innovation Our desk-based research did not allow the identification of SSA-based companies with formal R&D structures active in RE. As far as large-scale, high tech RET are concerned, most technologies now being deployed in Africa have been invented and developed abroad. As an example, in Rwanda, an innovative technology used to extract Lake Kivu\u2019s dissolved methane 152 was developed by an Israeli engineering group and implemented by a German installer, while another technology was tested by a French scientist \u2013 with very limited contribution from Rwandan scientists or engineers. That does not mean however that private innovation does not exist in SSA \u2013 rather the opposite. The development of attractive, adapted solutions for domestic energy needs is conducted by 152 The origin of Lake Kivu\u2019s methane is still disputed by specialists. While it cannot be considered a \u201crenewable\u201d energy per se , it is close in nature to biogas. Its extraction required the development of a brand new process. ",
        "111 independent inventors much more frequently than by university researchers. In this field \u2013 small- scale RE applications to answer domestic energy needs \u2013 the creativity of African inventors is virtually boundless with also the growing presence of Europeans and North-Americans. For a long time, this field was seen as unprofitable and hence, the first generations of improved stoves, gasifiers, solar appliances etc, were mostly developed by non-profit organisations. NGOs still are a crucial player in the adaptation and dissemination of RET. While international NGOs (such as England-based Practical Action and Global Village Energy Partnership, France-based GERES, to name a few) play a key role at the global level, many smaller NGOs develop their own solutions at the local level. Of course, the outreach of such local players remains very limited. In recent years, profit-seeking companies have entered the game. The populations at the \u201cbase of the pyramid\u201d (BoP) are now seen as a new market to conquer; energy access, as a profitable business. Companies develop innovative RE solutions suited to the poor\u2019s\u2019 energy needs and the donor community strongly encourages such market-based approaches. The major players are often based in Europe or North America (e.g. US-based Envirofit for cookstoves, US-based D.light for solar lanterns). However, many inventions are now due to Africans themselves, who develop RE solutions that are adapted to the local resources, know-how and needs. It would be impossible to identify them all, but the table below gives a few examples. Independent innovation is thus very dynamic. However, it remains scattered and informal \u2013 for instance, it very rarely leads to the registration of a patent (see below). Its outreach is often limited to the local market. A few innovative RE solutions developed by SSA-based entrepreneurs FlexiBiogas, by Biogas International (Kenya) Low cost biogas system made of flexible tarpaulin bag and plastic pipes.

In some countries, there is a strong policy to encourage cooperation between academia and the private sector: in Burkina Faso for instance; in Botswana, where an Innovation Hub was recently set up to facilitate partnerships; in Mauritius, where the Research Council offers specific financing tools for public-private research initiatives. Respondents to our survey reported many cases of partnerships with local private businesses active in RE, and also with state-owned energy companies (e.g. power utility). Partnerships with international companies were less reported; such partnerships seem to revolve around the international partner\u2019s activities in the country (rather than its international operations as a whole). 4.1.4 Support to R&I activities Financing R&I The mobilization of adequate financial resources is, of course, the most important issue for R&I. Public funds for research and innovation in RE are traditionally channelled through Ministries (for Research, for Higher Education, for Energy) to public universities and research centres, based on yearly budget allocations. However, recent years witnessed the creation of public funding agencies dedicated to R&I in several SSA countries: funds are allocated through calls for proposals, on a project-wise basis. For instance: \uf0b7 Ghana launched in 2008 the Science and Technology Endowment Fund (STREFund) to support basic and applied research \u2013 however the fund lacks adequate resources; \uf0b7 Burkina Faso established in 2011 the FONRID (National Fund for Research and Innovation, under the Ministry for R&I). RE research projects are financed through calls for proposals. The first call in 2012 selected projects on improved stoves and energy efficiency; \uf0b7 Mozambique since 2013 finances R&I through the FNI, Fundo Nacional de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o (National Research Fund) under the Ministry of Science and Technology. Calls for projects regularly include RE. Joint calls are launched together with Zambia\u2019s National Science and Technology Council; \uf0b7 Kenya is seriously engaged in the creation of a National Research Fund. The decision was approved by Parliament in late 2012, but the Fund is not yet operational as of now. In spite of these recent initiatives, insufficient local public financing is a major obstacle for R&I activities in RE: 100 % of the respondents in our survey said lack of public financing is a \u201cvery important obstacle\u201d for them and some (from DR Congo and Mali) reported using their own funds to carry out their research. In this regard, the role of multilateral and bilateral organisations is key: many research projects are financed by international donors (see Chapter 6 on international cooperation). Innovation contests Business-oriented innovation receives more and more support. Innovation contests, aimed at supporting promising innovations through their early development stages, are multiplying. Here are a few examples of such contests open to African inventors in the field of renewable energies: \uf0b7 The SEED initiative (Supporting Entrepreneurs for Sustainable Development) provides technical assistance to innovative entrepreneurs since 2005. It was launched by UNDP, UNEP and IUCN; 153 70 % of the respondents in our survey said that PPP for research activities are common practice in their country. ",
        "113 \uf0b7 The Energy and Environmental Partnership for Southern and Eastern Africa ( EEP S&EA ) since 2010 finances demonstration projects in RE. It is funded by Finland, the UK and Austria; \uf0b7 Since 2012 the Innovation Prize for Africa (IPA), an award founded by the African Innovation Foundation and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, focuses on marketable innovations. Out of 10 finalists in 2013, 2 were proposing innovations in renewable energy; \uf0b7 Lighting Africa (an IFC initiative to promote off-grid lighting, mostly solar powered) conducts each year since 2008 a grant competition, providing seed funding for innovations in off-grid lighting product development and distribution; \uf0b7 Since 2013, the West Africa Forum for Clean Energy Financing ( WAFCEF ) Business Plan Competition offers support to promising entrepreneurs in renewable energy. Academic cooperation networks for RE 154 Access to international knowledge and experience sharing is also key for R&I. The table below gives a few examples of formal international cooperation networks that are of high relevance for SSA-based academic institutions and researchers in RE. This list is, of course, not exhaustive, but gives a first overview of the situation. It must be noted that the majority of these networks were initiated outside Africa, either by universities of the North, or by multilateral cooperation organisations.

For a deeper and broader analysis of international cooperation, see Chapter 6. ",
        "114 In addition to these formal networks, research projects conducted jointly by universities of SSA, Europe, Asia and America attest to the dynamism of international academic cooperation. Our survey sample of international cooperation indicates the following trends: within Africa , unsurprisingly, most cooperation activities happen between countries belonging to the same economic/linguistic area (e.g. Kenya-Uganda-Tanzania; Mali-Senegal-Benin-Burkina Faso). South African universities are well represented in joint research programmes, not only within Southern Africa, but throughout the whole continent and even globally. Between Africa and Europe , although there remain ties from older times (e.g. between France and Mali; Belgium and DR Congo; Portugal and Cape Verde; UK and Nigeria; etc), today\u2019s academic cooperation knows no predefined borders. Scandinavian, German and Austrian universities are particularly active while the ones from Southern Europe are less represented. Between Africa and North America, a range of joint research projects are on-going with universities from the USA and Canada. Cooperation however seems less strong than with European academic partners. Our study did not find any academic cooperation between Africa and Latin America. Between Africa and Asia, the stronger ties seem to be with India. Two India-based research centres are now strongly established on the African continent: the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) with a branch in Ethiopia, and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) with two regional hubs in Mali and Kenya and six branches throughout Africa. Japanese, Korean and to a lesser extent Chinese academic institutions are also partnering with African universities. 4.1.5 Patents Africa makes less than 1 % of all patents Innovation in the design of efficient, adapted cookstoves is an important field for innovation in SSA. It is therefore interesting to take a closer look at the recent patenting trends in this field 155 . The result is rather surprising: an overwhelming majority of patented stoves were invented in China (88%). In Africa \u2013 none. A very similar pattern was observed for solar cooking 156 : China comes first with almost 50%; the only SSA country represented in the sample (South Africa) makes only 2%. On a broader perspective, the exploration of several sources shows that patent activity in SSA is extremely limited \u2013 not only in the RE sector, but in all sectors of the economy. The thorough research on clean energy technologies conducted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the European Patents Office (EPO) shows that less than 1 % of all patent applications relating to this field have been filed in Africa 157 , a large majority of which, in South Africa. Patented African inventions in RE The UNEP/EPO report quoted above analysed patents applications related to energy technologies for climate change mitigation (CPC \u201cY02\u201d) and adaptation (CPC \u201cZ\u201d). They identified about 1 100 applications registered in SSA related to RE technologies out of which 900 in South Africa alone. The data indicates that solar thermal, biofuels wind and solar PV are the most active sectors for innovation. 155 This paragraph is based on the authors\u2019 research on Espacenet Worldwide database (CPC Y02B40/163 \u201cFuel efficient biomass cooking stoves\u201d, publication date between 2000 and 2013). 156 \u00ab Patent Landscape Report on Solar Cooking \u00bb, World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), 2011 157 \u201cPatents and clean energy technologies in Africa\u201d; UNEP, EPO, 2013 ",

Formatting: authors Patents and non-patent strategies for invention protection Considering the dynamism of entrepreneurs and inventors across Africa, the low level of patents activity is rather surprising. All the more so as the required legal framework is now in place: according to the UNEP/EPO report quoted above, \u201call African states except Somalia now have a patent system, and all states except for Somalia and Eritrea comply or will eventually be obliged to comply to the requirements of the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement as members of the WTO\u201d. In addition to national frameworks, two regional organisations offer the possibility to apply for patents simultaneously in several countries: OAPI (Organisation Africaine de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle) and ARIPO (African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation). It must however be noted that, even with a law in place, the legal protection of one\u2019s invention is not easy to obtain and enforce. The dire condition of the administrative and legal system in many African countries is an important obstacle in the way of intellectual property protection: on the one hand, it increases the cost and time needed for filing a patent application, while on the other, it does not give sufficient certainty that the inventor\u2019s rights would actually prevail in court in case the invention were copied. The cost and effort of registering a patent may therefore not be justified. In addition, many inventors belong to the informal sector: their relationship with the administration is weak, their understanding of legal issues is limited, which may explain their reluctance or inability to enter a formal patent application process. While the difficulty to obtain legal protection for their innovations may act as a disincentive, African inventors also resort to other strategies to protect themselves from copycats and retain their market advantage 160 . Secrecy is one; scattered production, i.e. distributed manufacturing of components 158 Regional organisation covering Benin, Burkina faso, Cameroon, Centrafrique, Comores, Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, Bissau Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, Chad, Togo 159 Regional organisation covering Botswana, the Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe 160 This paragraph largely draws from \u201cCountry study on innovation, intellectual property and the informal economy: the informal metalworking sector in Kenya\u201d, WIPO, 2014. This report includes several case studies related to small-scale RE (improved stoves, digesters etc). ",
        "116 across several suppliers so that only the owner has knowledge of all the components necessary to assemble a product, is another. But it must be noted that IP protection can be at odds with the cooperation spirit that prevails in many African professional communities. Furthermore, as innovation in RE is seen by many as a way of improving the population\u2019s living condition, IP protection is not always desirable. For instance, according to WIPO\u2019s report on Kenya quoted above, the design of the Kenyan Ceramic Jiko, an improved version of Kenya\u2019s traditional cookstove, was purposefully disclosed by its inventor in order to encourage its rapid spreading out. Hence, there is little evidence of a correlation between innovative activity and patents in SSA (outside South Africa). Thanks to the efforts undertaken by national and regional patents offices, this situation may change in the coming years as patenting becomes more and more accessible to African inventors. But for the time being, as noted by the European Patents Office in the report quoted above, \u201cpatent rights are unlikely to be a major consideration in any decision to exploit clean energy technologies\u201d in SSA. 4.2 R&I Needs 4.2.1 Introduction and types of needs The assessment of the needs for public support in RET and R&I capacity lies at the heart of this project. Existing initiatives, such as the Africa-EU Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme (RECP) 161 , have identified a set of competency areas which are indispensable requirements for any RET-related innovation process: 1) Policy Advisory Services; 2) Private Sector Cooperation; 3) Project Preparation and 4) Technology and Capacity Development. If we combine the above basic requirements with the Horizon 2020 supporting activities for R&I, the following categories emerge, for which basic needs have been identified: \uf0b7 Framework conditions \u2013 including all actions related to business and regulatory context; \uf0b7 Research & Innovation actions \u2013 focusing on collaborative research within the SSA region and/or with EU; \uf0b7 Innovation Actions \u2013 plans for new or improved products, processes or services, typically focusing on the adjustment of existing technologies/products to the SSA context; \uf0b7 Private sector cooperation \u2013 domains where businesses from EU and the SSA region would be expected to lead, e.g. in formulating business models, exploring markets, etc.; \uf0b7 Coordination & support actions , e.g. those requiring standardisation, dissemination of good practices, policy dialogues, etc.; \uf0b7 Competency development : mobility support of researchers or students for training and career development; curriculum development in the field of renewable energy. Analysing the R&I needs pertaining to each of the RET reveals that various types of above-listed actions are required to foster the deployment of the considered RE. This is true as well for grids and mini-grids as they are enablers for increased penetration of RET in SSA. Within the perimeter of innovation related to the category Grids and Mini-grids lie the smart management of generation, storage and distribution of electricity (through remote control technologies), its consumption (smart metering) and the related topics of prepayment and mobile banking. Some of the R&I needs and related actions are technology-specific and some others are transversal, as they make sense for most (or all) of the RET. Examples of transversal needs are impacts assessment, academic cooperation, training and education, support to the private sector. 161 Africa-EU Energy Partnership/RECP (2009) \u201cAfrica-EU Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme (RECP); ",
        "117 The following chapters provide explanation on the type of actions envisioned in the form of examples applied to some pertaining RETs. In-depth analysis of the specific R&I needs and related required actions pertaining to each RET (and to Grids and Mini-grids as well) has been undertaken. Further on, this detailed portfolio of R&I needs, after examination of the existing cooperation activities in these various relevant domains (Chapter 6), are screened with regards to areas of potential common interest between EU and SSA (Chapter 7). Each of the resulting selected topics is the described in a detailed fiche, both for technology-specific needs and for transversal ones. These fiches are then ranked according to specific criteria (Chapter 8). 4.2.2 Framework conditions In many SSA countries, the institutional and regulatory framework is not adapted to the uptake of renewable energy. This is particularly pertaining to grid-tied RE supply. When grid connection is concerned, the following topics have to be taken care of: grid code adaptation for facilitating IPP supply, suitable Feed-in-Tariffs as well as non-distorted tariff schemes (removal of hidden subsidies), protective Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) which secures private investments versus changing conditions, e.g. grid extension that changes the tariff conditions of an isolated minigrid. This is also related to grid extension planning. Regarding biomass, the questions of property rights on land, the standards (especially for biofuels) and the management of waste and biomass resource (both within the informal sector and in the urban areas for urban waste management) are important. Supporting SSA countries to develop and put in place enabling framework conditions is not really a matter of research and innovation, but it is an important topic, for which continued cooperation (and support via appropriate channels, e.g. DEVCO, bilateral cooperation) is required. Furthermore, policy makers in the region (including those from the African Union Commission) have pointed to the importance of research in the preparation of policies \u2013 often referred to as evidence- based policies. Thus, research can contribute substantially to framework conditions by its ability to put in place a basis for sound, effective and efficient policies. 4.2.3 Research & Innovation actions A wide range of Research & Innovation actions have been identified, focusing on the improvement of existing RE technologies, the assessment of the resource potential and the assessment of impacts of RE deployment in the SSA region. Much scope exists for the improvement of existing RE technologies in the field of biomass . In wood agro-industry residues, sugar cane varieties and breeding programmes are needed to improve efficiency, e.g. through densification and torrefaction. Research is also needed on high- value use of by-products for biofuels and bio-digesters (waste biogas). Launching a Research and Innovation programme could help to address the barriers to a wider use of solid biofuels and dissemination of thermo chemical conversion from agro-industrial wastes. Such a programme could focus on the following fields: \uf0b7 Mapping of wood-forestry and agro-industrial residues; assessment of available resources; \uf0b7 Prospective studies of large plantations especially those which can replace coal in mix co- generation; \uf0b7 Combination of different fuels (agro wastes and /or coals) to maximise base power generation); \uf0b7 Fuel handling improvement and transport cost reduction; ",
        "118 \uf0b7 Densification and binding: pellets, briquetting; adaptation of imported technologies to African by-products, residues and wastes; \uf0b7 Study of equitable feed-in tariffs for solid biofuels power plants; \uf0b7 Selection of technologies adapted to the residues, flexibility of fuels and easy maintenance at a large scale for grid connection or for decentralized electrification; \uf0b7 High-Pressure steam technology; gasifiers; \uf0b7 Innovative Revenue-Sharing Mechanisms between farmers, millers and utilities; \uf0b7 Innovative financing schemes. Concentrated solar power (CSP) is another area where a range of technologies require further work and where cooperation between EU and Africa (notably South Africa, Stellenbosch University) can be envisaged. Areas of collaboration could involve the following fields: \uf0b7 CSP system concepts, development & analysis; \uf0b7 Thermal energy storage; \uf0b7 Condenser cooling (wet, dry & hybrid); \uf0b7 Heliostat and overall collector R&D; \uf0b7 Linear Fresnel collector R&D; \uf0b7 Sterling dish R&D; \uf0b7 Solar resource assessments, measurements & GIS mapping; \uf0b7 Small CSP plants for Africa. The most important angle for research appears to come from the assessment of resource potential , where the existing knowledge about the importance and precise location of RE resources is limited or fragmented. For example in biomass, there is a need for the assessment of available resources including sugarcane. For biofuels, studies are needed on land right issues related to the acquisition of large amounts of land. In wind, a need for databases of wind speeds including the installation of wind gauges is recorded. Such data would help to identify the most suitable locations in a given country and provide invaluable information for policy makers as well as investors. Moreover, the longer term result of such a database could contribute to the creation of wind atlases for their region similar to the WASA project in South Africa 162 . Equally in geothermal, there is a need for resources identification and capacities analysis of wells, gas and steam extracted. This assessment of resource potential not only regards the current situation, but especially so in the future \u2013 in light of climate change and evolving and increasingly extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. What will be the impact of climate change on the potential of hydro power, especially so for small scale solutions with limited storage potential? And what will be the impact on solar thermal, where the integration of climate databases in modelling and design tools is called for? By the same token, wind and power production forecasts. Such resource mapping is currently already taking place, e.g. by JRC 163 or by the REMEA Action 164 . However the scale of these needs is very large in terms of scope and much more can be done in this domain. More effective and efficient resource mapping activities can potentially be developed. Data collection in remote areas is challenging, providing opportunities for innovative data collection methods. These methods can be based on the high penetration of mobile phones, for example through community or crowd involvement. Other activities can also benefit from this, e.g. improving operation and maintenance efficiency using remote monitoring techniques. 162 The WASA is financially supported by the Royal Danish Embassy (RDE) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) through the South African Wind Energy Project (SAWEP). See http://www.wasaproject.info 163 JRC (2013) \u201cThe availability of renewable energies in a changing Africa: assessing climate and non-climate effects\u201d 164 Renewable Energy Mapping and Monitoring in Europe and Africa http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/remea/about-remea-action ",
        "119 A third area of research collaboration consists of the assessment of impacts of renewable energy on communities, ecosystems, water runs, etc. As the previous chapter has demonstrated, the knowledge about such impacts (both positive and adverse) is still partial, and much depends on the way in which RE is implemented. As already stated above, a strong interest in local universities exists in building knowledge and competencies about such impacts \u2013 in an attempt to make right choices and to opt for technologies that are best suited to local needs. In biomass in particular, independent research on social and environmental impacts of biofuels as well as local economic impacts are called for. In ocean energy, research into environment impacts on sites is required \u2013 for both wave and tidal. Another research theme is the assessment of development impacts of electrification of local communities through RE. An investigation of RE impacts on grids is another research topic. In the area of large-scale hydro , non-technological research needs specifically concern tackling complex institutional, financial and impact barriers. 4.2.4 Innovation Actions Innovative actions aim to produce plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services. In the context of the SSA region, the focus lies on the alteration or modification of products and processes \u2013 and to adjust them to the specific contexts. Therefore, virtually all RETs require such actions. Three types of Innovation actions can be distinguished: 1) Adaptation of existing designs or products; 2) Testing, demonstration and upscaling projects; and 3) Enablers. Adaptation of existing designs or products can be needed in general or for the specific SSA environment. Some RET technologies still require further improvement in design irrespective of the SSA environment. In large-scale hydro , IRENA 165 has assessed needs to improve variable-speed generation technology, tunnelling techniques, river basin management, hydro-kinetics, silt erosion, environmental issues. In CSP, there is still much room for optimising plants. And in ocean energy there is a need for testing effectiveness of devices. Indeed, such improvements would benefit the SSA region, but also other regions. But many other adaptations are required which are specific to the SSA context. This is particularly important in biomass , as fuel and food crops growing in the SSA region are different from those growing in other regions. For example, there is need to adapt imported technologies for wood agro- industry residues to locally available by-products. In the area of waste biogas, a need is also discerned to adapt waste micro-digesters and bio-landfills to SSA basic usages. In mini-grids , there is need for the design of simple and smart power consumption limiters, that provide security to the operator and smooth consumption limitations for the user. In medium-volt grids, there is a need for integration of SWER technology \u2013 which balances alternators other than the 3 phase alternators. In wind , there is a need to promote the use and adaptability of small scale wind turbines (less than 15 diameters and below 50KW output). These turbines are more easily transported and can be integrated into a hybrid mixing it with solar energy or diesel. Also worth promoting are remote fiber optic load monitoring which can be particularly useful for managing wind farms in remote locations where site visits for maintenance checks are expensive. 165 http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf ",
        "120 Testing, demonstration and upscaling projects are asked for in several RETs. In the area of PV, batteries used in rural mini-grids in Africa (lead-acid batteries) are not the best solution in terms of technical performance and flexibility. The lead-acid technology suffers from reduced capacity at higher temperature and high sensitivity to deep cycling, while lithium-ion batteries are still too costly. Therefore, RE mini-grids backed up by Li-on batters and LiFePO4 batteries could be a solution \u2013 but these would need to be tested. With regard to enablers, specific equipment for drilling/exploration in remote areas without transport infrastructure is needed for geothermal energy \u2013 and there are opportunities by combining this with the equipment needed for water drilling. In order to take advantage of mini-grids, there is need for the introduction of prepaid options into smart metering. Such meters would allow rural customers to manage their consumption, for example through mobile payment options. 4.2.5 Private sector cooperation Private sector cooperation is focusing on areas for joint EU-Africa business interests. Although such cooperation is already developing, there can be good reasons to foster such cooperation \u2013 in light of broader socio-economic benefits which are broader than the businesses involved. Broadly two areas of cooperation can be distinguished: 1) Project preparation and 2) Adjustment of business models. Project preparation can be particularly burdensome as risks for business ventures in the SSA region tend to be higher than in other regions, thus requiring careful analysis. Feasibility studies are therefore often needed, for example in the area of biofuels. Especially for small scale projects it can be difficult to prepare and develop projects, in terms of feasibility studies as well as access to finance. Research on effective means of bundling smaller projects can potentially address this. Business incubation centres show potential, in this respect, of which the Kenyan Climate Innovation Centre 166 can be taken as an example. However more attention is required for adjustment of business models. For remote areas, a recurrent issue is the necessity of creating sustainable distribution and retail channels. More specifically, in grids, there is a need to develop innovative RE business models that cover higher upfront costs and (increased) payment risks. In the case of small scale RET\u2019s, socio-economic research can address potential cultural barriers for domestic RE product acceptance. In solar, innovation in business approaches for small PV systems as well as financing models are needed \u2013 e.g. the above-mentioned focus on pre-payment systems or a micro-franchise model, stimulating after-sales support. In small-scale hydro, there is a need for development of new business models for distribution and payment collection and focussed on anchor clients. New joint ventures are needed between business and research bodies to design tailor-made waste management systems. In the area of traditional fuels, a need is considered to change the value chain of charcoal supply in order to constitute independent producers\u2019 associations. 4.2.6 Coordination & support actions Coordination and support actions include standardisation, dissemination, policy dialogues, etc. These actions can be expected to be vital to prevent fragmentation and to promote that good practices are shared across the SSA region and beyond. Coordination and support actions can be distinguished as follows: 1) Ad hoc actions; 2) Platforms and networks; and 3) Institutions. 166 http://www.kenyacic.org/ ",
        "121 Ad hoc actions include the implementation of cook stove programmes (traditional fuel), the sharing of best cultivation practices in biofuels and the sharing of information on maintenance of wind turbines. Platforms and networks allow for more structured and longer term exchange. Various such coordination and support actions are suggested, most concretely the establishment of a development platform for biofuels. Establishing institutions is the most structured approach to coordination and support. Support of testing centres for industry-digesters (waste biogas) is one such suggestion. Suggested is also the creation of an African (or regional) research centre dedicated to pico-micro hydro which takes into consideration the peculiarity of the African context: remoteness of the villages from the grid, water intake, season, difficult geographical locations. This Centre could evaluate existing technologies and quality standards of small scale hydro technology and act as the catalyst of a micro- pico- hydro industry and market for example for pico-hydro turbines. This could be done for example in collaboration with similar European centres. In order to promote improved cookstoves, it is suggested that the best listed African centre should be enforced. Furthermore, a model could be to set up at SSA-level a research centre like the APROVECHO one operating a state-of-the-art laboratory dedicated to testing stoves. The aim would be to make available to projects testing and reports on fuel use, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and greenhouse gas emissions from a variety of improved cook stoves. Later this could be developed in a real innovation centre leading and federating the national and regional centres. The aim would be to allow the appropriation by Africa of the most advanced testing of gasifier stove in order to fit with local conditions. For the time being no research centre in SSA seems to have the resources (human and economic) to master such process. In exploring such dedicated institutions it is essential to take into account the existing and yet to be launched Regional Renewable Energy Centres and their programmes (EACREEE and the yet to be established ECREEE and SACREEE). A concrete suggestion for SACREEE would be to disseminate RE IPP and PPA policy from South Africa to the SSA region. 4.2.7 Competency development Competency development is a broad area of cooperation, and some actions have been formulated in broad terms only. For example, a need is established for sustainable capacity building for local and national authorities/ local companies/banks ( micro and pico hydro ). Furthermore, there is a shortage of basic skill development of local staff regarding system design, maintenance and market design. Usually hydro engineers trained tend to leave remote areas to work on larger hydro projects. Therefore, there is a need to train local population with basic hydro skills. Equally for geothermal, training professionals for power production and equipment maintenance (including heat pumps) is required. In Solar thermal, EU-SSA transfer of competencies and technology is called for. More specific forms of competency development are 1) Mobility support and 2) Curriculum development. Mobility support is a logical response to shortage of capacities and competencies. It aims to promote the exchange of researchers and students for raining and career development, including that through the well-known Marie Sklodowska-Curie and Erasmus Mundus actions. Nevertheless, only few RET-specific initiatives are suggested. A concrete example is the suggestion for an ",

        "130 4.3 Conclusions Overview R&I capacities While many SSA countries share similar characteristics and face similar challenges, there are also wide disparities, South Africa being most advanced. Although carried out in several places, basic research in renewable energy is rather rare in the SSA region \u2013 and most activities focus on technology conversion and \u201cfrugal\u201d innovation. A large part of R&I activities revolves around domestic and rural energy needs (e.g. off-grid electrification, efficient cooking, efficient lighting). Offering low-tech, low-costs solutions to poor and remote communities is crucial. Due to the focus on the adaptation of RE technologies to the local capacities and needs, the outreach of most SSA- based R&I activities remains limited to a local audience. However, Africa is also characterised by its dynamics of change. While enrolment in tertiary education in SSA is dramatically lower than in any other part of the world, it also has the fastest growth rate. And if the number of players actively involved in RE remains small, with energy now recognised as a major instrument for economic development, several universities and research centres were created in recent years. All these changes will undoubtedly contribute to dramatically improve R&I capacities in SSA in the coming years. The main focus of existing R&I players is energy access in view of improving living conditions . Hence, most activities revolve around domestic energies, small-scale applications and biomass management. A lot is done to adapt existing technologies to local materials, to local markets, according to the principles of \u201cfrugal innovation\u201d. Many SSA players have the required capacity to work on high impact, high visibility research projects in these fields; cooperation with European research institutions is already in place. Apart from the development of adapted technologies itself, cross-cutting issues like socio-economic factors and means to foster experience capitalisation and knowledge sharing would require attention. Academic research suffers from lack of public funding . While partnerships with the private sector are developing, some researchers in our survey reported using their own funds to finance their research in RE. This may sound surprising as multilateral and bilateral donors are highly active in Africa, even more so now with the SE4ALL initiative and the US Power for Africa scheme. However financing is mostly devoted to field activities, it rarely goes to academic research. Indeed, the outreach of most R&I activities conducted in SSA is very limited : few publications and few patents applications. African researchers and inventors lack visibility at the global level. African scientists and researchers are not well represented in the international arena with few publications, few patent applications, only little participation in international conferences. The legal protection of patents is limited across the SSA region as well, and its enforcement is problematic. It seems sometimes that, due to lack of efficient capitalisation and dissemination mechanisms, the wheel keeps being reinvented over and over. However, the structures that could help improving the visibility are already in place: namely, international cooperation networks and Africa-based scientific journals. Scientific publication is key for African scientists to (1) improve knowledge capitalisation and (2) start existing in the international arena. We have identified a couple of relevant publications, e.g. Nigerian Journal of Solar Energy (published by SESN), Tanzania Journal of Engineering and Technology (published by UDSM), etc; but their impact factor is awfully limited (actually, nobody seem to even bother to calculate their impact factor). Clearly, these journals could benefit from external support. ",
        "131 R&I needs The overview of RET-specific needs (including grids-related R&I needs) confirms the overall importance of applied research, demonstration and testing (including plans for new or improved products, processes or services) rather than basic research. Technology conversion and frugal innovation are the key words here. These actions should however be developed together with private sector players, who need to invest in the development of business models that are adapted to the SSA needs. Among transversal needs, access to resource mapping is key, and there is a strong interest in learning about the impacts of renewable energy technology \u2013 thus confirming the commitment to R&I actors to contribute to the improvement of living conditions. There is as well a strong need for quality assurance for RET products , and this calls for increased testing and labelling capacities in SSA. There appears ample scope for mobility initiatives , however these need to be carefully positioned within the broader brain drain forces that are exerted over the region. Within this context it would be worthwhile to explore how the role of South Africa as a knowledge hub can be exploited \u2013 e.g. cooperation programmes which would include EU actors, South African actors and other SSA actors \u2013 thus producing mobility solutions that could be more effective than mainstream solutions. The need for increased access to electricity in rural and remote areas is calling for innovative technical solutions (e.g. minigrids, mobile banking) as well as non-technical innovations (new business models). In this sense a specific support to innovative African and European SMEs developing new solutions for rural areas seems to be relevant. This chapter has confirmed once more the importance to frame all of the above actions within the framework conditions; they need to take into account the investment climate, the policy framework as well as basic respect to rule of law including recognition of intellectual property rights.

Not yet established x x Detailed fact sheets on the main regional cooperation initiatives in the field of renewable energy are provided in Annex 5 of the Annex Report. Here follows a synthesis analysis of the main features of these initiatives, and of possible cooperation opportunities on R&I for fostering renewable energy deployment. Several regional organisations exist in the field of renewable energy in the SSA region. A close investigation of these regional organisations reveals that the level of cooperation on RE-related topics differs significantly among them. While some organisations limit their cooperation efforts to a specific renewable energy source that is abundant in a particular region, others pursue a larger scope of cooperation with a strong effort at policy level. It is also to be noted that some geographical regions are more advanced in terms of regional integration and cooperation in the energy sector: \uf0b7 In Western Africa , the regional cooperation regarding RE has focused on the institutional aspects (Creation of a regional centre for renewable energy (ECREEE), a regional renewable energy policy (EREP) under the ECOWAS and the Regional Initiative for renewable energies IRED under the UEMOA) and on the development of a portfolio of hydroelectricity projects within the WAPP and collaborative arrangements regarding the Senegal River and Gambia River basins. The objective of the ECOWAS area is to achieve an energy mix which has about half of fossil energy and half renewables (mainly hydropower, while solar energy remains marginal). The region is also committed in the fight against desertification and drought. There are programmes in the areas of water resource management and forestry (PREDAS programme within CILSS); \uf0b7 The regional cooperation in Central Africa does not focus on the development of renewable energy despite existing resources other than hydropower (e.g. biomass from forestry and agriculture). The management of transboundary waters and hydroelectricity developments remain the main cooperation themes. The creation of the Central African Power Pool took place more recently than the pool in West Africa. There are projects emerging within the CAPP, but actual regional infrastructure implementations are limited; \uf0b7 Similarly to Central Africa region, Eastern Africa cooperation in the field of renewable energy focuses on the management of the hydropower resources which are abundant in the region (EGL, NELSAP). The variety of political organisations cooperating in the field of energy (EAC, COMESA, IGAD, IOC) shows the lack of a comprehensive and harmonised institutional framework for the development of renewable energy. The creation of the Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (EACREEE) is in the pipeline within the Eastern African Community since March 2013. It was formally approved by the Ministers of Energy on 21 April 2014, Nairobi, Kenya. The center was expected to be operational by end of 2014. The IOC is currently creating a specific common framework for the development of renewable energy; ",
        "136 \uf0b7 Within Southern Africa region, only Mauritius and South Africa have developed comprehensive strategies and action plans for renewable energy; at present, there is no region-wide regulatory framework that specifically addresses renewable energy. In conjunction with Member States, the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), and the Regional Electricity Regulators Association, SADC intends to harmonise cross-border policies and regulations for renewable energy in the region in the coming years, establishing a coherent framework that will foster development of this important sector. It aims to do so by creating the Southern African Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE). SADC Ministers for Energy were expected to adopt a final decision on the Centre in spring/summer 2014 at their next annual meeting, including a decision on the host country as well as the financial and in-kind contributions from both the hosts and other SADC members. However such a decision has not taken place to date, and funding gaps appear to be at the core of 5.2 Assessing selected types of regional cooperation 5.2.1 Organisations for the development of large energy infrastructures These organisations have no specific mandate for renewable energy but a strong focus on the construction of large hydropower plants. Main example: Power pools, APUA, NEPAD. In Africa, the African Union Commission (AUC), the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and Power Pools (PP) have been the main institutions involved in energy policy making and planning since the first institution - the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) - was established in the mid-1990s. Each of the four main economic regions of Sub-Saharan Africa has its own regional economic community and Power pool: West, Central, East, and South. The basic role of the regional economic communities (RECs) in the energy sector is to promote cooperation between member states in order to develop integrated and cost effective energy infrastructure in support of regional economic development. The four regional power pools in Sub-Saharan Africa are the \u2018technical\u2019 organs of the RECs. They have primary responsibility for coordinating, harmonizing, and enforcing the operational rules and standards needed to achieve the goal of regional cooperation in energy 167 . However, the Power pools do not have a mandate for renewable energy per se and their contribution is mainly centred on the development of large hydropower plants. New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) The NEPAD is an African Union strategic framework for pan-African socio-economic development. Although its specific target is the development of regional and continental generation capacities through hydropower, one of its theme areas is the \u201cResearch and Development - Science and Technology\u201d. In this field, the NEPAD works to increase innovation, encourage partnerships, facilitate knowledge sharing and improve the volume and quality of research and development. In particular, the Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action (CPA) include a number of programmes and projects grouped into two core areas: (i) research and development in the fields of energy, water and desertification, in particular activities of the West African and South African Water Centres of Excellence and (ii) mechanisms to improve policy and promote technological innovation through the improvement of regional co-operation in science and technology and the promotion of the creation of technology parks. Association of Power Utilities of Africa (APUA) The Association of Power Utilities of Africa (APUA) was created with the purpose of promoting development and integration of the African power systems through the interconnection of networks, the exchanges of experiences and know-how as well as the pooling of energy resources in a win- 167 ACP Development Report, June 2013 ",
        "137 win approach for all members. Although till 2012 APUA did not have activities in the field of Renewable Energy and Renewable Energy Technologies and no collaboration activities in this field have been announced so far, such activities are part of the 2012-2014 Action Plan. Thus the General secretariat is now building a network through its participation in international and regional meetings (\u201cSustainable energy solutions in Africa: energy efficiency, renewable energy and interconnection\u201d Workshop WEC/ AUE and APUA; 2IE meeting Burkina-Faso; \"22th World Energy congress\", etc.). South African Power Pool (SAPP) The Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) was created with the primary aim to provide reliable and economical electricity supply to the consumers of each of the SAPP members, consistent with the reasonable utilisation of natural resources and the effect on the environment. SAPP is a cooperation of the national electricity companies in Southern Africa under the auspices of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The members of SAPP have created a common power grid between their countries and a common market for electricity in the SADC region. SAPP was founded in 1995. SAPP Members combined have an electricity production capacity of 315 billion kWh, of which by far the majority (76 %) comes from Eskom in South Africa, followed by Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (9 %) and Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique (5 %).

A number of regional organisations have been created around the management of renewable energy sources in particular around important rivers with huge hydropower potential such as the OMVS, the OMVG, and the Energie des Grands Lacs (EGL). Another example is the CILSS initiative which covers 7 of the ECOWAS countries (Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and the Gambia) and focuses on woody biomass, sustainable management of forest and wooded lands and sustainable use of wood-fuel, including substitution strategies (LPG and kerosene). ",
        "138 In East Africa, the main regional cooperation activities on geothermal resource are channelized through the African Rift Geothermal Development facility project (ARGeo) supported by the UNEP and the GEF. Several institutes and universities are currently working on water issues and in particular on the issue of sustainable management of water resources within the networks of excellence centres. Some of these institutions lead research activities and training linked to RET (e.g. 2iE in Burkina Faso or Kwame Nkrumah University for Science and Technology in Ghana). 5.2.3 Organisations within existing regional political structures These organisations are related to the economic and monetary unions ex. ECOWAS, UEMOA, SADC, etc.) with the aim of creating a regional policy framework for development of renewable energy. The challenges of energy security, dependency on fossil fuels, affordable power supply, climate change and deforestation that African countries are facing, call for the adoption of common regional energy policies that can successfully ensure increased access to energy services in a sustainable way. Three regional organisations, including the Economic Commission of West African States (ECOWAS/CEDEAO), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Eastern African Community (EAC) have engaged respectively in a common regional energy policy in order to meet this objective. While the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) is in place since 2010 and seems to be at an already advanced stage in its programme implementation including in the field of R&I activities, the other two regional centres for the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency are still at an early stage. The SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE) is still not operational at the time of writing, while the EAC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (EACREEE) was formally approved by the Ministers of Energy on 21 April 2014, in Nairobi, Kenya. Although this Centre was expected to be operational by end of 2014, it does not look to be operational at the moment yet. Therefore at the time of the writing of this report only the ECREEE could become a potential framework for the development of R&I activities. Contacts with the ECREEE have been developed during the implementation of this studies and the Centre has been involved in the organisation of the regional workshop for Western Africa in Ouagadougou and participated to the final workshop in Brussels. The ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) The ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) has adopted its renewable energy policy, EREP, in 2012. In its implementation plan, capacity development in the field of renewable energy is one of the main pillars of activities to be implemented. Some of them have already or are being implemented. These activities are: \uf0b7 A regional capacity needs assessment in cooperation with three local universities (2iE from Burkina Faso, KNUST from Ghana, UNICV from Cape Verde) in order to design a comprehensive multi-year ECOWAS Regional Capacity Building Programme on different RE&EE aspects and for various target groups; \uf0b7 The promotion of regional sustainable energy research programs and establishment of academic exchange programs ; for example ECREEE, UNIDO, Columbia University and University of Cape Verde (UniCV) are implementing an e-learning programme on Sustainable Energy Solutions for 10 young West African energy experts for the ECOWAS; ",
        "139 \uf0b7 The promotion of south-south and north-south knowledge transfer and fundraising for capacity building activities for which different training activities were developed in collaboration with Indian institutions (TERI, SELCO) and European / International institutions (ITC, RENAC, IRENA, WB, NARUC, etc). The long term capacity building programme will identify future collaborations to promote knowledge transfer. SADC and SACREEE The main objectives of SADC is to achieve development, peace and security, and economic growth, to alleviate poverty, enhance the standard and quality of life of the peoples of Southern Africa, and support the socially disadvantaged through regional integration, built on democratic principles and equitable and sustainable development. SADC has 15 member states: Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. As energy is a chief component of infrastructure development, the Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan released in 2012 outlines SADC\u2019s intentions for energy over the next 25 years, which involves a strong renewable energy component. The Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan and its Energy Sector Plan advises that SADC Member States capitalise on the renewable energy opportunities available in Southern Africa, investing in infrastructure that allows the sector to compete with already-established fossil fuels. A useful opportunity identified for cooperation is working with IRENA which has offered to support SADC in the elaboration of methodology for assessing solar and wind potential. In addition, SADC has started or is starting cooperation with EEP programme, FAO, USAID, ECOWAS and its ECREEE facility. As part of SADC\u2019s overall efforts, it is proposed to establish the SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE). The proposed centre would, among other things, spearhead the promotion of renewable energy development in the region. Energy experts in the region endorsed the proposed centre at a meeting held in October 2013 in Gaborone, Botswana and organised by the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), which coordinates the planning, generation and transmission of electricity on behalf of member state utilities in SADC. At the Gaborone validation workshop, it was agreed that the centre should be an independent SADC institution that should be owned and supported by SADC member states for sustainability purposes. Such a development would give the centre more authority to spearhead efforts to increase the uptake of renewable energy sources in the region. SADC Ministers for Energy were expected to adopt a final decision on the Centre in spring/summer 2014 at their next annual meeting, including a decision on the host country as well as the financial and in-kind contributions from both the hosts and other SADC members. However, at the time of writing such decision has not yet taken place and funding gaps as well as pending decisions on the choice of location for the centre appear to be at the root of the limited progress in recent months. 168 168 Source: EUEI PDF Energy for Development, http://www.euei-pdf.org/regional-studies/centre-for-renewable-energy-and- energy-efficiency-sacreee ",
        "140 5.3 Conclusions: impact on research and research capacity Clearly, both cooperation in renewable energy and in research can provide major benefits, as they allow the increased efficiency of resources, increased specialisation, and higher effectiveness in terms of impacts and visibility. Furthermore, such cooperation helps to reduce access to state-of- the-art knowledge and publications. Across the SSA region, various regional cooperation initiatives exist, and some are more effective and advanced than others. There are strong differences in institutional set-up between the sub- regions and it is important to take note of this variation. We consider the following regional cooperation networks as most influential with regard to future research orientation and capacity. Across the SSA region, the African Union in general and the AU strategic framework for pan- African socio-economic development (NEPAD) is considered increasingly important. In addition to political union objectives, the African Union has only recently taken the steps to promote an economic union, and its role is expected to increase also in orchestrating science and research. Its recognition by the EU makes it also an important institution, as exemplified by its role in the implementation of the RECP programme. The primary focus of the NEPAD cooperation framework is the development of regional and continental generation capacities through hydropower. It does not have particular objectives in the area of renewable energy, however it does aim to advance the development of the continent by promoting research in all fields, in particular in science and technology. Iit remains to be seen whether the African Union Commission and its related bodies will have the resources to play this role in the domain of renewable energy \u2013 given the sheer size of the continent and the large number of over 50 members. 169 Association of Power Utilities of Africa (APUA) has a General secretariat which is now building a network through its participation in international and regional meetings (\u201cSustainable energy solutions in Africa: energy efficiency, renewable energy and interconnection\u201d Workshop WEC/ AUE and APUA; 2IE meeting Burkina-Faso; \"22th World Energy congress\", etc.). Promising are also the Regional Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Centres , Currently, only the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) is fully operational and its impact is clearly growing in Western Africa, e.g. through programme implementation including in the field of R&I activities. For example, within the context of this project, the ECREEE was highly involved in the organisation of the regional workshop for Western Africa in Ouagadougou and also participated to the final workshop in Brussels. Therefore at the time of the writing of this report only the ECREEE could become a potential framework for the development of R&I activities. As stated above, the other two regional centres for the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency (EACREEE and SACREEE) are still at an early stage and it is too early to tell whether they will take a similar course as ECREEE. Across the continent, academics and researchers have expressed the important to evolve to closer cooperation in the field of renewable energy through setting up networks of excellence. For example the University of Stellenbosch is promoting such ways of working across the continent, which would include a recognition of each other\u2019s competencies and strengths, coordination of research agendas, and increased mobility. For example, several institutes and universities are currently working on water issues and in particular on the issue of sustainable management of water resources within the networks of excellence centres. Some of these institutions lead research activities and training linked to RET (e.g. 2IE in Burkina Faso or Kwame Nkrumah University for 169 http://www.au.int/en/about/nutshell ",
        "141 Science and Technology in Ghana). However establishing such stable networks has not proved easy. The following challenges can be noted: 1) Bridging the variety in terms of research capacities, as size differences are major; 2) Bringing continuity to these networks \u2013 as they tend to be funded on a project basis (including that provided by the EU); 3) A need for local ownership, rather than responding to international initiatives; 4) Lack of funding, especially when concerning larger-scale research and demonstration projects. As an example the AFRETEP initiative (African Renewable Energy Technology Platform) initiated by the JRC is potentially powerful, however it has not yet been recognised and In areas where above networks and initiatives leave gaps, Regional Power Pools can provide a role in the coordination of renewable energy development \u2013 especially on grid-related issues and in the context of large-scale hydropower. The South African Powerpool is particularly important in this respect. However these Power Pools are not expected to play any major role in building up research agendas and capacities. ",

        "143 6 Existing international cooperation networks The terms of Reference require the preparation of \u201c task reports on the cooperation in the area of RES and/or research between Africa and the following key international partners: 1) European Union; 2) Member States of the European Union; 3) USA; 4) Japan; and 5) Brazil, Russia, India, China \u201d. This chapter starts with a review of cooperation between SSA and the European Union. More specifically, EU-SSA scientific cooperation in renewable energy (6.1), EDF-funded scientific cooperation (6.2), EuropeAid Energy cooperation programmes (6.3) and bilateral cooperation with EU Member States (6.4). Cooperation of SSA with non-European actors is discussed under (6.5) Cooperation with other countries and (6.6) Cooperation with international organisations. 6.1 EU-SSA scientific cooperation: DG R&I This review focuses on the operational aspects of past EU-funded calls for proposals and their buy- in by the Sub-Saharan African scientific community, with a focus on renewable energy (RE). A review of JRC\u2019s RE-in-Africa activities with emphasis on EU-Africa cooperation is also provided, as well as a list of EU-funded initiatives that aim at fostering EU-Africa scientific cooperation. Lessons to be learnt from past DGR&I funded projects have been expressed in a separate note and partly taken over in chapter 8. 6.1.1 FP7 instruments The overall buy-in of FP7 by African scientists is rather high, in particular thanks to the FP7- AFRICA call held in 2010. However participation in the Marie Sklodowska-Curie mobility programme is low. Participation varies widely across the continent, with South Africa clearly taking the lead. Major themes for EU-SSA cooperation under FP7 were health, agriculture, food security, environment; only a handful of projects on renewable energy did receive funding. Overall African participation in FP7 In total, 770 Sub-Saharan African participations are recorded under FP7. As a comparison, there were 650 participations from Latin America, 280 from China, 1030 from Turkey. 38 Sub-Saharan African countries participated. However in most cases project leadership rested with the European partners.

The success rate of South African applications is also rather high (27% over the period 2007-2012).The existence of an EU-South Africa S&T agreement may be one of the reasons behind this high level of participation, as well as the support measures put in place by South Africa, such as a well-developed NCP structure and pre-project seed-funding. It must be noted that under FP7, renewable energy was a very minor topic for EU-Africa cooperation. Only a handful of projects are recorded in CORDIS under the \u201cRenewable Sources of Energy\u201d subject, several of which are only loosely related to RE (see details in Annex 3).

FP7-AFRICA-2010, also known as the Coordinated Call For Africa, had a global budget of \u20ac72 million (of which \u20ac34 million went to the African participants) covering three themes: Health, Food, Environment (RE wasn\u2019t included). The specifics of this call were: \uf0b7 Most topics focused on African issues; \uf0b7 Participation of Africa based institutions was mandatory. A number of 173 eligible proposals were received, out of which 94 (54%) passed evaluation threshold. 24 of these eventually were proposed for funding, i.e. 15% of eligible proposals. The success rate is hence rather lower than the average FP7 (19%). Applications mostly came from: \uf0b7 In Africa: South Africa (19 participants), Nigeria (17), Burkina Faso (11), Tanzania (11), Kenya (10), Ethiopia (10), Uganda (10); \uf0b7 In the EU: United Kingdom (28), France (10), Germany (8), Spain (7), Sweden (7). Marie Sklodowska-Curie in Africa 2007-2014 This FP7 specific programme funds worldwide and cross-sector researcher mobility, covering all stages of a researcher's career, from PhD candidates to highly experienced researchers. Over the period from 2007 to 2014, 662 Sub-Saharan African researchers from 27 countries benefitted from ",
        "145 Marie Sklodowska-Curie grants. This is relatively low: as a comparison, there were 1500 researchers from India, 320 from Morocco, 720 from Argentina to benefit from similar grants. As no sector-wise statistics are available, the take-up of Marie Sklodowska-Curie by RE researchers is not known. Table 6.3 Top ten Sub-Saharan countries in Marie Sklodowska-Curie (across all themes) Country Number of researchers South Africa 458 Ethiopia 31 Cameroon 26 Kenya 19 Ghana 15 Mauritius 10 Zimbabwe 10 Cote d'Ivoire 9 Uganda 9 COST COST provides financial support for cooperation efforts. The support covers the costs of networking activities such as meetings (e.g. travel, subsistence, local organiser support), conferences, workshops, short-term scientific exchanges, training schools, publications and dissemination activities. COST does not fund the research itself. COST had a total budget of \u20ac 250 million under FP7. Apart from South Africa, with which there is a reciprocal agreement, SSA\u2019s involvement in COST is very low. Though COST is opening up to more international cooperation, Africa is not particularly targeted 170 . Neither is renewable energy: out of the 300+ COST Actions over the period 2010-2014 only a dozen were more or less related to RE; only two clearly focused on RE 171 . 6.1.2 FP7-funded cooperation projects FP7 funded several projects aiming at improving EU-SSA cooperation, some of which now continue under H2020. Renewable energy was not a major topic for these projects (to the exception of ERAfrica) hence the impact on cooperation in RE remains very limited. ERAfrica As an FP7-funded project, ERAfrica\u2019s objective was to pool European and African funds to finance joint research endeavours. It resulted in a \u20ac11 million call launched in 2013 172 , funded by 15 countries (1/3 of funds from Africa, 2/3 from Europe) covering the following areas: Renewable Energies, Interfacing Challenges (key societal challenges where African and European collaboration has value addition), and New Ideas (originality and novelty of the idea, approach or expected outputs). Out of 106 eligible proposals, 17 projects were selected to be funded, involving 65 institutions from 18 countries. The result of the call showed an extremely well balanced participation, with about half of the proposals coordinated by an African institution and the other half by European institutions \u2013 whereas in FP7 calls, the overwhelming majority of proposals are led by European institutions. The ERAfrica consortium members and funding parties expressed in late 2014 their strong interest in pursuing their cooperation. Although implementation modalities remain to be fixed, it is likely that the ERAfrica experience will continue in the coming years. 170 Source: COST 135/14 DECISION, Subject: B.3. \u201cCOST International Cooperation and Specific Organisations Participation\u201d 171 Rapid assessment based on the list of COST Approve Actions.

        "146 In spite of its overall achievements and in spite of the high interest shown by African partners for RE during the ERAfrica call preparation phase, only 14 proposals were received on this theme. The quality of RE proposals was lower than for other fields; only 2 of them were eventually selected for funding.

It could also show that mutual ground between European and African research on RE is hard to find. Indeed, the call was rather demanding in terms of co-financing so only proposals that raised interest both in Europe and in Africa could receive funding: as noted in the call evaluation report, \u201c this thematic area [raised] high interest from African countries [but from a] smaller number of European countries \u201d. CAAST-Net Plus FP7-funded CAAST-Net Plus (2013-2016) continues the work of CAAST-Net (2008-2012). It is implemented by a consortium of 25 national science partners, half of them African and half European. One of its goals is to increase in the quality and quantity of scientific cooperation between Europe and Africa through greater use of instruments under FP7 and now H2020. It does so by organizing information sessions in several SSA countries, disseminating information through its website, newsletter and Facebook, coordinating with other key stakeholders. An important CAAST-Net Plus activity is to enhance the national NCP networks across SSA. RE is not among the priorities of CAAST-Net Plus (these priorities being Climate Change, Food Security and Health). National Contact Points The network of National Contact Points (NCPs) provides practical information and assistance on all aspects of participation in FP7 and Horizon 2020. Initially, the network of FP7 National coordinators unevenly reached SSA: in 2010 there were 2 coordinators in South Africa, 1 in Kenya, but none in Tanzania, in Uganda and in many other SSA countries. The situation improved over time with in 2012 NCPs established in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda. While the list of SSA countries with one or several NCPs continues to grow under H2020 many countries are yet to appoint one. ESASTAP Plus FP7-funded ESASTAP Plus (2012-2015, successor of FP6 ESASTAP) supports the deepening of scientific and technological cooperation between South Africa and the EU. One of its main goals is to promote South Africa\u2019s participation in Horizon 2020. ESASTAP plays an important role in support to the NCP network: there are 18 NCPs in South Africa covering a wide range of scientific areas. PAERIP PAERIP (Promoting African \u2013 European Research Infrastructure Partnerships) was an FP7-funded project that ran from 2011 to 2013. PAERIP produced reports and organised events on several issues; it also set up an inventory of research infrastructure to help identifying potential ",
        "147 collaboration among RI on the two continents that could lead to partnerships. The inventory includes 11 Africa-based organizations active in Energy research. It identified several potential partnerships between these and European counterparts in Energy, but it does not seem to have led to concrete actions on the ground. 6.1.3 JRC\u2019s activities related to RE in Africa The Institute for Energy and Transport (IET) of the Joint Research Center (JRC) is involved since many years in research activities targeting RE in Africa. Although these activities are no scientific cooperation projects per se, they provided, and will continue to provide, numerous opportunities for European and African RE researchers to be in contact. REMEA REMEA was born from the 2013 merger of REMM (Renewable Energy Mapping and Monitoring) and RENAF (RENewable energies in AFrica). Its activities revolve around three themes: \uf0b7 Mapping renewable energy raw resources in Europe and Africa; \uf0b7 Monitoring renewable energy deployment in Europe and in Africa; \uf0b7 International scientific cooperation and networking. REMEA hosts the interactive tool RE2nAF (Renewable Energies for Rural Electrification of Africa), a GIS-based simulation tool for off-grid electricity production options in Africa. Under REMEA, there are of course numerous links between the JRC-IET and various African institutions and projects, in particular with the Strathmore University in Kenya (JRC-IET and Strathmore being Focal Points for Academia/Research under the Africa-EU Energy Partnership). The JRC-sponsored Technical Programme of the Africa PVSEC conference (South Africa, March 2014) was a good opportunity for EU-SSA scientific networking. REMEA collaborates with a range of partners, including IRENA and ECOWAS-ECREEE. However, REMEA is not a scientific cooperation programme in itself as it is implemented by a team comprising only of European researchers. AFRETEP The African Renewable Energy Technology Platform (AFRETEP) was the major international cooperation activity of the REMEA action. It built a network of African Research Institutions dealing with renewable energies and rural electrification. Three regional workshops on RE technologies, held in 2011-12, helped developing the network on the ground: with almost 100 participants, the workshops reached scientists from 30 African countries. Speakers came from Europe and from several African institutions like 2iE (Burkina Faso), KNUST (Ghana), CIFRES (Senegal), and University of Cape Town (South Africa). Currently, more than 850 institutions, associations and individuals are members of the network. But with the AFRETEP funding now having ended, the network is being migrated to the new DEVCO online collaboration platform, Capacity4Dev (Energy group). The JRC-IET team involved in AFRETEP will however retain some kind of ownership. 6.2 EDF-funded scientific cooperation RE was an important theme under several calls funded by the 10th EDF from 2009 to 2013: two African Union Research Grants calls and two ACP-EU Science and Technology calls. These calls recorded high levels of participation and resulted in 13 RE-in-SSA research projects receiving funds. The success rate, in the range of 5-10%, is significantly lower than for FP7 calls. ",
        "148 African Union Research Grants (AURG) This EU-funded initiative is managed by the Department of Human Resources, Science and Technology of the African Union Commission. Funds come from development aid budgets (10th EDF intra-ACP budget). Two calls were already conducted, of \u20ac7 million in 2011 and \u20ac7 million in 2012, covering: \uf0b7 Post-Harvest and Agriculture; \uf0b7 Renewable and sustainable energy; \uf0b7 Water and Sanitation. Advertisement about the calls was limited, with publication in the Economist and Jeune Afrique but no information workshops (except a small one in Addis Ababa, where the African Union is located). More than 100 applications related to RE were received in total for the two calls. International cooperation was mandatory, but the presence of European organizations in the consortium was not an obligation.

The overall quality of RE application was deemed to be rather high, with 41% of original applications passing the evaluation threshold. However due to budget constraints, only 6 RE projects could eventually receive funding (i.e. 5% of all applications, 13% of applications having passed the threshold): Table 6.6 RE projects funded by the African Union Research Grants Name of project Lead country Partner countries Mise au point de technologies de production et d\u2019utilisation durables de biocarburant de Jatropha curcas pour une r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9 rurale en Afrique de l\u2019Ouest Senegal Benin, Burkina Faso Potential of distributed grid-connected solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems in rural electrification in Africa Ghana Botswana, Germany Development of a cost-effective, modular and dry concentrating solar power for Africa: design and test of components Burkina Faso Ghana, Cape Verde, France Adaptation of small-scale biogas digesters for use in rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa Uganda Britain, Ethiopia, Scotland, Cameroon Vers une production durable et innovante de biocarburants en ad\u00e9quation avec les potentiels et les besoins de l\u2019Afrique : PRONOVABIO Burkina Faso France, Benin, Mali FOstering ReneWable and Sustainable Energy in Africa Egypt Tanzania, Ethiopia, Spain ",
        "149 through R&D Four more calls of \u20ac5 million each are planned over the next six years. RE could be part of the call topics. ACP-EU Cooperation Programme in Science and Technology Held in 2012-13, the 2nd call of the ACP-EU Cooperation Programme in Science and Technology had a budget of \u20ac21 million funded under EDF and the EU South Africa DCI. Renewable energy was a major theme along with Agriculture and food security. The call was widely advertised through several channels: mailing lists, websites, embassies and delegations, promotional events in several African and European countries. CAAST-Net and ESASTAP also passed on the information. The call organisers developed a Partner Search online tool, but its impact remained limited. Out of the 300 proposals received, 76 were in the field of Energy and 17 in Energy and Agriculture. The call\u2019s overall success rate was around 7%. Five SSA-focused renewable energy research and capacity building projects started in early 2014, adding up to the three RE projects funded under the first call (2009). In total these eight projects involve 32 African institutions (universities, research institutes, NGOs) and 14 EU institutions \u2013 total funding for RE is about \u20ac7 million. In spite of the strong African participation, the leadership remains in Europe for all but one of these projects.

Lead Development Partners: development of quality Gap Analysis and of national Action Plans The EU supports the SE4All objectives with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa where the needs are the greatest. It has created a \u20ac 65 million Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) to support SSA countries which are committed to reach the SE4All objectives and to scale up investment in the energy sector. Given the strategic importance of energy access as a powerful leverage of growth and competitiveness for Sub-Saharan Africa, the European Commission intends to allocate a total of \u20ac 400 million as a financial blending instrument for increasing access to energy under the SE4All. From now on, access to energy, renewable energy and energy efficiency constitute the backbone of the EU policies on energy and development. This is consistent with the EU's new development policy Agenda for Change that sets energy as a key driver for inclusive growth. SE4ALL is expected to increase the impact of EU Development Policy: \uf0b7 More efficient use of EU funds by blending of grants and loans; \uf0b7 Mobilizing the private sector; \uf0b7 Identifies two key sectors as drivers of sustainable growth: Agriculture and Energy.

The facility aimed at: \uf0b7 Facilitating the implementation of the investment projects needed to meet the SE4All objectives; \uf0b7 Enhancing involvement of the private sector; \uf0b7 Accelerating and implementing efficiently and effectively sector reform policies on access to sustainable energy, energy efficiency and energy supplies; \uf0b7 Promoting capacity development, awareness raising, transfer of technology. For achieving SE4ALL objectives, the strategy of the TAF is to remove or mitigate a number of gaps: \uf0b7 Lack of suitable institutional, policy, legal and regulatory framework \uf0b7 Lack of industrial support environment in Africa \uf0b7 Lack of capacity \uf0b7 Lack of project packaging and sponsors\u2019 pre-financing capacity \uf0b7 Lack of affordable long term finance 173 The initial contribution of the commission was: \u20ac 75 million 174 Association of European Development Finance Institutions is a group of fifteen bilateral European development finance institutions, whose members provide long term finance for private sector enterprises in developing and reforming economies..

        "151 The TAF aims supporting industrial and technology cooperation, but until now no significant achievement could be recorded (the TAF was set up end of 2013 an only few missions in few countries could take place). The European Investment Bank Investment Facility (EIB) EIB is setting up and managing various financing instruments (e.g., EU AITF, GEEREF, EEDF) aiming at financing SE4ALL projects. EIB denies supporting coal fired/thermal power plants (for EU policy reason against GHG). On the other hand, it is keen to be involved in Hydropower projects (because of the \u201cClimate window\u201d) and in RE projects (like the 30 MW pilot solar project in Burkina Faso). More and more emphasis is put on access to energy. a) EU Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF) 175 The scope of AITF is to give priority to investment projects targeting increased access to modern energy services in eligible countries that are committed to improving their policy and regulatory framework. Renewable energy is preferred, but the use of fossil fuels is not excluded (for hybrid plants). Grid, mini-grid, or off-grid projects are eligible. AITF is one of the main instruments to implement the EU\u2019s commitment. It provides grant support through subsidizing medium and long term project loans, technical assistance including feasibility studies and capacity building, and insurance premiums to cover country risks during project inception phase. The Commission has designated the ITF as one of the main instruments to implement the EU\u2019s commitment, while supporting the SEA4LL initiative with grants, and has endorsed it with \u20ac 329 million to foster private sector investment in energy access, renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. With more than half approved ITF operations to date in the energy sector and a strong pipeline of energy projects, the ITF is well placed to assist countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with their adaptation and mitigation efforts. Types of project financing: \uf0b7 Grants (investment co-financing); \uf0b7 Interest Rate Subsidy; \uf0b7 Technical Assistance; \uf0b7 Guarantee, risk sharing instruments. The countries will be able to improve their energy security and in particular to reduce their import bills by using renewable energy in the following various listed fields: \uf0b7 Geothermal, biomass, biogas, hydro, solar, wind, and ocean energy. The total budget of AITF during the time span 2007 \u2013 2013 176 was \u20ac 746,4 million (EC contribution: \u20ac 647,7 million). Approval of blending operations 177 in energy sector: 49 operations (62%), EU contribution amounted \u20ac 330 million for SSA countries \uf0e8 total projects cost: \u20ac 8,9 billion Remarks on AITF Grants (see details in Annex 6 of the Annex Report): \uf0b7 Nine projects are reported in W & C Africa: 7 are hydroelectricity projects, 2 are support finance for promoting in private sector Renewable Energy projects in West Africa; \uf0b7 Ten projects reported in E & S Africa: 5 are hydroelectricity projects, 5 aim at supporting RE sources (solar, wind, geothermal) often associated with Energy Efficiency measures; 175 The EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund: http://www.eu-africa-infrastructure-tf.net/ 176 November 2013 data 177 mix of EU grants with loans or risk-sharing mechanisms, investment facilities, etc. ",
        "152 \uf0b7 Hydro power is recognised for being a main source of renewable energy in SSA. Therefore capacity building in Hydroelectricity development is a main concern for education and applied research in the very various fields involved (i.e. geology, civil engineering, electrical, mechanical engineering \u2026); \uf0b7 The last decisions of the executive committee show a growing concern about new renewable energy sources such as geothermal in East Africa, biomass in Namibia, and others. This move appears to be linked with the growing participation of the EU in the SE4ALL initiative. From the point of view of the support provided to financing eligible renewable energy (and energy efficiency) investments, the \u20ac 30 m credit line by AFD to two local banks in Kenya should be highlighted 178 . Similar facilities have been allocated to Uganda and Tanzania. As mentioned before, the target investments are projects of a maximum amount of \u20ac 10 m in hydroelectricity, biomass, biogas, solar and wind power. The objective is to complete the energy security of the region by promoting renewable energy solutions that are technically, economically and financially viable. The implementation of a Regional Technical Assistance Programme in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, with the help of AITF (2 000 000\u20ac fully disbursed + 2 100 000 \u20ac recently approved) had as first objective to support the development and financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in the region, then again, helping identification of new EE & RE projects. For these objectives, transfer of skills to local sponsors, local banks and local experts is at stake. A similar programme has been approved for West Africa (Ivory Coast, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Togo) lead by AFD which is setting up a concessional facility of \u20ac 30 m (including \u20ac 1.5 m technical assistance over 3 years in order to create bankable projects) aiming at engaging regional local banks to finance a better use of energy and ensure the promotion of renewable energy in the private sector 179 . Linked to these Grants, the Africa Energy Guarantee Fund 180 (AEGF). The fund will provide proper risk mitigation and credit enhancement solutions to facilitate and increase private sector involvement in the African energy sector. The AEGF project is developed as one of the key European responses to the Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4ALL). Despite a large energy infrastructure gap and a growing demand for energy in many countries, private sector investment and involvement in the African energy sector remains modest. Issues such as regulatory uncertainties, lack of appropriate Feed In Tariffs (FiT), weak off-takers and more generally weak business environments dissuade the private sector and increase the level of transaction costs. b) The Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF) 181 GEEREF is a public private partnership, an innovative Fund-of-Funds182, providing global risk capital through private investment for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in developing countries and economies in transition. GEEREF providing Equity investment is dedicated to small and medium-sized projects in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sector. It is managed by the EIB group. It has 3 objectives: 1. Energy access for people 2. Combat climate change 178 The description of this operation in Eastern Africa is in the Annex II: \u201cDescription of projects supported by AITF\u201d (project Nr 11 \u201cEngaging Banks in Financing Energy Transition Projects in East Africa\u201d) 179 Idem for the description of project (1 & 2):;\u201d Technical Assistance for Financing Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Investment of Private Companies in West Africa; LEAD AFD\u201d 180 http://www.eu-africa-infrastructure-tf.net/activities/grants/africa-energy-guarantee-fund-aegf.htm 181 GEEREF: http://geeref.com 182 The total leverage effect (over the lifetime of GEEREF) has been conservatively estimated at 1 to 35 ",
        "153 3. Support Financial Sustainability Launched in 2004, GEEREF aims to accelerate the transfer, development, use and enforcement of environmentally sound technologies for the world\u2019s poorer regions, helping to bring secure, clean and affordable energy to local people. GEEREF is sponsored by the European Union, Germany and Norway. c) 11\u00b0 EDF (2014 \u2013 2020): The new trends of EU development policy will be strongly reflected in the design and priorities of the 11th EDF. The EU will increase the use of blending of loans and grants (mix of EU grants with loans or risk-sharing mechanisms, investment facilities, etc.), with the aim of generating a substantial financial leverage of EDF resources to support public and private investments in the beneficiary countries. There will be identification of 3 or maximum 4 priority sectors per country. Agriculture and energy will get a prominent focus in the future development framework of the EC. At least 25 ACP countries indicated that they favour energy as focal sector for the next programming cooperation (2014 - 2020). The 33 KMW Zagtouli Solar Plani in Burkina Faso, cofinanced by a 25 million grant from the 10 th EDF, a \u20ac 23 million grant from the EIB and \u20ac 22,5 million grant from the AFD (both at 2% over 20 years), is a good example of this blending mechanism advocated by the EU. The Energy Facility 183 Created to implement the EU Energy Initiative (EUEI) launched in Johannesburg in 2002, the Energy Facility was endowed with a total of \u20ac 420 million under the Intra-ACP envelopes of the 9th and the 10th European Development Fund (EDF). The Energy Facility provides co-financing, mainly for small scale access projects in ACP countries, major focus on renewable energy. \uf0b7 The main mechanism has been Call for Proposals; \uf0b7 140 projects have been selected to provide improved access to energy to 13 million people mostly from renewable energy (see details in Appendix 6.3.) Call for proposals on Rural Electrification by the end of 2012: \uf0b7 143 applications 184 received: EC funding available \u20ac 55 million; Grant amount requested \u20ac 825 million; Total amount of investments proposed \u20ac 1,2 billion. Moreover, the Thematic Programme for Environment and Natural Resources including energy (ENRTP) has financed worldwide small energy projects with an environmental objective, mainly renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. It includes a pilot phase (\u20ac 5 million) for the Africa-EU Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme (RECP). Africa- EU energy partnership (AEEP) Renewable energy cooperation programme (RECP) and European Union energy initiative \u2013 Partnership Dialogue Facility (EUEI \u2013 PDF). RECP is mainly a Technical Assistance Facility with a budget that amounts around \u20ac 15 million. 183 http://database.energyfacilitymonitoring.eu/acpeu/Forward.xhtml;jsessionid=adb8673f2dbdc0bfca2dcce55573 184 Cf 2 document in Annexes (6.3.) : (i) mapping Energy Facility I & II Projects location; (ii) \u201dEnergy Facility selected proposals and reserve list 2009 - 2010\u201d; and (iii) \u201cACP \u2013 EU Energy Facility Approved list 75 selected proposals\u201d ",
        "154 One of the interesting component of the programme is the Area 4: Technology innovation and capacity development. The aim of Action Area 4 is to enhance applied research capacity of African institutions and firms, to create academic training in engineering and policy-relevant Masters programmes to enhance decision-making on all levels and to provide vocational training for technicians in the renewable energy field. Activities under Action Area 4 include: 1. Facilitate the establishment of partnerships between African and European research institutes \u2013 and inter-African cooperation \u2013 including exchanges of scholars, researchers and joint research programmes, technology transfer and adaptation of technologies to local contexts; 2. Strengthen or set up vocational training structures and institutions focusing on renewable energy to cater for the demand for technicians needed in the sector (incl. curriculum development, train-the-trainers, etc.); 3. Strengthen or create Masters programmes on renewable energy, focusing on both engineering and policy-making; 4. Create executive education programmes on renewable energy particularly designed for policy- makers and private sector stakeholders. So far, the RECP is starting first activities in particular on the second and third points (vocational training and higher education), as some initial contributions from EU donors (Austria, Finland, Germany) have been received. A study has already been conducted on the needs for vocational training support interventions in Africa, in support of renewable energy market development, and proposing concrete support interventions for them (and others) to take up in the coming months. With the resources available, RECP may be able to support 2-3 countries with the technical vocational education in the sector. The first such project is currently starting in Ghana, focusing on technical vocational education for the emerging PV sector. It includes the development of curricula, training-of-trainers, certification processes, as well as actual trainings. Other projects (including with higher education institutions) will follow during the course of the year. For higher education, RECP is following a similar process. They have just commissioned a similar \u201cscoping study\u201d which will identify existing Masters programmes (in the renewables/energy sector) and propose sensible support interventions. Following the interview with one of the project manager, the main bottleneck to the development of this area is the availability of resources which are currently relatively limited to go into areas such as applied research. However, they have already existing links to many universities in Africa within the EUEI PDF and the upcoming support interventions for a (selected) number of African countries will help to better articulate the needs for research programmes in African universities on renewable energy. 6.4 European bilateral renewable energy cooperation Austria Austria is a hub of many international energy organisations, including REEP and UNIDO which manages SE4All at world level. Austria Development Cooperation focuses its assistance on regional organisations such as ECREEE and plays a major role in the energy and environment partnership with Southern and East Africa (SEEP S \u00a7 EA) in which it has already co-funded 55 projects. Between 2009 and 2013 Austria granted \u20ac 1.8 million in support of the ECOWAS Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) which was established to lead and ",
        "155 coordinate regional projects and programmes that seek to establish and operationalize markets for renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and services in ECOWAS. SOLTRAIN Southern African solar thermal training and demonstration initiative is also an interesting initiative which covers 5 Southern African countries, including Southern Africa. Austria aims at transferring its major experience in hydraulic and biomass, as well as thermal solar, PV, wind and geothermal. Besides regional organisations, priority targets countries are Uganda, Ethiopia and Senegal. Belgium Belgian public investments in the private energy sector are focussing on basic infrastructure projects with the following goals, aims or results: \uf0b7 Projects that reduce the negative effects or slow down climate change; \uf0b7 Projects that produce- and/or distribute renewable energy; and \uf0b7 Projects that have a significant impact on energy efficiency. In the past years the following budget has been spent on projects who fit these criteria: \uf0b7 2010: \u20ac 10.2 million \uf0b7 2011: \u20ac 21.3 million \uf0b7 2012: \u20ac 21.0 million \uf0b7 2013: \u20ac 14.4 million Some of the largest projects in Africa receiving Belgian funds are: \uf0b7 Appui \u00e0 la fourniture d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 Kisangani (Western Africa); \uf0b7 Financement volontaire au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du ''Fonds de D\u00e9veloppement pour l'Energie'' (FDE) faisant partie du programme r\u00e9gional de l'UEMOA d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 ''Initiative r\u00e9gionale pour l'Energie durable'' (IRED) (Congo); \uf0b7 Programme de d\u00e9veloppement des briquettes biomasse comme alternative \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique au charbon de bois autour du Parc National des Virunga (Congo); \uf0b7 BIO - Development Fund \u2013 Kivuwatt (Rwanda); and \uf0b7 BIO - Development Fund \u2013 Addax (Sierra Leone). Other African countries that received aid are Kenia, Mozambique, Senegal and Tanzania. Denmark Denmark has 5 main credit lines concerning RE and SSA: \uf0b7 Bilateral activities in DK priority countries ( \u20ac 201 million) \uf0b7 Contribution on Global Environment Facility ( \u20ac 54 million) \uf0b7 Climate envelope ( \u20ac 67 million) \uf0b7 Danide Business Programme ( \u20ac 72,6 million) \uf0b7 Contribution to the African Development Fund ( \u20ac 84,4 million) Implementation is partly through multilateral partners: ESMAP/WB, RISOE Centre (UNEP), SE4All Energy Efficiency Hub, the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa SEFA (AfDB), and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) placed in Copenhagen. Denmark has developed interesting financial instruments to unlock private investment for development: \uf0b7 Danida Business Partnerships : facilitates the establishment of commercial partnership in poor communities; \uf0b7 Danida Business Finance : provides interest-free or low interested loans to development projects; ",
        "156 \uf0b7 The Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU): makes investments on commercial terms by committing equity capital, loans and guarantees; \uf0b7 Climate Investment Fund (DCIF) : invests on commercial viable private sector projects in the energy filed with a positive climate impact. Bilateral support focuses on the transfer of low carbon technologies among which: \uf0b7 Small scale RE, including clean cooking; \uf0b7 Assessment of new opportunities within sustainable biomass energy production such as fuel wood production; \uf0b7 Energy efficiency improvements related to the production and use of charcoal and firewood; \uf0b7 Impact assessment of off-grid energy development. Netherlands The Dutch cooperation is mainly involved through 3 instruments: \uf0b7 PREP: Promoting Renewable Programme; \uf0b7 FMO: the Finance Development Company; \uf0b7 ORIO: a Facility for Infrastructure Development. Promoting Renewable Programme (PREP) The Dutch government has allocated a budget of \u20ac 500 million for promoting the use of renewable energy in developing countries in the period 2008-2014. The objective is to encourage the use of renewable energies in developing countries. The program has four pillars: a) Direct investments in access to renewable energy in priority regions in Sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia; b) Influencing the policies of partners who are responsible for investments in the field of renewable energy; c) Ensuring sustainability of the production of biomass that is used for energy consumption purposes; d) Building knowledge and capacity in recipient countries. The ultimate goal is to support developing countries to draw up and implement effective renewable energy policies. The Dutch government implements PREP through existing and proven channels. The bulk of the funds is channeled through bilateral projects and programmes executed by multilateral agencies. PREP also works with the private sector. Implementation is done through over 30 partners including World Bank, GIZ, HIVOS/SNV, and a wide range of innovative private sector partners, 90% of the funds allocated to SSA. FMO FMO\u2019s committed portfolio is \u20ac 6.63 billion in 2013. 5. FMO focuses on the full chain from exploration and transportation to generation and distribution, with a strong emphasis on renewable energy. In middle-income countries, investments are done in sustainable energy. In low-income countries, FMO invests in energy projects that enable new access to energy, with a preference for sustainable solutions. FMO finances long-term projects that can fuel economies, open gateways to access, clear the way for low-carbon systems and safeguard energy supplies; 6. Projects include: - Energy-efficient technologies such as wind, hydro, and geothermal; - Solar-panel systems for homes in rural villages; - Generation and distribution of energy to rural, off-grid areas; ",
        "157 - Refurbishment and efficiency improvements of fossil-fuel fired plants (eg, co-generation); - Sustainable forestry, forest carbon (REDD+) and biodiversity conservation to address CO2 issues from global warming. ORIO ORIO encourages public-infrastructure development in developing countries, contributing to the realization of a functional public infrastructure that is relevant to development. In this way, ORIO aims to contribute to human development and private-sector development. Finland Finland is focusing on specific countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. Its 3 main cooperation instruments are: Finfund Finnfund is a Finnish development finance company that provides long-term risk capital for private projects in developing countries. Apart from co-investing with Finnish companies, Finnfund finances ventures that use Finnish technology, cooperate with Finnish partners on a long-term basis or generate major environmental or social benefits. It managed 26 projects in Africa. Total portfolio is \u20ac 274 million. See http://www.finnfund.fi/sijoitukset/karttahankkeet/en_GB/afrikka/). Finnpartnership The mission of Finnpartnership, which is managed by Finnfund, is to increase commercial cooperation and promote business partnerships between companies in Finland and in developing countries. Finnpartnership provides free of charge advisory services for the business activities of Finnish companies in developing countries as well as financial support in the planning, development and training phases of a project. The Energy and Environment Partnership (EEP) EEP is a Programme which promotes renewable energy (RE), energy efficiency (EE), and clean technology investments. The program started 2002 in Central America before its implementation in South-East Asia and Africa. The EEP Program in Southern and East Africa is jointly funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland (lead donor), The Austrian Development Agency (ADA) and the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID). EEP implementation in southern and eastern Africa started in March 2010. Total funding for the first phase (2010-2013) was \u20ac 25 million and second phase (2013-2017) \u20ac 35 million. Finland\u2019s share of funding during years 2009-2017 is in total \u20ac 21.6 million. The Energy and Environment Partnership Programme of Southern and East Africa (EEP S&EA) is focused on projects in all fields of renewable energy (including biomass, biogas, solar PV, wind power, waste-to-energy, hydro and hybrid etc .). The goal is bridging the gap between a good idea and a bankable project by providing part-financing to project proposals. These projects include various types of feasibility studies aiming at concrete investments, as well as pilot, scale-up and demonstration projects. By October 2013, The Programme has received more than 1,000 concept notes out of which 113 projects have been selected for funding to date. An extensive list of ongoing projects is available via http://eepafrica.org/projects/. France In 2012, AFD has a portfolio of nearly \u20ac 7 billion of project funding, of which \u20ac 2.7 billion (39.5%) for Sub-Saharan Africa (top priority), making it one of the world\u2019s largest development finance institution. Since 2009, energy sector is a priority and represented: \u20ac 2.14 billion in 2009, 1.84 in 2010 and 2.14 in 2011. From the \u20ac 7.42 billion engaged for the energy sector between 2007 and ",
        "158 2011, \u20ac 1.79 billion have been engaged for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries (more than 30% of funds for SSA since 2009). The principal funding tools of the AFD Group (AFD and Proparco) include: Loans: \u20ac 4.7 million in 2012, Grants and Subsidies \u20ac 571 million, Guarantees \u20ac115 million, Private Equity \u20ac 90 million. AFD also offers technical assistance (TA) to aid recipients to ensure the performance of funded projects. In 2012, 47% of new financing commitments went to SSA, the AFD amount of funding approvals for SSA was more than \u20ac 2 billion, of which \u20ac 550 million for the energy sector shared between EE/RE \u20ac 380 million; secured energy \u20ac 100 million; Climate and energy \u20ac 50 million, and energy access \u20ac 20 million. Specific activities in the energy sector and ACP countries Considering that energy is a thematic core of sustainable development, since 2007, AFD has decided to promote three strategic main lines: sustainable energy, secured energy and access to energy. 1. Sustainable energy: in order to develop autonomy, systems resilience vis-\u00e0-vis prices volatility and climatic hazards, AFD gives priority to energy efficiency and renewable energies; 2. Access to energy: developing energy access to electricity, to domestic fuels and to biofuels; 3. Secure and reinforce energy systems: the economic potential of LDCs is limited by production capacity deficit and unreliable energy services (shortage of power, low voltage, etc.) and it is necessary to improve the standardization of electricity network, to develop regional inter- connections and introduce intelligent network. In the RE field, the technical assistance & capacity building activities focus on four areas: 1. Scaling up on-grid RE investments; 2. Enhance energy access through RE projects; 3. Mobilize new financial instruments to support RE; 4. Knowledge sharing & dissemination of best practices. The European Commission has delegated to the AFD \u20ac 2 million in the context of an action entitled\" Africa-EU Renewable Energies Cooperation Programme- RECP- Development of capacity for project preparation and mobilization of funds\" amounting total of \u20ac 3.6 million, which will take place in several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. This programme was launched in 2010 at the First High-Level Meeting of the Africa-EU Energy Partnership (AEEP). The objective of RECP is to stimulate sustainable economic and social development in Africa through the use of renewable energy sources on the continent. AFD is also involved (as the secretariat) in the French Global Environment. The specific objective of the Facility is to subsidise development projects that have a significant and long lasting impact on one or other of the principal global environmental domains (biodiversity, global warming, international waters, ozone layer, soil degradation including desertification and deforestation, persistent organic pollutants). East African countries: A credit facility of \u20ac 90 million has been launched in 2011 with Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, including technical assistance implemented by Kenyan Association of Manufacturers (KAM).

In addition to its bilateral programmes, Germany participates in various international processes and institutions for the further expansion of renewable energy: EUEI-PDF, AEEP, Global Alliance for Clean cook stoves. The German Government also supports the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21). KfW KfW is one of the largest financiers of RE sources in developing countries. Over the last five years, commitments by KfW in the area of environmentally friendly and sustainable energy supply amounted to \u20ac 5.8 billion. In 2012 alone about 16 per cent of all Financial Cooperation (FC) commitments went into projects and programmes of renewable energy and energy efficiency. Energy projects receiving funding from KfW cover the entire range of power generation, transmission, distribution and demand and, to a lesser extent, domestic energy supply. Support for adequate framework conditions can also be a component of an FC project. The lion\u2019s share of commitments between 2008 and 2012, roughly 67%, were made for power generation (grid-based and non-grid-based). Renewable energy continues to gain importance. In 2012, \u20ac 787 million (16% of total commitments in the energy sector) were allocated to renewable energy. ",

EnDev promotes the supply of modern energy technologies to households and small-scale businesses. The GIZ has been commissioned by the donors to act as the lead agency for implementing the Energising Development Programme. EnDev works with partners in the governmental, non-governmental and private sector to implement activities in developing countries. At countryscale, EnDev projects are cooperating with international, bilateral and multilateral programmes. EnDev provides energy access to households, social institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. This is done by establishing economically sustainable energy solutions and distribution schemes, mainly for rural communities. Main goals are the extension and densification of power grids, installation of hydropower plants and distribution of solar home systems. Furthermore, it helps to establish self-sustaining markets for the production and sale of improved (more efficient) cookstoves. Italy The majority of Italy\u2019s contribution to development went through the multilateral system. The share going to energy and SSA is not known.

The grant has been awarded by the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) and Canada\u2019s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) programme, a seven-year, $70 million research initiative aimed at understanding climate change and adaptation in vulnerable regions. The ASSAR initiative will focus on 10 countries across Africa and South Asia, with UEA primarily responsible for research in East Africa. Working with partners in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. Also working with the University of Cape Town and UEA on ASSAR are Start International (United States), Oxfam Great Britain (United Kingdom) and the International Institute for Human Settlements (India). The UK will provide \u00a3 95 million to capitalise GAP - a new company that will be established under the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) Trust. GAP will invest in renewable energy projects to demonstrate the viability of renewable energy in Africa so that future projects are more likely to happen and attract private developers and investors. A further \u00a3 3 million budget will be used to set up the project, monitor and evaluate these impacts and capture and disseminate this knowledge. GAP aims to support projects that will install ~270MW of renewable energy in Africa in 4 years. Renewable energy projects cover from geothermal power in Kenya to unlocking methane from the depths of Rwanda\u2019s Lake Kivu, In Rwanda, DFID is piloting results-based mechanisms to incentivise private developers of LED lighting, institutional biomass and small hydro mini-grids. Finally, the DFID supported Cape Verde Wind Power programme, InfraCo Africa is the developer of the US$ 90 million Cabeolica wind farm, which won the 2011 award for the best renewable energy project in Africa, and will provide 30% of Cape Verde\u2019s energy needs by 2012.

        "164 6.5 Renewable energy cooperation with other countries Brazil Since 2007, Brazil is developing its involvement in Africa, with the opening of 18 new embassies (from 18 to 36). The Brazilian Development Bank has become the main funding agency for projects undertaken by Brazilian companies in Africa. In 2009, Brazil total investments in Africa exceeded 10 billion or 6,4 % of total foreign investment. In 2006, Petrobras signed an agreement for the production of biofuel in Mozambique. In October 2007, at the second India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) trilateral development initiative, South Africa agreed to work together with the other two countries on climate change mitigation through the promotion of clean energy technologies and renewable energy. 186 Obviously, Brazil could be instrumental in transferring its advanced know-how in the use of biomass, ethanol and biodiesels, although the environment is quite different. As observed during this study\u2019s field visits, Brazilian universities have also developed their links with African universities. All in all, the most important SSA-Brazil cooperation is on the field of bio-energy. India India is both a provider of development cooperation and an aid recipient. In 2011, India gave US$ 787 million in ODA, of which 479 million in Technical and Economic Cooperation. African countries only receive a small share. In parallel, EXIM Bank provides loans to import Indian goods and services: US$ 1.1 billion in 2011, 53% for Africa. India is active as a provider of equipment for power generation and transmission, rural electrification, cogeneration plants for the sugar industry, and in other areas related to renewable energy. Two Indian universities have set up branches in Africa, including in the field of energy. In addition, India celebrated its 10-year partnership with Brazil and South Africa through the previously mentioned IBSA trilateral development initiative. However, significant India-SSA cooperation was not observed during the field visits. Nevertheless, India could just as well as China in the future provide cheap and locally adaptable RETs to Africa to exploit its rich renewable energy potential. 187 USAID Power Africa is an USAID initiative in partnership with the Word Bank, AfDB and with the private sector. Power Africa 188 is a special electrification programme involving African governments, the private sector, and other partners such as the World Bank and African Development Bank with an initial focus on six sub-Saharan African countries. The programme: 1. Aims to add more than 10,000 megawatts (MW) of clean, efficient, electricity generation capacity; 2. Includes mini-grid and off-grid solutions and the expansion of power generation, transmission, and distribution structures; 3. Will make electricity available to 20 million people and commercial entities. Among the beneficiaries are Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria and Tanzania, covering about 20 million new electricity consumers in total. The first phase of the US government budget commitment in the period 2013-2018 is around US$7 billion. This financing should leverage $14 billion in total (i.e. generate a 2 to 1 multiplier effect), from the private sector in project finance, guarantees and equity investments.

It will achieve this by mobilising investment from private sources as well as by providing policy support to governments. The program will support expansion of generation, transmission and distribution facilities as well as provide support for mini-grid and off-grid networks in rural areas. It plans to use an array of different instruments to achieve this goal including loans, grants, guarantees, risk mitigation insurance, and technical assistance; \uf0b7 The Power Africa programme began in July 2013 and is still at an early stage of implementation. The following investments are receiving support:.ETHIOPIA Corbetti Geothermal Power Plant \u2013 up to 1,000 MW: provision of transactional and technical advice to support the first independent power producer (IPP) in Ethiopia; \uf0b7 KENYA Aeolus Wind 60 MW \u2013 this development also supports the implementation of a grid management program to enable integration of intermittent renewable energy; \uf0b7 NIGERIA Power Privatisation \u2013 2,000 MW by 2018: support for the companies involved in the privatisation of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria by helping improve their operations, maintenance and investment activities; \uf0b7 TANZANIA Kiwira River Hydro Project \u2013 10 MW provision of a loan guarantee to support development of hydropower in the country\u2019s agricultural corridor. The guarantee will support provision of local finance for this development. Russia During our field visits there seemed to be no mentioning of any cooperation activities between SSA and Russia in the field of renewable energy. Russia provided US$ 472 million in ODA, but only small amounts go to several SSA countries. The largest non-ODA outflows from Russia are fpreign direct Investments. One of the main channels towards Sub-Saharan Africa for these funds is the Coordinating Committee on Economic Cooperation with Sub-Saharan Africa (Afrocom), established in 2009. The main purpose of Afrocom is to assist interested parties in establishing and developing relationships with Sub-Saharan governments and businesses, provide information and consulting services to the Russian businesses interested in implementing projects in this region. More recently, Russia and South Africa agreed on a strategic partnership worth US$50 billion to increase the nuclear power generation capacity of the latter 189 . China The majority of SSA-China cooperation is driven by economic interests. Chinese involvement in Sub-Saharan Africa is significant, although the scope is not necessarily renewable energy. The main focus is on resources (agriculture, mining, energy, etc.), which can obviously also cover renewable energy. Likely driven from a resource perspective, Chinese involvement has developed in multiple sectors. A recurrent observation is that in exchange for concessions (e.g. in mining), Chinese contractors have made major improvements to the African infrastructure. These involvements, as well as an opening up of the SSA region for Chinese tourists, attracts Chinese investors in the recreational sector. Specifically in the renewable energy sector, actual Chinese presence is most prevalent where (labour-intensive) civil engineering is involved. This is particularly evident in large-scale hydro projects, of which a summary is given in Table 6.1. 189 http://mg.co.za/article/2014-09-23-sa-russia-agree-to-50-billion-nuclear-deal ",

To list a few examples, Chinese companies were attracted by the South African government to invest in renewable energy sources after the South African government announced in a White Paper on Renewable Energy a 10,000 GWh renewable energy target to be achieved by 2013. In Mozambique, Chinese contractors are active in coal mining, infrastructure improvements and the recreational sector. In Ethiopia, the Chinese are active in supporting infrastructure (transport, grid) and large scale hydropower, most notably the Gibe III dam (see above). On the one hand, the \u201cChinese approach\u201d often lacks several of the precautions that Western countries would take before setting up a similar project, for example by performing the necessary environmental impact assessment or preventing the displacement of local populations. On the other hand, these projects play a major role in the regional interconnection on this side of the African continent as they supply power to the national grids and connect neighbouring regions. In some of these investment projects, there is a bilateral cooperation agreement in place to formally guarantee support and attract the investors from China. For example, China has committed itself to build 100 new clean energy projects. 191 From an RET point of view, Chinese companies have a dominant position in the field of large-scale hydropower. Indirectly, Chinese are active in the supply chain for those RETs with interests of the Chinese manufacturing sector, of which solar PV panel manufacturing is the most evident. Japan Through official development aid (ODA), Japan has funded the development of geothermal energy in a range of African countries. For example, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) supports the African Rift Valley to identify ways to overcome financial and technical issues surrounding exploratory drilling for geothermal reservoirs. Other efforts by JICA include conducting development studies in energy efficiency improvement in South Africa (2011-2012), hydropower development and interconnection in Uganda (2009-2011 and 2007) and rural electrification through renewable energy usage in both Ghana and Kenya (2004-2005 and 2011-2015). JICA has also provided aid for emergency repair and overhaul works for the Jebba Hydropower station in Nigeria, to the Olkaria I Unit 4 and 5 Geothermal Power Project in Kenya, and to rural electrification and water supply through PV power in Tunisia, Nigeria and Ghana. Finally, JICA has 190 IR, 2014. \u201cChinese dams in Africa\u201d. Available at http://www.internationalrivers.org/campaigns/chinese-dams-in-africa 191 People\u2019s Daily, 2009 ",

The research topics cover: resource sustainability, system studies, fuel standards, greenhouse gas balance, barriers to deployment, management decision support systems. For the period 2013-2015, there are 10 Tasks, each during 3 years. To be noted that South Africa is one of the member countries of Bioenergy IA. Geothermal The work underway includes, identification of, and development of, means to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts that can arise from the use of geothermal energy; development of enhanced (engineered) geothermal systems (EGS) for commercial power generation; helping reduce drilling costs through developing an understanding of drilling and logging needs, clarifying best practices and sharing methods and technologies; investigating all aspects of direct heat use technology to improve implementation, reduce costs and enhance use; exchange and dissemination of data and information on all aspects of geothermal energy use; and determination of the steps required to make EGS fluid injection a safe and economical technology acceptable to the public and industry. Hydropower Present work addresses technological, organisational and regulatory issues related to small hydro projects (less than 10MW and more than 50KW), development and dissemination of training materials in the areas of planning, operations and maintenance of hydropower installations (good practice), Integration of Wind into Hydropower Systems, Renewal and Upgrading of Existing Hydropower Plants, and environmental issues. There are no African countries within the members, but IEA Hydro co-hosted three workshops at AFRICA 2013 in Ethiopia, in April 2013 on Small-Scale Hydropower. Topics covered included: automation and management aspects, environmental issues, financing, design, engineering, legal frameworks, hydrology, and small hydro for rural development. Experience with small scale hydropower development for Africa has been presented. ",
        "169 Ocean Energy Systems The OES brings together countries to advance research, development and demonstration of conversion technologies to harness energy from all forms of ocean renewable resources, such as tides, waves, currents, temperature gradient (ocean thermal energy conversion and submarine geothermal energy) and salinity gradient for electricity generation, as well as for other uses, such as desalination, through international cooperation and information exchange. Photovoltaic Power Systems (PVPS) Working on both technical and non-technical issues, the Agreement undertakes key collaborative projects related to technology and performance assessment, cost reduction, best practice in various applications, rapid deployment of photovoltaic systems, and key issues such as grid integration and environmental aspects. This IA has a specific Task 9 on \u201cDeployment of PV services for regional development\u201d. Task 9 group has a lot of knowledge of the drivers and constraints/ barriers to RE development in developing countries including SSA. The group is composed by consulting and engineering companies (INTEC-Switzerland, IED-France, GSES-Australia), by Solar Centers or institutes such as the Solar Energy Research Centre of the Dalarna University in Sweden, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in Germany, and semi-governmental organisations such as the Japan New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO). They might have as well as ideas on interesting R\u00a7I themes worth to be supported (both technological, technology adaptation or dissemination and soft research with the objective of: \uf0b7 Promoting the implementation of appropriate and efficient technical solutions through the development of partnerships with selected Asian and African \u201cmegaphones\u201d (financial institutions, regional / professional organisations such as the ADB, AfDB, CLUB-ER, ASEAN Center for Energy, etc.) which offer dissemination opportunities for the outputs of other technology-focused PVPS Tasks addressing these challenges, adapting the messages and implementation frameworks in areas beyond the borders of OECD countries. These partnerships would enable the sharing of PVPS\u2019 knowledge in the area of rural electrification and beyond e.g. highly relevant topics like penetration of PV in the urban environment, PV hybrids, very large scale PV plants and high penetration in grids; \uf0b7 Producing substantive work on applications meeting the needs of rural communities such as water pumping, health (refrigeration, lighting,\u2026), \u201cpico PV services\u201d (highly efficient integrated appliances for lighting and ICT needs), and on relevant business models for deployment. Solar heating and cooling Established in 1977, the SHC IA mission assumes a whole-building approach to the application of solar technologies and design. Through international collaborative activities, the SHC IA supports market expansion by providing access to reliable information on solar system performance, data, design guidelines and tools, and by developing and integrating advanced solar energy technologies and design strategies for the built environment and for agricultural and industrial process heat applications. The Agreement's target audience is the design community, solar manufacturers, and the energy supply and service industries that serve the end-users and building owners.

INDONESIA: US$ 175 million to increase geothermal power capacity by 150 MW; 3. SOUTH AFRICA: US$ 50 million and $200 million for wind development and concentrating solar power plants. Examples of the results from investment in renewable energy are given below. 1. Bangladesh in Solar PV : In 2002, only 7,000 Bangladeshi households were using solar panels. Today, more than 1.4 million low-income rural households in Bangladesh have electricity\u2014delivered by solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. Installations of the panels under the IDA-supported Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project have doubled since 2010 to 40,000 a month; 2. In Indonesia , geothermal capacity increased from 992 MW in 2007 to 1,197MW in 2012. In Kenya , a smaller but still significant increase in geothermal capacity has taken place from 135 MW to 167 MW; 3. In Turkey, a Private Sector Renewable Energy project contributed to an increase in 969 MW of new capacity through the support of 9 small hydro plants, six wind plants, and one geothermal development. Recent examples in SSA countries of the application of renewable energy technologies 1. CAMEROUN: US$ 132 million for Lom Pangar hydroelectric project to increase the dam\u2019s all season capacity by 40% from 1,750MW to 3,000 MW; 2. KENYA: US$ 75 million to increase Geothermal Power Generation capacity by 35 MW at the Olkaria field; 3. GUINEA: US$ 5 million for Decentralized Rural Electrification, mainly for Solar PV systems and mini-hydro schemes in rural areas. UNIDO United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, UNIDO's energy-related activities include the promotion of renewable sources of energy, the facilitation of productive activities in rural areas and in industrial processes. UNIDO's Renewable Energy Strategy aims at helping developing countries and countries in transition to achieve the following strategic outcomes: \uf0b7 Mainstream the use of renewable energy in industrial applications, in particular in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), to increase their competitiveness and reduce dependence on fossil fuels; \uf0b7 Create business development opportunities through increasing access to energy through mini- grids, by promoting renewable energy technologies; \uf0b7 Support innovative business models promoting renewable energy as a business sector, thereby increase the viability of enterprises, particularly in rural areas, by augmenting the use of locally available renewable energy sources. As an integral part of its mandate to support sustainable energy production and use, UNIDO focuses on promoting renewable energy for productive uses and industrial applications in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. To enhance productive activities and increase competitiveness of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in rural on/off-grid areas, UNIDO\u2019s renewable energy strategy promotes the following forms of renewable energy: Biomass, Hydropower, Solar energy, and wind energy. ",
        "172 UNIDO pursues a multi-dimensional and multi-track approach to promote productive uses of renewable energy in developing countries, and offers, among others, the following assistances: \uf0b7 Technology demonstration: o Demonstrating the technical, economical and social feasibility of using different renewable energy technologies for augmenting rural / urban electrification; o Promoting renewable energy technologies for industrial applications in energy intensive manufacturing SMEs, which have requirements for motive power, and process heat for low or high temperature applications; \uf0b7 Policy support: o Enabling policy environment that helps in promoting renewable energy technologies, markets and investments; o Fostering agreements between the industrial sector and the national energy and environment sector regulators, utilities and financing agencies; \uf0b7 Capacity building: o Supporting capacity building of national institutions, public decision-makers, local entrepreneurs and the industry in the field of renewable energy for rural electrification and productive uses; o Strengthening manufacturing capacities of local industries and enterprises to manufacture, assemble an maintain renewable energy technologies and systems. In Africa, the UNIDO in cooperation with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS) launched the regional programme to promote access to modern energy services; increased use of renewable sources of energy and improving energy efficiencies in the industrial and household sectors in West Africa. In this framework it has financed the creation of the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in 2010. And is still one of the major supporters of its activities. Other selected projects developed in Africa are: \uf0b7 Renewable Energy Based Electricity Generation for Isolated Mini-Grids in Zambia; \uf0b7 Renewable Energy Powered Telecentre- Pilot and Demonstration Project in Zambia; \uf0b7 Training package on \u2018Sustainable Energy Regulation and Policymaking for Africa\u2019; \uf0b7 Establishment of the UNIDO's Regional Centre for Small Hydro Power in Abuja (Nigeria) which provides technical assistance at the regional level. 6.7 Conclusions Promoting Renewable Energy is SSA is becoming a major objective, if not the priority, of most IFIs including the World Bank, AFdB and EU (DEVCO and EIB). There is a multitude of initiatives, with still some overlapping in spite of the coordination efforts at local level. In itself, there are plenty of financial resources available from the World Bank, the EIB and others. The needs related to energy programming, identifications of projects, policy reform, institutional development and capacity building are pretty well covered (even with some overlapping). Funds are available to finance RE pilot projects with the following main constraints: \uf0b7 The private sector is still reluctant to invest in RE; \uf0b7 Knowledge of RE potential, technologies or success stories is not widely diffused. This creates doubts on the advantages of investing in RE projects, especially from the private sector, the energy utilities and the public authorities; ",
        "173 \uf0b7 There is a lack of good private sector project proposals and a limited local capacity in making pre/feasibility studies; \uf0b7 Even if not perfect, cooperation is developing. For example, AFD/KFW and EIB are frequently associated in the funding of SSA RE projects; \uf0b7 Financial resources for feasibility studies are unknown or information about them is confusing. However, the focus of most international cooperation initiatives in the area of renewable energy is currently on hard investment. At the same time, \u2018soft\u2019 actions (often taken by the EU) are often not targeted to the renewable energy sector. This leaves substantial room for additional initiatives which focus on EU-SSA research cooperation and capacity building in the area of renewable energy. ",

The aim of this exercise is to come to a shared view about areas where EU\u2019s knowledge and potential can be deployed to assist the development of renewable energy and R&D capacity development in SSA. Benefits should be sought in the short, medium and longer terms, including benefits for the global climate change mitigation, providing clean and affordable energy in SSA, and strengthening competitiveness in both areas. The methodology for this matching exercise has been as follows: \uf0b7 Desk-based research: Chapter 4 provides a broad overview of research needs which have been identified, based on desk research and the survey; \uf0b7 These research needs have been investigated through Field work and regional workshops in the SSA-region. A total of 10 countries were visited and three Regional Workshops were held: in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Johannesburg (South Africa) and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia). In each of these workshops, a group of about 40 participants \u2013 consisting of leading officials, academics, international donors and NGO\u2019s active in renewable energy research or development from the hosting and adjacent countries discussed these research needs. This has resulted in the identification of promising and concrete research topics. These research topics were elaborated in so-called research fiches; \uf0b7 These research fiches have been discussed in a Validation Workshop in Brussels , to determine the EU-interest in these research topics and whether a change in scope is required; \uf0b7 The fiches have been adjusted and elaborated, taking into account comments made during the validation workshop, and extending the parts addressing the benefits and impacts for Europe. In this chapter, a package of 20 themes will be presented in two different categories: RET-specific research cooperation (13 themes, Chapter 7.2) and transversal research cooperation (7 themes, Chapter 7.3).

Technologies not highlighted here are expected to benefit from transversal research themes as presented in Chapter 7.3. 7.2.1 Project Development Assistance for the Deployment of small PV Systems (A.1) 1. Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation In sub-Saharan Africa, off-grid solutions using local solar energy resources can help lift isolated communities out of their energy poverty. Continuous reduction of PV system costs allowed the development of a broad technical offer by private players. However there are remaining financing gaps to reach rural populations that innovative business models and new financing schemes can bridge. 2. Justification/background information International development aid has been for a long time the main source of funding for providing access to off-grid solar systems to remote populations. But the recent cost reduction of solar PV ",
        "177 panels and associated devices has attracted many private players in this bottom-of-the-pyramid 193 market, and a wide offer of products is now available to people living beyond grids or in areas with poor grid supply. In addition, new technologies (mobile banking, remote control of equipment though mobile networks) can help streamlining the payment collection process (for instalments within credit schemes) and maintenance procedures, thus reducing costs. Nevertheless there are many areas in Sub-Saharan Africa where access to these small PV products remains difficult because of insufficiently dense distribution channels in remote rural areas or because of a lower ability to pay for high quality products in these areas. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation The overall scope of this research theme comprises 3 components: 1. Assessment study and programme design : \uf0b7 Cover past programmes built on public-private cooperation for the distribution of small solar systems 194 implemented in SSA (best practice, impacts, transactions costs, efficient designs), and evaluation of existing knowledge gaps within the private banking sector, including microfinance institutions; \uf0b7 Provide a comprehensive programme design for efficient, sustainable public/private co- funding for the distribution and maintenance of small renewable energy-based products for rural pre-electrification. 2. Programme development assistance support would be provided to public-private partnerships aiming to deploy new financing mechanisms for the distribution of off-grid individual power solutions based on renewable energy. The support will be conditional on mobilized private funding. 3. Credit line for financing local lending institutions. Public funds provided to lending institutions would be limited to the amount required to cross the last financing gap, which will not exceed 25% of the commercial retail price of the supported PV product. The support will be conditional on an actual long-term maintenance plan involving stable private suppliers and service providers. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 An available assessment of best practice from past programmes for the distribution of small solar PV systems; \uf0b7 Increased penetration of small off-grid solar PV systems, especially in remote areas; \uf0b7 Increased ability for the local banking sector to run credits and leasing schemes for small PV systems. 5. Benefits/Impacts for Europe \uf0b7 The development of public-private partnerships would be beneficial to European RE systems providers thanks to an enlarged market base, simplified access to markets and ability to promote higher quality products; \uf0b7 Opportunities for EU banks present in SSA to offer new, competitive services via increased adoption of mobile banking; \uf0b7 Higher local impact and efficiency of the spent EU development aid. 6.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation In sub-Saharan Africa, solar heating and cooling technologies can provide valuable heat source for basic applications like domestic water heating as well as for more advanced applications like space cooling and process heat, which require continued research and innovation. 2. Justification/background information In sub-Saharan Africa, power consumption for air conditioning as well as domestic water heating is increasing, leading to higher pressure on already constrained power supply infrastructures. Because the daily load profile of air conditioners matches with the profile of solar irradiance and because water heaters can be operated at a dedicated time, there are good reasons for tackling the high solar resource in SSA for space cooling and domestic water heating. In addition, solar heat above 200\u00b0C for industrial processes, and industrial solar cooling above 700 kW power are acknowledged as promising, but innovative concepts, processes and technologies could help improving performance and reliability as well as reducing costs, thus bringing these solutions to a higher TRL (Technology Readiness Level), and ultimately market application. In this context, SSA countries could provide valuable field opportunities for pilot/demonstration facility leading to competitive edges for EU players and spill-overs to SSA countries. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation The topics to be addressed under the present calls regarding solar heating and cooling 195 within Horizon 2020 are LCE 2 (innovative processes and technologies for use of solar heating for industrial process) and LCE 3 (demonstration of innovative and cost-effective solutions for the production of domestic hot water). They both match with research goals in this sector for sub- Saharan Africa. It is therefore recommended to: \uf0b7 Open future Horizon 2020 calls on solar heating and cooling to African countries . The future Horizon 2020 calls on solar heating and cooling could be follow-ups (open to SSA countries) of the present LCE 2 and LCE 3; \uf0b7 Promote the various Marie Skoldowska-Curie Actions (ITN, RISE, TN, Cofund) 196 within Horizon 2020 in Sub-Saharan Africa for intensified academic cooperation, knowledge exchange and training with EU partners. 195 LCE 2 \u2013 2014/2015: Developing the next generation technologies of renewable electricity and heating/cooling.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Bring CSP technology solutions to a higher technology readiness level, and increase the readiness level of SSA manufacturing capacities. 2. Justification/background information CSP is an emerging technology, with significant technological R&I potential. Players in both Europe and SSA are active in this respect. CSP plants presently under construction in Morocco (Noor 1: 160 MW) and in South Africa (Khi 50 MW, KaXxu 100 MW) represent the early development of this technology on the continent. While North African CSP plants can be envisioned as a first step of a trans-Mediterranean power market, the ones in South Africa will play a significant role within the regional interconnected grids of the SADC. South Africa is involved in several international cooperation activities on CSP (SolarPACES, bilateral cooperation via GIZ and regional academic cooperation) and a EuropeAid grant has been provided to Burkina Faso and Ghana for R&D on small-scale CSP for local capacity development. 3.

They should bring technology solutions to a higher technology readiness level (TRL) and SSA manufacturing capacities to higher manufacturing readiness level (MRL). 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA Involving SSA countries (and especially South Africa) in the European cooperation on CSP would provide: \uf0b7 Continued EU-SSA academic cooperation, capacity building and skills development in SSA, funding for research equipment at key SSA research centres on CSP and solar thermal applications; \uf0b7 Nurturing the development of SSA\u2019s industrial capacity to produce components and systems; \uf0b7 Opportunities for increasing the local content within CSP installations in SSA; \uf0b7 Future deployment of CSP in Africa will bring storage capacity that may play a role in grid balancing and integration of other renewable energy sources. For Sub-Saharan countries in general, continued EU-SSA academic cooperation, capacity building and skills development in SSA, funding for research equipment at key SSA research centres on CSP and solar thermal applications, potential development of SSA-specific designs using local materials (for thermal energy storage for instance). 5. Benefits/Impacts for Europe Involving SSA countries (and especially South Africa) in the European cooperation on CSP would provide: \uf0b7 Easier access to the SSA field for European players for testing CSP facilities and mutual benefit in increased information sharing, aiming at reducing CSP technical and business risks; \uf0b7 Innovative options for reduced water usage and dry cooling; \uf0b7 Opportunities for reducing CSP costs; \uf0b7 New opportunities in SSA for European players. 6.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation \uf0b7 Need to understand the (mostly non-technological) reasons for the low penetration of improved cook stoves; \uf0b7 Need to observe the practical energy ratios of improved cook stoves on sites (depending on the quality of fuel wood or charcoal used). 2. Justification/background information Biomass (including traditional fuels: fuel wood and charcoal) will remain the most important source of energy for a majority of SSA countries during the next twenty years. The demand for firewood is mainly for rural households (cooking) and for free collection. Urban households consume more charcoal. Households use a lot of charcoal for cooking with a very low efficiency (5 to 15%) and this has a tremendous impact on wood resources and CO2 production. The traditional biomass consumption could be divided by 2 or 3. However, the dissemination of improved cook stoves remains limited in spite of the large amount of programmes carried out in the last 40 years. Energy conservation for cooking is a particularly important priority because of environmental, social (time spent for collecting fuel wood) and health (namely for women and children) impacts. SSA prospects for 2050 confirm the important place of traditional biomass in the energy balance (> 50% in 2050 excluding South-Africa). The technology of traditional improved cook stoves is now well known. Energy-efficient stoves emit very little smoke due to improved combustion and specific design. Most significant research on the shape and the design of improved cook stoves has already been done. Moreover, economical and mixed technology of specific improved stoves has been developed (such as the TLUD now in some African countries). With energy-efficient (up to 50 or 60%) improved stoves, the fuel wood consumption could be divided by 3 and make up for the demographic growth. However, as empirically observed all over SSA, the dissemination of improved stoves (using wood in rural areas or charcoal in urban areas) involves only a minority of the population. As of now, no detailed statistical information and no extensive in-depth reports are available (except for some case-by-case basis projects implemented and monitored by NGOs). Therefore, the sociological/economic reasons causing a limited penetration/dissemination of improved stoves and the reasons for rural people\u2019s reluctance to adopt improved stoves, need to be cleared up. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation 1. Analysis of existing/past schemes for promoting improved stoves in the country or in the region, including the reasons for success or failure; 2.

Reasons for not buying improved cook stoves (price, availability, lack of information); d. Awareness of health risks related to the use of traditional stoves; e. The survey should give the basis on which an awareness campaign could be conducted; 3. On-site testing of the efficiency of improved stoves depending upon the type of fuel wood used; 4. In the case of villages or small rural towns, the survey will also analyse the situation of handicrafts/small rural agro/ industrial activities: a. Fuels used for industrial activities (baking, drying, etc): wood, charcoal, generators, etc. Fuel consumption ratios; b. Identification of opportunities for alternative energy solutions (including industrial waste) and/or energy efficiency. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 Increased awareness and promotion of improved stoves; \uf0b7 Reduced fuel wood consumption (and therefore also reduced deforestation) and CO2- emissions to due more energy-efficient cooking; \uf0b7 Improved health for women and children due to reduction of smokes/pollutions at home; \uf0b7 Increased available time (gender approach) for other activities than collecting fuel wood; \uf0b7 Financial saving for those buying charcoal in urban areas; \uf0b7 Pertinent arguments for the design of efficient/improved stoves locally produced; \uf0b7 Strong and positive environmental impacts. 5. Benefits/Impacts for Europe Reduced CO2-emissions and a contribution towards the EU-Africa External Policy and Africa-EU Energy Policy (energy efficiency, reduction of deforestation, better use of biomass resources). 6.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation In many SSA countries charcoal production is a market in the hands of traders reluctant to introduce new productive technologies. The rapid growth of the market demand creates a huge ",
        "183 need of dissemination of more appropriate technologies and more efficient kilns, which will lead to the improvement of the energy ratio and to the reduction of the CO2 emissions. 2. Justification/background information In SSA, charcoal is mainly used by urban households. Due to the triple effect of population growth, increased urbanization, and relative price changes of alternate energy sources for cooking, it is expected that the consumption of charcoal will remain at very high levels or even increase in absolute terms over the next decades. The reason why consumers keep using wood-based biomass lies in the reliability of supply. The quantity of wood or charcoal purchased can be adjusted to the households\u2019 amount of available cash, and wood-based biomass is also available through a wide network of retailers without shortage. In SSA the charcoal is usually produced in mobile traditional earth kilns with low conversion efficiency (8 - 12%). But charcoal is easier to transport and to sell, which explains its attractiveness. Therefore, the conversion efficiency of the production process should be improved by using fixed modern \u201ckilns\u201d (in concrete, or metallic) as at present African governments want to encourage the use of charcoal. Fixed equipment could be generalized across SSA, in the proximity of towns or of industry. The energy efficiency could increase from around 10% at present up to 20% in semi-industrial kilns, and up to more than 25 \u2013 30% in industrialised ones. Not only the technical aspects of production have to be tested on field, but also the socio economic constraints to the penetration of fixed equipment have to be understood through appropriate studies or pilot projects. Indeed in SSA, trade and marketing are probably the least regulated aspects of the charcoal value chain and could be crippling obstacles. Several new charcoal kilns have been installed for example in Madagascar or Kenya. Lessons should be learned through an impact assessment of these projects in order to develop larger investment programmes in this sector. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation 1. A research study at national or regional level of a sample of new charcoal kilns installed in the last 5 years, with an impact assessment in energy efficiency, CO2 emissions, charcoal price and distribution channels (through SE4All initiatives or FWC Lot 4); 2. A call (Africa Call or EU-ACP Energy Facility) for innovative pilot/demonstration kiln or integrated projects that could cover several types of initiatives: a. Innovative fixed equipment for charcoal production improving the efficiency from a current 12% up to 30% and more; b. Development of efficient permanent (concrete) or mobile (metallic) kilns for charcoal production coupled with smoke purification; c. Identification and demonstration of innovative solutions adapted to the energy-consumption of small business sector (crafts): bakeries, brickyards, beer of millet, drying / baking; d. Development of large scale carbonisation process mixed with power co-generation; e.

Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 An improvement of more than 100% of the energy efficiency of charcoal production can be expected, therefore improving drastically the conservation of the traditional biomass energy resources; \uf0b7 A continuous supply of charcoal based on permanent kilns settled in permanent forests may have favorable consequences on crafts and on industrial production; \uf0b7 The potential for reducing GHG emissions by promoting the application of improved kiln technology is tremendous, not only due to higher carbonization efficiencies, but also due to the application of GHG reducing technologies and the possibility of electricity co-generation; \uf0b7 SSA could benefit from EU technologies and vice versa (some European stakeholders are considering to invest in Africa. 5.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Innovative use of biomass is expected to potentially provide an important source of renewable energy in most SSA countries for domestic, handicraft and industrial use, but greater optimisation is needed in the use of existing solid biofuels for renewable energy generation: forestry and agro- industry by-products, residues and waste for medium scale generation. 2. Justification/background information A large amount of resources with high energy potential remains either poorly or completely unexploited today (e.g. wood harvest residues, sawdust, wood-ships, crop residues and agro- industries residues and waste). Additionally, the potentials for energy-generation from agro- 199 European charcoal market is booming and eperts from SSA to Europe or South Africa could be a starting point to promote and disseminate new technologies in SSA. ",
        "185 industrial by-products and energy crops treatment (e.g. such as cassava, sugarcane, wheat, miscanthus, and short rotation coppice) seem to be still suboptimal. Resources existing in most SSA countries are still largely considered as without energy value and as such they are poorly exploited. Greater information, knowledge and awareness of such potentials is therefore required and support for innovative practices is needed throughout the energy-production value chain (e.g. identification of energy potentials, improvement of logistics for harvesting, reduction of cost for collection/transportation, and improvement of waste management). 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation Learning from the past in Europe and SSA: Specific studies can be promoted in order to highlight opportunities, identify success stories and business models for energy generation from solid biofuels residues for self-use and/or transmission to the national or local grids (e.g. lessons from bagasse valorisation in Mauritius, Kenya and European overseas departments before replication). Energy analysis of selected SSA agro-industries, resources and needs: Pilot projects should be promoted to incentivise local analysis of energy-balance for selected agro-industries: resources, energy and raw materials needs for selected sectors such as palm oil, cotton, cashew nut, peanut, karate, mango, rice, coffee, cocoa, cassava, etc. Developing resources and technologies: C alls for proposals can aim at a range of strategic initiatives, essential in the correct development of the sector, including specific components to support local capacity building in these areas. Initiatives to be promoted are the followings: \uf0b7 Resource identification: quantities and physical/chemical characteristics in order to evaluate and promote technical and economical viable pathways in the forestry and agro-industrial sectors; \uf0b7 Selection and development of technologies for densification of solid biofuels depending on characteristics of available resources: assessment of the various residues and their capacities to be mixed for densification and binding; tests and assessment; \uf0b7 Selection and development of thermo-chemical combustion technologies adapted to the specific African solid biofuels resources, and expected generation : heat, power or co- generation for different plant size, tests and assessment. Developing new generation technologies for rural electrification in remote areas: Research programmes can be deployed for the development of power generation processes (including small size co-generation - less than 1MW) in remote areas: example, the gasification process. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 Valorisation of biomass residues, substitution to the traditional biomass and increase of local resource use at local and/or national level - main potential advantages: a high capacity factor (up to 95%) and low energy costs (5 to 15 Euro cents per kWh); \uf0b7 Promotion of agro-industries using their own waste for self-use, reducing the energy costs and shortages of power - most of the agro processing sector in SSA suffers from frequent energy shortages, leading the companies to buy very expensive standalone diesel generators that could actually be replaced by biomass generators; \uf0b7 Promotion of locally manufactured and maintained technologies; \uf0b7 Increase of rural and permanent electrification using locally available solid biofuels and avoiding fossil fuels or hybrid systems; \uf0b7 Local employment and revenues due to collection and transformation of solid biofuels; \uf0b7 Avoiding GHG and traditional biomass depletion ",

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Local production of liquid biofuels for local applications should be promoted, depending on the envisaged performances and most efficient available energy sources across SSA countries. 2. Justification/background information Two dominant types of liquid biofuels are currently identified: bio-ethanol and biodiesel issued from by-products and energy crops. These can be produced for direct local usage or mixed with petroleum products to be distributed at the national level so to reduce the imports of fuel from abroad. First generation projects are barely financially viable (besides sugar cane conversion into bio-ethanol) and some operate at a loss or have even stopped their operation. Second generation (i.e. conversion of cellulosic biomass into a variety of products including bio-ethanol) has become interesting for SSA countries and bio-refineries are expected to play a key role in the second generation of biomass conversion in the future. Still, further research is required to assess the most efficient type of sources for biofuel production across SSA. In fact, despite a lot of efforts so far, jatropha has not proven its technical/economic competitiveness, whilst other crops might be more suitable for the SSA arid climate (i.e. camelinasativa) . This non-food crop shows in fact a long-term ability to economically produce sufficient oil seeds and to significantly expand production to meet the overall local demand. Furthermore, other possibly more-efficient approaches exist for liquid biofuels in SSA than the current \u201cmainstream initiatives\u201d (e.g. simple local processing of local resource for local usage: press and filter vegetable oil for direct use in local diesel engines) and these require further research and investigation before becoming fully deployable at commercial level. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation R&I needs for promotion of local production and applications: Specific studies and research initiatives are to be supported in a variety of promising areas, such as: ",

Building up standards for production, incorporation and use. R&I needs for National level production: Similarly, specific studies and support activities aimed for research capacity building and better R&I infrastructures can be promoted, so to: \uf0b7 Focus on improving profitability by finding higher-value use for by-products, greater oil- processing efficiency, developing seed varieties and optimizing cultivation practice; \uf0b7 Studies on land right issues /acquisition of large amount of land for biofuels; \uf0b7 Fill the knowledge gaps on food security as defined by the FAO (availability, access, stability of supply and utilisation); \uf0b7 Develop a research cooperation platform in the field of bio refineries , developing pilot plants and pilot projects such as yeasts for ligno-cellulosic conversion. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 Providing biofuels with large added value at local and territorial level; \uf0b7 Access to energy for rural areas, increasing the capacity for local services; \uf0b7 Induce economic development as a result of local transformation of products and added value; \uf0b7 Providing new solutions for domestic needs: lighting, cooking, grinding; \uf0b7 Reducing rural depopulation through increased quality of life; \uf0b7 Controlling ecosystem damage and land use. 5.

        "188 7.2.8 Exploit Biogas potential from Agro-industries (A.8) 1. Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Research should be conducted with the most efficient means to optimise the biomass potential to produce biogas at a medium-scale level from agro-industries, based on available technologies, expected biomass resources availability and substrate specificities. 2. Justification/background information Waste and by-products of agro-industries (e.g dairy farms and slaughter houses), as well as municipal humid wastes and residues represent an important potential for biogas production: on average 200 MW per SSA country. Technologies required for a full exploitation of such sources are well known: i) biogas (mixture of methane -CH 4 and carbon dioxide-CO 2 ) production through anaerobic digestion is convenient for many humid wastes transformation processes and devices such as bio-digesters (large or small); ii) anaerobic digestion could also be used for treatment of polluted waste streams (such as waste water). Specific advantages of biogas are i) compost (a by-product) has a huge added value as organic fertiliser increasing food production, and; ii ) It has an easy storage potential avoiding intermittence. Nevertheless, a limited awareness and dissemination of such practices across SSA countries prevents an optimal take-up of relatively simple biogas technologies. Domestic biogas digesters also represent an important potential, but no specific research and innovation activity is required. Several donors are involved in the promotion of the technologies and aim at installing 2 million digesters for African households by 2020. Although tests have been launched many years ago, there is not much dissemination across SSA. In sum, the need for greater awareness is key, as well as the promotion of specific skills and capabilities in order for implementation and maintenance to be managed locally. This in turn improves resilience of such installed infrastructures. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation Research is currently being done across all stages of the biogas production cycle and aims at increasing the relative efficiency of the processes, from crop cultivation and the biogas production installation to the biogas producing unit. Priority should be given to medium-scale /commercial digesters for agro-industries.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Proper assessment of waste-to-energy potentials for existing waste streams (type of waste, collection mode and quantities available for energy generation) requires specific skill-sets and methodologies. These are often lacking but are key to attract investments and trigger innovation. 2. Justification/background information Proper management of urban waste can be an opportunity for energy generation in growing urban areas, which are much in need of sustainable energy for metropolitan households and businesses. But energy potentials vary depending on the types of locally-produced waste (e.g. due to business processes and food consumed), the existing mix of humid and solid by-products (e.g. wood) ",
        "190 collected and specific climatic conditions (e.g. rain levels and seasonal effects on dry waste). Proper urban waste management therefore requires specific assessment procedures and skills (operational and analytical) to be in place and joint efforts by policy-makers, researchers and businesses involved in the sector. Such assessment should also cover the current performance of existing digesters at wastewater treatment plants (digestion of sewage sludge). And yet, lack of capabilities of city regulators and policy-makers and the limited economic incentives for the ecosystem of enterprises and research organisations to innovate in the sector, provide serious obstacles for the development of waste-to-energy potentials in SSA urban areas (both larger and smaller urban conglomerates). Therefore, a systematic analysis of waste-management cycles is to be promoted, whilst concrete approaches to introduce efficient waste-to-energy tools are required. This must be done by supporting innovative pilot projects at the urban level, both for the energy assessment and the implementation of sustainable tools and processes 200 . 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation \uf0b7 Research and adaptation initiatives to identify existing assessment tools and methodologies, aimed at mapping energy potentials for the mix of wastes managed in urban landfills, and tailor these to local practices and needs; \uf0b7 Pilot projects aimed at adopting the previously identified tools and methods, so to assess real energy potentials of urban waste in SSA cities (larger and smaller) and support decision makers and potential stakeholders (including investors) locally and internationally; \uf0b7 Small-scale demonstration projects in the implementation of new concepts and practices in sustainable waste-to-energy bio-digesters for urban settlements; \uf0b7 Study of specific features for promising types of urban waste streams (scale, type of waste, waste producer, optimal territorial level of management and type of processes needed), development of business models and assessment of financial feasibility for the implementation of efficient urban systems for waste-to-energy management; \uf0b7 Assessment of the cost structure of processing activities, differentiating between e.g. centralised or decentralised processing schemes, low or high levels of required technology); \uf0b7 Analysis of the capacity needed to fully implement such structures as well as the gap analysis and identification of type of support needed to up-skill local human resources; \uf0b7 Support capacity building activities accordingly to the results of the promoted studies. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA Direct benefits for local communities through increased access to energy supply, due to an improvement in understanding local urban waste-to-energy potentials and maximisation of the actual production capacity at the local level. Improved knowledge and awareness of urban waste- to-energy potentials across different actors in the sector, and the acquired greater skills in developing \u201cbankable\u201d solutions and business models which fit local contexts, will generate greater business opportunities for local entrepreneurs with positive local economic returns in the mid/long- term. On a longer-term scale, the growing awareness by policy makers in assessing energetic potentials of urban waste management, coupled with greater capacity acquired in better planning and implementation of urban waste-to-energy regulation, may result in more stable and efficient local waste-to-energy systems. Such improved systems result in a range of indirect benefits, from a general increase of basic sanitary condition due to stable electrification, up to environmental benefits due to reduced environmental and health impacts of \u201ctraditional\u201d energy sources (e.g. lower pollution, improved waste-water treatment for local landfills). 200 Existing initiatives (e.g. Smart Cities Information System - concerto.eu) could be discussed ",
        "191 5. Benefits/Impacts for Europe The promotion of smart and sustainable cities is an essential policy goal for the EU and local policy makers across EU urban settlements. Promotion of EU-SSA partnerships can be instrumental in creating economic incentives for a stronger EU industry (including R&I expertise) in such an essential and relatively underdeveloped sector for the EU industry (i.e. urban waste-to-energy promotion). In the longer term, it can provide an area for further experimentation and diversification of current practices and solutions, so to achieve stronger global appeal. It can help to introduce a platform for the promotion of innovative EU approaches and technologies in sustainable and \u201csmart\u201d cities. As such, EU-SSA partnerships can ultimately result in the promotion of more sustainable implementations within the EU, due to lessons learnt in a very diverse environment. 6.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Bioenergy technologies can provide efficient solution in supplying territories with the much-needed energy sources. To do so, a careful assessment of local value chains is required, which implies complex skill sets, methodologies and tools to be locally available. This is often not the case. 2. Justification/background information A major challenge lies in the assessment of energy potentials throughout the entire value chain bioenergy production pathways as highlighted hereby. ",
        "192 Source: Hawai\u2018i Natural Energy Institute, 2012. Potentials in generating greater spatial efficiencies require an effective assessment of production opportunities and needs in a given territory. Such assessment requires additional skills and capabilities in order to map the whole production process and consequently identify the best techniques and operations for efficient local bioenergy generation. Essential support should be given in properly modelling energy potentials by analysing the specific components. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation a) Research and adaptation initiatives to identify existing assessment tools and methodologies, aimed at mapping energy potentials for bioenergy value chains, tailor-made to local needs; b) Pilot projects aimed at adopting the previously identified tools and methods, so to assess real energy potentials as well as other by-products to be potentially produced, and support decision makers and potential stakeholders (including investors) locally and internationally; c) Assessment of the cost structure of processing activities, differentiating between e.g. centralised or decentralised processing schemes, low or high levels of required technology); d) Small-scale demonstration projects in the implementation of new concepts and practices in sustainable use of bioenergy value chains at the local level, so to provide access to energy supply for local communities and businesses and trigger global investors\u2019 interest; e) Analysis of the capacity needed to fully implement such business-models as well as the gap analysis and identification of type of support needed to up-skill local human resources; f) Support capacity building activities accordingly to the results of the promoted studies, possibly also through the promotion of dedicated platforms so to share good practices in the area across SSA countries and macro-regions (and even between SSA and EU practitioners). 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA Direct benefits for local communities are increased understanding of bioenergy potentials in a given territory, resulting in more efficient exploitation of local potentials through the adoption and/or development of innovative technologies. This will result in a greater access to energy supply. ",
        "193 Greater capacity and awareness across different actors in the sector, and the ability to develop \u201cbankable\u201d solutions and business models for maximising local biogas value chain potentials, is expected to have beneficial economic returns for local business communities in the mid-term. On a longer-term scale, greater awareness by policy makers implies better planning and implementation of urban waste-to-energy regulation Therefore resulting in an generally improved territorial energetic capacity, which enables greater access to schooling, sanitation and more efficient and competitive business environment. The promotion of an efficient and sustainable energy system (e.g. recycling, energy-efficiency) is also expected to reduce environmental impacts, identified for less \u201cclean\u201d traditional energy sources such as fire-wood or incineration (e.g. air pollution, black- waters leaking). It is important, in the implementation of such technologies, to give careful attention to the possible negative impacts of bioenergy technologies: from the potential excess of water requirements, which can result in reducing access to clean water for local communities, up to the possible negative impact for local food production. These need to be carefully assessed and can be avoided \u2013 or least mitigated \u2013 by focussing on possible synergies suggested by good practices. 5. Benefits/Impacts for Europe Understanding of the interplay amongst different specific RETs throughout specific value chains has been a growing trend in Europe, although practical implementations are still highly embryonic. Promotion of EU-SSA partnerships can be instrumental in creating incentives for stronger EU-SSA scientific and industrial relations (including R&I expertise) in a relatively embryonic emerging sector (i.e. energy efficiency in biomass value chains). The specificities of SSA ecosystems and agro- industry productions can in fact induce greater exchange of know-how and industrial practices with the EU. And as such become an incentive for the promotion of local \u201cgreen economies\u201d across the EU, so to reduce CO2 emissions, promote greater energy efficiency and shift towards a more efficient adoption of sustainable and renewable local sources. 6.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Most of the existing research initiatives are currently fragmented and should therefore be streamlined in a technical network by promoting EU-SSA research cooperation on specific subjects deemed to be of relevant mutual interest (e.g. agro-industries residues or liquid biofuels). ",
        "194 2. Justification/background information Full exploitation of the bioenergy potential in SSA requires a number of different processing technologies to be in place, the right mix of which depends on local specificities (i.e. potential energy supply and demand). A great variety of local bioenergy potential in fact has emerged, depending on local patterns in climate conditions, deforestation, cultural habits, urbanisation, exports products, etc. Nevertheless, even though the past decade saw pilot projects being developed across SSA and globally, these remain in a relatively infant stage and their results are not well-enough disseminated. Greater reflections on the lessons learnt from the past could be promoted by strengthening cooperation channels between research centers and universities in SSA and the EU. Key question to address in such a network is: what has worked well and what not so well in promoting bioenergy in SSA? 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation A technical network on advanced bioenergy should work on all topics linked with biomass development, similarly to what is already in place for EU-Latin America cooperation (i.e. the WIP- RFA, COMPETE), for Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria (Biomass Web- Bonn University BMZ financing) or for Forest Biomass network in West-Africa (UN-REDD): \uf0b7 Research and cooperation should primarily focus on using second-generation biomass (agro- industries residues) in order to identify the resources and the effective potential, standards, good practices; \uf0b7 Another opportunity is liquid biofuel and research cooperation on bio-refineries under the responsibility of Stellenbosch University (S.A.) linked with institutions as 2iE (Burkina Faso), the African Centre for Technology Studies in Kenya, Dar es Salaam University, and relevant centres in Europe; \uf0b7 Mobilising the interest of the private investors is another relevant area of network- development, for example by favouring joint ventures with European companies in order to prepare pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for bioenergy projects. \uf0b7 Specific capacity building initiatives could also be promoted in order to support the professional growth on network participants, for example by promoting exchanges of researchers across the network. 4.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation The fact that small-scale hydropower projects are very site-specific and that micro and pico size means small, fragmented sales, calls for more local content both in terms of engineering and products supply. Skills development and localisation of manufacturing would foster the deployment of the technology. 2. Justification/background information Small-scale hydropower shows significant potential in sub-Saharan Africa, albeit largely untapped. Development of small-scale hydropower strongly relies on imported equipment and foreign technical skills. The development of local engineering expertise, local manufacturing capacity and local maintenance skills would help tapping more efficiently this fragmented market. In addition, there is a lack of capitalisation on past experience and good practice regarding micro-hydropower projects implementation. Building up recommendation guidelines based on past experience and specific business cases would help increase quality and sustainability of small-scale hydropower projects in sub-Saharan Africa. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation Research should primarily focus on developing an incremental approach for localising production and developing local skills. This should be done in light of the potential local markets and their specificities, and take into account the lessons learnt from past projects, thanks to best practice case studies. Capacity building is a key component of this approach. The following activities are part of the scope: \uf0b7 Market assessment study. The study will be conducted in the involved SSA countries and will include: - Identification of existing business cases for on-grid and off-grid small scale hydropower development; - Assessment of the required market base for sustainable local manufacturing activity and identification of potential anchor clients (industrial, agricultural, domestic) for off-grid development; - Identification of required skills and expertise in involved countries, assessment of existing gaps and related capacity building needs; \uf0b7 Development of a strategy for localising production.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation The development of geothermal energy is limited due to high investment leading to financial risk of exploration. Some specific applied research may valorise direct use of heat and steam that cannot be used for power generation and grid connection 2. Justification/background information East African countries represent a huge potential (more than 15 000MW) for geothermal energy, but the main barrier to geothermal development is the investment cost (drilling equipment) and the financial risk of exploration. Some regional initiatives such as the \u201cGeothermal Compact\u201d(World Bank / Iceland), the \u201cGeothermal Risk Mitigation Facility\u201d (African Union Commission) and the EU- Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (EIB), are focusing on surface studies, exploration and management of the exploratory drilling risk (40% of the global cost is represented by the first well).\u201c ",
        "197 Technology does exist and is fairly mature for high enthalpy (220\u00b0C to 250\u00b0C) but it is limited to small spots and the exploration risk appears if the temperature in the well decreases (less than 200\u00b0C). Low and medium enthalpy (100-200\u00b0C) is likely to expand because of existing wells (exploration failure) but needs applied research for direct use and power generation. It must be integrated (optimisation of the resources) with high enthalpy exploration. There is a greater potential than for high enthalpy but the technology must be adapted/developed and evaluated. Direct use will also reduce the transaction risk regarding the tariff paid by electricity companies per kWh. Private investors, power companies and industries may be reassured if outlets are diversified. Many countries in East Africa, especially in the Rift Valley, but also in Europe or in the Caribbean and in Pacific territories (overseas departments) are concerned by this issue. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation a) Component 1 (refer LCE2): Research on the opportunity to valorise steam or heat from medium enthalpy (100 to 200\u00b0) for direct use: utilities for industries (textile, dairies, wood dryers, etc.) or other economic activities (horticulture, green houses). \uf0b7 Assessment of market base through prefeasibility studies regarding steam and power distribution to industries and commercial activities located in the vicinity of existing (or potential) drilling areas; \uf0b7 Adaptation and development of technologies to generate power from medium enthalpy; \uf0b7 Feasibility to feed in isolated grids in the range of 1 to 10MW for nearby communities including remote areas and volcanic islands; \uf0b7 Assessment and reduction of production and distribution costs. b) Component 2 (refer LCE3): Develop and demonstrate through pilot projects the feasibility of heat and steam direct use, and the reliability of technologies/equipment which could be manufactured and managed locally. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 Development of geothermal energy up to 10% or more in the Rift Valley countries; \uf0b7 Valorisation of dozens of failed or lost wells; \uf0b7 Reduction of geothermal exploration risks; \uf0b7 Diversification of production and capacity in order to share the risks with several clients; \uf0b7 Attract industries and specific activities with cheap utilities. 5.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation The development of a network of well-established research centers, recognized as poles of excellence is a prerequisite to foster EU-SSA cooperation in the field of research. Capacity building in research will lead to a higher level of skills and the ability to perform more pertinent and more useful research. 2. Justification/background information \uf0b7 The study has identified a number of research centers which are active and well connected to universities and other African/EU centers. They are progressing well, but they are still lacking equipment and financial resources (except for some South African universities). See Chapter 4 \u201cOverview of SSA R\u00a7I capacity\u201d and annex list of main centers involved in RE; \uf0b7 On the other hand, it is recognized by many European researchers and donors that SSA universities and research centers are the most appropriate base to adapt \u201cin situ\u201d small scales and intermediate technologies., in particular in the bioenergy field where SSA resources and opportunities are large. There is also a huge potential for small solar / wind systems for local communities / territories; \uf0b7 Among the weaknesses identified 201 : - Poor physical infrastructure (internet connection / laboratory equipment); - Tendency to produce low impact research; - Lack of accountability of supervisors; - Lack of support from donors (international and bilateral - see chapter 6) as well as from national authorities for research and innovation(see chapter 4); \uf0b7 Limited connection with private sector and private sector needs reinforcement of SSA research centers \u201cattractiveness\u201d. It would encourage SSA students to pursue their career in research. This will also encourage African students in Europe and the African Diaspora to go back to their home countries, preventing researchers \u2018brain drain\u2019 to Europe, USA Canada, China; \uf0b7 Similarly, recognized poles of excellence in SSA would facilitate partnership with European universities and the secondment of European researchers who may fear the lack of a proper environment to pursue their research and career in Africa.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Insight in RE resource potential is consistently identified as a need for further uptake of RET\u2019s. Specifically, relevant SSA actors on the ground have insufficient information on resource potential, need more knowledge about the availability and need more expertise for utilising existing datasets. 2. Justification/background information Data on resource availability and accessibility is conditional for RE development and private sector involvement in the RE sector. The quality and availability of resource maps differ strongly across the SSA region and by type of technology. Obviously, detailed resource mapping is not needed when conditions appear inappropriate or where demand would not materialise. Hence, a staged or multi-layered approach is needed: scoping prior to detailed work. Furthermore, some resources require a dynamic approach: regular updates of wind maps are needed, whilst this is less the case for solar or geothermal sources 203 . A wide number of international actors are active in the field of resource mapping, both international organisations (e.g. IRENA, Worldbank, UNEP) as well as bilateral actors (e.g. Danish bilateral cooperation), also indirectly supported by the EC. 204 Nevertheless, and despite the above efforts, an overview on the various mapping efforts is not well known to SSA actors on the ground. As a consequence, national and regional policy makers and renewable energy operators are not fully informed about the precise renewable energy potential \u2013 needed to develop renewable energy 203 For example, large-scale high-resolution wind resource mapping in South Africa has been completed now, in cooperation between South African and Danish institutions. 204 Through activities in the REMEA programme, revolving around three themes: - Mapping renewable energy raw resources in Europe and Africa - Monitoring renewable energy deployment in Europe and in Africa - International scientific cooperation and networking REMEA also hosts the interactive tool RE2nAF (Renewable Energies for Rural Electrification of Africa), a GIS-based simulation tool for off-grid electricity production options in Africa. ",
        "201 policies, strategies and investment projects. This is partially due to the fact that much of the resource mapping is currently done by international experts, while local actors are often much less involved or informed. This is seen in the SSA region as a missed opportunity as local knowledge of specific African circumstances is crucial. Stepping up the involvement of SSA actors would not only build capacities, and promote cooperation but also contribute to cost savings, and longer-term sustainable use of the information collected. Another challenge lies in the fact that the results of resource mapping are not necessarily shared and disseminated to the full. This can be due to technical reasons (compatibility of GIS systems) but sometimes also due to a hesitance or reluctance to openly share all available results \u2013 even when funded with public resources. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation Resource mapping would apply to wind, solar (PV, CSP), hydro and geothermal energy sources primarily, and synergies between these renewable technologies are expected to exist. Initiatives in the area of biomass (e.g. Biomass Atlas for Africa) would be included in this scope as well. \uf0b7 A meta-approach to resource mapping ; including an inventory of mapping techniques in use, areas and technologies mapped, a shared platform and overviews of actors in the field \u2013 both European, international and local actors; assessment of mapping techniques particularly suitable in the SSA context; \uf0b7 Identify focus areas for resource mapping : the SSA region is vast in size and it is not realistic to expect that resource mapping for all technologies would take place with similar levels of detail. Therefore, it is important to work with a multi-layered approach, identify focus areas (scoping) and build a view on priority areas \u2013 e.g. following the \u2018Red Zone\u2019 approach as promoted by the CSIR in South Africa; \uf0b7 Guidance and training on resource mapping : building on approaches implemented by IRENA, JRC and others, and allowing SSA stakeholders to get involved in such activities. Complementary training activities \u2013 e.g. building on existing curriculae in this area; \uf0b7 Adjusting techniques and practices to SSA conditions : the climatic, geographic and geological conditions in the SSA region are often different from those in other regions. Adjusting techniques and practices can help to improve the quality of resource mapping; \uf0b7 A platform for Resource mapping in SSA region : initiatives which would bring together EU and SSA actors currently active or with interest in this activity; \uf0b7 Promote dissemination and use of results : dissemination actions aimed at policy makers as well as renewable energy operators, pointing to the availability of this information, the analysis and use of their results. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 Informed policy makers, and therefore improved renewable energy policies in the SSA region; \uf0b7 Improved conditions for RE uptake in the SSA region, hence reduced barriers for RE operators; \uf0b7 Increased efficiency due to targeted actions and coordination of actors, and improved returns on investment; \uf0b7 Improved resource mapping techniques, tailored to the needs of the region; \uf0b7 Increased capacities by SSA research organisations involved, and strengthened potential for EU-SSA cooperation in this area. 5.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation The expected large-scale deployment of renewable energy in SSA raises the question of their environmental, social and economic impact \u2013 both positive and negative. While it has become virtually mandatory to conduct ex-ante impact assessment for new projects, too little is known of the ex-post, cumulative impact of existing RE infrastructure. As a crucial starting point, it is important to acknowledge that the impacts of RET uptake in SSA are often significantly different from those found in Europe, as well as across SSA countries. This is due to significant differences in local ecosystems, socio-economic contexts and basic societal needs. A reliable and thorough assessment of such impacts requires the development of sound methodologies that can be adapted to the specificities of local contexts. ",
        "203 2. Justification/background information The attention paid to the possible negative consequences of large infrastructure projects has been consistently increasing over the past years. Sound policies, frameworks and methodologies now exist to assess and manage the environmental impacts of energy projects. For the most part initiated by international financiers such as the World Bank, these policies and methods were progressively integrated into the legal framework of many African countries. However, impact assessment often remains a one-off effort undertaken by project promoters in view of obtaining environmental clearances. As it is usually carried out by private consultancies, African researchers are not enough involved in impact assessment resulting in limited publication of results in peer- reviewed journals and insufficient capitalisation/dissemination. Little is done to assess, measure and monitor the impacts of RE infrastructure after construction \u2013 for instance the long-term, basin-wide impact of cascade hydropower. Also, while impact assessment is mandatory for large RE projects, it is usually not the case for small-scale developments \u2013 even though the cumulative impact of e.g. thousands of PV panels and batteries can be huge. Although the positive social impacts of energy access projects are widely acknowledged, they are rarely measured with appropriate accuracy. Advancing the knowledge from past RE deployment is crucial for informing decisions on new projects. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation a) Collaborative research on the impact of RE projects. The objective is here to foster EU-SSA scientific cooperation in the field of impact assessment, with a suggested focus on (a) the ex- post monitoring of RE projects (for instance: impact of fuel crops (eg. jatropha) on local agriculture and water use; environmental impact of large dams in SSA) and (b) the meta- analysis of donor-funded energy access projects (for instance: actual impact of improved stoves on indoor air pollution; of RE-based rural electrification on local economic development). This action could be implemented as a call for joint research proposals; b) Building SSA\u2019s research capacity in impact assessment/monitoring. The aim is to increase the capacity of the SSA scientific community to become a key stakeholder in impact assessment/monitoring. It will include support for research infrastructure (eg. portable measuring instruments, mapping tools, laboratory equipment) as well as human capacity development (training, internships). Twinning with European laboratories could be envisaged (see 7.3.3); c) Capacity building for policy makers. This will cover training on Environmental and Social Impact Assessment; Strategic Environmental Assessment; Monitoring and Evaluation. Such capacity building activities will be more efficient if associated with concrete realizations eg. drafting of an Energy Policy document of developing a specific RE project. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 Informed policy makers, and therefore improved renewable energy policies in the SSA region; \uf0b7 Increased ownership of RE projects by the local scientific community leading to increased civil society participation; \uf0b7 Improved effectiveness of RETs as environmental and socio-economic impacts are better measured; \uf0b7 Improved overall costs and benefits analyses, and improved social acceptance for RET projects; \uf0b7 Potential for best practice sharing between SSA regions as RET success stories start to arise; \uf0b7 Increased capacity by SSA local experts and research organisations involved. 5. Benefits/Impacts for Europe \uf0b7 Increased outreach and leadership of European research on environmental impacts of RET; ",

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Both European and African innovative SMEs developing new solutions for increased energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa need support throughout their development cycle from proof-of-concept phase to testing, demonstration, piloting and market introduction. 2. Justification/background information Energy access is generally not perceived as an attractive market, but there are many activities run by innovative European, American and African SMEs targeting this bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market through the use of local renewable resource. The reduction of PV costs has boosted the development of new business approaches to deliver energy services with \u2018smart\u2019 solar systems. Innovation is not limited to solar: load management technologies, smart power inverters, pre- payment meters and the rapid uptake of mobile banking provide new opportunities while innovative solutions for clean cooking and sustainable biomass use are also developed. But not all BOP- oriented innovations will turn into viable commercial enterprises: developing an efficient business model, in particular as regards last-mile distribution, can be tricky. Supporting mechanisms already exist for these SMEs 205 : business plan and innovation contests that provide seed money and/or business coaching, facilitation of access to equity financing, dedicated investment funds and credit lines. But not all Africa-based SMEs have the capacity to access these mechanisms, which often require some kind of international exposure. Furthermore, most of the available support is oriented towards energy generation, with little in place to foster innovation in maintenance and monitoring of existing equipment. 205 To name a few: business plan contests include SEED, the African Union Kwame Nkrumah Scientific Awards, the WAFCEF (West Africa Forum for Clean Energy Financing). Incubators for innovative SMEs: Climate Innovation Centers (Kenya, Ethiopia), 2iE incubator (Burkina Faso). An ongoing programme by IRENA and DFID supports experience sharing between Asian and African incubators. ",
        "205 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation Proposed cooperation activities would have to complete, rather than duplicate, the existing supporting mechanisms for innovative SMEs: \uf0b7 Support to European and African incubators that select and assist promising start-ups developing Africa-specific innovative products and business models for increased energy access and rural electrification thanks to renewable energy sources. It will include e.g. support for building incubators\u2019 networking activities and business mentoring capabilities (addressing company creation aspects, legal and financial aspects, business management and intellectual property). Specific attention will be paid to the soundness of BOP-oriented business models and in particular, the challenge of distributing new products to poor, scattered populations. Target beneficiaries will be existing incubators located in Africa and in Europe as well as African institutions intending to develop local incubators. EU-Africa twinning of incubators will be encouraged. This support could be organised as a call for proposals open to existing/planned incubators or alternatively, as a dedicated activity under a wider Capacity Building project; \uf0b7 Support to selected start-up companies for early stage development . The needs of start-ups include: innovation aid (advances, grants, interest-free loans to facilitate practical R&D and testing of innovative products and services in real field conditions in Africa), coaching for business plan preparation and business development, and support to business development at post incubation phase (seed loans for fundraising, guarantees, equity investment). This support could focus on start-ups developing innovative, workable approaches for the maintenance and monitoring of renewable energy equipment in the African context. It could be implemented as an extension of already existing instruments that support SMEs . 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 Increased innovation capacity; \uf0b7 Job creation; \uf0b7 Improvement of energy access for the bottom of the pyramid; \uf0b7 Positive social, economic and health impacts thanks to better energy access. 5.

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation There is a strong need to improve the quality of RET products in order to develop renewable energies in Africa. Across Renewable Energy technologies, issues of substandard quality have appeared: solar panels, small wind turbines, pico-hydro systems, biofuel quality \u2013 all have been affected by such concerns. This undermines the confidence and reputation of renewable energy in the region, as well as the willingness of investors in this domain. 2. Justification/background information Uncertainties about and consequences of low quality RET products provide a risk for RE development. This issue emerges especially for small wind turbines, pico-hydro systems, solar home systems, pico-PV products as well as biofuels. Efficient quality assurance, with appropriate testing facilities, provides the opportunity for setting product standards and introducing certification schemes. Implementing certification and labelling of products helps improving overall RE products quality, reliability and public acceptance of renewable energy. The EU has strong competencies in standard setting and Horizon 2020 support is currently provided to standard setting in biofuels (Call B.2.5). The World Bank\u2019s initiative Lighting Global is addressing quality standards for pico-PV and solar home systems. Regarding small wind turbines, there are existing standards, developed for instance in UK on the basis of compliance to IEC standards. The product certification of pico-hydro systems is much more an open field. One reason for this is the wide range of turbine designs. More than designing adapted standards for SSA, the first need is to support SSA authorities to build up their capacity to enforce existing standards within their domestic markets. The development of labels for small wind turbines and pico-hydro systems will help increase customers and installers\u2019 awareness and overall efficiency of these small systems. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation The overall scope is related to increasing human capacities and technical testing capacities in SSA, and to the implementation of labels for pico-energy products. The activities would have the following components: \uf0b7 Knowledge transfer and capacity development in SSA : The participation of CEN-CENELEC is required. The beneficiaries are the SSA national bodies including testing facilities; \uf0b7 Implementation of adequate testing equipment: in selected SSA testing centre and implementation of related training activities; \uf0b7 Technical assistance to the creation and implementation of labelling procedure, as well as awareness raising and communication. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA The identified research and cooperation activities shall lead to: \uf0b7 Increased quality and reliability of RE products and RE installations; \uf0b7 Increased public acceptance of renewable energy; \uf0b7 Increased penetration of small renewable energy systems, especially in remote areas. 5. Benefits/Impacts for Europe Third degree impacts for EU: ",

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Research into optimal RE integration onto the grid is identified as a need to further stimulate RE uptake. This research can be focused on the societal costs of grid-integration, synergies between integrating multiple RET\u2019s and optimal grid management under high RE penetration. 2. Justification/background information Maintaining grid stability is a major challenge for uptake of renewable energy. This is primarily due to the volatile production patterns of major renewable energy technologies like solar PV and wind. On a day to day basis, production patterns are forecasted based on weather patterns, of which especially the production pattern of wind energy is difficult to forecast. To a lesser extent, this is also the case for solar PV. This calls for, relative to conventional grid management, more complex balancing demand and supply, both from a temporal and spatial perspective. From a temporal perspective, the variability attached to some renewable energy sources impacts both the instant/short term activities for ensuring supply/demand balance \u2013 and hence grid stability \u2013 and the long term exercise of planning investments for additional generation capacity, taking into account the respective limitations, merits and costs of the different energy sources. While the expertise related to the ability for grids to accept variable renewable energy supply is growing in some European countries with advanced integration of renewable sources, African utilities lack knowledge and tools to address these issues. Some African utilities are facing challenges in the negotiation with private project holders willing to generate and inject RE power on existing grids because of uncertainties related to grid stability, especially in contexts where the grid itself is weak. From a spatial perspective, forecasts of energy demand are conditional for planning the investment related to grid extension, grid improvement and management of energy dispatching. Considering the long time it takes to realise (renewable) energy supply, mid and long term predictions on energy demand are required. This requires insight into complex regional socio-economic development. African authorities and utilities lack of expertise and tools for this activity. ",
        "208 All in all, increasing uptake of renewable energy is not a matter of just rolling out one technology, it is a complex symbiosis with significant modelling and planning challenges that increased EU-SSA cooperation can significantly help addressing. Additionally, as grid management is clearly a public task, public spending on research for improving its efficiency is justified. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation Dynamic energy supply modelling applies to all renewable electricity production, with a focus on the integration of variable sources like wind and solar PV. The following activities should be part of the scope: \uf0b7 Development of typologies : building on the resource mapping above, combining renewable energy technologies requires insight in commonly mutually occurring resource potential. Obviously, this will vary strongly based on geographical and climatic conditions; \uf0b7 Assessment of renewable energy merits , costs and synergies: for each of the developed typologies, merits, costs and synergetic combinations should be identified and assessed. For this assessment, a strategic societal cost-effectiveness analysis (levelised costs approach) should address the significance of grid integration on the real societal costs of renewables, i.e. including grid connection costs, reliability of supply and grid balancing costs. The technical and economic aspects of large grid-tied RE projects versus on-grid distributed small systems (PV in urban environment for instance) should be included in the analyses. The goal is to quantify potential benefits of renewable synergies under different context-dependent variables; \uf0b7 Model development for optimised renewable energy grid integration : a conceptual model should be developed for optimal grid management under high penetrations of renewable energies, and/or lower penetration in constrained grids. The aim is to provide a solid basis for grid planners and operators to improve the efficiency of inclusion of renewables onto the grid, and in general, remove a barrier for uptake of renewable energy; \uf0b7 Involvement of local utilities and grid operators : in order to ensure sustainable improvement of efficient inclusion of renewables onto the grid and grid management, involvement of local utilities, grid operators and researchers is crucial. This should be a partnership of capacity building and joint model development. Additionally, dissemination of the developed model and capacity building for other grid operators is part of the scope. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 Improved insight in optimal grid management under a high penetration of renewable energy; \uf0b7 Increased capacity of SSA grid operators and researchers for complex inclusion of renewables onto the grid; \uf0b7 Improved efficiency in grid management; \uf0b7 Improved grid stability, resulting in stimulation of the local investment climate; \uf0b7 Improved conditions for RE uptake. 5. Benefits/Impacts for Europe \uf0b7 Primarily, the European energy market obviously also faces challenges for RE integration onto the grid. There are clear differences between SSA and Europe, e.g. in grid penetration and reliability. Nonetheless, Europe can benefit from knowledge developed in this respect, especially because SSA has the opportunity to leapfrog: allowing development and testing of optimal \u2018greenfield designs\u2019. Consequently, this is, at least in part, a shared EU-SSA research need; \uf0b7 Improved insight in optimal grid management under a high penetration of renewable energy; \uf0b7 Further development of the SSA RE-market through improved conditions for RE uptake, indirectly providing market opportunity for European businesses and industry; \uf0b7 Climate change mitigation through the improved conditions for RE uptake; ",

Identification of SSA needs for Research and Cooperation Hybrid minigrids are advocated as an attractive solution for rural electrification and for islands. To actually unlock their development potential, there is a need for research and development regarding effective engineering designs and associated smart control devices to reduce storage needs, costs, complexity, and to set up standard designs. 2. Justification/background information Solar PV / Diesel hybrid minigrids are deploying at a slower pace than expected in Sub-Saharan Africa, mainly because of the technical complexity of systems, of the high cost of storage and the absence of standard designs and standard component blocks. Effective engineering designs to reduce storage requirement, associated with smart power management systems and new storage options (e.g. Lithium-ion batteries) can significantly reduce these barriers. On the islands of EU overseas territories, increasing the share of renewable energy in these small power generation systems requires to add storage capacity and to efficiently manage various intermittent RE sources (e.g. solar and wind). The power supply systems of these isolated grids are thus advancing towards smart hybrid systems. Research activities on these topics are taking place in the EU (at Fraunhofer ISE in Germany, at CEA-INES in France for instance) and cooperation activities exist with Sub-Saharan Africa 206 . Further support to these research and innovation activities and the involvement of key African research centres active in these fields would create seeds for wider deployment of improved, smart and cost-effective RE hybrid power generation systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, and would provide effective solutions to increase renewable energy share within European island grids. 3. Scope of possible research and cooperation The research and development activities should focus on: 206 For instance, the programme Flexy-energy at Institute 2iE, Burkina Faso, with EU support. ",

The activities should take into account the specificities of the various renewable energy sources (especially solar PV and wind energy) and of different mature or emerging storage technologies. Key European and African research centres should work in cooperation in order to provide opportunities for knowledge transfer as well as real field-testing in Sub-Saharan Africa. 4. Benefits/Impacts for SSA \uf0b7 Reduction of electricity generation costs in isolated grids due to higher penetration of local renewable energy generation; \uf0b7 Deferred investment for grid extension and grid reinforcements; \uf0b7 Increased electricity access in remote and rural areas; \uf0b7 Higher quality of power service in remote and rural areas and reduced service interruption thanks to reduced need for fuel transportation. 5.

        "211 8 Conclusions and Recommendations for EU- SSA international cooperation The aim of the study (Task 8) is to \u201cprovide recommendations that should enable the formulation of a clear strategy on whether and how to undertake a research and innovation programme that would be equitable and beneficial to EU and SSA in the area of renewable energy\u201d. It is important to understand that the challenges faced by the European Union in terms of energy and energy policy have commonalities but also substantial differences from the challenges faced by African countries. For example: \uf0b7 The main issue in SSA lies on the access to modern source of energy (only 20- 30% of the population is connected to the electricity grid); \uf0b7 Unlike the EU, wood and charcoal remain the main sources of energy in SSA; \uf0b7 GHG emissions in Africa, as a whole, are limited (2 to 3% of world emissions\u2026). 8.1 Overall conclusions Access to energy is a crucial pre-condition for further economic development of the African continent. Sub-Saharan Africa is blessed by an array of renewable energy sources which together provide a strong potential. Even though the current penetration of renewable energy in SSA is limited, apart from biomass and hydro, the future potential is substantial. Biomass, solar energy (PV, solar thermal as well as CSP) and hydropower can all play their part, while wind and geothermal have strong roles to play as well \u2013 all depending on the geographic context. This potential is currently underutilised due to limited demand, non-existing or incomplete grids, and policy frameworks which require substantial advancement. Despite previous investments in renewable energy in the region, the knowledge about their effectiveness and efficiency is partial and fragmented. EU-SSA research cooperation in this area can contribute substantially to boost medium- to long- term renewable energy take-up in the region. It can also strengthen the market position of EU players \u2013 in areas where they are strong. RET-specific research themes have thereto been proposed, including traditional and advanced bioenergy (biofuels, biogas, bioenergy value chains), various solar technologies (PV, solar heating and cooling, CSP), small-scale hydro and geothermal energy. Transversal research topics proposed include support to research infrastructures, resource mapping, impact assessment, innovative SMES and grid improvements (including energy supply modelling and smart hybrid mini-grids). Sequencing and organising such EU-SSA research cooperation deserves much attention. It requires the establishment of dedicated networks where EU and SSA researchers can meet, capacity needs to be put in place, and it is important to learn from what has worked in the past and what not. Furthermore, it also requires respecting of the existing policy frameworks, as well as a need to bringing research and industry closer together. Ample attention also needs to be paid to new business models which are adapted to the situation in the region. All these initiatives should contribute towards sustainable, longer-term deployment of renewable energy in SSA. ",
        "212 8.2 Initial assessment of the research themes Chapter 7 has provided an overview of areas of potential common interest for research cooperation between the EU and SSA. It has been deliberately broad and allows these themes to be taken forward in the context of various support frameworks, including but not exclusively Horizon 2020. An initial assessment of these 20 research themes has been carried out by reviewing them against five criteria as formulated within the project team. The following criteria have been identified: 1. Development potential of the RE technology based on the technical potential as provided in Chapter 2 of this report. 2. SSA capacity : potential to improve the capacity of SSA-based R&I institutions; based on the analysis as provided in Chapter 4 of this report. 3. Energy access : contribution of the initiative to improved energy access, either through grid or through off-grid solutions. 4. EU interest : is the theme interesting for EU stakeholders, including scientists and industry? 5. Public spending and market failure : is there a case for public intervention or could this initiative be taken forward by the market alone? And are there already existing policies that provide sufficient support to the theme? Figure 8.1 Initial assessment of the research themes A first observation is that all 20 themes investigated have positive scores on several of the criteria identified. Although there is some variation, none of the themes presented has a poor score which would allow it to be ignored. For details regarding the assessment see Annex IV. Amongst the highest priority themes can be counted the RET-specific themes related to solar PV and solar CSP, small-scale hydro, solar heating/cooling and improved stoves/charcoal. These are followed by the wide range of advanced bioenergy themes. Transversal themes with high scoring include resource mapping, impact assessment, quality infrastructure and grid symbiosis. Please note that this assessment does not refer to a prioritisation in time (see Chapter 8.5). ",
        "213 Evidently, the real value and impact of research cooperation would depend much on the quality and characteristics of projects and project applicants. 8.3 Building on Existing Science and Technology Cooperation Instruments In the recent past the SSA region has benefited from various R&I or DEVCO Cooperation programmes amongst which the main ones are: Table 8.1 Overview of recent EU cooperation programmes DG Research and Innovation DG DEVCO FP7 (with a budget of around 100 million EUR for SSA) including the 2010 \u201cCoordinated Africa Call\u201d EU-ACP Science and Technology cooperation Horizon 2020 (access to calls for proposals) EU-ACP Energy Facility 207 Erafrica SE4All Marie Sklodovska Curie Caast Net Plus ESASTAP (only for South Africa) PAERIP REMEA (JRC) AFRETEP (JRC) A detailed analysis of those instruments is provided in \u00a76.1. The main conclusions and lessons learnt from the above-mentioned programmes are the following. The framework for EU-SSA scientific cooperation is now well established \u2013 but participation across the SSA region is uneven Thanks to the experience accumulated over the last years, the framework for scientific cooperation between the EU and Africa is now firmly established. Existing platforms such as CAAST-Net Plus and ESASTAP Plus (for South Africa only), coupled with the growing network of National Contact Points, offer efficient communication channels to reach the African scientific community and advertise upcoming opportunities. The African participation in EU-funded scientific programmes remains however extremely uneven across the continent. Unsurprisingly, South Africa leads by far. Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda for Eastern Africa; Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, for Western Africa, are also quite active; one could also name Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cameroon, Tanzania... Many other countries are yet to enter the game. The bulk of this participation was under the 2010 \u201dcoordinated Africa call\u201d. Renewable energy is a relatively new topic for cooperation \u2013 with a few challenges Under FP7, EU-SSA cooperation on renewable energy remained a minor topic. But with other EU instruments also available, and excluding the EU-ACP Energy Facility, about twenty RE cooperation projects were funded, biomass and biofuels being the predominant topics. However, while RE is an important area for research both in Europe and in Sub-Saharan Africa, mutual ground is not always easy to find. A large part of SSA-based RE research revolves around the adaptation of existing technologies to the local conditions, which might be of limited interest for their European counterparts although it could also open business opportunities. The gap between SSA\u2019s and Europe\u2019s research capacity is also an important obstacle to the emergence of mutually beneficial partnerships. In this regard, most RE research projects that received funds from the EU until now, were funded by development instruments rather than research instruments. Also, the 207 Although it has a broader scope than R&I, it has been useful in financing demonstration or pilot projects. ",
        "214 private sector was until now almost absent \u2013 not only in RE, but in EU-SSA energy cooperation in general. Sound cooperation in RE will take time to build RE being a relatively new field for EU-SSA cooperation, the number of players having developed sufficient international linkage remains limited both in Africa and in Europe. Absorption capacity however is increasing: the high level of participation recorded in recent calls for proposals shows a strong potential for increased cooperation. But sound scientific partnerships only emerge through time, thanks to interpersonal relationships, common experience and mutual trust. New tools are thereto made available to applicants, such as brokerage events, matchmaking mechanisms and online partner search tools. Until now, most EU-funded research projects were prepared and led by European partners, while African partners play a secondary role. This is true in general under FP7 and holds true also in the case of RE projects. European scientists, who are more experienced in putting proposals together and in dealing with the administrative hurdles often associated with EU funding, are probably seen as more fit to lead. It must also be noted that the sense of ownership remains strongly related to the origin of funding: co-financing initiatives like ERAfrica are seen as a powerful tool to encourage co- ownership. 8.4 Towards a menu of cooperation instruments The assessment of research themes suggests there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 and that the variety of themes suggested calls for a tailor-made approach, where a menu of instruments could be deployed: \uf0b7 Axis 1: Dedicated SSA capacity building (e.g. dedicated H2020 Network actions) \uf0b7 Axis 2: Enhanced mobility of researchers (e.g. Marie Sklodowska-Curie) \uf0b7 Axis 3: Dedicated EU-SSA research cooperation (e.g. dedicated H2020 Africa call) \uf0b7 Axis 4: Mainstream research cooperation (e.g. H2020 Calls for proposals) \uf0b7 Axis 5: Targeted EU development cooperation (e.g. DEVCO, including EU-ACP cooperation) \uf0b7 Axis 6: Targeted bilateral cooperation (in targeted areas) In the Table below, we have grouped the above research themes by axis. As the above axes are not multiply exclusive, and as the research themes are deliberately broad at this stage, we have prioritised those according to the essential characteristics of the themes. ",
        "215 Table 8.1 A menu of cooperation instruments (research themes may appear in more than one Axis) Axis 1: Dedicated SSA capacity building Axis 2: Enhanced mobility of researchers Technical Network on Advanced Bioenergy (A.11) Promote R&I in Solar Heating and Cooling (A.2) Reinforcing SSA Research Infrastructure (B.1) Promote R&I in Concentrated Solar Power (A.3) A Strategic approach to Resource mapping (B.2) Reinforcing SSA Research Infrastructure (B.1) Impact assessment of RE deployment in SSA (B.3) A Strategic approach to Resource mapping (B.2) Impact assessment of RE deployment in SSA (B.3) Axis 3: Dedicated research EU-SSA cooperation Axis 4: Mainstream research cooperation Project developm. assistance for small-scale PV (A.1) Promote R&I in Solar Heating and Cooling (A.2) Socio-economic study on improved cook stoves (A.4) Promote R&I in Concentrated Solar Power (A.3) Improved charcoal production (A.5) Exploit Biogas from Agro-industries (A.8) Innovative use of Solid Biofuels (A.6) Assess Urban-Waste-to-Energy Potential (A.9) Local production of Liquid Biofuels (A.7) Applied research for Geothermal Energy (A.13) Exploit Biogas from Agro-industries (A.8) Enhancing grids through Dynamic Energy Supply Modelling (B.6) Assess Urban-Waste-to-Energy potential (A.9) Smart Hybrid Mini-grids (B.7) Assessment of potential Bioenergy Value Chains (A.10) Applied research for Geothermal Energy (A.13) Quality infrastructure and Testing Centres for RETs (B.5) Enhancing grids through Dynamic Energy Supply Modelling (B.6) Smart Hybrid Mini-grids (B.7) Axis 5: Targeted Development cooperation Axis 6: Bilateral cooperation Project develop. assistance for small-scale PV (A.1) e.g. Wind resource mapping (Denmark) Promote R&I in Solar Heating and Cooling (A.3) e.g. Ocean renewable energy (UK, Sweden) Socio-economic study on improved cookstoves (A.4) e.g. Hydropower (Norway, Austria) Improved charcoal production (A.5) Sustainable Small-scale Hydro (A.12) Supporting innovative SMEs in rural electrification (B.4) Axis 1: Dedicated capacity building initiatives EU-SSA cooperation can only be truly partnership-based if the capacities are in place. Although such capacities are clearly growing, they are only partially in place. Furthermore, there is much need for coordination and orchestration \u2013 as overlap and fragmentation are paramount in this area. Good examples in building research capacity exist, in renewable energy and beyond. The CAAST- Net Plus project and ESASTAP should be pursued with the request that CAAST-NET focuses more on Renewable Energy. ERAfrica seems to be an efficient instrument but its complementarity with other instruments should be analysed \u2013 and it has proven difficult to attract RE research projects. ",
        "216 Dedicated capacity building initiatives could focus on a number of initiatives, such as the Technical Network on Advanced Bioenergy, Reinforcing SSA Research Infrastructure, a Strategic approach to Resource mapping and Impact assessment of RE deployment in SSA. Research cooperation in general usually provides significant potential for capacity building. Considering the importance of human capacity for sustainable RE-uptake, capacity building should be included in the scope of cooperation instruments whenever possible, Axis 2: Enhanced mobility of researchers The Marie Sklodowska-Curie programme appears an attractive programme for stimulating researchers mobility also in RE between EU and SSA. However, it has proved difficult for many SSA researchers to pass the academic excellence test, and the programme allows for limited scope to focus on a theme such as renewable energy. It would be worthwhile to further explore possibilities for tailoring the programme to such specific needs. In this context, relationships with European knowledge centres could be built (e.g. CIRAD), or those European universities with a dedicated Master\u2019s programme in Renewable Energy. In addition to cooperation instruments specifically aimed at researcher mobility, other research cooperation programmes also provide significant potential to promote this (as proposed under Axis 1, 3 and 4). Axis 3: Dedicated research cooperation Throughout the research, stakeholders in both SSA and the EU have expressed strong interest in a dedicated Horizon 2020 \u201cAfrica Call\u201d, in line with a previous \u201cAfrica Coordinated Call\u201d in 2010). Back in 2010, the call was restricted to Health, Food Security and Environment. If renewed, a specific focus on renewable energy \u2013 and particularly on bioenergy research would be suggested. Under this heading could be placed a range of cooperation projects in both traditional and advanced biofuels, which are specific to the region and which would generate interest from both EU and SSA \u2013based researchers. In light of the limited overview and coordination in this area, it would be recommended to first put into place a number of capacity building initiatives (Axis 1), particularly a Technical network on Bioenergy \u2013 which would allow for coordination and prioritisation. When further developing such research cooperation, it is important to take full account of the existing and emerging institutions in the SSA, notably the African Union Commission, ECREEE and the South African government. But also other international organisations would need to be involved, such as (IRENA) \u2013 allowing for such an initiative to be properly embedded. In this context it is important to also remind of possibilities to find synergies with dedicated DEVCO initiatives, notably the EU-ACP Science and Technology cooperation programme (there are still two calls planned in the next four years). Should a call for proposals targeting RE in SSA be launched \u2013 whether under H2020 or another instrument \u2013 here are a few operational recommendations 208 that might help improve the outcome. Some of these recommendations are indeed already in place: \uf0b7 Involve African players from early on; if possible, from the call preparation stage onwards; \uf0b7 Organise information events in several African countries; 208 Depending on the funding instruments\u2019 rules and constraints, not all recommendations can be implemented. ",
        "217 \uf0b7 Make sure that pre-project financial support is available to allow for researchers to travel to/from Africa to write their proposals together, which is a recognised way of improving the proposals quality(like cost +,a specific tool or seed funding under Devco); \uf0b7 Propose matchmaking tools (online Partner Search, brokerage events\u2026) that can help ; set up a specific SSA H2020 contact point (for example RECP) to liaise with other NCP\u2019s or a specific Management Unit as in EU-ACP S\u00a7I cooperation programme); \uf0b7 Provide assistance during call preparation to help those unfamiliar with EU procedures prepare successful applications. Written guidelines are not enough; personal interaction is required (also refer to the above); \uf0b7 Take language barriers into account: allow participation in English, French and Portuguese; \uf0b7 Set realistic demands in terms of consortium composition as too high demands could act as a deterrent. For instance, request at least two EU and two SSA partners. In some cases African leadership could be made mandatory; alternatively, it could be considered an asset in evaluation; \uf0b7 South Africa being far more advanced, it should be treated as a specific case in the call; \uf0b7 Involve African players in proposal evaluation processes. Axis 4: Mainstream research cooperation Procedures for answering H2020 Calls, even if they have been simplified, remain complicated, time consuming and costly for SSA-based applicants. An easier entry-point for SSA-based applicants is to be involved as partner. Experience to date (particularly in other areas such as food, health and environment) has demonstrated that it is indeed possible for advanced researchers in the region to take part in regular H2020 calls. In the case of renewable energy, such cooperation is already existing in the area of Concentrated Solar Power, through involvement of South Africa. Axis 5: Targeted EU development cooperation Many SSA counties have earmarked Energy as a priority, thus some of the actions proposed, like environmental impacts could be included in FED National Indicative programmes or Regional indicative programmes (NIP/RIP). DEVCO FWC lot 4 could also be an easy way to launch some of the suggested research studies. Actions which can be grouped in this Axis are rather small-scale, deconcentrated projects with limited coordination needs. Furthermore, they include actions in areas which benefit the SSA region more so than the EU (e.g. cookstoves, charcoal). EU-ACP Energy Facility: This instrument, if pursued by DG DEVCO, would be most appropriate to co\u2013finance pilot or demonstration projects, a prerequisite to validate new technologies or to convince the stakeholders, in particular SME\u2019s, or the utilities, to apply new energy solutions based on renewable. However the impact of the three previous EU energy Facility calls is partly unclear and it would be useful to have an ex-post evaluation of the benefits of the pilot-demonstration projects in terms of energy performance and in terms of dissemination. This could be included when setting up a broader Impact Assessment programme (B.3). SE4all One should look also at the possibility to use the activity area 5 planned in the DEVCO programme SE4 all. In common with Activity area 2 (capacity building for policy and regulatory framework), Activity area 5 \u2018Industrial and technology cooperation\u2019 aims at developing know how and expertise in the beneficiaries countries on modern technological solutions, their comparable advantages and their construction and maintenance with a special focus on RE and EE technologies. This component will encourage exchange and experience, namely with technology providers and specialised companies through workshops, seminars, study tours, thematic conferences, etc. ",
        "218 Axis 6: Targeted Bilateral cooperation As has been presented in Chapter 6.4, many EU Member States have their own bilateral cooperation programmes, in a broad range of areas covering renewable energy. Some of this support (e.g. from Austria and Germany) is tied rather firmly to multilateral DEVCO aid (EUEI PDF facility). Although we have not been able to fully assess the rationale, effectiveness and impacts of the bilateral programmes presented in the context of this project, our impression is that there is substantial improvement for targeting such bilateral cooperation. Examples of targeted support in this context are Wind resource mapping done by Denmark in South Africa (WASA), Swedish ocean renewable support to Ghana, and Norwegian support in Hydropower to East Africa. In this context, one of the trends perceived is that many countries put emphasis and have developed programmes to promote business cooperation with European National technology holders or RE promoters, Finance prefeasibility studies and give the priority to projects or support projects where National RE specialists are involved. This current trend could be a way to overcome the lack of interest of African private sector and may help to overcome the credibility crisis thanks to the positive European experiences developing economical RE projects 8.5 Towards a staged R&I cooperation Evidently, the proper sequencing of these research themes would be crucial. We recommend that the initial focus is on dedicated SSA capacity building (including enhanced mobility of researchers). This would include the establishment of research networks, such a Technical network on Bioenergy. At the same time, selected participation in mainstream research cooperation would be worth pursuing (e.g. in CSP) \u2013 together with targeted EU development and bilateral cooperation in complementary areas. In the medium-term, dedicated EU-SSA research cooperation could be effective (e.g. H2020 Africa call focusing on bioenergy). Such an initiative would need to build on research networks established (e.g. a Technical network on Bioenergy). In the longer term, this would strengthen the potential of the SSA-region to participate in mainstream research cooperation. Figure 8.2 A staged approach to R&I initiatives In more detail: ",
        "219 Short-term (2015-2016): \uf0b7 Axis 1: Dedicated SSA capacity building (e.g. dedicated H2020 Network actions) \uf0b7 Axis 2: Enhanced mobility of researchers (e.g. Marie Sklodowska-Curie) \uf0b7 Axis 4: Mainstream research cooperation (e.g. H2020 calls in selected areas such as CSP) \uf0b7 Axis 5: Targeted EU development cooperation (e.g. DEVCO, including EU-ACP cooperation) \uf0b7 Axis 6: Targeted bilateral cooperation (in targeted areas) The mobilisation of SSA research capacity (Axis 1 and 2) would be complemented by existing DEVCO and bilateral cooperation instruments which would be increasingly targeted (both thematically and geographically). Medium-term (2016-2018): \uf0b7 Axis 3: Dedicated EU-SSA research cooperation (e.g. dedicated H2020 Africa call focusing on bioenergy) \uf0b7 Axis 4: Mainstream research cooperation (e.g. H2020 Calls for proposals) \uf0b7 Axis 5: Targeted EU development cooperation (e.g. DEVCO, including EU-ACP cooperation) \uf0b7 Axis 6: Targeted bilateral cooperation (in targeted areas) Building on the results from dedicated SSA Capacity building (E.g. Technical network on bioenergy), a dedicated EU-SSA research cooperation could be envisaged \u2013 focusing mostly on bioenergy topics. Meanwhile, other topics (such as CSP, Geothermal, Hydro) could be promoted through mainstream research cooperation. EU development cooperation and bilateral cooperation to further complement these in areas not covered. Longer term (2018 and beyond) \uf0b7 Axis 4: Mainstream research cooperation (e.g. H2020 Calls for proposals) \uf0b7 Axis 5: Targeted EU development cooperation (e.g. DEVCO, including EU-ACP cooperation) \uf0b7 Axis 6: Targeted bilateral cooperation (in targeted areas) The dedicated EU-SSA research cooperation initiative would pave the way for further inclusion of SSA actors in mainstream research cooperation. Meanwhile, EU and bilateral development cooperation is expected to focus on those areas not covered yet by research cooperation. 8.6 Key factors for a successful EU-SSA scientific cooperation in RE An efficient programme to support long-lasting scientific cooperation in RE should activate several levers in a coordinated manner: joint research projects but also joint publication, communications, conferences; students and researchers exchange programmes; professional networks; capacity building; etc. These various actions call for different instruments, so coordination among these instruments towards a shared goal is a key success factor. 8.6.1 Improvement of SSA\u2019s R&I capacity Cooperation between the EU and SSA today cannot be considered as a partnership of equals, as there remains \u2013 to the exception of South Africa perhaps \u2013 huge disparities in terms of capacity. Hence, a long-lasting cooperation can only be built if capacity reinforcement actions are taken by all stakeholders with the aim of progressively reducing that gap. We propose two axis for the EU to take part in these efforts. Reinforcement of research infrastructure Constraints associated with the lack of laboratory facilities and equipment, lack of internet access or a limited budget and financial support discourage young researchers, or doctorate students living abroad, either from joining existing research centres or from returning to their home countries. In ",
        "220 consequence, research centres should become more \u201cattractive\u201d in order to retain skilled people. See detailed recommendations in Research Theme B.1. Training and education Innovation and development of RET requires significant technical and non-technical skills development. Training of technicians on basic knowledge for RET installation and maintenance also constitutes an important need. This task has rather been assigned to RECP (Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme of the Africa EU Energy Cooperation) that is active both in vocational training in RE, and in higher education with the development of MSc curricula in RE. In parallel to RECP one may consider to develop, under H2020 or DEVCO, specific training programmes/modules that may circulate among the main regional universities under a \u201croad show\u201d formula 209 . A capacity building component (including training scheme of all local/regional stakeholders) should be systematically included in all EU-supported RE projects. Last, in order to develop the SSA-based capacity in RE engineering and consulting, it is recommended that Technical Assistance (TA) projects include incentives for European engineering and consultancy firms to recruit SSA junior consultants or trainees 210 . DEVCO could promote the use of SSA-based consultants in TAs (through, for example, a bonus in the evaluation as is already done by the AfDB). 8.6.2 Scientific cooperation Scientific cooperation is crucial in preventing research fragmentation and fostering the advancement of science. Thanks inter alia to past efforts to promote EU-SSA academic cooperation in various domains, African and European universities are already connected through various networks and joint research projects. However RE was not an important field for cooperation until recently (see Chapter 6.1 for more details): building sound partnerships in this field will require sustained actions through a long period of time. Also, most joint research efforts are for now led by European partners, while African partners play a secondary role. Switching from European ownership to true co-ownership of cooperation programmes will be a major challenge. Reinforce existing cooperation networks Several cooperation networks and frameworks are already in place to promote EU-Africa and intra- Africa exchanges, even in the field of RE in spite of its relative novelty. While we consider that impulsing a new networking initiative could make sense in the field of Biomass (see Research Theme A.11), for other RE technologies we would rather advise not to add one more initiative to an already scattered landscape. Sustaining and supporting existing networks, for instance by making them eligible to specific calls, seems a more promising way of reinforcing cooperation. Foster researchers mobility The Marie Sklodowska-Curie action fosters worldwide and cross-sector researcher mobility but its buy-in in SSA remains relatively low (see Chapter 6.1). One way to boost the African demand for MSCA would be to start using this instrument in support to research / development projects in a coordinated manner 211 . If this is not possible or not practical, a specific EU-SSA researchers mobility programme could be set up in the field of renewable energy. 209 This was the strategy applied by the Commission to train their staff and the Beneficiaries on e.g Sectorial Budget Support (SPSP) or Public Finance Management (PFM) and other tools (PRAG, Project Cycle Management, etc). 210 This could be similar to the Junior, Russia-CIS, China. 211 For example, if the EU supports a wind turbine project in Tanzania, then if would make sense to use MSCA for Tanzanian scientists to come and work, for example, with their Danish academic counterparts ",
        "221 8.6.3 Communication issues As highlighted above, it is crucial that actions be spread over a timeframe longer than the usual 3- year project. For instance, calls for proposal could be spread through time rather than a one-off, larger call. Specific actions to help African RE scientists make use of EU instruments will also be needed, building on what already exists. The existing cooperation framework and networks will provide efficient communication channels for future cooperation on RE. Non-EU professional networks can also be used to reach the RE scientific community. An indicative list is provided below. Table 8.3 A range of cooperation instruments (research themes may appear in more than one Axis) Name Comment EU-related initiatives, projects and networks ACP S&T calls Management unit The team of the ACP Science and Technology Programme posts info on funding sources on their website.

        "222 8.6.4 Research impact and uptake It is expected that increased scientific cooperation in RE will eventually result in the increased deployment of RE technologies throughout Africa. However, one should have realistic expectations as to what the recommendations set forth in the present study can result in: real impacts will be difficult to measure, all the more so within the short timeframe usually allotted to research projects. The overall approach should hence be a staged one: in the first stage, the main emphasis should be on the creation of strong and sustained partnerships between European RE scientists and their African counterparts. Once this foundation is in place, more concrete impacts on RE deployment can be expected. Co-ownership When research activities are led by European partners (as is the case in the majority of joint research projects as already mentioned), there are fewer chances for the results to be shared with African policy makers or businessmen, hence limiting the local uptake 212 . This situation could be improved by encouraging the co-ownership of cooperation programmes. Co-financing is a powerful way of promoting co-ownership as demonstrated by the ERAfrica project but some simpler measures such as greater involvement of African players in the early stages of programme preparation could be efficient too. Private sector Improving the participation of private players is an important concern for any research programme, all the more so as they could act as the \u201cmissing link\u201d between scientists and the society hence improving the uptake of research. But several obstacles limit this participation: lack of awareness of financing instruments, lack of linkage with the academic world, perceived administrative difficulties\u2026 Also, the timeframe of most EU instruments is not adapted to the needs of private players, especially SMEs and innovative start-ups. These obstacles are now recognised and specific actions were initiated to overcome them such as the SME instrument under H2020 \u2013 which is for now not open to private players outside the EU. In addition to these common challenges, it must be noted that private R&D in the field of renewable energy in Africa remains, for now, rather weak. Hence, encouraging the participation of the private sector in RE scientific cooperation is important, but it can only be a gradual process. We propose to contribute to this process by offering specific support to innovative SMEs (see research theme B.4).or promoting the sponsoring of public research by private sector (see research theme B.1). 212 As evidenced in \u201c Africa-EU Research Collaboration on Climate Change: A Critical Analysis of the Scope, Coordination and Uptake of Findings\u201d, CAAST Net Plus, 2014 ",

        "247 Annex III: Elaboration of Transversal Research needs and Technologies In addition to the RET-specific needs, we have identified a number of transversal R&I needs that deserve separate coverage. These are mainly linked to grid and minigrids, considering the evolving context provided by innovative power control technologies, smart meters, energy limiters and storage solutions. Progress in each of these domains can substantially improve conditions for the take-up of RE technologies in the SSA region. Definition of transversal technologies and needs With the introduction of RES in the overall power system (both as central generation systems and as distributed grid-tied RE systems at customers premises), and in a context of power markets liberalisation, there are a wide range of new innovative technologies that are developed in order to better manage power generation & distribution, power sales, loads\u2019 adjustment through demand- side management (DSM) mechanisms for smoother matching of generation and consumption as well as for peak shaving or management of spot sales/purchases. These technologies include hardware devices as well as communication tools between the operator and its assets, including the customers\u2019 meters. This innovation trend is mainly driven by the needs of large utilities, but some innovations are due to SMEs targeting specific applications, among which minigrids and the electricity markets of developing/emerging countries. Even the off-grid segment is positively affected by these new technology developments, and there are new business models now enabled by this trend that are presently tested in SSA. These innovations can be classified as follows: \uf0b7 Power control technologies: o Smart management of generation and storage o Smart management of distribution o Smart management of consumption and storage at customers\u2019 premises (DSM) \uf0b7 Smart metering \uf0b7 Smart payment technologies \uf0b7 New storage solutions. Hereafter are shown the major categories of new solutions that are developed in this purpose. ",
        "248 Figure III.1 Major categories of new solutions ",
        "249 Impacts of increased grid-tied RE supply One of the impacts of intermittent grid-tied RE sources on a power system is the increased difficulty of balancing supply and demand. Reaching suitable balance requires control mechanisms, both at the generation and the demand side of the grid. This control can be either: \uf0b7 actively performed by the supplier (either at its generation site or through activating remote devices to offset some loads); \uf0b7 actively performed by users if there are incited to do so; \uf0b7 automatically performed by installed devices at the users\u2019 location (for instance PV inverters and local storage, batteries). Many SSA grids are affected by under capacity, load shedding, wider range of frequency fluctuations and voltage fluctuations than in Europe. This context also affects the balancing process. Following information shows that increased grid-tied RE in urban grids (and also in rural grids) can help coping with some issues pertaining specifically to African grids. Table III.1 African grids issues and impacts of increased grid-tied RE supply African grids issues Impacts of increased grid-tied RE Role of user / supplier \uf0b7 Reduced voltage at end-of-lines \uf0b7 RE inverters can help maintaining voltage in suitable range by reactive power control Local control mechanism \uf0b7 Instable voltage \uf0b7 Fault ride-through capabilities of recent RE inverters helps keeping RE supply even in case of short-time faults Local control mechanism \uf0b7 Lowered frequency due to overloads. (In most of SSA countries, generation capacity is lower than required) \uf0b7 Added grid-tied RE generation helps reducing the demand/supply gap and reducing the frequency shift Local control mechanism \uf0b7 Higher frequency in case of supply higher than load. (This situation may arise in isolated grids) \uf0b7 RE inverters can help reducing the frequency shift through reducing their active power injection on grid Local control mechanism \uf0b7 Load shedding due to overloads \uf0b7 Installation of RE generation with batteries by urban customers provides continuous supply to these users. (This is driven by wealthier customers willing to have a back-up supply in case of load shedding, and thanks to existing product offer developed for the German market) Here the investment is made by users, not the utility. Following table shows that development of smart meters for commercial reasons can impact positively the RE deployment in minigrids. The development of small-scale grid-tied RE generation with specific tariffs (Feed-in-Tariffs) requires the deployment of smart meters for counting in and out energy flows. In addition, the need for more demand-side management by utilities calls for centrally-controllable smart meters. This deployment is already happening in some African countries (South Africa). These innovations can also help the deployment of small-scale grid-tied RE capacities at customers\u2019 premises and they can benefit to the minigrids segment as well. ",
        "250 Table III.2 Smart meter issues and their impacts African grids issues Impacts of deployment of smart meters Role of user / supplier \uf0b7 Central grids (Affected by lower generation capacity than required) \uf0b7 Central orders to customers\u2019 meters for deferring low-priority loads help limiting needs for load shedding Central control \uf0b7 RE minigrids (Minigrids supplied by intermittent and not-predictable RE sources) \uf0b7 Central orders to customers\u2019 meters for deferring low-priority loads help matching generation and consumption curves and helps reducing storage needs Central control Features of transversal technologies and needs Power control technologies The main challenges that minigrids and off-grid systems are facing in rural areas are their operation & maintenance and the management of the customers. Recent development of Energy Smart Technologies (EST) for better energy management and of new Energy Storage Solution (ESS) for renewable grid-integration is actually changing the way how energy is distributed, stored, traded and saved. When implemented in developing countries, isolated generation and distribution networks such as minigrids or individual systems (e.g. SHS, pico-hydro systems) require different technology solutions. Among the key challenges, there is the management \u2013 at low cost \u2013 of remote power generation, distribution and consumption. ESTs can facilitate the control of power generation, distribution and sales, making the systems more sustainable. EST & ESS can also mitigate some challenges regarding future grid-connection when central grid get finally extended to the location of an existing minigrid. The specific needs for better management of power supply (generation & distribution) are: \u2022 Remote control & monitoring of minigrids operation (in real-time) & troubleshooting; \u2022 Data acquisition system for deeper analysis and diagnosis; \u2022 Optimise the use of multi-generating sources (in case of hybrid minigrids); \u2022 Optimise the use of backup and storage; \u2022 Smoothening of the renewable energy intermittence; \u2022 Voltage, frequency and power factor management; \u2022 Load balancing (matching supply and demand; between phases; frequency); \u2022 Reduce technical and non-technical losses in the network; \u2022 Upgrading from isolated minigrid to grid-connected power system. The specific needs for better management of energy consumption are: \u2022 Improved demand/supply matching: Special devices as current limiters, power/energy management administrators, smart meters; \u2022 Simplified and secured billing system & money collection: Special devices for prepayment, mobile banking systems, flat rate system; \u2022 Avoid non-technical losses (\u201canti-fraud\u201d): Special devices for connectors, connecting cables, meter boards, protections; \u2022 Reduced consumptions: Energy efficient appliances. Power control in minigrids at power generation side In the field of energy production, smart technologies can fulfil the following duties described hereafter. ",
        "251 Remote monitoring of operation, troubleshooting, failure control Small size standard diesel generators are usually sold without sophisticated controller and data acquisition system. These devices are sometimes available in option and are required when coupling (synchronisation) with other gensets or with solar/wind generators. Communication between multi-generators is essential to optimise operation and to save fuel and wear. Regarding solar and wind energy, over the last decade there has been many products developed by inverter & BOS manufacturers (SMA, Studer, Fronius, AEI, Kaco, Outback, Xantrex, etc.) Most all BOS equipment integrates smart devices to better manage energy production and supply. Energy management in hybrid systems especially deals with multi-sources, back-up gensets and batteries. Circutor has developed special concept for managing, controlling and monitoring distributed generation/accumulation and demand in hybrid micro-grids (Electricity Dispenser, Battery Supervisory Controller, 3-phase Power Analyser, PowerStudio SCADA) SMA has developed a new product \u201cFuel-saving controller\u201d for large PV-diesel hybrid systems allowing high penetration rate of solar PV (up to 60%) in an isolated diesel-based industrial system (1-5 MWp) without battery storage, by managing carefully the load demand and the productions from gensets and solar. Voltage, frequency & power factor control Voltage, frequency & power factor controllers are not new devices but progress in electronics allows substantial reduction of power losses in mini-grids (automatic capacitor adjustment). They enable management and matching of production and consumption in due time, reducing significantly power losses. Future grid connection When an isolated mini-grid is confronted with a nearby grid extension, its technical interconnection can be of 2 ways; either the generation plant is dismantled/removed (e.g. diesel power plant) and its existing distribution grid can easily be connected to the main grid (through a newly built substation), or the existing renewable energy power plant (hydro, biomass, hybrid) can be valued through local injection into the grid (voltage boost, stability of grid reactive power, frequency, etc.) with smart devices as grid managers. The grid coupling should follow national regulations for grid connection and for power injection to ensure safe connection/disconnection through measurements & default detection. Basic synchronisation devices can be used for interconnecting hydro and biomass generating plants. For hybrid solar or wind systems, their later interconnection to the grid could be costly if key components as inverters are not properly chosen at early stage and are not compatible with grid connection. Based on power & energy availability (daily, weekly, yearly) from the renewable energy sources and the demand profile, the sales of electricity shall then be negotiated with the distributor. Software tools Forecasting tools for RET sources (wind, solar) are actively developed in industrialised countries and will be used in African or Asian contexts. They can greatly help in managing multi-sources for off-grid systems. Example given, in Burkina Faso, the 2IE project uses a \u201cmeteo forecast system\u201d. 213 213 PVSEC conference 2012, 5.BV1.50 ",
        "252 Power control in minigrids at distribution side Here are two examples of technologies helping a better management of distribution grids specifically applicable to the African context. Transformer station monitoring and control (as the Landis+Gyr S650 Smart Grid Terminal) is a component for advanced low voltage distribution network infrastructures. The terminal provides cover for multiple application areas by one device, including energy balance settlement, non-technical loss 214 detection and network optimization, as well as power quality analysis. The \u201cEnergy fraud preventing kit\u201d (Michaud) is an outdoor cut-out on top of the pole which keeps consumption under control and avoids exceeding the subscribed demand. It can be equipped with a fuse or a thermal or electronic load limiter, and provides the network management system with a simple cut-off point thus limiting the risk of fraud. Smart metering and energy limiters Energy smart technologies can play various roles in demand-side management, such as load control & limitation, automatic protections, payments, remote switching and disconnections in case of non-payment. Smart meters Smart meters are intelligent electricity meters that allows two-way communications through a communication system (GSM with SIM cards, satellite, radio, power line), sending accurate meter readings and energy usage details to the energy supplier and giving key information to the customers through a display. This new technology opens up opportunities to save energy and money, to increase flexibility in energy use (between neighbouring customers), to tailor services and tariffs to exact customer\u2019s needs, etc. There are a wide range of products available on the international market; however most of the smart meters will not be affordable for rural off-grid projects in Africa. Improved energy meters New generation of low cost, low consumption meters integrated in customer switchboard are now commercialised for low income customers. RE Meter kit (Michaud) is a turnkey cost-effective customer board with accurate energy metering (1 to 15 A, class 1). This board is provided with a protection cut-out, possibly a 220V electrical socket as well as a trapdoor for meter reading and access to the earth leakage circuit breaker. Energy or current limiter This category includes various devices as electronic or thermal switches, circuit breakers, fuses that can limit the current of each customer at a fixed value. The Aladin Service Connection kit (Michaud) is a connection box for small consumers with an electronic load limiter which replaces the conventional meter, avoiding meter reading. The load limiter is adapted to fixed fee-for-service billing. It is provided with a fuse switch connector which helps fighting against fraud or failure to pay. It is a \u201cFixed price energy management system\u201d located on fa\u00e7ade or top of the pole, thus placing the core system outdoor in order to prevent fraudulent acts inside end-users\u2019 homes. 214 non-technical losses: Theft of electricity and measurement errors. These losses can exceed 30% in some African countries. ",
        "253 Energy management systems Several product developers have designed smart devices allowing better management of rural customers having specific needs and behaviour. The energy dispenser/meter, built by Circutor 215 (Spain), is an advanced electronic meter, which is installed in the house of each mini-grid\u2019s user and which communicates with the power plant\u2019s supervisory control. The Easynergy kit (Michaud) (France) is used to control power and energy of a single customer connected to the electrical network. The MicroPower Smart Meter (Inensus) (Germany) is a Load management and Accounting Unit (LAU) including metering, power & energy limitation and DSM management (load shedding, deferrable loads, and disconnection). This system has been tested as a pilot operation in the Senegalese village Sine Moussa Abdou within a Private-Public-Partnership (2008) between INENSUS GmbH, MATFORCE (local private partner) and GIZ (public partner). A hybrid generator (5 kWp solar, 5 kW wind, 8 kVA diesel, 120 kWh battery) and Inensus Micro Power Smart Meters with prepaid cards have been installed. Smart payment devices Devices allowing prepayment Started about 20 years ago, the prepayment meter industry is widely developed with high competition between manufacturers (e.g. Landis & Gyr, Siemens, Conlog). Only in India there are more than 20 manufacturers of prepaid meters. Benefiting from cost reduction, prepayment meters have become very popular among African utilities because they help solving many problems linked with fraud and money collection in urban and rural areas. The main African countries having widely implemented prepayment meters are South Africa, Sudan and Morocco. In principle, the prepayment management system should include 3 components: (i) the prepayment meters, (ii) the vending unit (tokens, scratch cards, code) and (iii) the vending and management servers (point-of-sales, internet, operator / utility). Different approaches of prepayment have been developed offering a wide range of management schemes: \uf0b7 Tokens: buying tokens with cash at a point-of-sales or paypoint; \uf0b7 Reloadable key or card: buying credit with cash at a paypoint with terminal (data from customer can be sent to operator\u2019s server); \uf0b7 Scratch card: buying credit with cash at a paypoint and reload meter with code; \uf0b7 Internet: buy credit and get code through mobile banking (internet); \uf0b7 GSM: buy credit and get code through mobile banking (SMS); \uf0b7 Smart meters (with SIM card): buy credit and send data from the meter (SMS). And finally the prepayment meters can be either Split or Combo type. The split meter has separated prepayment meter and customer interface unit. It is preferred when customer shouldn\u2019t have access to meter or in culturally sensitive environments: \uf0b7 Prepayment meter: contains all critical function such as metering, token decryption and load control functionality. It has a two-wire communications interface to the remotely located 215 http://fr.circutor.com/energie/energies-renouvelables_a_1127.aspx ",
        "254 customer interface unit, operates independently and is immune to any form of tampering on the interface unit; \uf0b7 Customer interface unit: comprises a keypad for the entry of prepayment voucher numbers and a display for accessing parameters such as remaining credit and various meter status functions. Examples of Products: Conlog BEC series: BEC 23 ECU (max 20A) and Cashpower prepaid meters from Landis & Gyr (Swiss) that range from small single phase meters (Gemini, ECU, Sabre) to 3-phases meters, combo or split. In Africa, prepayment meters are becoming the new standard for urban and rural customers (except for large customers). There are many companies / organizations working on innovative energy service solutions to facilitate rural management of electrification schemes through SMS-based communication tools for like payment collection, energy management and remote monitoring. Devices allowing remote payment Today the sprawling of GSM network in rural areas has changed ways to operate and manage electrification infrastructures. The access to mobile network allows in particular remote payments or prepayments through what is called today \u201cmobile banking\u201d or mobile payments. This low-cost solution is progressively solving the problematic management of \u201creload centres\u201d in terms of logistic and access. In addition, as described above, remote communication through GSM also allows remote control & monitoring of equipment either from generating plants or from customer\u2019s side. Many cumbersome activities as door-to-door meter reading, money collection or troubleshooting can be alleviated. The technology is simply used to communicate with a bank through SMS, far easier and cheaper than other mobile banking systems (Direct Mobile Billing, Mobile Web Payment or Near Field Communication NFC-payment) using internet or smart phones (mobile wallets, credit cards). Even the basic SMS-based mobile banking system allows credit top-up, bill payments, salary payments, and other banking services as deposit, national or international money transfers. All African telecom operators and some proactive banks (Stanbic, Equity Bank) are developing through commercial partnerships \u2018mobile payment products\u2019 for their customers (ex. MobileMoney from MTN, M-PESA & M-KOPA from Safaricom). Beyond remote payment, SMS-based innovative devices can also be used to control power generation and end-users\u2019 consumptions and to collect real-time data from the field. DFID and GIZ have been supporting such innovative development in Kenya. bitHarvester is an SMS-enabled monitoring device developed by Access:Energy (Kenya) that delivers real-time information on the status of an energy systems (wind turbines, hybrid systems) to an office in- town (internet portal) and which regularly updates supervisor on local conditions and system performance. Mobisol is a German company developing high-tech solar home systems for developing countries combining SHS with innovative mobile pay-as-you-go technology. Since 2009 in Senegal, within GIZ-funded program Peracod, Michaud installed 700 power management systems in rural villages. This will lead to the development of a second generation of product thanks to this first experiment, enabling more cost-effective design. ",
        "255 Advanced prepayment meters / remote payment meters with specific features developed for pilot minigrids are still quite expensive and thus not yet suitable to massive rural electrification projects. There is a need for the design and manufacture of low-cost smart meters for rural electrification. Storage technologies There is a wide range of energy storage solutions supporting the grid integration of renewable energy, the production of which depends on meteorological conditions, varies at different time scale and are not (or little) predictable. Some storage solutions are commercialized, but many other options are still at pre-commercial stage or under development. Main storage categories are: \uf0b7 Electro-chemical batteries (lead-acid, Li-ion, NaS, Vanadium Redox Flow); \uf0b7 Flywheels (seconds to minutes); \uf0b7 Fuel cells; \uf0b7 Compressed air (CAES); \uf0b7 Potential storage (pumped hydro); \uf0b7 Thermal storage; \uf0b7 Magnetic storage; \uf0b7 Supercapacitors, Supraconductors. Each of those storage systems has its own characteristics as power and energy density (kW/kg - kWh/kg), \u201ccharacteristic time\u201d, lifetime, and cost. Figure III.2 Energy and power characteristics of main storage solutions In the segment of large grid-tied RE systems, storage solutions are required for: \u2022 Hydropower: to shift the time, day or season of power delivery, through water storage, and pumped storage; \u2022 Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants: the last heated medium (generally molten salt) in the CSP process serves has a thermal energy storage making this technology partially dispatchable on a day-night timescale; \u2022 PV power plants: there are presently pilot applications of Li-ion battery storage of PV power for large-scale PV power plants. ",
        "256 In RE-hybrid minigrids, the electricity production using variable renewable energy sources doesn\u2019t match with the fluctuating demand profile. Storage of electricity is required to ensure continuity and quality service to customers. The storage issue is of utmost importance for the solar and wind generation due to their variable and unpredictable character. The storage performs various functions: \u2022 Attenuate the fluctuations over short period of time (< minutes): this \u201cbuffer storage\u201d helps to stabilise the power supply and can usually be achieved with flying wheels for wind turbines or with limited capacity chemical batteries; \u2022 Shift the daily production periods to load peaks by a couple of hours. Lead-acid and Li-ion batteries are well adapted for such daily storage. Such storage also allows reducing the use of gensets or limiting this to peak load when load factor is most favourable; \u2022 Security reserve over few days in case of consecutive days with low renewable supply. This reserve is usually costly as the stored energy will be used only occasionally. A backup diesel genset is recommended for security reserve purpose, in order to avoid over-sizing the storage system and to provide flexibility at lower cost in case of unplanned or exceptional loads. Storage technologies pertaining to minigrids In relation to the deployment of smart grids, renewable energy integration and electrical vehicles, a strong battery market growth is observed for grid-tied storage systems. Electrochemical batteries have a large potential together with a number of new materials and technologies under development to improve performance and reduce costs. Common storage options used or considered for RE-mini-grids are detailed below. Table III.3 Common storage options Technology Availability Cost-benefit Flywheels Commercial Low cost, high power but for limited time Lead-Acid batteries Commercial Low cost but low energy density and short-lifetime Li-ion batteries Commercial High efficiency and lifetime, widely used for portable devices but still expensive for larger power application and for off-grid Vanadium redox flow cells Pre-commercial Already been used in small- to mid-size renewable power systems but not mature yet for DC and remote applications Novel batteries (e.g. NaS batteries) Demo phase Constraining barriers for use in rural areas and DC applications (high temperature for NaS) Flywheels Flywheels can make available kW- to MW-size power output with very short response time and with high efficiency but for a limited duration (seconds to minutes). Systems can be more or less complex and efficient (use of vacuum chamber, superconducting magnetic levitation, etc.) but requires little maintenance. At present, commercial flywheels are mostly used to provide back-up power to UPS but can support frequency regulation and wind power in small grids. Their capital cost 216 is also sensitive to the size, ranging from US$ 1 000 / kW for small, simple flywheels to US$ 4 000 / kW for MW-size multi-wheel systems (Irena, 2012). Lead-acid batteries 216 Capital costs of a storage technology can be given per unit of power capacity ($/kW) or per unit of energy storage capacity ($/kWh). Operating costs are given per unit of power capacity per year ($/kW-yr). The overall cost and the levelised cost of energy storage are given per unit of energy ($/kWh) as the ratio of all costs incurred for storing the energy (capital, operation and energy costs, if any) to the total amount of energy stored in all storage cycles over the plant\u2019s lifetime. The costs provided in the text are indicative estimates often with a wide range of variations. ",
        "257 The lead acid battery remains today the most used storage system in decentralised power applications and hybrid systems given its low cost and reasonable performances. Over the last decade, some noticeable progresses have been made to increase performances and lifetime of those batteries used in off-grid solar/wind systems. Advanced deep-cycle lead-acid batteries have been developed for solar applications to better fit with daily cycles. Market prices of deep-cycle batteries are in the range of 150-250 USD / kWh (investment cost). The overall storage cost per MWh stored is usually in the range 250-500 USD / MWh, depending on operating conditions and real lifetimes. For comparison, the overall cost of pumped hydro energy storage is estimated at between 50 and 150 USD / MWh stored. (Irena, 2012). Lithium-ions batteries Li-ion batteries are perhaps the most promising technology for both small- and large-scale electricity storages in power generation. They dominate the market of energy storage for portable devices and are also the primary candidate for energy storage in electric vehicles and distributed renewable power. They can cope with high variability of discharge. Li-ion currently offer superior performances (power and energy density, cycle efficiency, durability, self-discharge, temperature range) than lead-acid, NiCd, NiMH. Their cost could significantly reduce thanks to the development of electric vehicle market. Safety of larger Li-ion batteries is also an issue as overcharging, short circuiting and abnormal heating can occur during operation. Furthermore performance, costs and safety features vary significantly within the Lithium family (various materials for cathode, anode, and electrolyte). Li-ion batteries for power applications are still expensive (up to 2500 USD / kW) because of the need for new materials and technology, and safety devices. Large research efforts on batteries for electric vehicles and wind energy storage promise a rapid cost reduction to less than 1 000 USD / kW (Irena, 2012). High quality Li-ion products (half MW size) are available in EU at about 1 000-1 300 USD / kWh while low-cost products (mainly from Asia) can be as low as 500 USD / kWh. Different forecast scenarios claim LIB price decline between 150-400 USD / kWh by 2020 217 but there are plenty of press announcements touting improved performance and lower cost. 218 Among the various Li-ion chemistries, Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide batteries (or NMC) are presently available commercial products implemented as energy storage option in pilot remote minigrids. The better performances and longer lifetime of Li-ion give a prospective overall storage cost which could be close to the overall cost of deep-cycle lead-acid batteries. As a first estimate, the overall cost of stored electricity is about 0,24 USD / kWh for lead-acid technology and could be 0,29 USD / kWh for a Li-ion technology at current average market price and ideal lifetime & performances (see table below). Some experiences indicate that overall cost for Li-ion is in practice higher than 0,50 USD / kWh.

        "258 Vanadium Redox-flow Battery (VRB) This electro-chemical storage system offers power capacity from few kW to MW-size with short time response to power demand and a high lifetime (> 12 000 charge/discharge cycles). VRB needs little maintenance but is rather complex for remote areas with its pumping and cooling systems. It can be used to support large wind/solar power generation at a cost of 3 000-5 000 USD / kW with prospects for a rapid reduction to 2 000 USD / kWh and 250\u2013300 USD / MWh overall storage cost, depending of actual lifetime (Irena, 2012). Alternative flow battery concepts include Zn/Br (commercial) and other Zn-Air, Al-Air, Fe-Cr, Zn-Cl (still under development). Sodium Nickel Chloride battery (NaCl-Ni) NaCl-Ni battery is another alternative technology presently under development (General Electric) but with attractive perspectives as it has simple and robust technology, and high energy density. Capital cost is still about 1 000 USD / kWh but is expected to reach half in a couple of years. Sodium Sulphur battery (NaS) NaS batteries are based on the sodium-sulfur reaction and require high operating temperature (300\u00b0C). At this early stage of development, they are suitable only for large-size applications, such as MW-size grid stabilization, load-levelling, utility-scale storage of wind and PV electricity. Their feasibility in off-grid or mini-grid projects has not been demonstrated yet. ",

        "274 K I - N A - 27 - 789 - E N - N Access to energy is a crucial pre-condition for further economic development of the African continent. Sub-Saharan Africa is blessed by an array of renewable energy sources which together provide a strong potential. Even though the current penetration of renewable energy in SSA is limited, apart from biomass and hydro, the future potential is substantial. Biomass, solar energy (PV, solar thermal as well as CSP) and hydropower can all play their part, while wind and geothermal have strong roles to play as well \u2013 all depending on the geographic context. This potential is currently underutilised due to limited demand, non-existing or incomplete grids, and policy frameworks which require substantial advancement. Despite previous investments in renewable energy in the region, the knowledge about their effectiveness and efficiency is partial and fragmented. EU-SSA research cooperation in this area can contribute substantially to medium- to long-term renewable energy take-up in the region. It can also strengthen the market position of EU players in areas where they are strong and globally competitive. RET-specific research themes have thereto been proposed, including traditional and advanced bioenergy (biofuels, biogas, bioenergy value chains), various solar technologies (PV, solar heating and cooling, CSP), small-scale hydro and geothermal energy. Transversal research topics proposed include support to research infrastructures, resource mapping and assessment, impact assessment, innovative SMES and grid improvements (including energy supply modelling and smart hybrid mini-grids).
