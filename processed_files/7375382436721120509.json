The 15-year period \u2014 1958 to 1972 \u2014 covered by this work corresponds to the beginnings of the European Commission, whose first task was to come up with practical means of achieving the Treaties\u2019 main objective \u2014 the establishment of a common market \u2014 taking as its point of departure the general interest of the entire Community of six Member States. Forged by men and women with often very different backgrounds, the history of the first few years is one of crises but also of achievements which shaped the major milestones of European integration in almost every area. Imagination, long-term vision, enthusiasm and tenacity seem to have been the great virtues of the people working for the young European institution at that time. By piecing together over a number of years the recollections of former Commission officials, a consortium of university teachers under the direction of Professor Michel Dumoulin of the Catholic University of Louvain at Louvain-la-Neuve has at last made it possible to tell the story of what happened during those early days. > Map \u2014 The European Union The 27 EU Member States with regional borders.

It also publishes an annual report listing valid Community plant variety rights, the names of their holders and the dates on which they were granted and will expire. > Forestry statistics The aim of the pocketbook is to present updated information on the forest sector in the EU, EFTA and candidate countries. It may be considered as a compendium of the most relevant Eurostat data sets concerning the forest sector. Data on forest resources and forest certification have been taken from a previous publication of UNECE, while the JRC has provided forest maps and additional information on forest resources, as well as the chapter on forest fires. In addition, the chapter on forest condition was drawn up by ICP Forests. This pocketbook is divided into two main parts. The first gives a general description of forest resources, forest ownership, forest condition, employment in the forest sector, the contribution of this sector to national GDP formation and the share of energy produced using woody material. The second part is devoted to the production and trade of wood and wood products and is based on data from the \u2018Joint forest sector questionnaire\u2019, which is the result of cooperation among Eurostat, UNECE, the FAO and ITTO. This section of the pocketbook also contains supply balance sheets concerning the production and trade of wood, wood-based panels, paper and paperboard. Tables and figures based on Eurostat data refer mainly to Eurostat\u2019s NewCronos database. ",

The main impulses stem from a robust increase in investment, continued strong world growth and an improved outlook in Germany. Growth is expected to edge slightly lower in 2007 to 2.2 % in the EU and 1.8 % in the euro area. The EU as a whole is expected to create 3\u00bd million new jobs over the period 2006\u201307, after nearly 3 million in the previous two years. This will help reduce unemployment from a peak of more than 9 % in 2004 to an expected 8.2 % in 2007 in the EU. Inflation remains remarkably stable at slightly above 2 % despite soaring oil prices, which remain the main risk to economic growth. ",

In 2005, the budgetary position in the euro area and the EU improved significantly. According to the spring 2006 forecasts of the Commission services, the euro area and EU deficits would remain roughly stable in 2006 and 2007, based on the assumption of unchanged policy. > European Economy \u2014 No 5/2006 > Economic forecasts Autumn 2006 Economic growth in 2006 is set to reach 2.8 % in the European Union and 2.6 % in the euro area, up from 1.7 % and 1.4 % in 2005, according to the Commission\u2019s autumn economic forecasts. The main impulses are robust growth in domestic demand, especially investment, and sustained global growth. Economic activity should ease somewhat in 2007 and 2008 reflecting the global outlook and, in particular, the slowdown in the United States. Yet, GDP growth is projected to remain around potential in the next two years (EU: 2.4 % in both 2007 and 2008; euro area: 2.1 % in 2007 and 2.2 % in 2008). > European Economy \u2014 Special Report No 1/2006 > The impact of ageing on public expenditure: projections for the EU-25 Member States on pensions, healthcare, long-term care, education and unemployment transfers (2004\u201350) In the coming decades, the size and age-structure of Europe\u2019s population will undergo dramatic changes due to low fertility rates, continuous increases in life expectancy and the retirement of the baby-boom generation. This report presents the results of the age-related expenditure projection exercise. ",

With the enlargement of the European Union, its centre has moved significantly to the east. This makes the Union\u2019s relations with the Mediterranean partners a major foreign policy issue. The relations with this area are crucial as concerns the enlarged European Union\u2019s ability to play a political role in the international arena. The fall of the Berlin wall made it possible for the EU to approach the east, whilst the peace process in the Middle East enabled the Union to improve its relations with non-EU countries in the Mediterranean area. From the European Union\u2019s side, the main initiative to support cooperation between the Union and the Mediterranean countries is the neighbourhood policy, and especially the new neighbourhood instrument. This study aims to find out how this instrument could support decentralised cooperation, by presenting 10 case studies. > European Union foreign direct investment yearbook 2005 \u2014 Pocketbook \u2014 Data 1998\u20132003 Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a key role in the globalisation process and is an important element affecting international relations.

The report covers a range of instruments which are used as tools to achieve environmental objectives. These instruments include environmental taxes, charges and deposit-refund systems, environmental tax reform, emissions trading schemes, subsidies, and liability and compensation requirements. The report finds a steadily growing application of market-based instruments across Europe. It also identifies the need for cost-effective policy measures in order to make authorities more aware of the advantages of implementing MBIs.

Since 1995, concern about the state of Europe\u2019s coastline has led to a number of EU initiatives which build on the concept of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). ICZM attempts to balance the needs of development with protection of the very resources that sustain coastal economies.

That remains the EEA\u2019s key conclusion, despite significant progress on some issues demonstrating that environmental policy works. Were we to fast-forward to the year 2010, it would be my strong hope that in its next state and outlook report, the EEA would be able to report significant environmental improvements, not least as a result of reversing unsustainable trends in sectors such as energy, agriculture and transport.

The amended packaging and packaging waste directive has recently been adopted, and work is under way to develop EU thematic strategies on waste prevention and recycling and on the sustainable use and management of natural resources. The packaging and packaging waste directive is one of the few environmentally related directives to contain directly measurable, quantitative targets. It has now been in place for 10 years and this is an opportune time to take stock of this important policy area. The EEA has conducted a pilot study of the effectiveness of packaging waste management systems in five EU Member States with the aim of gaining practical and concrete experience of ex post policy effectiveness evaluation, and to track progress in this policy area. > European environment outlook \u2014 EEA Report No 4/2005 Protecting our environment is a key element in ensuring sustainable livelihoods for today\u2019s and future generations. Indeed, the most recent Eurobarometer surveys show that, as Europeans, we regard the protection of our environment to be one of the six key priorities for the European Union. Issues of particular concern are water and air pollution, man-made disasters, and climate change. In addition, new challenges arising from diffuse sources of pollution, changing consumption patterns and the possibility of sudden extreme environmental changes all need to be addressed. > Agriculture and environment in EU-15 \u2014 The IRENA indicator report \u2014 EEA Report No 6/2005 This report provides an assessment of the progress made in the development and the interpretation of the agri-environmental indicators identified in COM(2000) 20 during the IRENA operation. The report builds on more than 35 detailed indicator factsheets that can be found on the IRENA website (http://www.eea.europa.eu/projects/irena/products). ",

European waters are affected across the whole range from inland water bodies such as groundwater, rivers and lakes, to transitional and coastal waters and ecosystems in open seas. Eutrophication is caused by large anthropogenic inputs of the nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to the aquatic environment from a range of societal sectors. > Sustainable use and management of natural resources \u2014 EEA Report No 9/2005 This report focuses on our ability to continue to provide for our needs by drawing on the natural world. Given the broad coverage of the term \u2018natural resources\u2019, a decision was made at the outset to focus the analysis on a selection of natural resources: fisheries, forestry, water, fossil fuels, metals and construction minerals, and land use. The factors behind this choice included ensuring a mix of renewable and non-renewable resources, the policy relevance and political importance of the resources, and the ability to illustrate the various policy approaches. > Environment and health \u2014 EEA Report No 10/2005 Public concerns, evidence from research and increasing scientific knowledge are all driving widespread discussions on environment and health problems. The issue of environment and health is characterised by multi-causality with different strengths of association. This means that the links between exposures and their health consequences depend on the environmental pollutants and diseases being considered, but are also influenced by factors such as genetic constitution, age, nutrition and lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors such as poverty and level of education.

With an aim to provide input for European policymaking, this report analyses the environmental effects of household consumption in Europe. We have identified four consumption categories that form a major part of our total consumption expenditure and for which the environmental effects are either large or increasing rapidly. These are consumption of food and drink, housing, personal travel and mobility, and tourism. The negative environmental effects of our consumption not only occur in Europe but also in other regions of the world, mainly as a result of resource extraction, production, processing and transportation of the goods we consume in Europe, and as a result of our personal travel and tourist activities. Attaining more sustainable consumption and production patterns is a common challenge that involves all actors, including public authorities at all levels, business and consumers. ",

The tourism industry has grown to massive proportions in the last decade and so has its environmental impact. Since tourism is above all an economic activity, a better management of tourism is not only necessary to mitigate its negative effects on the environment, but also to minimise the potential conflict with other economic activities such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries. > EU competitiveness and industrial location In May 2005 the Group of Economic Policy Analysis (GEPA) discussed the issue of EU competitiveness and industrial location. At that meeting, a request was made for BEPA to prepare a report: (i) taking stock of the phenomena of delocalisation and outsourcing in particular and globalisation in general; (ii) assessing their impact on the European economy; and (iii) considering how potential challenges can be addressed. This report \u2014 a draft of which was presented to the GEPA in September 2005 \u2014 is a response to this request. The report discusses EU trade patterns, reviews factors affecting industrial location decisions, reviews relevant evidence on globalisation and relocation and their impact in particular on employment, and presents a set of policies aimed at improving the EU\u2019s competitiveness and its ability to address challenges emanating from these shocks. > European industrial relations dictionary Designed as an easy-to-use online format, the European industrial relations dictionary is a comprehensive collection of the most commonly used terms in employment and industrial relations at EU level today.

This booklet gives a broad overview and introduces the nine general themes of the dictionary. It presents a concise outline of the legal and institutional framework of the EU system of employment and industrial relations, charting its evolution from the Treaty of Paris in 1951 right up to the current predicament regarding the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.

Use of the term \u2018competence\u2019 is shown to be ambiguous and applicable to various situations with different meanings. This term needs careful specification and interpretation if it is to be properly understood. Countries or regions have their own definition of competence and each sector or occupational family has its own interpretation. Outcomes of learning cannot be described by using this term only. We have to add knowledge and skills or, as the authors propose, use terms such as cognitive competence, functional competence or meta-competence, understood as personal and social-attitudinal competence, to encompass the necessary knowledge and skills. > Eurovoc Eurovoc is a multilingual thesaurus (19 languages) which covers all the fields in which the European Union is active and provides a means of indexing the documents in users\u2019 documentation systems.

The journal is looking to publish articles which set out ideas, report on research results, and which report on experience at national and European level. It also publishes position papers and reaction statements on issues in the field of vocational education and training. > Identifying skill needs for the future \u2014 From research to policy and practice In a rapidly changing environment early identification of skill needs is becoming increasingly challenging. The pace of technological change and innovation entails demands for new skills and competences on the labour market. Availability of reliable and accurate information on skill trends is a precondition for a timely response to new and changing training and education needs. This publication is based on proceedings of the international conference in Thessaloniki in May 2003 and it continues the debate begun in the earlier publication Early identification of skill needs in Europe , from Cedefop. > Key data on education in Europe \u2014 2005 First published in 1994, Key data on education in Europe sets out a very wide variety of both qualitative and quantitative indicators on different aspects of education systems in 30 European countries, including how they are organised, the human and financial resources invested in them, teaching processes, and qualifications awarded at different levels. Key data on education in Europe is intended to provide a very wide audience with information on many aspects of education systems. Its aim is to highlight numerous differences and similarities in the way in which they are organised and function, as well as trends underlying their development. The publication contains a wealth of graphic material, including histograms, maps and diagrams, so that it is easy to consult and readily accessible to everyone. The basic underlying principle is that descriptive, statistical and comparative diagrams should alternate with comments on various points that arise from comparative examination of the data concerned.

This knowledge is necessary because of the introduction of more flexible ways of working and learning, including new technology. The concept of work process knowledge enables us to resolve contradictions between theory and practice and indeed contradictions within work itself. It also provides a framework for forging partnerships between education and training institutions concerned with formal learning and enterprises focusing on work-based learning. This book brings us up to date with current debates about work process knowledge, through presenting the research findings of experts from nine European countries in the fields of learning theory, knowledge development and education and training. Ways of teaching and learning theoretical knowledge that can have greater impact on professional practice are examined in this book. > Learning by leaving \u2014 Placements abroad as a didactic tool in the context of vocational education and training in Europe This study treats placements abroad in Europe both quantitatively and qualitatively. First, it attempts to assess the European, national and regional scope of activities across Europe. The main European mobility programme in VET \u2014 Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 only represents the tip of the iceberg. Many transnational placement activities are carried out under other EU programmes and initiatives (notably the Structural Funds), but major national and regional input complements and extends Commission efforts. Second, it tries to gauge the learning potential of placements abroad through a theoretical analysis of practices. It concludes that placements abroad can be a powerful didactic tool in VET, notably for developing individuals\u2019 capacity for managing change in career, technology and work organisation. However, this learning potential will not unfold automatically through physical presence at a workplace in another country. The study identifies and describes the pedagogical aspects before, during and after the stay and gives examples of good practice. ",

Alternative water sources are expected to play a significant role in areas suffering water shortages. In many places wastewater reuse is becoming a valuable component of sustainable water management practices. However, substantial and practical information is still needed to safely design, implement and operate waste reuse schemes. This publication presents practical information on wastewater reuse concepts based on actual and proved management and operational practices. A broad approach has been considered by addressing institutional, organisational, legal, economic, financial, social and environmental issues together with technological aspects. The targeted readers are mainly practitioners concerned with implementation of wastewater reuse schemes, but we are convinced that this publication will also become \u2018the wastewater reuse manual\u2019 for decision-makers, local authorities, consultants and research bodies involved in the area. 10. Scientific and technical research > Science, technology and innovation in Europe In the context of the conclusions of the Council meetings of Lisbon in 2000 and Barcelona in 2002, relevant and meaningful indicators on science, technology and innovation are paramount in informing policymakers as to where Europe stands in moving towards more knowledge and growth. This information is also necessary to better gauge how Europe is evolving, compared with the United States, Japan, China, the Russian Federation and other main economies. The statistics and indicators presented in this publication report on Europe\u2019s recent performance on R & D, innovation, high-tech industries and knowledge-based services, patenting and human resources in science and technology.

This facilitates the exchange of information and makes agro-technology transfer possible. The creation of the soil geographical database for the whole of Europe, at 1:1 000 000 scale, is a great achievement. To complete the database, the European Soil Bureau, based at the Joint Research Centre in Ispra (Italy), built up a network of soil scientists, from all over the continent, who readily invested considerable amounts of time and energy. The database is structured from soil typological units (STUs) defined precisely by variables describing the nature and properties of soils: texture, water regime, etc. These STUs are grouped into soil mapping units (SMUs) which constitute associations of soils. The SMUs are delineated at a scale of 1:1 000 000. The information about the soils is based on a data dictionary that contains the precise definition of each variable. The soil geographical database of Europe is complemented by a soil profile analytical database containing the data for the principal soil types found in the countries of Europe. A knowledge base in the form of pedotransfer rules is also supplied for the estimation of variables not available directly from the geographic database: organic matter content, density, available water content, etc. Together these databases form the European soil database, v. 1.0.

This is why this report not only includes information for the traditionally well-known noise-exposed sectors such as construction, manufacturing or agriculture, but also for more female dominated service-oriented professions, such as education or call centres. > Promoting health and safety in European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \u2014 SME funding scheme 2003\u20132004 Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are widely acknowledged as the backbone of the European economy, employing nearly two thirds of the EU\u2019s private-sector workforce and creating one in every two new jobs. Sadly, their occupational safety record does not compare well with larger enterprises. The fatal accident rate in firms with fewer than 50 workers is around double that of larger companies. Because cash flows in SMEs tend to be tight and they find it harder than larger companies to release staff, occupational safety and health is often a low priority. This is despite the evidence that safe, healthy and agreeable working conditions not only save days lost through sickness and injury, but increase productivity. The 2003\u201304 scheme provided co-funding for initiatives that encouraged SMEs to adopt good occupational safety and health practice. Grants for projects were aimed at SMEs\u2019 specific needs in one of three categories: \u2014 training related to the prevention of accidents and the avoidance of health risks; \u2014 information and communications that promote health and safety; \u2014 identifying effective good practices that reduce dangers to health and safety.

A particular focus for the Commission has been to play a supportive role, and in line with that strategy the Commission has now published a series of handbooks for local actors. They provide a practical tool indicating the best approaches for designing, developing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating successful local employment development strategies and activities. The key principles are presented, documented with examples and a list of useful contacts. > Reducing the risks from occupational noise Every day, millions of employees in Europe are exposed to noise at work and all the risks this can entail. While noise is most obviously a problem in industries such as metal manufacturing and construction, it can also be an issue in a wide range of other workplaces, from airports to farms, call centres to concert halls. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has looked at how the European directive structure and the standards that complement it work to ensure that risks to workers from noise are addressed to reduce the high personal, social and economic cost of ill health, stress and accidents arising from exposure to noise.

        "K e y p u b l i c a t i o n s o f t h e E u r o p e a n U n i o n 2 0 0 7 > Quality of the working environment and productivity This working paper demonstrates that health and safety measures have a positive impact not only on safety and health performance but also on company productivity. However, identifying and quantifying these effects is not always straightforward. In addition, although experience shows that in many cases proof of profitability can be given, it might be rather difficult in a certain number of cases to develop solid evidence. This might be the case when some of the important consequences of health and safety risks can be externalised (e.g. hazards with long-term effects), thus putting a strain on society and not immediately on the company. Safety and health of workers is a moral responsibility within our society that cannot only depend on productivity criteria within a particular company. This responsibility fits into the broader concept of the performance of a company. The final evaluation concerns not only the short term, but is more an issue of the long term. > Career guidance \u2014 A handbook for policy makers Despite many examples of good practice, large weaknesses exist in many countries\u2019 national career guidance services, according to extensive research conducted by the OECD, and by the Centre for the Development of Vocational Training and the European Training Foundation, on behalf of the European Commission. Access is limited, particularly for adults. In addition, services often focus upon immediate decisions, and fail to develop career management skills. Training for those who provide services is frequently inappropriate, failing to reflect the full range of client needs or to take account of modern, more flexible delivery methods such as ICT. Services are poorly coordinated between different ministries, and between governments and other stakeholders. The evidence base is too weak to provide policy makers with useful data on outcomes, costs and benefits. These gaps stand in the way of governments\u2019 attempts to implement lifelong learning, active employability and social equity policies. This joint publication by the OECD and the European Commission (staff working paper) gives policy makers practical tools to tackle these problems. In simple, non-technical language, the publication addresses a broad range of policy issues that are central to the effective delivery of career guidance services. These include: how to widen access to career guidance; ways of improving the quality of career information; ensuring that staff qualifications meet policy objectives; and improving strategic leadership. This publication is essential reading for all policy makers, especially those in education and labour, who are responsible for planning, managing and delivering career guidance services. ",

There are two series: one in English only and one in the language of each Member State (except France where only the English edition exists). Further information is available on the EMIRE database (http:// www.eurofound.ie/emire/emire.html). > Corporate social responsibility and safety and health at work Corporate social responsibility (CSR) was defined by the European Commission as a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis. To be socially responsible means going beyond fulfilling the legal expectations, by also investing \u2018more\u2019 into human capital, the environment and relations with stakeholders. There can be no doubt that safe and sound working conditions and good worker health belong to the social responsibilities of companies and can be regarded as an integral part of CSR. A distinction is often made between three aspects of the social dimension of corporate social responsibility, as follows. \u2014 Internal aspects \u2014 human resource management, health and safety at work (OSH), business ethics, adaptation to change, and organisational learning \u2014 require participation of workers or their representatives. \u2014 External local aspects \u2014 local corporate citizenship \u2014 require cooperation with business partners, local authorities and local NGOs. \u2014 External worldwide aspects \u2014 human rights, global environmental concerns, safety and health in supply companies, corporate citizenship worldwide \u2014 require communication with consumers, investors, globally operating NGOs, etc. This report explores the interactions between CSR and safety and health at work both at company and policy level.

Section 2 considers the competition policy concerns and a framework for analysis of non-horizontal mergers. Section 3 considers the economics and competition policy analysis of vertical mergers. Section 4 brings together literature to consider the economics and competition policy implications of transactions involving complements and/or neighbouring products. The analysis in Sections 3 and 4 considers only how a non-horizontal merger would increase the market power of the merging firm. Section 5 considers the implications of non-horizontal mergers for the coordinated exercise of market power. Section 6 considers the implications of conglomerate mergers on the incentives for predation and the implications for competition if such a merger affects financial leverage. Section 7 briefly considers efficiency rationales for non-horizontal mergers. > The economics of horizontal mergers: unilateral and coordinated effects This document builds on two reports commissioned by the European Commission on the economic analysis of horizontal mergers, dealing respectively with unilateral effects and tacit collusion. The document comprises four parts. Part A provides a general introduction and overview of the main issues. Part B focuses on the economics of unilateral effects, while Part C studies coordinated effects through the economics of tacit collusion. Part D reviews a number of quantitative procedures that can be used for the analysis of unilateral effects and tacit collusion. ",

Conducted mostly through interviews with market operators, the study examines major problems in the design and implementation of remedies that have become apparent since the decisions were adopted. It also carries out an overall evaluation of the effectiveness of the remedies in maintaining effective competition in the market. The study\u2019s findings confirm the relevance of various aspects of the Commission\u2019s merger remedies practice, as described in the remedies notice and the model commitment texts (http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/mergers/legislation/ remedies.htm). Nevertheless, the study also identifies a number of areas regarding the design and implementation of the remedies which require further improvement. In addition to being used in future cases, the results of the study, together with relevant recent practice and jurisprudence, will be used in an upcoming review of the merger remedies notice and of the model divestiture commitments and trustee mandate. A public consultation on the drafts of these amended texts is scheduled for 2006. > EC competition rules \u2014 Modernisation of EC antitrust enforcement rules On 1 May 2004, a new system of application of Articles 81 and 82 EC entered into force. This is the result of a long reform process which started five years ago and which has been characterised by a large public consultation at every stage. It resulted in the adoption by the Council of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 and in the adoption by the Commission of the flanking \u2018modernisation package\u2019: a commission implementing regulation and six notices. The objective of the reform is to ensure an efficient protection of competition in an enlarged Union. The new regulation creates the conditions for a greater involvement of national courts and national competition authorities by making Articles 81 and 82 directly applicable in their entirety. Furthermore, it makes it compulsory to apply Community law whenever the agreement or practice at stake may affect trade between Member States. ",

Transport > Driving licences \u2014 European Union and European Economic Area Currently, 110 different driving licence models circulate in the EU and EEA Member States. This manual aims to help controlling authorities, as well as the interested private person, to identify these many different types. It also enables licence holders to be aware of their rights, and national authorities to know the validity and extent of the rights associated with each model of licence. Good management of driving licences is central to guaranteeing the freedom of movement. Mutual recognition of driving licences between the Member States of the EU, without any formalities, has been in full force since 1 July 1996. From that date all administrative obstacles have been eliminated for licence holders who go to or establish themselves in another Member State. > Ten key transport and environment issues for policy-makers Transport volumes are growing at a rate where many of the improvements brought about by new technology are being partly or fully negated. Emissions of harmful pollutants are decreasing steadily, but there are indications that the test cycles, on which the emissions are calculated, fail to represent real world driving conditions. Therefore, air quality is not improving as would be expected from the emission figures. The TERM 2004 report looks at trends in transport emissions and other transport impacts over the decade from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. > Transport in the Euro-Mediterranean region \u2014 Data 1990\u20132001 This publication attempts to respond to data needs by providing an updated statistical overview of transport for the 12 Mediterranean partners (Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey).
