Increasingly, developing countries, which suffer more than most from rising oil prices, are turning to renewables - a trend the Commission actively supports. As a decentralised energy source par excellence , these technologies offer special opportun- ities to outlying areas and countries lacking a national electricity grid. Developing EU capacity Sometime next year, the Commission is due to invite Member States to discuss new targets for renewable energy beyond 2010. The European Parliament has already suggested that targets could reach 25% by 2020, while Stavros Dimas, the Environment Commissioner, has pub- licly stated that this should be seriously considered. At the same time, the Commission is con- tinuing to assess how to increase the use of renewable energy sources of electricity. Among the different measures now in place in EU Member States are feed-in tar- iffs (whereby distributors pay a fixed rate to domestic producers of green electrici- ty), green certificates (setting quotas or percentages for consumption from renew- able sources), tendering requirements and fiscal incentives. T he EU\u2019s comprehensive and target- based renewable energy policy is now delivering tangible results and is one of Europe\u2019s fastest growing sectors, with an annual turnover of some \u20ac 15 billion. Renewable technologies \u2013 hydro, modern biomass, wind, solar, geothermal and bio- fuels \u2013 are now competing with conven- tional fuels in four distinct markets: power generation, hot water and heating, transportation fuels and rural, off-grid, energy supplies. Renewables now provide 6% of the EU\u2019s energy needs and 14% of its electricity. Both are still well below the respective 12% and 21% targets Europe has set itself for 2010, but their share of the market is steadily increasing. Some Member States are at the cutting edge of technological breakthroughs. Denmark, Spain and Germany are leading the way in wind power, while the UK is installing the world\u2019s largest advanced tidal energy system. Renewable energy has many pluses. It can limit the EU\u2019s dependency on imported energy and increase its security of supply. Both considerations are now to the fore after the temporary disruption of Russian gas supplies at the beginning of the year and against a background of high oil prices. The different forms of clean energy reduce the EU\u2019s overall level of greenhouse gas emissions. They also promote innovation The Commission believes there is room for more cross-border cooperation, such as between the German, French and Spanish feed-in tariffs. Scope also exists for optimising national schemes by reducing administrative barriers, improv- ing grid arrangements and minimising investment risks. Alongside these more general initiatives, the Commission has tabled a biomass action plan, with 20 specific measures to make better use of forestry, agricultural and waste materials in generating energy for heating, electricity and transport. It aims to promote the use of biofuels, which currently have just 0.8% of the EU market \u2013 well below the 5.75% target set for 2010. To remedy this, it proposes to follow the example of countries like Brazil, China and India and require sup- pliers to include a minimum quantity of biofuels among the conventional fuel they place on the market. Implementation of the various measures could increase the use of biomass to some 150 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2010 compared to less than half that figure three years ago. This in turn would enable the EU to reach the targets set for 2010, lower greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs for up to 300,000 people and reduce reliance on imported energy. \u00bb Hope for the new generation The creation of a common European energy policy is now very much on the EU\u2019s policy agenda. Renewable energy can help satisfy Europe\u2019s energy needs and in the process meet wider environmental, economic, security and development objectives. The European Commission is examining ways to give a further boost to existing policy on renewables, both through domestic initiatives and international cooperation. \u00a9 European Communities ",
        "4 E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s N o 2 3 March 2006 International cooperation Global investment in renewable energy reached a new high in 2004: $30 billion, according to research by the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Cen- tury (REN21). As a result, renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydropower, biomass and geothermal provide more energy than ever before and account for 17% of global primary energy supply. An estimated 40 million households around the world now heat their water with solar collectors and there are over 4.5 million green power consumers in Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan using renewable electricity. Countries outside the EU with the strongest markets in renewable energies include Brazil (particularly for biofuels), China (solar hot water and small hydro), India (wind and rural solar and biomass) and Japan (solar PV). As far back as 2002, the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Develop- ment in Johannesburg started the ball rolling by agreeing that the global share of renewable energy should be increased, but it shied away from the sensitive issue of setting concrete goals. This led the EU and like-minded countries to establish the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition (JREC). Co-chaired by the European Commission and Morocco, it now has 90 members and is committed to developing renewables through target- based cooperation. The first breakthrough came in Bonn in June 2004 when participants at the re- newable energy conference agreed to create the REN21 multi-stakeholder network and adopted an international action plan with over 200 specific commitments. This was followed last November by an even more significant development at an international conference held in Beijing, which demonstrated the strength of international cooperation in this area. For the first time, an agreement in principle was reached to monitor the share of renewable sources of energy on the world market at regular intervals. Almost 50 countries worldwide, including 14 in the developing world, now have some kind of renewable energy promo- tion policy and over 45 have introduced renewable energy targets. China, for instance, recently adopted legislation encouraging the development of renewable energy sources for electricity. In cooperation with the International Energy Agency, the Commission is now aiming to make the JREC Renewable Energy Policy and Measures Database the largest online data repository of national renewable energy policies. The target is for all 90 JREC and other major countries to be covered by the time of the 2006 session of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Commission in May. The database could also be used to track global progress in implementing the Beijing commitments.

        "T he recent sight of Prague, one of Europe\u2019s major cities, knee-deep under water brought home the fact that flooding is a major environmental hazard. It is a tragedy that can hit large parts of the continent, not just low-lying coastal areas. Between 1998 and 2004, Europe suffered over 100 major floods. These included the catastrophic events of the summer of 2002 when the Danube and Elbe rivers burst their banks unleashing torrents of destruction. The human and material costs involved are enormous. Over the past eight years, floods in Europe have claimed some 700 lives, forced half a million people to flee their homes and caused at least \u20ac 25 billion worth of insured economic losses. Risks on the increase Various factors suggest that Europe will have to contend with more, not fewer, floods in the years ahead. Climate change is leading to higher rainfall and raising sea levels. Inadequate management of river systems and the expansion of build- ing on river plains reduce the capacity of the ground to absorb floodwaters. There is a growing tendency for people and businesses to be based in areas of potential danger. Along the Rhine, more than 10 million people are at risk from flooding, while the potential damage is valued at around \u20ac 165 billion. Coastal areas, many of which are already contending with erosion, are perhaps in the front line. The total value of economic assets based within half a kilometre of the sea around Europe\u2019s coastline is up to \u20ac 1,000 billion. Floods also damage the environment, for instance by destroying wetlands and reducing biological diversity. They can spread pollution far and wide from instal- lations such as wastewater treatment plants or factories using toxic chemicals. Coordinated action National authorities are already heavily involved in devising flood protection measures. However, since most of Europe\u2019s major river basins cover more than one country, concerted EU action should yield stronger dividends. In all river basins and coastal areas, coordination and long-term planning are required to ensure that floods, as well as measures for managing them, do not unnecessarily damage the environment or the economy or endanger human life. The Commission is proposing a Europe- wide framework for flood risk manage- ment. This would be closely linked to the Water Framework Directive that is at the heart of the EU\u2019s water protection policy. The Directive would require national authorities to assess the risk of flooding in river basins and coastal zones. Where potential dangers are identified, flood risk maps must be developed, supplemented by plans for managing these risks. The plans will cover all phases of the flood risk management cycle. They will concentrate on preventing damage by not allowing buildings to be constructed in flood-prone areas and by promoting appropriate land-use policies among farmers. They will examine protective measures to reduce the likelihood of floods, and establish emergency proced- ures when flooding is unavoidable. The legislation also aims to enhance public information and increase citizens\u2019 involvement in developing flood pro- tection measures. (cid:3) Ready for the rising waters Floods cause an enormous amount of physical damage and loss of life in Europe. Unfortunately, due to climate change they are on the increase. Floods are natural phenomena that cannot be prevented. However, to reduce their impact, the European Commission has proposed legislation that would identify areas under threat. These assessments would lead to the development of flood risk management plans concentrating on prevention, protection and preparedness.

        "E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s N o 2 3 March 2006 6 Greening our cities F our out of five Europeans now live in urban areas, so the quality of our urban environment has a direct impact on our wellbeing. \u201cEurope\u2019s cities should be sustainable and offer a high quality of life so that people want to live and work in them and businesses want to invest there,\u201d said EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas. \u201cThe Thematic Strategy on the urban environment works with Member States to help regional and local authorities learn from one another about measures that are particularly effective in improving the environmental performance of our cities.\u201d Modern living means Europe\u2019s towns and cities face many challenges. These range from urban sprawl to traffic jams, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and waste management. Environmental prob- lems do not come from one source alone, but from many factors together, so effec- tive solutions have to take account of all potential side effects and ensure that the intended results are not undermined by action elsewhere. For example, improving air quality by purchasing low-emission buses may be less effective if land-use planning decisions are encouraging private car-use through the construction of city- centre car parks. The strategy\u2019s approach aims to coord- inate and maximise the impact of existing measures, and encourages local policy- makers to build on examples of good practice. Putting local knowledge to use Local authorities are the main actors, but national governments and the EU need to provide support and cooperate with the local level to ensure that policies are coherent. The strategy aims to help local authorities to implement European envir- onmental legislation better and high- lights opportunities for EU funding, for instance through the Cohesion Policy. The approach taken is the result of wide- ranging discussions over a four-year period on what needs to be done to complement existing policies at the local level, for instance on air quality, wastewater treat- ment, noise, etc. The Commission organised seven expert working groups and public consultations in 2004 and 2005. Reflecting the consult- ations, the strategy lists four main areas for action at EU level, which will need to be taken forward by all authorities: \u275a The Commission will offer technical guidance to local authorities on inte- grated environmental management and sustainable urban transport plans, drawing on the experience of the most successful cities. This will support the implementation of EU environmental laws at local level; \u275a Support for training and capacity- building will help local managers to improve their knowledge and skills; \u275a The Commission will offer support for demonstration projects and networking and explore the scope for setting up an EU-wide scheme for the exchange of best practice; \u275a The Commission is considering setting up a new thematic internet portal to help local authorities access useful and up-to-date information. The European Environment Agency (EEA) and Member States will be involved in improving the amount and quality of data on the urban environment, to monitor progress. Based on thorough consultation of stake- holders, the Commission decided it was not justified to propose any new legisla- tion. The strategy does not impose costs on public authorities or business. Voluntary adoption of the recommended measures could cost around 0.7% of a city\u2019s transport budget over a five-year period. However, the price of doing nothing would be much greater, including some 370,000 premature deaths each year due to air pollution, damage to the envir- onment, and the waste of time and resources caused by traffic congestion. (cid:3) In January 2006 the European Commission launched another of its seven Thematic Strategies for the environment \u2013 this time aimed at improving the quality of life in Europe\u2019s towns and cities.

        "March 2006 N o 2 3 E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s 7 An extraordinarily busy year on the green front T he 2005 Environment Policy Review highlights three broad areas where the EU was especially busy: climate change, development of the Thematic Strategies (see EFE 21 ), and defining the role of better policy-making on green issues within the EU\u2019s Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs. Emphasising and strengthening the link between economic growth and environ- mental well-being was a top priority during the year. Much of our prosperity depends to a large extent on the quality of environment. Safeguarding the envir- onment is ultimately cheaper and more effective than dealing with pollution and damage after it happens, and research in early 2005 demonstrated that climate change, for example, will become more and more expensive the longer we fail to confront it. Eco-innovation and the development of new, green technologies can make a major contribution to EU growth and competitiveness whilst improving quality of life. The review points out that EU eco- industries have been growing by around 5% a year since the mid-1990s \u2013 faster than the economy \u2013 and now employ over 2 million people, creating a trade surplus of \u20ac 600 million in 2005 and controlling about one-third of the global market. In 2005 the EU renewed its Lisbon Strategy, originally launched in 2000 with the aim of making Europe a more competitive, knowledge-based economy. In March 2005, the European Council emphasised that higher growth and more and better jobs must come within overall sustainable development, incorporating economic, social and environmental dimensions. During the year, the European Commission took steps to speed up implementation of its Environmental Technologies Action Plan (ETAP), working with Member States to draw up ETAP roadmaps for innov- ation and exchange of good practice, and earmarked investment for future research and development. New approach 2005 was also a landmark year for climate change, with the launch of the EU Emission Trading Scheme, the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s entry into force on 16 February, and the United Nations conference in Montreal in December attended by more than 180 nations. The EU took a leading role in securing 40 decisions that strengthen the Kyoto Protocol and opening the way for global talks on future action in a wide forum, so that countries currently outside the Kyoto framework are also taken on board. By January 2006, the Commission had adopted five of its seven planned Thematic Strategies, on air pollution, marine and urban environments, use of resources, and waste. Work on the final two \u2013 soil protection and pesticides \u2013 was well under way. This approach conformed to the general drive for better regulation: the Thematic Strategies represent a new way of making policy through detailed assess- ment of impacts, extensive stakeholder consultation and use of integrated and flexible policy instruments to achieve both short and long-term objectives. Looking to the future Two other issues came high on the list of green priorities in 2005: the control of chemicals through the new regulatory system known as REACH, which made significant progress towards becoming law, and moves to preserve biodiversity, which will remain at the top of the agenda for 2006 (see page 14). Looking forward to the rest of 2006 and beyond, the report highlights the need to implement existing laws correctly, this year\u2019s review of the Emission Trading Scheme, the importance of biodiversity and completion of the Natura 2000 wildlife network, and calls for swifter action to conserve dwindling natural resources, both EU-wide and globally. (cid:3) February 2006 saw the publication of the third annual Environment Policy Review, an important means of assessing long-term progress on green issues in the EU. It reveals that 2005 was a year when environmental policy made a great leap forward.

        "E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s N o 2 3 March 2006 8 T he new Science for Environment Policy service was launched in early January 2006 and within less than a month 2,000 people signed up to receive it. The News Alert covers all the main envir- onment policy areas and must meet high standards of scientific accuracy. It also aims to address \u2018hot\u2019 topics, where policy- makers are looking for the best way to respond to immediate problems. Its goal is to bridge the gap between scien- tists and academics on the one hand, and politicians and business on the other. A firm foundation One of the key objectives of the EU\u2019s Sixth Environment Action Programme, which runs until 2012, is to ensure that policy decisions are based on sound scien- tific facts, as well as clear assessment of economic impacts. In the past, the links between research scientists and environ- mental policy-makers have not always been as good as they could have been, and therefore important findings were not reaching the people who could make the best use of them. New research pro- jects are launched every year in Europe and around the world, but sometimes the results may be highly technical and hard to relate to day-to-day situations. Another News Alert focuses on an epide- miological study showing that loud traffic noise, over a long period, can contribute to heart disease. German researchers collected data from across the city of Berlin, and concluded that men \u2013 but not women \u2013 run a greater risk of heart attack due to the physiological stress induced by chronic noise exposure. Scientifically based data of this kind can have an important impact in the design of policies. An account of research in Australia reveals that mice fed with genetically modified peas suffered an adverse reac- tion, including inflammation in the lungs. As a result of the study, all the GM pea plants were destroyed. \u201cThe case emphasises the important role science can play in decision-making,\u201d concludes the article.

But they need to be widely disseminated and presented in an interesting and accessible format. The information can also be used by business and industry in the search for eco-friendly innovations and solutions to environmental challenges. As well as the News Alert delivered each week into subscribers\u2019 electronic mailboxes, the Science for Environment Policy website gives access to all the articles, sorted by date or theme. Findings come not only from EU-funded research projects but also from other reliable international data sources. Making an impact The A to Z of research topics ranges widely, from agriculture and health to biotech- nology and risk assessment. Each one- page study report outlines the subject, the research methods, and the conclusions and recommendations. The first issue, for example, highlighted work by Swiss scientists examining the decline of fish stocks in rivers. Their find- ings are the result of five years of work, gathering data going back 20 years, and give rise to specific proposals for halting the loss of fish populations. \u00a9 P. Wagnon - IRD ",

Carl: This area of activity is extremely important. When it became obvious that this post would be available I jumped at it straight away. I have been working on questions of inter- national and domestic economic policy for these past 25 years [in DG Trade, External Relations, and the World Bank] and have taken part in a lot of international negoti- ations. So I have had frequent professional contact with a number of the issues this DG deals with: GMOs, trade and environ- ment, forest protection, animal welfare, and so on. But the main reason is of a more personal nature. I have always had a very strong interest in environmental questions. \u275a What do you regard as the main environmental challenges over the coming period? Carl: This is an enormous and fascinating task that I have inherited. We have several problems to overcome in order to move forward internationally in important areas, where we face scepticism from our poten- tial partners. The USA has little enthusiasm for international rule making, but it\u2019s not only them. In a year\u2019s time the bigger developing countries will account for similar outputs of greenhouse gases. I have been putting quite a lot of emphasis on climate change because I found it was under funded compared with the huge task ahead of us, and if we don\u2019t get control of this agenda then many of the other things we are trying to achieve will count for nothing in 20 to 30 years. Where Europe has been playing a leading role we must continue to do this, finding new approaches to bring others along with us. It is not enough for us to do more and better in Europe alone. Domestically, the main problem is that a cleaner and better environment comes at a cost. But it\u2019s my impression that the over- all political atmosphere is favourable and support for more effective European legis- lation is very widespread. \u275a Can the EU make a difference on global issues like climate change? Carl: Not only can the EU make a differ- ence, it must make the difference. If we don\u2019t, nobody else will. This applies not only to climate change but also to other key issues such as chemicals \u2013 where the EU has been leading negotiations at the UN conference in Dubai \u2013 and of course bio- diversity, natural resources, air pollution and sustainable development. The EU has a unique role to play because of the way our societies and our politics have developed. Support from the citizens and governments of Europe is exceptionally strong. Surveys have shown that environ- ment is perhaps the area where our fellow citizens see the strongest added value at European level. > M e e t t h e n e w D i r e c t o r - G e n e r a l \u275a Do you think that environment is given a high enough priority in policy-making generally in Europe? Carl: It\u2019s never high enough, but you have to compare it with the starting point 30-odd years ago. Tremendous progress has been made, and must continue across the board. There is resistance from some parts of industry because of costs and impact on competitiveness, but it would be a mistake to think that opposition from the private sector or governments is stalling further progress. That is not the case. \u275a Is there still time to make the right decisions to save the planet? Carl: My impression is that the over- whelming body of scientific opinion thinks it is not too late. What is true is that the longer the international community post- pones tackling greenhouse gas emissions, the more expensive it will become. I believe that international opinion now has a fundamental understanding of the consequences of inaction. It\u2019s a question of transforming that understanding into concrete action \u2013 and that\u2019s one of our biggest challenges.

The 54 projects selected cover 20 Member States and accession countries, with nine projects involving cooperation between two or more countries. The EU contribution represents 55% of the total investment ( \u20ac 125 mil- lion), with the rest coming from national, regional and local authorities, nature con- servation NGOs and other stakeholders. Most projects will restore Natura 2000 sites, setting up long-term management and raising public awareness. They target endangered species, such as the great bustard in Slovakia and Austria, otters in Belgium and Luxembourg, or the marsh fritillary \u2013 a type of butterfly \u2013 in Denmark. Endangered habitats are also a focus, such as coastal lagoons in the Baltic region, Mediterranean temporary ponds in Minorca, yew woodlands in Ireland or juniper heaths in Germany. EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas welcomed the new projects. \u201cI am The Natura 2000 network of protected sites is the backbone of EU efforts to conserve diverse wildlife species and habitats across the Member States. In 2005, under the LIFE-Nature programme, the European Commission invested \u20ac 69 million in 54 nature conservation projects to help build up this network.

Having visited LIFE-Nature sites myself, I have seen the difference this dynamic collaboration can make.\u201d The Natura 2000 network already includes over 18,000 sites, covering an area almost the size of France. Since 1992, the LIFE programme has invested \u20ac 1,500 million in some 2,500 projects. (cid:3) The Dalmatian pelican is on the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List of threatened species. Some 400 couples, or 10% of the 4-5,000 breeding pairs remaining worldwide, live and breed in the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve in Romania, and are crucial to the survival of the species. This project aims to pro- tect and increase their numbers. Specific conservation measures will encourage the pelicans to breed by protecting their habitats from dis- turbances, using specially trained wardens to guard against intruders. Rules on hunting and fishing will help to protect the birds from acci- dental injury and death. All the breeding grounds will be designated as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the EU Birds Directive. A comprehensive monitoring programme will check the pelicans\u2019 move- ments and population size, and evaluate the impact of the project. The houting \u2013 a member of the white fish family \u2013 used to be found throughout the Wadden Sea, spanning parts of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. However, its sensitivity to small disturbances in its habitat has brought a sharp decline in numbers. The houting now breeds in only six river systems in Denmark. The project aims to increase fish numbers in four Danish rivers and explore the possibility of reintroducing it into other rivers where it used to be found. The houting is unable to negotiate even small obstacles in waterways as it makes its way upstream to spawn. So weirs, dams and fish ladders are a major factor in limiting reproduction. Part of the project will help the houting to reach its spawning grounds by removing such barriers, involving the decommissioning of two hydroelectric power plants and three fish farms. The scheme will also have a wide beneficial effect on these river eco- systems and on several other wildlife species including otters, salmon, lamprey and loach.

        "March 2006 11 N o 2 3 E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s In the south of Italy lies an important area for the conservation of a number of different species of birds of prey, or raptors. This project aims to improve their conservation status in two Natura 2000 sites: Gravine di Matera, part of a regional archaeological park, and Lago San Giuliano e Timmari, a 1,000-hectare nature reserve along the banks of an artificial lake. These sites are hunting grounds for the most import- ant Italian population of the lesser kestrel. Around 500 pairs \u2013 3% of the estimated total in Europe \u2013 live in the remarkable and unique urban fabric of Matera (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) and Montescaglioso. Three other bird species at risk of extinction in Italy also make their homes in these sites: the Lanner falcon, the Egyptian vulture and the red kite. The project aims to safeguard these birds, in har- mony with the local residents, as well as working on a wider strategy for their preservation across Europe. Germany: Restoring the Upper Hotzenwald Greece: Mitigating the conflicts between fishermen and monk seals In the Black Forest, near the southern German border, lies the mountain area of the Hotzenwald: 2,105 hectares of forests, meadows, fens and streams situated 1,000 metres above sea level. The Upper Hotzenwald is a significant biodiversity \u2018hotspot\u2019, containing 21 of the endangered habitats listed by the EU Habitats Directive. However, this exceptional landscape and its wildlife are at risk. The project will undertake a range of activities to promote the area\u2019s conservation. These will include clearing conifers and overgrowth, restoring grazing lands, encouraging native wildlife such as capercaillie and hazel grouse, and removing drainage systems to restore raised bogs and bog woodland. It will work in close collaboration with local authorities, farmers and landowners, as well as setting up a forum for involving local stake- holders, and carrying out educational activities focusing on Natura 2000. The monk seal is one of the six most threatened mammals in the world. About 90% of the European population lives in Greece. Although this is the largest group globally, it numbers only about 200 to 250 individuals. Greece has been working for 15 years to conserve the monk seal, but conflict between the mam- mals and the interests of local fishing commu- nities remains a key problem. The seals are believed to compete for fish and damage equip- ment. Lack of knowledge hampers cooperation. Thus, fishermen may resort to killing the mam- mals deliberately, or at least failing to assist them when they are at risk. The outcome is a major threat to the monk seal\u2019s survival. Coordinated by the Hellenic Society for the Study and Protection of the Monk Seal (MOM), the project covers the entire Greek seacoast \u2013 15,000 km of coastline and 3,000 islands \u2013 and addresses the interests of both sides in this conflict. Interviews with fishermen in seven \u2018hot spot\u2019 areas will identify the problems more closely, and an awareness campaign will increase co- operation with local stake- holders. At the same time, the project will test the use of acoustic devices to keep the seals away from fishing gear and study their feeding preferences. Hungary: Saving the unique Pannonian grasslands Hungary\u2019s Pannonian grasslands and steppes are unique, formed through centuries of exten- sive grazing, and include a number of the priority habitats protected by EU legislation. However, EU membership and funding from the Common Agricultural Policy has encouraged Hungarian farmers either to intensify their use, with ploughing and fertilisers, or to abandon them completely, allowing them to revert to forests. This is threatening the very existence of the Pannonian grasslands. The project, coordinated by the NGO BirdLife Hungary, will examine the best way to manage six of these characteristic habitats. It will restore and conserve 720 hectares, through techniques such as grazing, mowing and clearing of overgrowth, and will develop sus- tainable management plans for each of them. Information on best practices will be provided to land managers, farmers and the public, and this advisory function will continue after the end of the project.

        "N o 2 3 March 2006 12 E very year, the EU generates more than 400 million tonnes of leftover materials from mining operations \u2013 or \u2018extractive industries\u2019 as they are known. This amounts to over 20% of the waste generated in Europe, and comprises the single largest category. So ensuring these materials are stored or disposed of in a safe and environmentally sound way is very important. Mining waste includes materials such as topsoil, rock, and tailings (the solids left over from the processing of ore), which are discarded during prospecting, extrac- tion and treatment of coal and minerals, for example. If not properly managed, mining waste can pose a serious risk to both human health and the environment. It accumulates in large quantities, can produce acid pollution, and dangerous substances such as cyanide are sometimes added during processing. This has given rise to a string of disas- ters in Europe over the past 40 years. In Aberfan, South Wales, in 1966, a coal tip collapsed on top of a primary school, killing 144 people, most of them children. In Stava, Italy, in 1985, a fluorite tailings dam collapsed, wrecking 62 buildings and leaving 268 people dead. More recently, in 1998, a damburst in Aznalc\u00f3llar in Spain poisoned the river Guadiamar and the Do\u00f1ana national park. Two years later, in 2000, a tailings dam gave way in Baia Mare, Romania, releasing 120 tonnes of cyanide into the Lapus, Tisza and Danube rivers, killing thousands of fish and destroying the ecosystem of hundreds of kilometres of waterways in Romania and Hungary. Such incidents, which also devastate the economies of local communities, con- vinced the European Commission that it was time to set down EU-wide regulations to prevent similar disasters happening in the future. Tackling chronic and acute pollution The proposal aims to improve the way waste is managed, and to set minimum standards to prevent soil and water pollu- tion and protect human health and the environment. It deals with the planning, licensing, operation, closure and aftercare of waste. Mine operators will have to draw up waste management plans, and operating permits will impose conditions to ensure that environmental and health safe- guards are in place from the outset. The Directive demands monitoring proced- ures, and financial guarantees to ensure that contaminated land can be cleaned up after mining operations are finished. One very important element of the pro- posal is that it provides for public partici- pation in decisions on the issue of permits. All waste facilities must be classified according to risk. The most dangerous areas will have to adopt a major-accident policy covering prevention of disasters and the setting up of emergency-response mechanisms, including supplying infor- mation to the public and joint consult- ation in the event of pollution spreading from one country to another. To deal with damage left over from the past, the rules require the drawing up of inventories of the most polluting sites already closed or abandoned. Before enlargement, the EU invested several million euros in assessing and cleaning up old sites in central and eastern European countries, including waste tips from post-war uranium mines that posed a risk from low-level radiation. The new measure aims to promote the highest environmental standards across all 25 Member States. EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas welcomed the proposed legislation, saying it offers \u201ca specific legal framework to tackle environmental and human health impacts throughout the life cycle of mining waste facilities, and to prevent accidents\u201d.

        "March 2006 N o 2 3 E n v i r o n m e n t f o r E u r o p e a n s 13 L egal trade in wild flora and fauna is estimated to be worth 10-20 billion euro a year worldwide, and involves hundreds of millions of plant and animal specimens. It includes not only living organisms but also products such as food, timber, fashion items and ingredients for traditional medicines. Trade in rare species, sometimes for big profits, can seriously threaten their existence, so a framework to stop their over- exploitation is a question of life or death. An outright ban on international trade covers around 900 of the most endangered species. But controlling the commercial import and export of more common forms of wildlife is also important, to ensure the sustainable use of resources for the future. Europe is the second largest market for species and products, after the USA. Between 1996 and 2002, the 25 Member States imported 86% of the live birds and 35% of the reptile skins traded around the world. Level of threat CITES operates through the issuing of permits under specific conditions. The Convention protects about 5,000 animals and 28,000 plants, grouped into three categories: \u275a Appendix I: species threatened with extinction, where trade is allowed only under exceptional circumstances; \u275a Appendix II: species that may become under threat unless commercial trade is controlled; \u275a Appendix III: species covered by regulations in individual countries, requiring the cooperation of others to prevent illegal exports. CITES has established its own criteria for assessing levels of threat and amending the Appendices as appropriate. The Conference of the Parties (COP) to CITES meets every three years to discuss changes and implementation. Over time, the EU has taken a leading role on a series of key issues, including the ivory trade. The latest COP (13) took place in Bangkok in October 2004. The EU itself is not a Party to CITES for technical reasons. However, the Union implemented the Convention through a Council Regu- lation adopted in 1982. In 1997, two new Regulations tightened up the rules and brought them into line with the single market. The EU is currently bringing in another amendment aimed at, among other things, combating the illegal caviar trade. Sturgeon population The plight of wild sturgeons, which breed mainly in the Caspian and Black Seas and the lower Danube, hit the headlines in January 2006, when the CITES Secretariat refused to publish the export quotas for caviar and other wild sturgeon products, thereby effectively suspending trade. The region exports up to 150 tonnes of caviar each year, under an approved quota system, with much of it finding its way into shops in the EU. But sturgeon numbers in the area have been falling alarmingly, and this year CITES announced it was not satisfied that the supply was coming from sustainable sources. It called on exporting countries to take account in their quotas of the extent of illegal fishing and to demonstrate that stocks can be maintained. Importers like the EU also have a responsibility to ensure that supplies are from legal and sustainable sources, with strict rules on processing and labelling. The European Commission has called on Member States to toughen up enforcement of CITES rules, for example by harmonising penalties for illegal traders, and raising awareness among police, customs officials and the judiciary.

        "T he Commission is preparing a Com- munication on Halting the loss of bio- diversity by 2010 \u2013 and beyond , likely to be adopted around May 2006. Biodiver- sity assures the flow of vital \u2018ecosystem services\u2019 \u2013 such as production of food and fibre, purification of water, nutrient cycling \u2013 which underpin our prosperity, security and quality of life. Land-use change, pollution, over-exploit- ation of natural resources, climate change and spread of alien species all cause loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In Europe, hundreds of species are at risk of extinction, ecosystems are fragmented, and there are many signs of decline, from collapsing fish stocks to severe floods. The Communication will set out a road map to meet the EU objectives to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010, to secure the recovery of nature in the EU, and to contribute better to reducing the global rate of loss by 2010. \u201cFor the first time there will be a clear, comprehensive EU plan of priority actions identifying who should do what \u2013 at both Community and Member State levels,\u201d explained DG Environment\u2019s principal administrator for biodiversity policy, Guy Duke. At policy level, the EU has made significant progress, integrating biodiversity into internal and external policies from agriculture to fisheries to the new Thematic Strategies (see EFE 21 ), and building up the Natura 2000 network of over 20,000 sites for conservation. \u201cThe Communication will not propose new legislation \u2013 though it will highlight gaps that need further consideration. But the emphasis is on implementation,\u201d he added. In preparing the Communication, the Commission sought feedback through an Internet consultation. Questions on key challenges brought a big and supportive public response for the road-map approach. Global context The international community has been addressing biodiversity loss since 1992 in the framework of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) with three objectives: the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its compon- ents and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of genetic resources. At the 2002 UN World Summit on Sustainable Development, world leaders resolved to \u201csignificantly reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010\u201d. The seventh Conference of the Parties (COP 7) to the CBD in February 2004 agreed to establish a global network of protected sites. \u201cSince then, there has been quite a lot of activity, with NGOs pooling resources and some countries making real progress in identifying gaps and establishing big new protected areas \u2013 for instance Brazil. But it varies sub- stantially from country to country,\u201d explained DG Environment\u2019s global biodiversity policy officer Stefan Leiner. \u201cReducing biodiversity loss does not mean giving priority to nature protection over poverty eradication. Quite the opposite: the protection and sustainable use of biodiversity contributes to reducing poverty.\u201d The eighth Conference of the Parties (COP 8) to the CBD took place in Curitiba, Brazil, in March 2006, together with a meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, governing move- ments of genetically modified organisms. Green Week 2006 Biodiversity is also the focus of attention at the European Commission\u2019s annual Green Week in 2006. Policy-makers and stakeholders will be invited to examine four main topics: biodiversity as a global issue, managing natural resources, space for nature, and biodiversity and society. Finally, IUCN, the World Conservation Union, is organising a conference on biodiversity and development cooper- ation in September 2006, as part of its Countdown 2010 initiative.

The Directive will mean that at least one quarter of the heavy-duty vehicles public bodies purchase or lease each year must be more environmentally friendly. It will initially cover buses, lorries and vans weighing more than 3.5 tonnes, but the quota could be extended to other vehicles in the future. Manufacturers have already developed a range of vehicles that produce fewer emissions, for example running on biofuels, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), hydrogen or electricity. But so far they are not widely used. The measure will improve air quality, help to arrest climate change, and save an esti- mated \u20ac 1,050 million through cutting damage caused by pollutants and green- house gases by 2030. And it will boost the production of cleaner vehicles by giving manufacturers a guaranteed market.

Mercury is highly toxic, and when released into the environment it damages human health, wildlife and ecosystems. The new initiative is designed to cut industrial demand for the material, and encourage manufacturers to develop substitutes. At the same time, the European Parlia- ment Environment Committee gave its backing to the proposed Mercury Strategy (see EFE 17 ) for cutting EU and global emissions. The European Commission is drawing up a Regulation to ban EU exports of mercury and ensure safe storage of unused mercury, likely to be adopted in spring 2006. The Commission is also organising an international conference in October 2006, bringing together industrialised and developing nations to examine the problem and explore scope for global action to cut mercury pollution, including trade measures.

In January 2006, the European Commission published guidelines for drawing up the National Allocation Plans (NAPs) \u2013 the starting point for efforts to cut green- house gases cost-effectively through the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). This will be the second \u2018trading period\u2019 since the ETS kicked off in January 2005, and is crucial because it coincides with the period when the EU must hit its emis- sion-reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The Commission also urged governments to make their NAPs more transparent and easier to implement.

It is the first global system covering the production and use of all types of chemicals, and applies the precautionary principle to the use of hazardous substances. In improving safety, it aims to counter poverty, protect vulnerable groups and advance human health, environmental protection and security. The deal follows a commitment made at the 2002 Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development to minimise risks by 2020. \u201cIn Dubai we have written the road map and made a common commitment to take action and monitor progress over the next 14 years,\u201d said EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas.
