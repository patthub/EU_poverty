The transitionfrom a centrally planned to a market economy creates opportunities for individuals to improve their standard of living. The other side of the coin is a greater risk of unemployment. Individuals who find that they do not have the skills required in the new economic environment may suffer stress and a resultant worsening of their health. Centrally planned economies were characterised by an artifi cially flat distribution of incomes. One of the consequences of the transition to a market economy is greater income inequality. This raises issues which need to be dealt with by society as a whole. In the absence of an adequate social safety net, people who lack inde pendent sources of income will end up living in poverty. For most of the countries in cen tral and Eastern Europe, the effect of economic transition on health was initially nega tive. The situation in many of these countries is now improving. Analysis suggests that the long-term effects of transition on health will be positive if appropriate social policies are implemented. Cross-country health comparisons are usually based on variables such as infant mortal ity (number of deaths of infants less than one year of age per thousand live births) and life expectancy at birth. Empirical evidence suggests that life expectancy is positively re lated to income and wealth, but at higher levels the differences in national income explain less of the health differentials than at lower levels. This suggests that, as a country be comes wealthier, the role of public policy in determining the health of its population may become more important. When the CEECs started the transition towards a market econ omy at the end of the 1980s, their health status was more favourable than would have been expected from their GDP per capita. This was largely due to the provision of comprehen sive health care and a basic level of income for the entire population. Over-staffed and over-bedded hospitals, on the other hand, were an indication that health services were generally not economically efficient. ",

Ukraine y\\ . ^__^\u2014 s Latvia Russia 93 94 95 96 The limitations of this approach to health care became evident from the mid-1970s. While infant mortality rates continued to im prove, life expectancy in the CEECs stagnated. The steady decline in infant mortality can be explained by the successfulfight against infectious diseases. That the health care system under central planning was much less well equipped to deal with non-infectious diseases explains to a great extent why there was little increase in life expectancy. The widening gap with the EU was substantially due to a rise in heart diseases among middle-aged men. It is an established fact that, as incomes rise, the causes of death shift from infectious to non-infectious diseases, but this does not ap pear to be the only factor at work here. Environmental pollution, unhealthy lifestyles and lagging medical technology all contrib uted to the increase in heart and liver diseases and cancers in the CEECs before 1990. At the start of the transition, around 1990, infant mortality started to rise again in some of the CEECs. Infant mortality initially went up sharply in the three Baltic states, but was little affected in Poland, Hungary, Slovenia and the Czech Republic, where its long-term decline continued. Developments in Bulgaria in 1996 and early 1997 (see the previous Economic Reform Monitor) show that sharp changes in household incomes can have dra matic effects on infant mortality. Life expectancy initially dropped in all of the countries, with the notable exception of Romania where life expectancy fell only slightly after first rising. In Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Re public, life expectancy is now one to two years longer than im mediately before the start of transition. Life expectancy in Hungary was little affected, whereas in Slovenia it quickly recov ered its pre\u2014transition level and then increased to a level that is not too far from the EU average. The picture in Bulgaria and the former Soviet Republics is rather different. Life expectancy is now rising again, but only after falling to levels which were 3 to 5 years below what they were immediately before 1990. One striking feature of developments is that the life expectancy of women has been less affected than the life expectancy of men. In deed, outside the former Soviet Union, the life expectancies of women have hardly been altered by transition. The reasons for this are not fully clear, but it may be that men have been more prone to alcohol and tobacco abuse, and have suffered more stress related to the loss of job security. In addition, more deaths due to external causes such as traffic accidents, murder and sui cides have been reported in the former Soviet Republics. GRAPH 2 : Life expectancy at birth years 80 75 70 65 60 -, EU Average 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 Source : WHO, Eurostat, National Statistics. Just as GDP figures do not give the full picture of a country's economy, life expectancy statistics are not enough to characterise the health of its population. Alongside figures which suggest that transition has generally had only a minor and short-lived effect on overall health, there have been some worrying developments which point to the impact of increased inequality. Tuberculosis, often regarded as a disease of poverty, has reappeared in some countries. Associated with the rise in infant mortality in some CEECS, there has been an increase in the percentage of children with a low birth weight. This may partly reflect the poor health and nutrition of their mothers. Altogether, this paints a rather complex picture of relationships between national health and the economic and social effects of the transition towards a market economy anda more western style society. Economic convergence on its own will not automatically lift health and welfare in central and eastern European countries to EU standards. This has implications for health and social se curity policies. Most transition economies - which had collective financing and public provision of health services under central planning - have adopted a mixed system, with varying degrees of public and private provision of health services, financed primar ily by public funds. With a desire to follow the western model and catch up with EU standards of care, many of the CEECs have re tained relatively high public health expenditure as a share of GDP without proper restructuring of the health sector. In some cases, health expenditure is increasing, despite frozen salary levels of hospital staff, because of the high and rising cost of medical sup plies. Capital investment in the health sector has generally plum meted in the early years of the transition period, in spite of the need for more modern technology. The continuing need forprudentfiscal policies means that simply increasing public spending on the health sector is not an option. In any event, higher government expenditure will not be sufficient to improve the situation in the long run. Achieving sustained im provements in the health of the people of central and Eastern Europe requires a comprehensive approach. As well as improving the efficiency of health services and social security systems, es sential ingredients of policies to narrow the \"health gap \" should include preventative measures, such as the promotion of healthier lifestyles, both through public education and tax incentives. Health care reform in a period of economic transition is particu larly difficult, but the costs of postponing action could be enor mous. ",

Country Notes (page) Bulgaria 3 Czech Republic 5 Estonia 6 Hungary 7 Latvia 9 Lithuania 11 Poland 12 Romania 14 Russia 16 Slovakia 17 Slovenia 19 Ukraine 20 1997 was a year of remarkable contrasts in Bulgaria's economic and political fortunes. At the start of the year, the country was in crisis \u00ad without a government, and in the midst of a severe recession. The year ended with a new government in office, and with the first signs of economic recovery starting to become visible. Nevertheless, as a re\u00ad sult of the dislocation to economic activity in the early part of the year, preliminary estimates are that real GDP fell by 7.4%, following a drop of almost 11% in 1996. Political and economic difficulties which had been building up during 1996 came to a head at the turn of the year. In the face of mounting economic problems, the Prime Minister resigned in late December. The ensuing political uncer\u00ad tainty added to pressure on the exchange rate, which had al\u00ad ready depreciated rapidly throughout 1996. The immediate result was hyperinflation: prices rose by 40% in January 1997 and by 240% in February. The situation was only re\u00ad solved following the announcement of new elections, and, in the interim, the appointment of a caretaker government with a mandate to seek support from the international finan\u00ad cial institutions. Agreement with the IMF was reached in April. The govern\u00ad ment which was formed following the elections is com\u00ad mitted to implementing the IMF programme. To date, the programme's main targets have been reached and, in some cases, even surpassed. A key element of the programme was the introduction from July last year of a currency board arrangement, under which the central bank buys and sells unlimited amounts of domestic currency at a fixed ex\u00ad change rate of 1000 leva to the deutschmark. The immedi\u00ad ate consequence of this system is that the size of the domes\u00ad tic money supply is dependent on the central bank's stock of foreign exchange reserves. Even before the formal intro\u00ad duction of the currency board, the prospect of a government with the authority to implement strong economic policies had a positive impact: monthly inflation has been in low single\u00addigit figures since April. The 1997 budget initially agreed with the IMF targeted a deficit of a little over 6% of GDP. As inflation and interest rates fell more quickly than had been expected, this target was subsequently revised to under 5% of GDP. First indica\u00ad tions are that the final outturn may have been a budget defi\u00ad cit of no more than 3%. This remarkable result is due to suc\u00ad cessful spending control and improvements in tax collection, as well as significant savings due to lower in\u00ad terest rates. Interest payments accounted for 25% of gov\u00ad ernment spending in 1997, compared with 45% in 1996, when the budget deficit reached 11 % of GDP. Low interest rates \u00ad the annualised rate of return on short\u00ad term government securities has been under 10% since mid\u00ad1997 \u00ad are the result of two apparently opposing ten\u00ad dencies. On the one hand, there has been a sizeable inflow of foreign currency to the banking system. This has come from foreign direct and portfolio investment, and from a re\u00ad versal of \"internal capital flight\" as Bulgarians have con\u00ad verted their savings from dollars back into leva. This in\u00ad creased confidence has allowed interest rates to fall. On the other hand, the government's ability to borrow money at ",
        "low rates suggests that banks are either reluctant or lack op\u00ad portunities to lend for productive investment, implying that economic activity remains depressed. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows exceeded $300 million in the first nine months of 1997. This is more than the total FDI received from 1994 to 1996. Significant in\u00ad flows of portfolio investment were also recorded, amount\u00ad ing to a net $180 million in January-September 1997. In\u00ad vestors were attracted by high short-term yields combined with a steady exchange rate in the early months of stabilisa\u00ad tion: as interest rates fell, the flow of portfolio investment began to change its direction in the third quarter. Further in\u00ad flows of foreign currency came from the IMF and from a substantial trade surplus, the latter amounting to over $500 million in the first nine months. The trade surplus is due to a fall in imports, reflecting the depth of the recession, rather than strong export performance. The net effect of balance of payments developments has been a strong increase in the central bank's foreign reserves. These rose from under $500 million in January 1997 to $1.9 billion in January 1998. This is the equivalent of over 4 months of imports of goods and services.

(g) Preliminary. The rise in FDI is the most obvious sign of the government's success in accelerating the pace of privatisation. In addition to a number of large sales, there is a continuing flow of pri\u00ad vatisations of smaller companies. Many of the latter have been sold through management and employee buyouts. This form of privatisation may not be conducive to rapid re\u00ad structuring. The new owners are likely to have little capital of their own, and will have difficulty raising funds while banks maintain their current cautious approach to lending. In the medium term, the stock market may provide a source of investment funds for Bulgarian private enterprises. The stock exchange began operations in the autumn. Although as yet shares in only one company are listed, an active over- the-counter market has developed. The government in\u00ad tends to promote the development of the stock market and facilitate privatisation through a second round of voucher privatisation. Individuals will be able to use their vouchers to purchase shares in state-owned enterprises when they are initially offered on the stock exchange. Privatisation of the banking sector is proving difficult, al\u00ad though one bank was sold last year to a consortium includ\u00ad ing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Develop\u00ad ment. A second planned sale was postponed indefinitely when the authorities rejected the two bids received. On the other hand, procedures for the sale of another bank are ad\u00ad vanced, notwithstanding criticism of the conduct of the ten\u00ad dering process by some of the participants. Under prompt\u00ad ing from the IMF, signs of a clearer strategy for bank privatisation began to emerge in mid-February. In its first months in office, the government has succeeded in stabilising the economy and relaunching Bulgaria's transition to a market economy. Much remains to be done, however. Previous episodes of macroeconomic stabilisa\u00ad tion have been undermined by a failure to press ahead with reforms which would provide a solid structural basis for the economy. It is vital that the government builds on its achievements to date. With the exchange rate fixed under the currency board arrangement - and inflation expected to remain above Western European levels for some time - Bulgarian enterprises need to achieve sustained improve\u00ad ments in productivity in order to avoid losing competitive\u00ad ness. Continued fast privatisation of state enterprises is es\u00ad sential in order to facilitate this process, and fiscal policy must remain supportive of a stable economic climate which will encourage investment. Increased foreign involvement in the banking sector will help improve the efficiency of fi\u00ad nancial intermediation and allow Bulgarian entrepreneurs to take advantage of the favourable conditions for invest\u00ad ment which currently exist.

        "\u20225- Czech Republic 1997 was a watershed year for the Czech Republic: the political stability and successful macroeconomic per formance characteristic of the country's transition both faltered last year. Growth slowed significantly, the country lost the currency peg which had been the corner stone of its monetary policy, and unemployment has risen. Howevrr, it does seem that the poor economic conditions are resulting in some much needed restructuring of enter prises. If the current economic difficulties incite the gov ernment to take hard economic policy decisions, the country should be able to return to the stronger growth of earlier years. The political situation, at least in the first half of 1998 may make this difficult. The current interim government, in place until June 1998, only has a limited mandate in terms of economic policy, and is prevented from finalising any politically controversial policy measures such as the much needed privatisation of the largest banks.

The transition in the Czech Republic was until recently characterised by stable government and strong growth with low unemployment. But underlying the strong macroeco nomic performance there had been little real restructuring of the economy: the country's voucher-based privatisation process had led to unclear ownership structures and poor corporate governance. The downturn in economic activity started in the enterprise sector in 1996, despite relatively strong headline growth of 4.1% in 1996. In particular ex port-oriented firms were faced with an overvalued ex change rate and slack demand from their main export markets. In addition, all firms faced increasing costs as wages grew quickly, mirroring those in the public sector; enterprise profitability in 1996 was significantly reduced. Throughout 1995 and 1996, the trade and current account deficits of the country had been widening steadily on the back of the strong exchange rate, but also helped by strong household consumption fuelled by high wage increases. Faced with a widening current account deficit, and little prospect of fiscal tightening, the central bank was forced to implement tight monetary policy to restrain domestic de mand, and to protect its currency peg and low inflation ob jectives. Tight monetary policy served as an additional con straint on firms which, combined with poor enterprise profitability, materialised in concrete terms in a sharp de cline in investment growth in the first quarter of 1997. The overall result was a slowdown of GDP growth to 1.5% year-on-year in this quarter. Even before the final data for the first quarter emerged, evi dence of the sharp slowdown was provided by poor tax rev enues, which caused a large deficit on the state budget. The government, which was firmly committed to a balanced state budget, took measures to curb the deficit. It also took the opportunity offered by the need for additional budget ary measures to launch a wide-ranging package of policy measures. To curb the budget deficit, the government cut investment expenditure and reduced the growth of the public sector wage bill in 1997 to 7.3%. Other significant measures in the package were aimed at ameliorating the acute problems with corporate governance; legislation to reduce the role of banks and investment funds in enterprise ownership were proposed, and plans to introduce a US- style Securities and Exchange Commission were acceler ated. Unfortunately, this package of measures was not enough to reassure financial markets, which were nervous because of the situation on Asian markets. In particular, markets were not convinced that the fiscal measures announced would be enough to curb the widening current account deficit - the government had not directly tackled strong household con sumption. On May 27, after repeated attacks on the currency, and after it had lost almost a quarter of its foreign exchange reserves, the Czech National Bank decided to let the currency float. It immediately depreciated by around 12%. In response, the government announced further cuts in the state budget. The fortunes of the country seemed to only get worse, when at the beginning of the summer one third of the territory was submerged by floods. Growth further slowed in this third quarter to only 0.8% year-on-year. There was, moreover, a big change in the composition of domestic demand; in the first half of the year household consumption had been growing strongly at 5.4%, but in the third quarter it actually contracted by 1% year-on-year. Although several factors contributed to this downturn in household consumption, an increase in unemployment in the country was the key fac tor. Worsening economic prospects had forced some firms to undertake some long overdue restructuring, and laying off workers was the first step in the process. By the end of September 1997 the unemployment rate had risen to 4.8% compared with 3.5% at the end of 1996. Some positive trends emerged towards the end of the year. There was an improvement in both the trade balance and the dynamics of trade - full year import growth was 13.7% and export growth was 20.2%. Industrial output also started to record an improvement. However economic developments, both good and bad, were overshadowed by political events. At the end of No- ",
        "vember, following a scandal over party financing, the gov\u00ad ernment of Vaclav Klaus resigned. In its place an interim government, led by the former central bank governor Josef Tosovsky, has been installed until elections can be held in June 1998. This interim government, made up of both technicians and politicians, has only a limited mandate\u00adfor example, it is not able make any decisions about the priva\u00ad tisation of strategic enterprises, including the three remain\u00ad ing large bank privatisations. The difficult political situ\u00ad ation is likely to constrain economic policy management until the middle of 1998. Nevertheless, the new govern\u00ad ment has stated that lowering inflation is key to their macro\u00adeconomic policy. One important development at the end of 1997 was the cen\u00ad tral bank's decision to switch to direct inflation targeting. Some change in the management of monetary policy was inevitable after the central bank lost its nominal anchor with the abandoning of the currency peg in May. The central bank will from now on be targeting \"net\" inflation, which is inflation adjusted for administrative price changes. The net inflation target for 1998 has been set at 6+0.5%. In this respect the first inflation figures for 1998 have been disap\u00ad pointing. Inflation in January 1998 rose by 4% month\u00adon\u00ad month, and 13.1% year\u00adon\u00adyear, from 10% year\u00adon\u00adyear inflation in December 1997. Although some of the increase is related to administrative price measures in January, the results for \"net\" inflation were not very promising; infla\u00ad tion adjusted for price deregulation and increases in excise taxes also grew by 1.5% month\u00adon\u00admonth, and 7.5% year\u00ad on\u00adyear.

Estonia After a summer of 'national exuberance ', underpinned by rising confidence and accelerating growth, recent months have seen a return to a more sober outlook for the Estonian economy. This has been sparked by the sharp drop of Estonia's stock market and the restrictive econo\u00ad mic measures announced by the authorities to address some of the macro\u00adeconomic disequilibria associated with the high growth rates achieved in the first half of last year. However, in 1997 the country has continued to make progress on the road to a fully\u00adfledged market economy. It is, moreover, clear that recent measures have laid the foundations f or a more balanced and sustainable growth path in the coming years.

(f) Includes jobless and job\u2014seekers. (g) Preliminary. In many respects, 1997 has been a remarkable year for Esto\u00ad nia. The most significant features of 1997 have been the success of the currency board to withstand the attacks on the Estonian kroon and the decisiveness of the government in addressing key economic problems. Data for the full year are not yet available, but preliminary indications are that GDP growth was approximately 10%. Inflation declined from an annual average of 23.1% in 1996 to 11.2% in 1997. This reduction was, however, slower than in the other two Baltic countries, Latvia and Lithuania. Registered unem\u00ad ployment decreased; productivity growth at about 8% was stronger than real wages increases. In the Autumn of 1997, the recognition that domestic de\u00ad mand growth in 1996 and 1997 had been excessive, and that it was fuelled by debt\u00adcreating capital inflows intermedi\u00ad ated by the commercial banks, led the authorities to tighten the macroeconomic policy mix. Fiscal policy was already rather counter\u00adcyclical in 1997 and its restrictive stance will be further accentuated in 1998: the surplus of the gen\u00ad eral government sector is forecast to grow from 0.4% of GDP to 1.8%. Notwithstanding the liquidity crisis that af\u00ad fected the Estonian financial markets, the central bank re\u00ad stricted monetary conditions at the end of 1997, notably through higher reserve requirements. This has induced a substantial increase in interest rates and a decline in lending activity. The one month TALIBOR jumped from 5.6% at the beginning of September to 14.7% at the end of January ",
        "1998, and in December the total amount of loans granted by commercial banks was 36% lower than in October. The overall effect of this tightening of macroeconomic policy will be to slow down economic growth in 1998. However, a more important consequence is that the de termination to implement a politically unpopular tighten ing of fiscal policy and the agreement with the IMF on a Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) have streng thened the credibility and authority of the Estonian govern ment. The MEP sets out the main macroeconomic and structural measures that the government will take in 1998 to ensure a \"soft landing\" of the economy. While the policy measures should reduce the trade and the current account deficits in 1998 and beyond, there were al ready indications of improvement in late 1997. As a percen tage of GDP, both deficits appear to have stabilised last year. Export growth (including transit trade) was remarka bly high in 1997, and in the last months of the year, was higher than import growth, which slowed down markedly. This latter factor suggests that domestic demand was af fected by the measures taken by the authorities. In addition, the balance of payments data for 1997 show that the Esto nian exports of services have been buoyant. In the first nine months of 1997, the financing of the current account deficit was on a sounder footing than in 1996. Capi tal inflows continued to be larger than the current account deficit, allowing the central bank to increase its reserves. More significantly, even if debt-creating inflows to banks continued to be very important, net foreign direct invest ment inflows were almost four times as big as in 1996. Data of Estonia's international investment position show that, while the private sector's external net liabilities increased sharply, the government's net external debt declined. In parallel to the changes in the macroeconomic policy mix, the authorities have announced that they will continue with structural reforms. Privatisation of the utilities and infra structure companies will be particularly important in 1998. A 49% stake in the national telecom company will be sold to a strategic investor in the first half of 1998 and the priva tisation of Eesti Energia (electricity production) and Eesti Raudtee (railways) will start in the second half of the year. In the context of the MEP, the Estonian authorities are com mitted to more than double private land ownership in 1998, to at least 35 percent of all land. A special area for attention is the financial sector, which re lied on borrowed resources from abroad to extend credit rather aggressively in 1997. The sector is characterised by the high proportion of liabilities and capital held by non residents in foreign currency, as well as by the high share of assets denominated in foreign currencies. Because this situation exposes Estonia's economy to shifts in interna tional investors' confidence, the authorities have agreed on a number of important measures, including higher reserve requirements, improved supervision of financial conglom erates and reinforcement of the capital base. Continuing strong profitability (although some banks registered losses in January) and an increase in deposits show that market participants have been reassured by these measures and by the resilience of the banks in the wake of the crisis on the equity markets and the effects of the Asian financial crisis on emerging markets. Restructuring of the sector has con tinued spontaneously with the possible merger of the largest and third-largest banks in Estonia, which would create the largest bank in the Baltic States. In relation to the special topic of this Economic Reform Monitor, it is encouraging to note that health conditions in Estonia have started to improve in recent years. In the im mediate aftermath of the re-establishment of independence a marked deterioration of health and sanitary conditions had occurred, as testified by declining life expectancy at birth, higher mortality rates, and higher incidence of infec tious and other diseases. However, since 1995, there have been clear improvements in key health indicators: the number of death per 1,000 inhabitants has fallen from 15.3 in 1994 to 13.5 in 1996; infant mortality has gone down from 15.8% 0 of live births in 1992 to 10.4%e in 1996, and life expectancy at birth has increased sharply between 1994 and 1996. A recent survey indicates that, compared to 1996, Estonians are less concerned about the health situation, al though this remains one of their major preoccupations. In deed there is no reason for complacency, as illustrated by the increasing incidence rate of tuberculosis and cancers in recent years.

The modernisa tion of the economy driven by sustained foreign direct in vestment has underpinned an acceleration in growth, a rise in investment and an export boom. Fiscal consolida tion and very positive balance of payments trends led to a further reduction in foreign debt. Economic growth, how ever, was fairly narrowly based and import-intensive. Inflation remained relatively high. Even though 1998 is ",
        "an electoral year, the authorities will need to adapt their policy mix to the changing macroeconomic environment. They must sustain their reform effort to further the struc tural changes which are needed to widen the growth base.

Following the slowdown caused by the adjustment pro gramme of 1995 to tackle unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances, growth began to pick up in the second half of 1996. During 1997, the recovery gained strength as exports surged, investment accelerated and private consumption growth resumed. In the first three quarters of 1997, GDP grew by 3.9% and fixed capital formation by 11.5% com pared to 1.3% and 6%, respectively, in 1996. Exports boomed growing in volume by 24.2% in the first nine months of the year and rose faster than imports, which in creased by 23.4%. In 1996, household real income had de clined by 0.5% and private consumption by 3.1%. By con trast, during the first three quarters of 1997, household income is estimated to have grown some 4% in real terms, leading to a 0.5% rise in private consumption. In the first eleven months of last year, agricultural output was unchanged, the construction sector was up 8.4% and industrial production grew by 11.4% compared to the same period in 1996. Within the industrial sector, production of machinery and equipment rose by more than 50% thanks to a near doubling of exports. Domestic industrial sales con tinued to decline, falling by 1.5%. Domestic sales of con sumer goods fell by 6.5% and the production of food and beverages declined by 8%. Growth has so far been fairly narrow-based and highly im port-intensive. In fact, it is the rise in capital expenditures and the exceptional growth performance of the export- oriented branches of multinational companies in a small number of sub-sectors which have driven the recovery. On the one hand, this underlines the depth of the restructuring process and the benefits accruing from continuously high levels of foreign direct investment. On the other hand, it ra ises the issue of how much rising private consumption will encourage domestic production as opposed to imports. While in the medium term high investment rates should lead to a structural widening of the bases of growth, in the shorter term the macroeconomic policy stance must be carefully adjusted to avoid any overheating. Any early fis cal tightening is unlikely since general and local elections are scheduled in the course of the year. Thus the responsi bility for keeping the economy on track will fall on monet ary policy. So far, the Hungarian policy mix has achieved impressive results as the recovery in growth was accompanied by further external and fiscal adjustment. According to pre liminary figures, the 1997 current account deficit fell to just below $1 billion, some 40% lower than in 1996 in spite of the sharp acceleration in growth. These developments were driven by a substantial improvement in the trade deficit, which dropped by more than a third, and a further strengthening of the tourist account. Moreover, foreign di rect investment flows continued unabated, rising by a quarter above the level of 1996 and confirming Hungary's attractiveness for foreign investors. Thanks to these trends, by November 1997 net foreign debt fell below $10 billion. Gross foreign debt dropped back to its 1991 level, but ex port revenues were then only half of total foreign debt while in 1997 they covered all of Hungary's foreign liabilities. Overall budgetary targets have been met consistently since the launch of the stabilisation effort in 1995. According to preliminary estimates, the general government deficit for 1997 was 4.6% of GDP, against a target of 4.9%. Helped by faster than expected growth, the accounts of the central budget, local governments and separate state funds all per formed better than envisaged. In a replay of 1996, these de velopments more than compensated for the overshooting of the social security funds which closed 1997 with a deficit of some 51 billion forint against an original target of 13.5 billion. The budget law for 1998 envisages a general gov ernment deficit of 4.9% of GDP. In view of recent develop ments, the growth assumptions underlying the fiscal pro jections look a bit pessimistic. The budgetary target, therefore, is likely to be met. However, the fall in the pri mary surplus, the possibility of overspending in the run up to general and local elections and the current upswing in growth raise the fear that the fiscal stance may be too expan sionary. In 1997, average rate of consumer price inflation fell some five percentage points with respect to 1996 and the author ities met their target. This was no minor achievement since a final adjustment in administered energy prices took place during the year. However, the year-on-year rate lingered around 18% all year and finished higher than envisaged at 18.4% in December. In January 1998 the year-on-year rate dropped to 17.7%, largely due to increases in administered prices which were smaller than those implemented in Jan uary 1997. Nevertheless, the January fall was somewhat less than generally expected, signalling the continued strength of inflationary inertia. This persistence is less sur prising if one takes into account the overall policy context within which disinflation has been sought. ",
        "When the adjustment programme was launched in 1995, inflation had been moderately high for years. Its reduction was clearly not a priority when set against the more urgent objectives of reining in consumption, reducing the current account deficit and enhancing the conditions for invest ment. The adjustment package actually envisaged a tem porary increase in inflation not only as a consequence of the initial step devaluation of the forint but also as an instru ment to shift resources from labour to capital. Since then, the authorities have aimed to reduce inflationary inertia by reducing expectations through gradual cuts in the rate of crawling peg devaluation and annual tripartite agreements on incomes policy. However, the effectiveness of incomes policy is limited by the government's past use of surprise inflation to cut real wages. From this point of view, it is not surprising that after falling more than planned in 1996, real wages grew more than planned in 1997, when they in creased by 4.7% against an originally projected rise of 2%. Moreover, as long as external adjustment and growth re main the authorities' policy priorities, progress in reducing inflation is likely to be slow. It seems that in order to strengthen their credibility, the authorities will at some point have to be willing to pay a price in order to reduce inflation. The strengthening of the economic recovery and the continuation of the favourable balance of payments situation could lead the incoming administration to reassess economic policy priorities, heralding a tougher stance on inflation.

With regards to policy priorities, the authorities have al ready hinted that the reform of the health system would be at the top of the agenda should the current ruling coalition be re-elected in May. This would be a welcome develop ment for two main reasons. First of all, budgetary conso lidation requires the expenditures and revenues of the Health Fund to be brought under control, even if the social security deficit as a percentage of GDP has fallen from roughly 1% in 1996 to an estimated 0.6% in 1997. Second ly, and more importantly, the efficiency of the system must be considerably improved. Hungary's public expenditures on health, which are not large by international standards, achieve poor results. Hungary's life expectancy at birth is one of the lowest among central European countries, and by far the lowest among OECD countries. Moreover, male life expectancy has dropped by two years since the early 1970s. This clearly calls for a reassessment of health care, and health policy in general. Latvia In 1997, Latvia consolidated the economic recovery that started in 1996. Growth is accelerating quickly, but the acceleration of growth has not been to the detriment of a continued steady decline in inflation. Higher growth, and therefore higher tax revenues, have allowed the govern ment to achieve a surplus on the general government budget in 1997. Although stronger economic growth has been behind a further widening of the trade deficit, the current account deficit continues to be covered by a sur plus on the capital account. Foreign direct investment flows related to the privatisation process have contributed to this surplus. Latvia is going ahead with privatisation, although the completion date of mid-1998 for the whole process is unlikely to be met. Privatisation of the largest state enterprises will prove difficult - there are some calls for decisions on these privatisations to be delayed until after the autumn elections. The upswing in economic activity in Latvia in 1997 has been remarkable; GDP growth has risen to 5.6% for the first three quarters of the year, up sharply from growth of 2.8% in 1996. Growth has also been accelerating throughout the year: it was 2.6% year-on-year in the first quarter, 6.5% in the second, and 7.6% in the third quarter. The lack of data on the expenditure side of the national accounts means that it is not clear what is driving the current spurt of high growth. However, short term indicators point to a growth in both household consumption as well as investment. Before 1997, restrained pay settlements and high inflation meant that wages had been declining in real terms. How ever, with inflation falling at a relatively quick pace, there has been a reversal in this trend. Retail sales figures, which show growth of retail trade of 13.4% in real terms, suggest there has been an improvement in household consumption driven by higher disposable income of households. Fixed investment is also recovering. There is some evi dence of investment growth in the economy as a whole, with investment in technological machinery and equipment growing the strongest. Data on imports also show an in creasing share of investment goods in the overall level of imports. Strong growth in 1997 was encouraged by the rapid increase in credit to domestic enterprises. The im proved fiscal position led to the withdrawal of the govern ment as a major borrower from the commercial banking sector and a subsequent reduction in banks' lending rates. The establishment of better property registers also in fluenced the accessibility of loan finance for enterprises. On the output side, growth continues to be driven by the ser vice sector, and by transport and communications services ",
        "\u00adlo\u00ad in particular; the service sector contributed 61.7% of gross value added in the first three quarters of 1997. Industry, and more specifically manufacturing industry, is also growing strongly. Industrial output grew at 6.1 % in 1997, led by ex\u00ad port\u00addriven manufacturing industries such as food proces\u00ad sing and production of wood and paper products. As growth has accelerated, the trade deficit in Latvia has widened further. In 1997 the deficit was $1 billion. Exports grew strongly in this period by 22.2% year\u00adon\u00adyear in local currency terms, but export growth was still less than that of imports at 23.4%. The most dynamic export products con\u00ad tinue to be wood products going to EU markets, but these products require minimal local processing. Other sectors also appear to be growing quickly; for example exports of processed food grew strongly in 1997 in real terms \u00ad a key export market for these products was neighbouring Lithua\u00ad nia. On the import side, consumer goods and intermediate goods such as fuel imports continue to dominate, but in\u00ad vestment goods make up an increasing share of the total. Although large trade and current account deficits are a cause for concern in the medium term, at present the current account deficit continues to be covered by a surplus on the capital account. In particular, in 1997, Latvia has been quite successful in attracting foreign direct investment \u00ad in the first half of the year the country attracted $165 million (up from $127 million in the first half of 1996). Much of this foreign direct investment is linked to the privatisation programme of the government. Despite the strong acceleration in growth in the economy, inflation continues to follow a downward path. Average inflation for 1997 was only 8.4% \u00ad this was lower than the government's target of 9%. At the end of January 1998, inflation was down to only 6.3% from 11.4% at the end of January 1997. One of the factors keeping inflation down has been the contraction of real wages, but in the first nine months of 1997 they did start to grow slowly again. The benchmark interest rate of the central bank is 4%, which at first glance seems very low and not necessarily conducive to low inflation. However because of the lack of depth of the Latvian financial market, interest rates of the central bank do not have that much of an impact on the behaviour of commercial banks. Lending and deposit rates, which have been falling recently, depend more on structural fac\u00ad tors. Monetary policy is actually more concerned with maintaining the external stability of the currency through a fixed peg, which in itself can serve as an important anti\u00ad inflationary mechanism. Fiscal policy remained tight in 1997. The budget plans for 1997 had aimed for a balanced central government deficit and a small deficit on local government budgets to allow for increased investment expenditure. However, the full year outturn on the general government budget, which consoli\u00ad dates both the central and local government budgets, is showing a surplus. The surplus to some extent reflects the fact that local governments have not hit their targets for in\u00ad creasing investment expenditure, which is not positive for the longer\u00adterm growth prospects of the country. But, the surplus is also due to better than expected revenues con\u00ad nected with higher than expected economic growth \u00ad all sources of tax revenue grew significantly on 1996, but ex\u00ad cise taxes grew most quickly. The Latvian banking sector is still characterised by a large number of small banks, the majority of which are highly specialised and serve only a small section of the market. In 1998 there should be some consolidation in the banking sector, as minimum capital requirements on banks in Latvia increase from 1 to 2 million lats on the 1 April. Two million lats is still low by international standards, but there are in\u00ad dications that some of the smaller banks will be unable to meet even this level of capital. The central bank hopes that the increase in the minimum capital requirement will force some of the smallest banks to merge. Consolidation in the banking sector will also be driven by international competi\u00ad tion. There are already precedents for mergers of banks from the three Baltic States, and more banks have been dis\u00ad cussing increased co\u00adoperation. Consolidation of the bank\u00ad ing sectors of the three countries through increased co\u00ad operation and mergers across borders is likely, as each of the individual national markets is small. The privatisation programme of the government is continu\u00ad ing, but it appears behind schedule. In particular it is not clear that the mid\u00ad1998 deadline for completion of the pro\u00ad ject will be met. Nonetheless the government is showing continued commitment to the process and to its speedy completion, despite political pressure by the main opposi\u00ad tion party to delay privatisation of two strategic enterprises until after the autumn elections; the two enterprises in\u00ad volved are Latvian Shipping Company (LASCO) and the state energy utility, Latvenergo. Two investors have been shortlisted to take the strategic stake in Lasco, and have been awarded the right to look more closely at the business. The privatisation of Latvenergo is more complicated, and requires that the business be substantially restructured be\u00ad fore privatisation \u00ad the government continues to work on this with the help of the World Bank and the EBRD.

Lithuania In 1997, Lithuanian growth accelerated in comparison to previous years. Inflation fell to single-digit levels and fis cal consolidation resumed after the slippage of 1996. These positive macroeconomic results were accompanied by a significant worsening of the external account, which was, however, easily financed thanks to continuing and rising capital inflows. The sustainability of current growth trends will require careful management of ma croeconomic policy, along with further structural re forms. During 1997, there were some positive develop ments in the performance of the banking sector and the process of privatisation. 1998 will be a crucial year as the government plans to carry out the most challenging di vestitures of banks and industrial enterprises. The Lithuanian economy is continuing to grow at an in creasing pace. Following a considerable upward revision of quarterly growth rates for 1997, GDP is now estimated to have risen 6.4% in the first three quarters of 1997, com pared to the same period of 1996. Growth is driven mainly by domestic demand. Investment spending during the first three quarters was up 7.4%. Private consumption was also increasing at a sustained pace. During 1997, retail sales in creased by 13.4% as wages and pensions rose by more than 15% in real terms. A large share of the increase in domestic demand, however, was met by foreign production as the local industrial sector grew by only 0.7% during 1997. Un employment is on the rise, increasing from 6.2% in De cember 1996 to 7.4% in January 1998 in spite of the accel eration in GDP growth. This points to continuing industrial restructuring. Economic transition will benefit from the further gains achieved in the field of macroeconomic stabilisation. Year- on-year consumer price inflation fell by nearly five percen tage points to 8.4% in December 1997, and the annual aver age more than halved in comparison to 1996. This is an even more remarkable achievement, since increases in VAT rates and other administrative price adjustments caused sharp rises in the prices of goods such as alcoholic bever ages and energy. The impact of these measures on the con sumer price index was offset by a very moderate increase in the prices of food and soft drinks, which account for near ly half of consumers' expenditure. In January 1998, the year-on-year rate of inflation dropped further to 6.5%. Fiscal consolidation advanced during 1997. The budget deficit fell from 0.7 to 0.5 billion litas. According to pre liminary estimates, this would correspond to less than 1.3% of GDP, against an original target of 1.9%. Perhaps more importantly, the negative trend in fiscal revenues has been reversed. Actual revenues were slightly above target, both at the level of the central budget and at that of municipal ities. Buoyant growth and continued improvements in tax administration will be needed next year if the government is to achieve the planned 15% increase in national budget revenues and keep the state budget deficit within the tar geted 1.6% of GDR In the medium term, the authorities aim to balance the budget, which they plan to achieve despite the announced compensation of savers for the rouble de posits lost in the early 1990s.

(f) Gross hard-currency debt as a percentage of hard-currency exports. With a moderate budget deficit and single-digit inflation, the sustainability of present trends in economic growth and the appropriateness of the current macroeconomic policy mix depend to a large extent on the developments of the ex ternal accounts. Imports have been growing rapidly due to increasing investment and rising household expenditure. During the first eleven months of 1997, the imports of goods increased some 23.5% in value compared to the same period in 1996. Despite a 14% increase in exports, the cumulative trade deficit rose above 6 billion litas, against a deficit of nearly 4 billion litas in the corresponding period of 1996. The evolution of the trade balance explains nearly all of the deterioration of the current account. The exact magnitude of these changes is partly obscured by a sharp ",
        "- 1 2\u00b7 rise in errors and omissions, which totalled 0.8 billion litas in the first three quarters. This item on the balance of pay ments includes unrecorded capital inflows as well as over- invoicing of imports and under-reporting of export rev enues. While during the first three quarters of 1996 the current ac count gap had been financed by loans and equity inflows in roughly equal proportions, portfolio and foreign direct in vestment provided nearly all the financing required in the corresponding period of 1997 for a much larger deficit. At the end of 1997, official reserves stood at 4.2 billion litas, up nearly 30% from the end of 1996, whereas total foreign debt had risen by some 20% to reach about 5.6 billion litas. The successful divestiture of large state enterprises in 1998 should lead to a further strengthening of equity inflows, but in the end the sustainability of the external accounts de pends upon high investment rates to achieve economic re structuring, and on real competitiveness gains. Sustainable balance of payments trends are a necessary condition for the successful implementation of Lithuania's intention to abandon the currency board system established in 1994. So far, the central bank has followed an orderly exit strategy. The monetary authorities launched repur chase and deposit auctions during 1997 and are preparing the ground for the introduction of overnight loan operations in the first half of 1998. The actual unpegging of the litas from the dollar will not take place until 1999. The sounder Lithuania's external position, the smaller the economic un certainty that will be generated. During 1997, developments in the banking sector were mixed. Aggregate positive results hid the worsening state of publicly owned banks. On the one hand, the recovery from the banking problems of 1995 and 1996 remains clear ly visible. The total value of deposits rose by some 50% over the year and the total portfolio of loans increased by roughly 15%. Several banks increased their share capital and all are in compliance with the new minimum share capital limit introduced as of beginning 1998. On the other hand, the three state-owned banks posted losses during the first nine months of 1997, and are failing to stem the decline in income before provisions. In November 1997, these banks still accounted for roughly 56% of total deposits and loans. As the state-owned banks keep losing market share, relative to the most dynamic private institutions, their value falls. Moreover, the credibility of the overall regulatory environment is undermined since state-owned Agricul tural Bank and State Commercial Bank are exempted by law from complying with prudential regulations until their divestiture. The rapid and successful implementation of the government's plans to privatise these two banks during 1998 would therefore be an important step to put the Li thuanian banking sector on a sounder footing. Privatisation of non-financial enterprises intensified dur ing 1997 compared to 1996, when only 46 entities were sold. During last year, the state sold 270 entities for a total revenue of 81 million litas. More than half of the enterprises were sold through public auctions. Foreign investors took part in eight divestitures which accounted for nearly 80% of total revenues. However, a large share of the enterprises included in the privatisation programme for 1997 were not sold, apparently for lack of interest at the prevailing offer conditions. The authorities plan the current year to mark a new phase in Lithuanian privatisation. First of all, according to a law enacted in late 1997, the whole process is to be reorganised with the creation of a Fund for State Property and Restitu tion of Residents' Savings. Secondly, the process of large- scale privatisation should come to fruition. Up to now, only Baltic Shipyard has been successfully sold, out of the four teen strategic enterprises originally slated for privatisation. Preparatory work for the other transactions has been ad vancing and the recent decision to conduct sales by direct negotiation with potential investors is expected to speed up the process. In the nearest future, final offers from strategic investors for a 60% stake in Lithuanian Telecom are to be received. In an effort to secure a successful transaction and maximise revenues, the government has been strengthen ing the company's attractiveness by introducing charges on local calls. It also granted Lithuanian Telecom a monopoly on local, domestic and international calls until 2003.

Poland The macroeconomic developments in Poland over the whole of last year have belied the pessimism which crept in during the summer of 1997. GDP growth in 1997 al most surpassed the record growth oftwoyears earlier, and was much higher than the 5.5% assumed in the Polish budget. This has made it easier for the new government to improve upon the budgetary target of the previous govern ment. But for the sting in the tail at the end of the year, the reduction of inflation was also right on target. Moreover, the current account deficit remained well within the sus tainable range. These favourable developments should allow the new government to carry on with and, if poss ible, speed up necessary reforms. Some recent develop- ",
        "13- ments suggest that the tendency to give in to pressure from economic interest groups and defer implementation of agreed commitments has not disappeared from the Polish political scene. This continues to affect its relations with the European Union.

Gross domestic product increased by almost 7% in 1997 - faster than all the forecasts which were made during the year. It is encouraging that the main sources of economic growth are exports and investment. While private con sumption grew at the same pace as GDP in 1997, both in vestment and exports grew faster. Investment increased by more than 20%, thereby repeating the 1996 performance. Industrial output went up by about 11%, and construction and assembly output by 16%. Despite an increase in the number of apartments by 5 to 6%, the housing shortage re mains significant. The foundations for an improvement in the housing market have been laid in the form of a cautious law on mortgage banks, but not many people can afford to buy a house with a mortgage limited to 60% of the value of the property. Import growth remains high but in 1997 was decreasing compared to the year before. In the second half of 1997, ex ports actually began to grow as fast as imports. This favour able development, together with the growth in GDP, kept the current account deficit far below the danger zone of 6-8% of GDP and the likelihood that the current account deficit will end up in this range in the years to come has dim inished. The notion of this range as a danger zone is very much based on the recent experiences in East Asia anyway, and has little to do with economic fundamentals in Poland. The deficit as it stands is comfortably financed by an in creasing inflow of foreign direct investment, which amounted to $6.6 billion in 1997. One of the most visible reflections of Poland's economic transition has been the appearance and disappearance of open-air bazaars. New visa regulations and the adoption of a customs code have reduced the opportunities for small traders. Travellers across the eastern borders now have to register their stay and are more likely to pay taxes when they import or produce Polish goods. A considerable part of the positive balance on unclassified transactions on the current account is due to such trade across the eastern and north-eastern borders. The restrictions on visitors from Be larus and Russia are likely to hurt this type of business, which is estimated to have made the Warsaw bazaar alone the fifth biggest exporter in Poland. Unregistered cross- border shopping at the German border, another source of surplus, has also been shrinking because of the appreciation of the real exchange rate. With the reduction of consumer price inflation to almost 13% at the end of 1997 - resulting in slightly less than 15% for the year as a whole - the Polish government very much enhanced the credibility of its inflation targets. Another positive sign is that real wage growth in 1997 was broadly in line with labour productivity growth. However, the end of 1997 saw a slight rise in inflation and an administrative rise in the prices of electricity, public transport and housing provided an additional push at the start of 1998, so that the target of single-digit inflation by the end of 1998 appears to be too ambitious. Nevertheless, the National Bank of Poland, which is operating under a new law since the begin ning of this year, is widely expected to reduce the monthly devaluation of the zloty against a basket of currencies and to combine this with a widening of the band to 15% on either side of the central parity in order to introduce greater uncertainty for portfolio investors. This would allow for a reduction of real interest rates, which increasingly hurt en terprises that have no access to foreign capital. Monetary policy in Poland has also begun to have some effect in curb ing the consumer credit boom and in increasing the house hold savings rate. Following the arrival in power of the centre-right coalition last November, the government now appears to have em barked upon a balancing act to reconcile the different policy intentions and the effects they have on the budget. There is still no clear ordering of priorities, but ministers are push ing pension and social security reform to the top of the agenda. The Solidarity camp has been putting forward its concept of popular ownership funds, but appears to accept that the proceeds from the privatisation of large and finan cially sound state enterprises should be used as a source of funds for pension reform. Health care and education are areas where increased government spending is urgently needed. Another subject of much public discussion is terri torial reform. At the beginning of February, the lower house of parliament (the Sejm) debated a far-reaching territorial reform proposed by the government, which would limit the number of provinces (voivodships) to 12 and insert an ad ministrative layer of about 300 districts (powiats) between the provinces and the communes (gminas). The government's Economic Committee (KERM), which is chaired by Minister of Finance Balcerowicz, appears to attach high priority to the consolidation of public finances. The KERM has launched initiatives to reduce economic bureaucracy and to simplify the tax system. The Ministry of Finance has made some efforts to calculate the general ",
        "-14 government deficit for Poland, taking into account local government deficits and the role of the many public funds and agencies that are outside the government's budget con trol. For 1997, they arrived at a deficit in the neighbourhood of 4% of GDP, which is considered to be exceptionally high as a result of the impact of the floods on local government budgets. The budget deficit of the central government, in cluding the revenue from privatisation, was reduced to 1.4% of GDP in 1997, and the top priority of fiscal policy is to have a balanced budget in three years time. In discussions between Poland and the EU and its Member States, one issue which has re-appeared on the agenda is the gradual removal of tariffs on steel imports under the Europe Agreement. The Polish government is now preparing a com prehensive and effective restructuring plan for the steel in dustry, a first version of which should be ready by mid-April. The problem in the steel sector is an illustration of the wider problem of finding strategic investors in loss-making state- owned firms which are still to be privatised. The steel sector's trade unions, for instance, are working under the assumption that the restructuring programme will result in redundancies of 40,000 workers for which support should be available.

There are also various difficulties in agricultural trade. In December last year, the EU imposed a ban on the imports of milk and other products after an inspection of Polish dairy farms. Most experts inside and outside Poland would agree on the low quality and hygiene standards in milk pro duction. The halting of meat transit and the recent ban on gelatine imports are imposed for health reasons by the Pol ish authorities. Although they should not be regarded as a retaliation for the milk ban, there is some speculation that small interest groups have used the opportunity to put pres sure on the Polish government. In February, Poland has asked the EU to re-examine its dairy farms. More positive notes are that the disagreements between Poland and the EU on car assembly have been solved, and that the road tax and permit system no longer discriminates between hauliers from different countries. Romania Although there was an acceleration of reforms in Roma nia in the first months of 1997, the momentum stalled later in the year. Continuous internal dissent within the ruling coalition - which led to a government reshuffle in December and to the departure of Social Democrat min isters from government in January - has delayed the adoption of key reforms, encouraged bureaucratic inertia and weakened foreign investors' confidence. While many important steps have been taken at a high economic and social cost for the population, the economic situation re mains fragile, as testified by the larger than expected fall in GDP recorded in 1997. Much still needs to be done to ensure that restructuring and privatisation of the large public companies is accelerated and to prevent further macroeconomic d\u00e9stabilisation. Only clear and far- reaching actions will reduce the prevailing political, legal and economic uncertainty, and entice domestic and foreign investors to start investing again in Romania.

GDP contracted by 6.6% according to preliminary data, bringing the level of aggregate output to approximately 82% of the 1989 level. This sharp fall in output has been caused by the overall restrictive stance of monetary, fiscal and income policies. Domestic demand in particular recorded a sharp fall. Price liberalisation at the beginning of the year, continuous and automatic adjust ment of administratively controlled prices and partial in dexation of wages led to a 22% fall in purchasing power. Private consumption plummeted. Construction activity was also particularly hard hit, slumping by 22%, and fixed capital formation fell by 16%. Only exports supported final demand. Agricultural production was particularly good, with the total grain crop reaching an all-time high. One important achievement of 1997 has been the improve ment of the framework of monetary policy. The special ",
        "15- credits that the National Bank of Romania (NBR) had been forced to extend to the agriculture and enterprises were ter minated, which allowed it to focus on its primary responsi bility of fighting inflation. Nevertheless, after a consider able tightening in the first half of the year, there was a premature relaxation of monetary policy during the summer. In the face of renewed inflationary pressures, the central bank had to tighten policy again in October, which led to a new increase in nominal and real interest rates. As a result, while its determination to fight inflation has not been put into question, the NBR has not been fully success ful in creating a predictable monetary framework. If the current restrictive monetary conditions were to be sustained, the consequences in terms of lost output and lower investment could become very serious. There would also be repercussions on the financial situation of enter prises and banks. It is therefore crucial that confidence be restored quickly so as to allow the easing of monetary policy and ensure the continuation of popular support for reforms. This will only be possible if there is decisive action in the field of structural reforms and an end to political un certainty. Achieving fiscal discipline in the public sector has been one outstanding success of the government in 1997. Indeed, despite lower revenues (expected to have fallen from 29.8% of GDP to 27% in 1997), the government has broad ly met its target of limiting the consolidated budget deficit to 4.5% of GDP. Looking at the primary deficit and taking into account the quasi-fiscal subsidies extended by the NBR up until 1996, the extent of the fiscal consolidation becomes even clearer. The primary deficit, including quasi-fixed subsidies, shrank from 6.1% of GDP in 1996 to an expected 0.6%. Given the substantial increases in ex penditures with which the government is faced, notably higher interest payments on the public debt and social ex penses, it has recently announced measures to enhance rev enues, including an increase in VAT from 18% to 22%. In the context of depressed activity, raising taxes has proved controversial. It will be difficult to sustain the hard-won gains of fiscal consolidation, however, unless substantial restructuring of public enterprises is rapidly achieved. There were some successes in 1997, including the sale of a number of large enterprises to foreign companies and the restructuring of the mining sector (which has been very expensive because of the high severance payments made to workers and the costs linked with the permanent closure of mines). How ever, the lack of progress in this area has been the main source of disappointment and concern. Restructuring of the large energy-intensive public enterprises has remained very slow and the transformation of the so-called 'R\u00e9gies autonomes' into commercial companies has not progressed much. Privatisation of the first public bank has been repeat edly postponed but may now take place in 1998. The public sector banks are showing growing signs of structural weak ness: not only have the authorities already approved costly restructuring plans for two major banks, but it is widely be lieved that the current economic difficulties and high in terest rates have further worsened their balance sheets. Foreign direct investment (FDI) increased sharply in the second and third quarters of 1997. In the first nine months of 1997, inflows increased to $806 million, from $160 mil lion in the same period of 1996. This is about 80% of the cumulative amount received between 1994 and 1996. How ever, these inflows fell far short of the authorities' expecta tions and they dried up in the last quarter of 1997. Repeated changes in the legal framework for foreign investment and privatisation sank foreign investors' confidence. Given the scarcity of domestic capital, higher FDI inflows are a cru cial element to ensure the modernisation of the export base and achieve non-inflationary growth. The external accounts have improved during 1997, al though again less than originally expected. Relatively high capital inflows in the second and third quarters more than offset the current account deficit, allowing the National Bank of Romania to build up its reserves from $700 million in February to $2.5 billion in December. Despite the real ap preciation of the national currency, exports increased by 4.4% in dollar terms in the first eleven months of 1997 over the same period of 1996, while imports fell by 2%. Devel oping the export base will be necessary to service a growing external debt, which increased by approximately 22% in 1997. The debt/export ratio rose to more than 100% for the first time and there are reasons to expect a further worsen ing of debt indicators in the coming years, because of the short-term profile of the debt.

In relation to the intoduction of this Economic Reform Monitor, the health situation in Romania deserves a special note. Notwithstanding the increased sums allocated in the budget to social protection, the deterioration of the econo mic situation has led to a further decline in the health of the Romanian population, which was already one of the most precarious of all countries of eastern Europe. Infant mortal ity has increased in the first ten months of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996, reaching 21.5%o. In fact, the last two years have seen a reversal of the trend of the years after 1989, when this indicator had been falling. While data ",
        "16- for 1997 are not yet available, life expectancy in Romania has been falling since the onset of transition. Diseases such as typhoid and cholera have reoccurred. In fact, the very low levels of salaries in the health sector - estimated at a little more than half the national wage - and the lack of medical equipment and basic medicines prompted nurses and other medical staff to go on strike at the beginning of February. Russia At the beginning of 1998, the economic situation in Rus sia is still characterised by contradictory features. Success in terms of macroeconomic stabilisation - most notably the reduction of inflation and the stability of the exchange rate - is at odds with the fragility of the fiscal stance, the slow progress in law enforcement and the lack of improve ment in corporate governance. However, compared to the situation in other policy domains, economic policy mak ing seems to be relatively less affected by political instabil ity. In particular, the authorities have shown alertness and determination in addressing the negative spin-off from the recent turmoil on international financial markets.

During 1997, Russia achieved significant results. For the first time since 1992, the economy recorded positive econo mic growth. GDP is reported to have increased by 0.4% with respect to 1996. Industrial production grew by 2.4%, with a substantial acceleration in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Increases were particularly marked in pharmaceuticals (+15%) and biotechnology (+7%). Progress was also made in consolidating macroeconomic stabilisation. Annual average inflation for 1997 is reported at 15%, a rate which a couple of years ago was attained in a single month. The exchange rate of the rouble remained remarkably stable within its corridor throughout the year. Furthermore, the authorities have successfully handled two major events affecting the rouble at the beginning of 1998. From 1 January 1998 the rouble has been re-denominated, with 1,000 'old' roubles equalling one new rouble. New coins have been issued, and banknotes in circulation will re main legal tender until 2002. The reform is clearly aimed at underpinning the success achieved in stabilising the rouble and reducing inflation. Some initial public scepti cism, inspired by the confiscatory nature of previous currency reforms, has effectively been subdued as a result of careful handling by the authorities. In a related measure, the Central Bank of Russia announced the introduction of a new exchange rate regime for the rouble. The central bank will target a central rate allowing fluctuation within a band of plus or minus 15%. The target rate for 1998 will be 6.1 roubles per US dollar and 6.2 for the following two years. Like most emerging markets, Russia has felt some of the negative consequences of the recent turmoil on the interna tional financial markets stemming from the Asian crisis. In particular, since the last quarter of 1997, Russia has been subject to large withdrawals of funds. By the end of January 1998, foreign investors had withdrawn an estimated $8 bil lion from the Russian securities market, a major source of borrowing for the government. Mounting pressures on the exchange rate of the rouble have led to a substantial reduc tion of Central Bank reserves, which declined from $25 bil lion in October to $16 billion at the end of January 1998. Those events, which suggest that Russia is now functioning to some extent as part of the global economy, coincided with the re-denomination of the rouble and the introduction of the wider corridor for the exchange rate, as well as with the lifting of most restrictions on foreign investment. As in the case of other countries, these effects have oc curred despite the existence of a number of favourable fea tures of the Russian economy: a current account surplus, no sign of excessive domestic demand and no clear indication that the rouble was overvalued. Structural weaknesses, and in particular the fragility of the fiscal situation, could be singled out as the main culprits. The fiscal stance remains the most problematic area for macroeconomic policy, and revenue shortfalls are a particularly serious problem. Tax collection is weak; cash revenues represent less than half of total revenues, the rest taking the form of non-cash ar rangements, featuring the mutual clearance of tax and spending arrears. A large part of inter-enterprise transac tions - as much as 70% of the total, is estimated to take place on a barter basis, thus evading taxation. Since the beginning of the financial crisis in East Asia, the Russian authorities have shown a strong determination to counter its negative effects. At the outset, the central bank promptly intervened in support of the exchange rate, first by buying roubles and later by substantially raising the refi nancing rate. Mounting pressure on the exchange rate of the rouble led to a further increase of the refinancing rate, which at the beginning of February 1998 stood at 42%. Supervision of the commercial banks has been streng thened and reserve requirements have been increased. These measures have helped to fight off possible contagion effects and to keep the rouble firmly within its corridor. This is particularly important because an exchange rate cri sis could have jeopardised the entire reform effort. Al- ",
        "17- though appropriate in the short term, the preventive measures might have negative medium- and long-term im plications. For example, very high real interest rates can exert a negative influence on economic growth. The author ities estimate that the impact on the real economy will be limited, however, given the low level of financial interme diation and the still underdeveloped nature of the Russian capital market. Furthermore, the sizeable increase of the in terest rate will have a negative impact on the cost to the budget of servicing domestic debt. Although, at about 20% of GDP, government debt is rather low, the interest burden will further constrain the effort to continue reducing the government budget deficit, which is estimated to have been 7.5% of GDP in 1997. Addressing the structural weaknesses in the economy is a complex matter. The authorities seem aware that a substan tial improvement of the government's budgetary position requires the thorough overhaul of the tax system. For this reason, at the beginning of 1998 the government has pres ented a new tax code to Parliament, replacing the 1997 draft that failed to win legislative approval. The new plan should simplify, rationalise and increase the transparency of the tax system. The overall tax burden will be reduced to 31% of GDP, down two percentage points from 1997. It would also radically simplify the system, by reducing the number of taxes. Progress with structural reform has been rather uneven in 1997. While some progress has been made in the regulation of natural monopolies, land reform and the sale of the gov ernment's share in some major firms, achieving lasting stabilisation and sustained economic growth demands in tense efforts to accelerate the pace of structural transform ation. The government seems aware of this. Its agenda for 1998 includes measures for a substantial improvement of corporate governance, further action to improve the sound ness of the financial system and greater efforts for the im provement of the investment environment. GRAPH 13 : RUSSIA : Life expectancy at birth (in years) I 1 Male \u00a1Hi Female 80 Slovakia In 1997, Slovakia recorded its fourth consecutive year of strong economic growth. Fuelled by rapid wage increases anda substantial deterioration of the general government deficit, domestic demand pushed up GDP by 6% in the first three quarters of 1997. As a result of tight monetary policy and the introduction of an import surcharge, the external trade deficit was somewhat lower than in 1996, but it remains unsustainably high. To withstand repeated attacks on the koruna, and to compensate for the easy fis cal policy, the National Bank of Slovakia increased in terest rates to levels that are difficult for enterprises and banks. A more fundamental solution to resolve the exter nal and budget deficits would consist of a significant re duction of government expenditure, combined with trans parent restructuring measures to increase the export competitiveness of Slovak enterprises. Following a con tinuous decline in the previous years, inflation acceler ated somewhat in 1997, mainly as a result of higher in direct taxes and adjustments of some regulated prices.

After having been close to 7% for two years, GDP growth in the first three quarters of 1997 slowed down marginally to 6%. Overall economic developments continued to be driven by domestic demand, although its growth rate de clined from 20% in 1996 to 5% in the first three quarters of 1997. Investment growth started to slow down in the third quarter, most likely as a result of the restrictive monetary policy and the ensuing high interest rates. Although real private consumption growth was broadly stable at close to 7%, in line with real wage growth, slower real wage rises in the fourth quarter might generate some slowdown in pri vate consumption growth too. Stockbuilding decelerated significantly in the first three quarters of 1997. This might be explained by the mounting financial cost of building in ventories because of the high interest rates. While domestic demand became less dynamic in 1997, there was a bigger contribution of external trade to econo mic growth. With a real growth rate of more than 8%, total exports were clearly recovering from their disappointing ",
        "\u00ad 1 8\u00ad performance in 1996, when a negative real growth rate was recorded. Real import growth decelerated significantly from 18.5% in 1996 to 6.7% in the first three quarters of 1997. Demand for imports was restricted by the effects of the tight monetary policy and by the introduction of a new import surcharge. A number of one\u00adoff factors that pushed up imports in 1996 (imports of military equipment from Russia as debt repayment, higher anticipatory imports be\u00ad fore increases of tax and import duties) were notably absent in 1997. In order to obtain the approval of the WTO for the surcharge, the authorities announced that it would be low\u00ad ered ahead of schedule to 3% on 1 April 1998, and would be eliminated on 1 October 1998 instead of on 1 January 1999. The improved external developments are confirmed by the end\u00adof\u00adyear trade figures. The trade deficit declined from more than 11% of GDP in 1996 to about T/i% of GDP in 1997. After 10 months, the current account deficit was about equal to its level in the same period of 1996. Taking into account that the trade deficit was sharply reduced in December 1997, it can be expected that the end\u00adof\u00adyear current account deficit will see a similar decline. Neverthe\u00ad less, given the low inflow of foreign direct investment in Slovakia, this is still too high to be sustainable. The high current account deficit has to be financed almost fully by foreign credits, which pushes up external debt. In October 1997, the debt\u00adexport ratio stood at 93%, an increase of 40 percentage points in less than two years. As a result of disappointing corporate profit tax collection, and of higher expenditures for highway construction, public sector wages, interest payments, and social security benefits, the general government deficit is estimated to have surged from 1.3% of GDP in 1996 to close to 5% in 1997. If the authorities had not taken a number of corrective measures in July, such as the introduction of the import sur\u00ad charge and some expenditure cuts, the deficit would even have been about 2% higher. Although the budget for 1998 foresees a fiscal state deficit of only 0.7% of GDP, com\u00ad pared to about 2.5 % in 1997, the general government deficit is still expected to be close to 3% of GDP. This includes extra\u00adbudgetary investment in infrastructure and housing. pecially on those institutions that depend on the interbank market for their financing. As a consequence, IRB, the third largest bank encountered serious liquidity problems, and had to be put under forced administration by the National Bank of Slovakia in December. IRB will now be sold to a domestic investor, which could involve a foreign partner in the restructuring of this bank. Although inflation remains relatively low compared to other countries in the region, its gradual decline has been arrested by the continued high economic growth and do\u00ad mestic demand. Inflation decreased from a peak of 26.9% in September 1993 to only 5.2% in September 1996. It then increased gradually to 6.5% in April 1997, after which it de\u00ad clined again somewhat to 5.7% in September, as a result of the more restrictive monetary policy. However, adjust\u00ad ments of some remaining administered prices and indirect tax increases pushed inflation up again to 7.2% in January 1998, the highest level since December 1995.

Because of the very expansive stance of fiscal policy, mon\u00ad etary policy had to be very restrictive, certainly after pres\u00ad sure on the currency in May 1997. Consequently, the gov\u00ad ernment faced increasing difficulties to finance its growing deficit on the domestic financial markets. The growing re\u00ad luctance of international markets to finance transition econ\u00ad omies after the financial crisis in Southeast Asia forced the government to postpone a planned Eurobond issue. As a consequence, the government had to pay significantly higher interest rates and crowded out almost all domestic credits to enterprises. Because the budget for 1998 still implies a sizeable general government deficit, monetary policy cannot be relaxed significantly in 1998, in order to preserve economic stability. The high real interest rates which followed from the ex\u00ad change rate pressures and the inappropriate policy mix put additional pressure on the already weak bank sector, es\u00ad Initially, the fast economic growth had a beneficial impact on unemployment. The unemployment rate declined from a peak of 15.2% in January 1995 to 12.8% in December 1996. However, in 1997 the number of unemployed has been constantly higher than in the corresponding period of 1996. The official unemployment rate probably overesti\u00ad mates actual unemployment somewhat: the internationally comparable ILO unemployment rate was 11.2% in 1997. Unemployment in Slovakia is now clearly a structural phe\u00ad nomenon. The large majority of the unemployed have been out of a job for more than a year, and have a low education level. Because of low geographical labour mobility and a lack of housing in regions with fast economic growth, re\u00ad gional differences in unemployment rates are very high. As in previous years, foreign involvement in enterprise re\u00ad structuring remained limited in 1997. Foreign direct invest\u00ad ment even declined further from the already low level. The ",
        "-19- role of the state in enterprise restructuring was further in creased by the approval of the enterprise revitalisation act. Under this act, selected enterprises will be granted debt and tax reductions, and be exempted from bankruptcy while they are restructuring. Because of the prospect of debt re lief, the announcement of this new act has clearly given in centives for enterprises to build up additional payment ar rears. On the positive side, the Parliament has recently approved the long-awaited revision of the previously inef fective bankruptcy act. Slovenia In 1997, economic developments in Slovenia were disap pointing. GDP grew only moderately, the government deficit increased significantly, and no progress was made on the reduction of inflation or unemployment. Neverthe less, some encouraging signs indicate the potential for more dynamic future growth. Wage growth was substan tially lower than in previous years, foreign direct invest ment is finally accelerating, and enterprise restructuring is continuing, albeit slowly. Moreover, a number of im portant economic and structural reforms have been put on track to prepare the economy for EU accession. The success of this new strategy will crucially depend on the successful and timely implementation of the planned re forms.

As a result of the more favourable international eco nomic environment, and the stabilisation of Slovenian ex port competitiveness at its improved level of the previous year, real exports of goods increased by almost 10% in the first eleven months of 1997. Domestic demand remained sluggish as a result of more moderate wage developments and weak investment growth. Despite the moderate devel opment of domestic demand, growth of real imports of goods accelerated to 7.3% in the first eleven months, as a consequence of the high import content of Slovenian ex ports. Although almost all exports are industrial products, real industrial production grew by only 1.3%. This remark able divergence might indicate that methodological changes in the registration of industrial production have made annual comparisons unreliable. After a rapid deceleration, single-digit inflation was reached at the end of 1995. Since then, inflation has remained close to 10%. However, this gives a somewhat misleading pic ture. The rapid slowdown of inflation in the early years of independence is partly explained by price controls and slow adjustment of administered prices. In 1997, the authorities have liberalised a number of previously administered prices, and have eliminated part of the price disparities, without endangering the achieved level of price stability. As a consequence, almost half of the inflation rate in 1997 can be attributed to changes in administered prices. In par ticular, energy prices were adjusted; they increased by more than 20% and accounted for about one third of total infla tion. Despite these significant adjustments, the average growth of the consumer price index over the whole year de creased further from 9.9% in 1996 to 8.4% in 1997. Starting in 1998, the official inflation rate is calculated using the consumer price index (CPI). Before, Slovenia used the re tail price index (RPI), which is based on a different basket of goods. 1997 has seen a fundamental change in real wage develop ments. While in previous years, excessive pay rises had been one of the factors that negatively affected employ ment, a new wage adjustment law was passed by Parliament in June 1997 to keep wage growth below the labour produc tivity increase. Wages are now adjusted for 85% of inflation only once a year, instead of every quarter. Also, a freeze on civil servants' wages has been imposed, and the increase in the minimum wage has been limited to 4%. Because no general collective agreement has been reached for the pri vate sector, more and more agreements are now negotiated at the enterprise level, which increases the link between the profitability of the enterprise and wages. As a consequence, real wage growth was close to zero or even negative in the second half of the year. After 11 months, real wages per em ployee increased by only 2.6%, compared to 4.3% in 1995. Similar to the previous years, unemployment stayed ap proximately stable in 1997. Unemployment is more and more becoming a structural problem, because the majority of the registered unemployed are more than 40 years old, have a low level of education and have been without a job for more than a year. Nevertheless, in recent months, the continuous decline of total employment seems to have been arrested. Since July 1997, total employment has been con stantly somewhat higher than in the corresponding period of 1996, while employment declined by 12% between 1991 and 1996. 1997 was a peculiar year for Slovenian public finances. General government expenditures rose rapidly as public wages and social benefits were increased in the pre-elec tion period at the end of 1996. The approval of the 1997 budget was considerably delayed and was only adopted by Parliament in the beginning of December 1997. In the meantime, expenditures were governed by various provi sional financing rules, which limited most expenditure cat- ",
        "-20- egories to their 1996 level. Because the late approval of the budget had significantly limited expenditures, the govern ment decided that expenditures that were foreseen in the 1997 budget could be spent up to the end of January 1998. To limit the budget deficit, it was also decided to transfer part of the sales tax revenue of January 1998 to 1997. When these additional revenues are included, provisional esti mates put the general government deficit at 1.1 % of GDP. However, when more orthodox accounting methods are used, the deficit would be around 1.5% of GDP, a consider able deterioration compared to the small surplus of 0.3% in 1996. In December 1997, the government submitted the 1998 budget proposal to Parliament. It foresees a general government deficit of 1% of GDP. The reduction of the deficit should be attained by a reduction of expenditures from 46.5% of GDP in 1997 to 46.0% in 1998 and by an in crease of revenues from 44.5% in 1997 (excluding the transfer of revenues from January 1998) to 45% in 1998. There are some promising signs that enterprise restructur ing, which has proceeded slowly in Slovenia until now, could be picking up. Although the overall investment level is not increasing rapidly, the composition is shifting from construction to investment in equipment, which is more beneficial for productivity. Also, foreign direct investment (FDI) flows accelerated: in the first eight months of 1997 FDI inflows amounted to $230 million, which is four times higher than in the same period in 1996. Moreover, a recent study based on a very large sample of enterprises has shown that in 1996, the companies that were previously respon sible for the largest part of losses went bankrupt. This shows that the bankruptcy mechanism is able to eliminate non-viable enterprises, which contributes to the overall profitability and competitiveness of the enterprise sector.

Ukraine 1997 has been another difficult year for Ukraine's econ omy. Recovery has been once again postponed. Themain reasons are the protracted frictions between the govern ment and the parliament over the approval of the 1997 budget, the delays in the adoption of vital structural measures and the continued administrative weaknesses. The accumulation of large budgetary arrears poses a seri ous economic problem with potentially grave social consequences. With external financing significantly re duced in recent months due in part to the erosion of foreign investors' confidence in emerging economies, Ukraine's fiscal situation has become quite fragile. Further delays in the implementation of critical struc tural reforms would jeopardise the stabilisation gains al ready achieved.

(b) End of period. (c) Ukranian definition (including privatisation revenue and principal debt payments). Although the economy shrank for the seventh consecutive year in 1997, the pace of contraction slowed. Real GDP fell by 3% last year, compared to 10% in 1996. Real wages are currently at approximately one-third of their 1990 level. Preliminary data on production in industry and some other sectors indicate that the output decline might be coming to an end. Due mainly to the prudent monetary policy pursued by the central bank, December-on-December consumer price inflation was further reduced from 40% in 1996 to 10% in 1997. The central bank has so far managed largely to protect the currency (the hryvnia) from speculative attacks, linked both to the erosion of confidence following the Asian currency turmoil and to Ukraine's fragile fiscal situation. This was achieved by strongly raising key interest rates and intervening heavily in both the foreign exchange and T-bill markets after the hryvnia repeatedly fell out of the an nounced exchange rate band vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar in recent months. To increase its margin of manoeuvre, the central bank widened and lowered the band on 21 January 1998. The current account recorded a deficit of 3.4% of GDP in 1997, compared to 2.7% in 1996. The deterioration is at tributed to the fact that exports to Russia, the country's largest trade partner, were reduced by 20% due to an unre solved trade dispute, largely motivated by Russia's desire ",
        "\u25a021 to protect its sugar refining industry from sugar imports from Ukraine. The dispute was settled at the beginning of 1998. Exports to non\u00adtraditional partners (China, Germany and Turkey) and eastern Europe increased by about 20%, showing that the country's output remained competitive on international markets despite the pursuance of a \"hard currency\" policy by the authorities. Fiscal developments have been disappointing in 1997. In view of the parliamentary elections due in March 1998, the government began from the third quarter of 1997 to partial\u00ad ly settle the accumulated budgetary wage, pension and so\u00ad cial security arrears, currently at 3% of GDP This rapidly deteriorated the budget deficit which reached 6.8% of GDP in 1997, against 4.6% in 1996. It also derailed the imple\u00ad mentation of the economic programme covering the period July 1997\u00adJune 1998 and supported by an IMF Stand\u00adby Arrangement (SBA) of $549 million, since the authorities could not meet the performance criteria particularly with respect to the budget deficit. The disbursement of several of the 1997 tranches of the SBA was made possible only after a substantial modification of the programme in late 1997. The 1998 budget, approved by the Ukrainian parliament on 30 December 1997, provides for a deficit of 4.3 billion hryvnias (equivalent to 4.2% of GDP). In comparison to earlier drafts of the budget, some spending cuts were made in the field of public administration while spending on de\u00ad fence, social protection and construction were increased. The budget provides for 2.3 billion hryvnias ($1.2 billion) of the deficit to be covered by external financing and calls for the settlement of all budgetary arrears without specify\u00ad ing the means to be used nor giving any deadlines. The Ukrainian authorities are currently facing some serious short\u00adterm economic challenges. First is the settlement of the budgetary arrears which disrupt the payments system and undermine confidence in the government. Second is the imminent redeeming (particularly in the first, but also in the second quarter of 1998) of a large amount of short\u00adterm T\u00ad bills issued in 1997 to finance the budget deficit. Rolling over of this debt by issuing new, longer\u00adterm, T\u00adbills will be difficult. In the aftermath of the recent turmoil in interna\u00ad tional markets and given Ukraine's precarious fiscal situ\u00ad ation, the presence of foreign investors in the domestic T\u00ad bill market has been drastically reduced, while the country's already limited access to the international capital markets has become more difficult. Ukraine placed a three\u00ad year bond worth DM750 million at the excessively high yield of 16% in mid\u00adFebruary. Under these circumstances, the government intends to focus, in the short term, on ex\u00ad penditure control and reduce outlays to the absolutely necessary (payments of budgetary wages and pensions, basic social expenditure, debt service). The main underlying problem of the Ukrainian economy remains the lack of significant progress of vital structural reforms. Although the privatisation of small enterprises has been virtually completed, the privatisation of large enter\u00ad prises has practically stagnated. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive tax reform to lighten the burden of the cor\u00ad porations and widen the tax base bringing Ukraine's boom\u00ad ing shadow economy into light. Deregulation and adminis\u00ad trative reform would streamline the decision making process, increase efficiency and create favourable condi\u00ad tions for domestic and foreign investment. In particular, ad\u00ad ministrative reform would also improve the fight against criminality, which, under the present economic and social conditions, is rising (although recent social statistics data are missing, drug crimes increased by 45% between 1990 and 1994). Economic developments in 1998 should largely depend on the outcome of the March parliamentary elections which would also influence the campaign for the October 1999 presidential elections. A crucial first priority for the new government will clearly be to draft a credible medium\u00adterm economic programme providing for comprehensive re\u00ad forms in several sectors of the economy. Such a programme would be essential to put the country's economy on a sound growth path, strengthen the credibility of the authorities and mobilise the interest of domestic and foreign investors.
