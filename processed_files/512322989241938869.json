INTRODUCTION 1. Cohesion Policy plays a crucial role in strengthening the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union by reducing disparities between the various EU regions, in line with Article 174 TFEU. Following the publication of the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, the Commission's legislative proposals for Cohesion Policy for the 2021-2027 period were published on 29 and 30 May 2018. The Cohesion Policy Legislative Package namely includes the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) 1 , the ERDF/Cohesion Fund Regulation (ERDF/CF) 2 , the European Social Fund Plus Regulation (ESF+) 3 , the European Territorial Cooperation (Interreg) Regulation 4 , as well as a Regulation for a mechanism to resolve legal and administrative obstacles in a cross-border context (ECBM) 5 . 1 Doc. 9511/18 + ADD 1. 2 Doc. 9522/18 + ADD 1-2. 3 Doc. 9573/18 + ADD 1-2. 4 Doc. 9536/18 + ADD 1. 5 Doc. 9555/18.

        "15428/18 AFG/mf 2 ECOMP.2B EN II. STATE OF PLAY OF NEGOTIATIONS WITHIN THE COUNCIL 2. The Bulgarian Presidency kicked-off the negotiations with the organisation of presentations and first exchanges of views during the month of June 2018. From July until mid-December of the same year, the Austrian Presidency held an in-depth examination of the legal proposals. In order to make the discussions more effective and efficient, work within the Council was structured by regulation but for the CPR also in thematic blocks. The Presidency prioritised those thematic blocks or parts of the regulations needed first to ensure a timely start of the upcoming programming exercise. 3. This intense work entailed very close cooperation between Member States with one or two meetings of the Structural Measures Working Party (SMWP) per week, with a total of 24 meetings of the SMWP during the Austrian Presidency. 4. The General Affairs Council dedicated to Cohesion Policy on 30 November 2018 took stock of the progress made and gave guidance on certain issues, namely the nature of the Partnership Agreement, the role of the mid-term review and its link with the programming exercise, as well as the architecture of the Interreg Regulation, based on a background paper for discussion (doc. 14216/18). The substantial discussion brought fruitful results that allowed the Presidency to continue the work on the proposals in the working party. 5. Based on the Ministerial discussion, the Presidency adjusted the relevant compromise texts of the regulations concerned in view of a compromise package for the ERDF/Cohesion Fund regulation and a limited number of CPR blocks to be agreed by delegations. This compromise package was discussed at the SMWP on 4, 10, 14 and 17 December 2018. 6. Progress achieved on the various regulations part of the Cohesion Policy Legislative Package can be summarised as follows: ",
        "15428/18 AFG/mf 3 ECOMP.2B EN Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) 7. The work of the SMWP put emphasis on the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR), for which examination article-by-article started in September 2018 with a focus on three thematic blocks covering provisions on (1) Programming and strategic planning, (2) Management and control and (3) Enabling conditions and performance framework. These three blocks constitute the main basis needed for national and regional authorities to start planning and programming at the earliest possible stage, to allow for a quick start and implementation of the 2021-2027 programmes. Further work is still needed on the other thematic blocks part of the CPR. 8. The results of the negotiations within the Council preparatory bodies on the CPR thematic block 1 (Programing and strategic planning) and block 5 (management and control) are set out in doc. 15429/18 + ADD1, as a partial mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament. 9. The Presidency's view on the most balanced compromise on the CPR thematic block 2 (Enabling conditions and performance framework) is set out in the Annex to this note. ERDF/Cohesion Fund 10. The SMWP carefully looked at the proposed regulation, clarified the mechanics between the different policy objectives and the scope of support of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund. All provisions of the Regulation were examined. An orientation debate on thematic concentration took place on 14 September 2018, having in mind that such provisions (Article 3) have been set aside for the time being, as part of the overall MFF negotiations. 11. The Presidency's view on the most balanced compromise on the ERDF/Cohesion Fund Regulation is set out in the Annex to this note. ",
        "15428/18 AFG/mf 4 ECOMP.2B EN ESF+ Regulation 12. The SMWP had an in-depth examination of the specific objectives of the ESF+ Regulation (Article 4(1)), which are intrinsically linked to certain CPR provisions on enabling conditions (particularly Article 11 and Annex III and IV of the CPR). Discussion at the SMWP also showed that more work is needed on the governance provisions, the relevant decision-making processes of the various strands and on indicators. An orientation debate on thematic concentration under ESF+ took place on 14 September 2018, having in mind that such provisions (Article 7) have been set aside for the time being, as part of the overall MFF negotiations. 13. The Presidency's view on the most balanced compromise on Article 4(1) of the ESF+ Regulation and the related enabling conditions is set out in the Annex to this note. European Territorial Cooperation (Interreg) Regulation 14. Detailed examination of the Interreg Regulation by the SMWP started with an orientation debate on 20 September 2018, which focused on the ETC components and their geographical coverage, the external dimension and the Interreg specificities. The main concern expressed by delegations was the proposed architecture of Interreg, with its five components. Moreover, on 15 November 2018 and following progress on the CPR provisions, the SMWP started examining the potential alignment and implications between the CPR and the Interreg Regulation, in particular on the programming, management and control provisions. 15. The General Affairs Council dedicated to Cohesion Policy on 30 November 2018 gave specific guidance on the architecture of the Interreg Regulation. The Presidency proposal to adjust the 'architecture' of the Interreg Regulation in a way that it stays as close as possible to the one of the 2014 \u2013 2020 period (as set out in doc. 14216/18), received broad support from delegations. Moreover, orientation was also given for existing programs of all three strands to be continued to a maximum extent. At the same time, the Interreg component 5 was shifted to ERDF as a dedicated initiative in that regulation. ",
        "15428/18 AFG/mf 5 ECOMP.2B EN European Cross-Border Mechanism Regulation (ECBM) 16. Detailed examination of the ECBM Regulation by the SMWP started with an orientation debate on 16 October 2018, which focused on the rationale and added-value of the proposed mechanism as well as on the approach taken by the Commission and its legal implications. The Austrian Presidency also worked on the legal implications and potential use of the proposed ECBM Regulation with a dedicated seminar in cooperation with the Government of Luxembourg on 21 November 2018. 17. Member States showed support for the idea of reducing undesirable border effects. However, the proposal itself raised a large number of questions, notably about the voluntary nature of such an instrument, the additional administrative burden that it could entail, the full recognition of existing mechanisms and other legal implications, mainly related to constitutional law. Therefore, further examination and legal assessment is needed in order to move forward with the file. 18. Due to the complexity and nature of the file, the Presidency has requested the Council Legal Service to further scrutinise the dossier. III. CONCLUSION 19. The Permanent Representatives Committee is invited to take note of this report. _________________ ",
