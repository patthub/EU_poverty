        "PanAf, an ambitious \u20ac845-million commitment to continental and inter-regional projects that mutually benefit Africa and Europe In 2014, the Pan-African Programme (PanAf) was launched to lend support to a strategy first adopted at the Lisbon Africa-EU Summit a decade ago. The so-called Joint Africa EU Strategy (JAES) of 2007 was driven from the highest political levels and represented a call for a new, strategic partnership that put Africa and the EU on a more equitable footing. PanAf is just one of the many EU instruments that are supporting the Africa-EU Partnership but it is the only EU programme designed to \u2018treat Africa as One\u2019. Through continental and trans-regional initiatives, the PanAf complements EU support at regional and country level. To achieve its goals, PanAf has received an envelope of \u20ac845m for the period 2014-2020. Since 2014, the programme has already committed \u20ac400m to building synergistic, mutually beneficial projects for the EU and Africa.

Without improved governance resources cannot be effectively managed and laws cannot be upheld, security can be compromised and citizens misrepresented.

S U CC E S S S TO R Y 1 A V O T E F O R F A I R N E S S The presence of electoral observers, which can help to reduce fraud and increase domestic confidence, has contributed to elections becoming more free and fair. Thanks to PanAf\u2019s commitment of \u20ac6.5m, the AUC has benefited from the expertise of electoral experts and since 2000 there have been 129 election observation missions to the conti- nent. In addition, the quality of Africa\u2019s own electoral missions, which now apply better methodologies and are more effectively deployed, has improved. S U CC E S S S TO R Y 2 T H E R I G H T W A Y F O R W A R D F O R H U M A N R I G H T S In a \u20ac10m project coined Strengthening the African Human Rights System, the EU has thrown its support behind numerous pan-African bodies working to improve the rights and welfare of the continent\u2019s people. By enforcing the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, people today feel more able to report acts of violation and abuse. As a result of this, a higher number of cases are being resolved and within a reasonable time frame. It has also led to new countries signing up to Article 34(6) of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, which enables non-governmental organisations and individuals to access the African Court on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights directly. It is still work in progress, however, as just eight African countries to date have signed up to it. S U CC E S S S TO R Y 3 R A I S I N G A W A R E N E S S The pan-African programme calls on civil society and international organisations to raise awareness on a number of priority issues such as female genital mutilation, illicit financial flows, the rights of people living with disabilities, and women\u2019s land rights among others. One such project, led by the International Commission of Jurists, aims to help civil society organisations educate citizens about the AU mechanisms available for the protection of human rights, and how to use them more frequently and effectively.

        "5 M I G R A T I O N & S E C U R I T Y Mobility and migration constitute important economic, security and social issues in both Africa and Europe. They can enrich and strengthen societies but also destabilise them if not managed properly. The EU\u2019s aim is to manage migration in an orderly fashion, which requires a balanced, holistic and sustainable policy response. PanAf has directed \u20ac45m to projects that support the migration dialogue between Africa and the EU. With smuggling and trafficking networks also on the rise, \u20ac14.5m is going towards establishing regional observatories aimed at monitoring trends in transnational organised crime. S U CC E S S S TO R Y 4 D I A S P O R A P O W E R Helping to advance the positive dialogue around migration is ADEPT, a platform for the African diaspora established in Europe to strengthen their voice through networking, capacity building, fundraising, and advocacy.

Although official unemployment rates are relatively low, the number of jobless Africans is increasing and underemployment, working poverty and poor job quality remain significant problems in many countries. In order to grow and provide jobs, Africa needs infrastructure, it needs to invest in its wealth of natural resources, and it needs regional integration to reap the benefits of that investment. \u20ac88m Infrastructure projects \u20ac40m economic integration \u20ac40m agriculture and raw materials ",
        "7 I N F R A S T R U C T U R E On a continent where 600 million people still do not have access to electricity, the importance of investing in infrastructure cannot be underplayed. But it\u2019s not just energy \u2013 infrastructure investment is also needed in other sectors like transport, sewage, water, and communication - to the tune of $93bn a year over the next 10 years, according to World Bank! Enter PIDA, the AU\u2019s Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa, which is committed to developing the world-class infrastructure required to improve transport policy and networks, and deliver continent-wide interconnectivity and accessibility to energy, water and IC technologies. In this the EU has a role to play too and, as a result of PanAf, dialogue is underway to support these efforts.

Its aim is to support trans-regional, continental and global projects that are of mutual interest to the AU and EU.

To this end, PanAf is helping to facilitate decision-making and policy monitoring processes, improve the availability and quality of statistical informa- tion, and implement international standards in African trade. One example of its efforts is to oversee negotiations on a Common Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). A G R I C U L T U R E A N D R A W M A T E R I A L S In order to link growth with sustainability and inclusiveness, the EU is supporting Africa in managing its natural resources. Not only is it helping to support policy developments around the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) and development of the livestock sector, it is also sharing knowledge and expertise for sustainable use of mineral resources and other raw materials. Reach for the skies In Africa, there is a huge untapped opportunity for air travel. Despite being the world\u2019s second largest con- tinent, Africa accounts for just 3% of global air traffic. The good news is that rapid growth of nearly 5% a year is expected over the next two decades, which will contribute to socio-eco- nomic development, inter- national trade, tourism and regional integration. The bad news is that 19% of global air accidents happen in Africa. PanAf is helping to extend coverage of Europe first pan-European satellite navigation system, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) system to Africa. At the same time, harmo- nised regulations, common oversight processes and training are also helping to build capacity of African Regional Safety Oversight Organisations. ",
        "9 S U CC E S S S TO R Y 2 L I V E S T O C K V A L U E A D D Close to one-third of Africa\u2019s people depend directly on livestock for their livelihoods. Indeed, this important sector contributes from 20% to 80% to agricultural value-add in most African countries. As such, PanAf has directed \u20ac19m to the implementation of the AU Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR) strategic plan that aims to encourage continent-wide development of the livestock sector. In doing so, this can help improve food and nutritional security, spur economic growth and create wealth where it is needed most. S U CC E S S S TO R Y 3 M A N A G I N G M I N E R A L S Africa produces around 60 different minerals and metals, but there is a growing rec- ognition that natural resources need to be better understood for the benefits to be reaped at home, and in a more sustainable manner.

From its experience of investing in a knowledge economy, both in terms of policies and technology transfers, Europe has much to offer.

        "R E S E A R C H & I N N O V A T I O N When it comes to the vital role that research an innovation plays in fuelling growth and employment, as well as tackling societal challenges, Africa falls short. At the same time, spend on research and development (R&D) as a per- centage of GDP is just 0.45%, much lower than the global average of 1.7% and less than the AU\u2019s target of 1%. Times are changing, however, and greater cooperation in the fields of science, technology and innovation (STI) has become a common goal for the two continents. Between 2014 and 2017, PanAf has also helped to strengthen research capacities and innovation in Africa through different programmes. These are underpinned by an EU-Africa High Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD) on STI, which is aimed at harnessing and pooling existing resources both nationally and globally. How GMES is delivering apps for Africa Management of the environ- ment and understanding and mitigating the effects of climate change, are crucial to Africa\u2019s development. Under the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) & Africa initiative, the idea is to harness Europe\u2019s existing satellite infrastructure and facilities, such as the Co- pernicus programme, for earth observation in Africa. To this end, some 70 institutions across the continent have formed 13 consortia to design and develop 23 new apps. Their aim: to help with monitoring and assessment of riverine floods, wetlands, land degradation, oil spills and more. Thanks to EU support, these consortia are making use of over 200 receiving stations installed across the continent. For the use of these apps to become wide- spread, universities and/or spe- cialised training centres in each region are equipped to train 200 policymakers from 25 countries, a hundred companies and 50 civil society and non-govern- mental organisations.
