(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 ( 3 ) lays down, inter alia , detailed rules for the application to milk and milk products of the import arrangements provided for the Association Agreement. Since the provisions relating to an import quota of cheese origi- nating in Jordan are no more compatible with the free and unlimited access into the Community of that product as provided for in Protocol 1 of the Association Agreement as replaced by the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters referred above, they should be deleted. (3) Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 provides for a yearly tariff quota of butter originating in New Zealand. (4) Council Regulation (EC) No 2175/2005 of 21 December 2005 concerning the implementation of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and New Zealand pursuant to Article XXIV.6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedules of the Czech republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic in the course of their accession to the European Union, supplementing Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomen- clature and on the Common Customs Tariff ( 4 ), provides for an additional allocation of 735 tonnes of butter originating in New Zealand under the annual import tariff quota. It is therefore appropriate to adjust the quantity of butter under quota No 09.4589 referred to in Annex III.A to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001. (5) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Commission Decision 2000/181/EC ( 2 ) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive. (2) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossier was necessary in order to allow it to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substance concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by that Directive. (3) For this active substance, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The rapporteur Member State submitted the draft assessment report to the Commission on 20 January 2002. (4) Following submission of the draft assessment report by the rapporteur Member State, it has been found to be necessary to request further information from the applicant and to have the rapporteur Member State examine that information and submit its assessment. Therefore, the examination of the dossier is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the time-frame provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC. (5) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substance concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossier to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion for thia- methoxam will have been completed within 24 months. (6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Member States may extend provisional authorisations for plant protection products containing thiamethoxam for a period not exceeding 24 months from the date of adoption of this Decision.

        "COMMISSION DECISION of 13 February 2006 requiring Member States temporarily to take additional measures against the dissemination of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode) as regards areas in Portugal, other than those in which it is known not to occur (notified under document number C(2006) 345) (2006/133/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community ( 1 ), and in particular Article 16(3) thereof, Whereas: (1) Where a Member State considers that there is an imminent danger of the introduction into its territory of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode (PWN)), from another Member State, it should be authorised to temporarily take any additional measures necessary to protect itself from that danger. (2) Portugal informed the other Member States and the Commission on 25 June 1999 that some samples of pine trees originating in its territory were identified as infested by PWN. The Commission has adopted Decisions 2000/58/EC ( 2 ) and 2001/218/EC ( 3 ) defining measures to be taken against PWN. (3) On the basis of assessments by the Food and Veterinary Office, most recently in November 2004, additional information submitted by Portugal and official surveys carried out by the other Member States on wood, isolated bark and plants of Abies Mill., Cedrus Trew, Larix Mill., Picea A. Dietr., Pinus L., Pseudotsuga Carr. and Tsuga Carr., it appears that as a result of the appli- cation of an eradication programme in Portugal, the spread of PWN remains limited to the demarcated areas in Portugal. However, trees showing symptoms of infestation by PWN were still found during surveys of those areas. (4) The implementation of the Portuguese mid-term eradi- cation plan for PWN of February 2003, as amended in June 2003, was evaluated by the Standing Committee on Plant Health in its meetings of July 2004 and May 2005. During the latter meeting it was concluded that the aimed reduction of infection level in the demarcated zone had not been fully achieved so far. (5) It is therefore necessary for Portugal to continue to take specific measures with respect to movements of wood, isolated bark and host plants within demarcated areas in Portugal and from such areas into other areas of Portugal and into the other Member States. (6) It is also necessary that Portugal continues to take measures to control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradication. Therefore, an updated mid-term eradi- cation plan to better control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradicating should be presented. (7) The other Member States should continue to have the possibility to apply additional measures to protect their territories from PWN. (8) The results of the specific measures and of the imple- mentation of the mid-term plan should be assessed continuously, in particular on the basis of information to be provided by Portugal and the other Member States. (9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 For the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply: (a) \u2018 the pine wood nematode (PWN) \u2019 : Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. ; EN L 52/34 Official Journal of the European Union 23.2.2006 ( 1 ) OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.

Dietr., Pinus L., Pseudotsuga Carr. and Tsuga Carr. Article 2 Until 31 March 2008, Portugal shall ensure that the conditions laid down in the Annex to this Decision are met in relation to susceptible wood, bark and plants, which are to be moved within or from demarcated areas in Portugal and defined as in accordance with Article 5, either to other areas in Portugal or to other Member States. By 15 February 2006, Portugal shall present an updated mid- term eradication plan to control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradicating it. That plan shall include details on the management, within the demarcated area, of tree species known to be highly susceptible to PWN under the conditions in Portugal. This plan shall be reviewed by 30 April 2007 and 30 March 2008. Article 3 Member States of destination other than Portugal may: (a) subject consignments of susceptible wood, bark and plants, coming from demarcated areas in Portugal and moved into their territory, to testing for the presence of PWN; (b) take further appropriate steps to carry out official moni- toring in respect of such consignments, to ascertain whether they comply with the relevant conditions specified in the Annex. Article 4 Member States shall conduct official annual surveys for PWN, on susceptible wood and bark and susceptible plants originating in their country, to determine whether there is any evidence of infestation by PWN. Without prejudice to Article 16(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC, the results of such surveys shall be notified to the other Member States and the Commission by 15 December 2006 and 15 December 2007. Article 5 Portugal shall establish areas in which PWN is known not to occur, and demarcate areas (hereinafter called demarcated areas) comprised of a part in which PWN is known to occur and a part designated as buffer zone of not less than 20 km width surrounding that part, taking into account the results of the surveys referred to in Article 4. The Commission shall compile a list of \u2018 areas \u2019 in which PWN is known not to occur and convey such a list to the Standing Committee on Plant Health and to the Member States. Any areas in Portugal not comprised in the above compiled list, shall be deemed to be demarcated areas. That list shall be updated according to the results of the surveys referred to in the first paragraph of Article 4 and to the findings notified under Article 16(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC.

Under certain circumstances the disease may also pose a risk to human health. There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread to other holdings, to wild birds and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through the international trade in live birds or their products. (2) Highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 has been isolated from wild birds in certain parts of the Community and in third countries adjacent to the Community or populated by migratory birds during winter. The likelihood of virus introduction with wild birds is increasing during the forthcoming migratory season. (3) Where an H5 avian influenza virus collected from poultry is isolated on the territory of a Member State and where, pending the determination of the neurami- nidase (N) type or of the pathogenicity index, the clinical picture and the epidemiological circumstances justify the suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by highly pathogenic influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 or the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, in particular of that subtype, has been confirmed, the affected Member State should apply certain protection measures to minimise the risk of disease spread. (4) These protective measures should be implemented in addition to those foreseen in the framework of Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza ( 5 ). (5) However, the measures provided for in Directive 92/40/EEC are minimum control measures and require supplementary provisions notably on the movement of certain birds and of products from poultry and other birds originating in the zone affected by the disease. (6) Given the particular disease risk and the epidemiological situation with regard to highly pathogenic avian influenza and taking into account the severe economic impact the disease may have, in particular when occurring in Densely Populated Poultry Areas, supple- mentary measures should aim at reinforcing the local control measures, regionalising the affected Member State by separating the affected part of the territory from the disease free part thereof, and providing reas- surance to the poultry sector and the trade partners about the safety of products dispatched from the disease free part of the country.

        "(7) Taking account of the differences in disease risk in case of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, a high risk area and a low risk area should be established by the affected Member State in close collaboration with the Commission. (8) If the epidemiological situation so requires, measures appropriate in relation to the areas concerned by the outbreak or suspected outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza should be taken, in particular by describing these areas, and keeping this description updated depending on the situation, in Annex I to the present Decision in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 10(3) or (4) of Directive 90/425/EEC and Article 9(3) or (4) of Directive 89/662/EEC. (9) In the interests of consistency, it is appropriate to apply for the purposes of this Decision certain definitions provided for in Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC ( 6 ), Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs ( 7 ), Regu- lation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin ( 8 ), Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC ( 9 ). (10) The measures laid down in Commission Decision 2005/734/EC of 19 October 2005 laying down biose- curity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and providing for an early detection system in areas at particular risk ( 10 ) should be implemented in the areas affected by the disease. (11) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC ( 11 ) provides for approved bodies, institutes and centres and a model certificate to accompany animals or their gametes between such approved premises in different Member States. A derogation from the transport restrictions should be envisaged for birds coming from and proceeding to bodies, institutes and centres approved in accordance with that Directive. (12) Transport of hatching eggs from the protection zones should be permitted under certain conditions. The dispatch of hatching eggs to other countries may be permitted subject in particular to compliance with the conditions referred to in Directive 2005/94/EC. In such cases the animal health certificates provided for in accordance with Directive 90/539/EEC should include a reference to this Decision. (13) The dispatch from protection zones of meat, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products should be permitted subject to certain conditions, in particular as regards compliance with certain requirements of Regu- lation (EC) No 853/2004 and of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption ( 12 ). (14) Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption ( 13 ) establishes a list of treatments rendering meat from restricted areas safe, provides for the possibility to establish a specific identification mark and sets up the identification mark required for meat not authorised for placing on the market for animal health reasons. It is appropriate to permit the dispatch from the protection zones of meat bearing the health mark provided for in that Directive and meat products subjected to treatment referred to therein.
