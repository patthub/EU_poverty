        "I (Legislative acts) REGULATIONS REGULATION (EU) 2017/1951 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 October 2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 on the European statistical programme 2013-17, by extending it to 2020 (Text with relevance for the EEA and for Switzerland) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) Reliable, relevant evidence based on timely and publicly available European statistics that can be used for policy- making is essential for measuring the progress of and evaluating the efficiency of the Union's policies and programmes, especially in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy set out in the Commission Communication of 3 March 2010 entitled \u2018Europe 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\u2019 (Europe 2020) and the Commission's Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change. (2) European statistics should take a comprehensive Union-wide approach that provides accurate data to assist further integration processes in the Union. (3) The availability of reliable, comprehensive European statistics is an important public good that benefits decision- makers, researchers and the public. (4) A good balance between economic and social goals in the European Semester is particularly important for the sustainability and legitimacy of the Economic and Monetary Union. Accordingly, social and employment goals have become more prominent in the European Semester, with both country reports and country-specific recommendations assessing social and employment challenges and promoting policy reforms based on best practice. To that end, social statistics are of particular importance. 31.10.2017 L 284/1 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ C 75, 10.3.2017, p. 53. ( 2 ) Position of the European Parliament of 14 September 2017 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of 9 October 2017. ",
        "(5) Under Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), the European statistical programme (the \u2018programme\u2019) is to provide the framework for the development, production and dissemination of high-quality European statistics, setting out the main fields and objectives of the actions envisaged for a period corresponding to that of the multiannual financial framework. The programme should be implemented by individual statistical actions in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. Annual work programmes should be based on the programme. (6) Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) only covers the period from 2013 to 2017, whereas the current multiannual financial framework extends to 2020. That Regulation should therefore be amended without delay to extend the programme to 2020 and to fill statistical gaps where urgently required. (7) In the context of the Commission's Better Regulation Agenda, Union policies should increasingly be designed and monitored on the basis of reliable evidence that has a solid statistical basis. European statistics have a distinct role to play in that respect, and can make a real difference, especially in policy areas where analytical value based on reliable data and responsiveness are key for policies to be successful. (8) High-quality statistics are therefore crucial to achieving better results and to contributing to a better Europe. Greater efforts should be made to boost investment in official statistics at both the European and national level. The programme should also provide guidance on priority policy areas, capacity-building and the ongoing reprior\u00ad itisation. Furthermore, in order to ensure a harmonised approach to achieving the objectives of this Regulation, cooperation with international organisations should be strengthened. (9) Action should be taken to tackle the most urgent statistical gaps, to increase timeliness and to support political priorities and economic policy coordination throughout the European Semester. The Commission (Eurostat) should also provide new population projections in close cooperation with national statistical institutes, including as regards migration flows, in order to update the analyses of the social, economic and budgetary implications of population ageing and of economic inequalities. (10) To support efficient policy-making, indicators should be published in a timely manner. In accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, the Commission (Eurostat) should communicate publicly on timeliness, including the provision of relevant information in respect of any insufficient timeliness that might occur, as an aspect of the statistical quality. (11) Experimental ecosystem accounts and climate change statistics, including those relevant to climate change adaptation and \u2018footprints\u2019, should be further developed using existing data. The European Energy Union and the 2030 climate and energy framework, which aim to make the Union's economy and energy system more competitive, efficient, secure and sustainable, will require new statistics on energy consumption, energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, energy dependence and security of supply, as well as new statistics on the circular economy. (12) High-quality statistics developed, produced and disseminated under the programme, in particular statistics on innovation, research and development, social statistics, environmental statistics as well as energy and transport statistics should allow the monitoring of objectives and targets of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that are to be set at the Union and Member State level and, in that way, contribute to the achievement of those objectives and targets. (13) Progress should be made in improving qualitative and quantitative information that contributes to the exhaus\u00ad tiveness of national accounts and thus allows for better estimates of the tax gap and tax avoidance. (14) The extension of the programme is an opportunity that should be taken to make adaptations and reflect the new orientations, in particular in line with the European Statistical System (ESS) Vision 2020, to complement the existing objectives, ongoing prioritisation and the availability of data in a context where the Union is facing important challenges in terms of economic development and social cohesion. It should ensure continued 31.10.2017 L 284/2 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics and repealing Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1101/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics, and Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities (OJ L 87, 31.3.2009, p. 164). ( 2 ) Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013 on the European statistical programme 2013-17 (OJ L 39, 9.2.2013, p. 12). ",
        "cooperation between the Commission (Eurostat) and the national statistical institutes, and should ensure regular dialogues with the European Statistical Advisory Committee established by Decision No 234/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ). It should also ensure the coordination between the ESS and the European System of Central Banks. The Commission (Eurostat) should monitor Member States' compliance with the European Statistics Code of Practice (Code of Practice). (15) It is particularly important to measure pockets of high unemployment, including youth unemployment in cross- border regions. (16) An appropriate increase in the budget for statistics at Union level should support the changes to the programme and the ongoing efficiency work of the ESS by bringing significant added value and results for the improvement of the quality of data through large scale projects, structural leverage effects and economies of scale that can improve statistical systems across Member States. (17) This Regulation lays down a financial envelope for the extension of the programme to cover the period from 2018 to 2020, which is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management ( 2 ), for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure. (18) In extending the programme, the Commission (Eurostat) should give particular consideration to the consequences of the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union. (19) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to extend the programme to cover the period from 2018 to 2020, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of propor\u00ad tionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (20) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, the draft proposal for an extension of the programme to cover the period from 2018 to 2020 has been submitted for prior examination to the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC), the European Statistical Advisory Committee and the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics established by Council Decision 2006/856/EC ( 3 ). (21) Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 should be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 is amended as follows: (1) in Article 1, the following paragraph is added: \u2018The programme shall be extended to cover the period from 2018 to 2020.\u2019; (2) Article 3 is replaced by the following: \u2018 Article 3 Scope This Regulation provides the programming framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, the main fields and the objectives of the actions envisaged for the period from 2013 to 2020, in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.\u2019; 31.10.2017 L 284/3 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Decision No 234/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2008 establishing the European Statistical Advisory Committee and repealing Council Decision 91/116/EEC (OJ L 73, 15.3.2008, p. 13).

Accounting frameworks The Commission Communication of 20 August 2009 entitled \u201cGDP and beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world\u201d (\u201cGDP and beyond\u201d), and the publication of the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Report on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, have given new impetus to the key challenge for the ESS, namely how to achieve better statistics on cross-cutting issues and more integrated statistics to describe complex social, environmental and economic phenomena beyond the traditional measures of economic output. Work on GDP and beyond within the ESS focuses on three priority areas: statistics on the household sector and statistics measuring the distribution of income, consumption and wealth; measuring quality of life in a multidi\u00ad mensional way; and measuring environmental sustainability. The new worldwide Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015 provide further impetus. The European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA) offers an integrated and consistent framework for all economic statistics that should be complemented by other indicators in order to provide more comprehensive information for policy- and decision-making. Full implemen\u00ad tation of the ESA 2010 will be supported by regular quality and compliance assessments, taking into account the progressive expiry of derogations until 2020, leading to further improvements in the timeliness and availability of indicators.\u2019; (f) point 2.1.

The expectations on the scope, quality and comparability of European statistics are increasing. With globalisation, a complex reality has emerged that has to be captured by official statistics and raises methodological challenges. The ever increasing availability of data from private and public providers offers the potential to improve the timeliness and relevance of official statistics as well as to reduce response burden. To face these challenges, while at the same time confronted with constraints on resources, the ESS will gradually implement strategic goals defined in the ESS Vision 2020, building upon a holistic approach to reach quality and efficiency gains: \u2014 to engage proactively in a regular dialogue with users to understand their needs more deeply, recognising that different user groups have different needs that need to be addressed correctly; \u2014 to provide high quality products and services and apply a quality approach to the management, organisation, and governance of the ESS; \u2014 to base statistical products and services on both traditional surveys and other sources, including adminis\u00ad trative data, geospatial and, where possible, big data; \u2014 to get access to new data sources, create methods and find suitable technology in order to use such data sources to produce European statistics in a reliable way; \u2014 to improve the efficiency of statistical production by further intensifying the sharing of knowledge, experiences and methodologies but also by sharing tools, data, services and resources where appropriate and duly justified. The collaboration will be based on agreed standards and common elements of technological and statistical infrastructure; \u2014 to implement a dissemination and communication strategy for European statistics which is flexible enough to adapt to emerging technologies, gives guidance in a world of data revolution and serves as a reliable pillar of democracy.\u2019; (b) in objective 1.1, the first indent of the third paragraph is replaced by the following: \u2018\u2014 the introduction of new integrated, effective and fit-for purpose quality assurance mechanism based on the Code of Practice and the ESS Quality Assurance Framework; \u2014 the assessment of compliance with the Code of Practice;\u2019; (c) objective 4.1 is amended as follows: (i) the following paragraph is inserted before the first paragraph: \u2018European citizens should be able to draw easily and without obstacles on European statistics to enable them to use such data for their education and decision-making. That objective will be implemented by enhancing the user-friendliness of European statistics and by facilitating access to data. Special attention should be paid to easy retrievability and convertibility of statistical data for practical use, including through graphs and maps. More citizens should benefit from European statistics, thereby contributing effectively to enhancing the dissemination of statistical information throughout society.\u2019; (ii) the following indent is added to the fifth paragraph: \u2018\u2014 the identification of current and future data requirements to provide multi-purpose and customised end- user products and services.\u2019; (d) in objective 5.1, the following indent is inserted after the third indent of the fourth paragraph: \u2018\u2014 the analysis of needs for new skills related to data science and their integration into training programmes;\u2019; 31.10.2017 L 284/10 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",

Ten years later, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 ( 5 ) in order to ensure that the appropriate tools continued to be available to the inland waterway transport sector and to manage fleet capacity. Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 covers the same subject matter as Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, without repealing it. (4) In accordance with Article 8(6) of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Carriage of Goods and Passengers by Rail and Road ( 6 ), all vehicles meeting the technical standards set out in Council Directive 96/53/EC ( 7 ) have been exempt from any quota or authorisation arrangements since 1 January 2005. Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 8 ), which concerns the distribution of permits for heavy goods vehicles travelling in Switzerland, should therefore be considered to be obsolete. 31.10.2017 L 284/12 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) OJ C 209, 30.6.2017, p. 58.
