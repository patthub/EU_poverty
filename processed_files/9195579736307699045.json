        "5 INTRODUCTION The launch of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research (2007-2013) placed a renewed empha- sis on international cooperation in Science and Technology which is increasingly seen as being at the centre of Union policies. International Cooperation in the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) addresses three interdependent objectives: (cid:115)(cid:0) Supporting European competitiveness through strategic partnerships with third countries 1 in selected fields of science and by engaging the best third country scientists to work in and with Europe; (cid:115)(cid:0) Facilitating contacts with partners in third countries with the aim of providing better access to research carried out elsewhere in the world; (cid:115)(cid:0) Tackling specific challenges that third countries face or having a global character on the basis of mutual interest and mutual benefit (e.g. contributing towards Millennium Development Goals and addressing global climate change, combating biodiversity loss, water and energy scarcity). Significant changes and improvements have taken place in the approach to international cooperation from the 6th Framework Programme (FP6) to FP7, which integrates international research collaboration throughout the Framework Programme by including both geographical and thematic targeting. This new approach provides a contribution towards the Europe 2020 Flagship initiative \u2018Innovation Union\u2019 through global knowledge sourcing and a greater coherence and a more efficient realisation of Europe\u2019s interests. In order to maximise impact, international activities take place across all Specific Programmes of FP7 in a complementary and synergistic manner. The Cooperation Programme enables research cooperation between different global research partners in collaboration with European researchers. The Capacities Programme supports a range of activities to support S&T cooperation policies and strengthen research capacity in the European scientific community and other regions of the world. The People Programme meets the need to foster both incoming and outgoing international mobility of researchers. The Ideas Programme supports excellence in frontier research and enables individual top international research- ers to participate in Europe-led teams. 1 Third countries other than EU Member States and Associated countries to the Framework Programme. 5 ",
        "6 Within the Capacity Programme the main activities of International Cooperation range from the bi- regional coordination of S&T cooperation, including priority setting and the support of the S&T policy dialogue (so-called INCO-NET projects), to the bilateral coordination of S&T policies with those coun- tries that signed (or are in the process of signing) an S&T agreement with the Union (so-called BILAT projects), and finally the coordination of national policies and activities of Member States and Associ- ated States concerning international S&T cooperation (so-called ERA-NET and ERA-NET Plus projects). This booklet presents the activities of all INCO-NET projects which have been selected following the evaluation of the FP7 calls for proposals published in 2006, 2009 and 2010. These projects cover differ- ent regions of the world, i.e. Western Balkan Countries, Mediterranean Partner Countries, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean and Pacific region, Arab Gulf Countries, Latin and Central America. INCO-NET projects aim at establishing coordination platforms, which: (cid:115)(cid:0) Bring together relevant policy makers, researchers, the private sector and other stakeholders of the EU and of third countries that belong to the targeted region, to identify S&T priorities and support the definition of S&T cooperation orientations; (cid:115)(cid:0) Implement awareness and dissemination activities dedicated to the strengthening of the participation of the targeted countries/regions in the Framework Programme, including the support for information points in third countries; (cid:115)(cid:0) Carry out strategic analysis of S&T trends and mapping research capacities in the targeted region, including their links with corresponding EU research counterparts; (cid:115)(cid:0) Systematically monitor and review cooperation activities in order to provide feedback and updating of S&T policies and priorities. They will also seek synergies with instruments of the Member States and of the European Union that are designed to implement cooperation policies and support EU external relations, such as the Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance (IPA), the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation instrument (DCECI), and the European Develop- ment Fund (EDF). These projects will involve research administrations, the research community, industry and other stake- holders from both Member States and Third countries that are expected to provide the Directorate for \u201cInternational Cooperation\u201d and the other Research Directorates with the necessary inputs and evi- dence to support future S&T cooperation policies and activities.

Background and objectives WBC-INCO.NET has become a strategic player in the process of enhancement of scientifi c coopera- tion between the EU, FP7 Associated Countries and the Western Balkan Countries (WBC). The project addresses issues of bi-regional dialogue at the highest stakeholder level with a strong operational implementation basis and aims to produce tangible results and generate a high structural impact. By bringing together existing projects, WBC-INCO.NET exploits synergies, fi lls in gaps with new structural activities and enhances processes through coordination and networking. The creation of the Steering Platform on Research for the Western Balkan Countries continuing the S&T Action Plan between the EU and WBC has already had considerable impact on the progress of S&T rela- tions between both parties. It defi nes itself as a clearing-house for S&T policy ideas and brings together senior S&T offi cials and invited experts, thus having the highest level of political coordination. WBC- INCO.NET has established a consensus with the Steering Platform and provides analytical and opera- tional support for the policy dialogues. The three core objectives of WBC-INCO.NET are: (cid:115)(cid:0) to support the bi-regional dialogue on S&T by interacting in an effi cient division of labour with the Steering Platform on Research, (cid:115)(cid:0) to identify Western Balkan Countries RTD priorities and potential which will be subsequently prepared for eventual take-up in forthcoming work programmes and calls for proposals to be launched under the Cooperation, People and Capacity FP7 Specifi c Programmes, (cid:115)(cid:0) to enhance the participation of researchers from the WBC in European projects of mutual interest and benefi t by implementing relevant capacity building measures on a structural (horizontal) and individual (i.e. research entity) level and by accompanying tailor-made net- working activities. At the same time, WBC-INCO.NET focuses on a preparation of an Action Plan for further WBC coopera- tion in the fi eld of innovation. 9 ",
        "4 2. Dialogue activities WBC-INCO.NET supports the political dialogue between the EU and WBC by providing logistical and analytical evidence-based input to the already existing Steering Platform on Research. It also supports dialogue within the region through \u201cRegional S&T Policy Meetings\u201d aiming to fi nd common solutions to cross-border challenges, to exchange information and best practices on innovation policies. Furthermore, a structured information exchange with several Directorates General of the European Commission has enabled WBC-INCO.NET to exploit the results and integration of S&T in other sub-sec- tors such as education, economy, labour market, regional development. 3. Implementation and dissemination activities WBC-INCO.NET put an emphasis on an identifi cation of S&T needs and potentials of the WBC and their subsequent take-up in the calls for proposals launched under FP7. It also helps to identify research areas of mutual benefi t in an inclusive and comprehensive manner. Implementation activities include seminars, workshops and reviews. Additionally, specifi c actions like brokerage events focus on the facilitation of network-building. To inform audiences on RTD cooperation potential with researchers from Western Balkan Countries and to support partner search, awareness raising sessions are organised during major European S&T conferences. The project\u2019s dissemination activities encompass a continuously updated professional website/on-line database, professionally designed and reviewed printed information, newsletters and a biweekly link digest/eJournal distributed to over 7,000 subscribers. 4. Monitoring and review activities WBC-INCO.NET has monitored the take-up of identifi ed research areas in forthcoming RTD programmes and the participation of WBC researchers in collaborative FP7 projects in terms of realised S&T coopera- tion its impact and has analysed existing cooperation patterns with social network methodologies and exploration of barriers to cooperation by empirical investigations. A milestone in this regard was the development of a toolbox which provides reliable information on the conditions and opportunities of WBC researchers from participating in FP7 and other selected European initiatives and programmes. This allows for evidence-based assessment of the level of involvement of WBC researchers, its structure and articulation as well as a better understanding of major barriers that hamper more active coopera- tion between researchers from WBC and the EU. 10 ",

Background and objectives The SEA-EU-NET project, launched in January 2008, was set up to expand scientifi c collaboration between Europe and Southeast Asia in a more strategic and coherent manner. It increases the quality, quantity and impact of bi-regional Science and Technology (S&T) cooperation between Southeast Asia and Europe. It supports EU policies, the specifi c objectives of FP7 and contributes to building the EU\u2019s S&T pillar for achieving its political, economic and social objectives. The SEA-EU-NET project delivers a wide range of measures to increase SEA-EU cooperation amongst academic, industrial and government stakeholders and it has made considerable progress in: (cid:115)(cid:0) establishing a bi-regional dialogue between EU and ASEAN S&T policy makers at Senior Offi cials level; (cid:115)(cid:0) raising the profi le of FP7 amongst the Southeast Asian research community and increasing the level of Southeast Asian participation in the FP7 programme; (cid:115)(cid:0) completing analytical work on the current state of EU-SEA S&T relations, and developing recommendations to strengthen the relationship and to feed the policy dialogue; (cid:115)(cid:0) extending the dialogue on EU-SEA S&T cooperation to include a wide range of stakeholders; (cid:115)(cid:0) linking results to other existing ERA-, INCO-NET, and thematic EU-FP projects thus also facili- tating the development of a coherent European-level approach towards international S&T cooperation. 2. Dialogue activities The annual meeting \u201cEU-ASEAN Bi-Regional S&T Policy Dialogue Platform\u201d is a forum for exchange and drafting policy recommendations. The meetings alternate between South-East Asian and European venues and are an opportunity to engage with a larger audience of policy makers, scientists and NGO representatives in a discussion on S&T collaboration between the regions. About 150 policy makers, scientists and international organizations representatives from both Southeast Asia and Europe attend. 13 ",
        "4 3. Dissemination activities The project informs stakeholders from science, industries and policy makers about opportunities for an enhanced S&T cooperation and the respective framework. It also fosters active networking among the science communities and R&D oriented, innovative industries in the Member States, Associated States and the SEA partner countries using various dissemination strategies and existing tools, platforms, and services (e.g. NCP-network, ASEAN-COST, CORDIS-Website, etc.) The project organises a series of national, regional and bi-regional conferences to address various groups of stakeholders: (cid:115)(cid:0) National and regional Information Days in the SEA on the 7th FP in close cooperation with the respective national stakeholders (governments, Science organisations and Info-points); (cid:115)(cid:0) Specifi c information sessions on the S&T potential of SEA in EU conferences; (cid:115)(cid:0) Regional conferences in specifi c research areas in the SEA addressing future cooperation with the EU; (cid:115)(cid:0) Selected targeted political events to raise awareness on the opportunities and challenges of a closer bi-regional cooperation, addressed to political stakeholders at national, regional and Community level. SEA-EU-NET has also created a new EU-SEA internet portal, devoted to the cooperation with the SEA region, also functioning as a meta-portal as future single access point: www.sea-eu.net 4. Monitoring and review activities One major objective is to provide scientifi c evidence to the bi-regional policy dialogue platforms and to spur cooperation mechanisms between the EU and the concerned countries at technical expert level. Ongoing cooperation activities in S&T will be identifi ed, screened, systematised and reviewed. Monitoring and review activities are aimed at: (cid:115)(cid:0) collecting, processing and facilitating the access and exchange of S&T information between the two regions; (cid:115)(cid:0) supporting the alignment of S&T statistics in order to follow the dynamics of the S&T systems; (cid:115)(cid:0) establishing a coherent mapping of the EU partner\u2019s unilateral initiatives and bi-lateral pro- grammes with SEA; (cid:115)(cid:0) clustering the identifi ed programmes and feature high-potential institutions in SEA in the mapping database; (cid:115)(cid:0) identifying convergences and diversities of the cooperation programmes; (cid:115)(cid:0) providing recommendations on improving S&T collaboration between the EU and SEA. The SEA-EU-NET Steering Committee is responsible for reviewing the project and providing advice. It gauges the impact of the Consortium\u2019s actions and ensures complementarities at policy and research institutions level.

Background and objectives EULARINET aims at strengthening bi-regional dialogue on S&T between EU Member States, Associated States and Latin American Partner Countries (LAPC) contributing to a three-fold objective: (cid:115)(cid:0) promoting the joint identification, establishment, implementation and monitoring of priorities of mutual interest and benefit in future work programmes across the Specific Programmes of FP7; (cid:115)(cid:0) jointly supporting the defi nition of S&T cooperation policies; (cid:115)(cid:0) supporting and stimulating the participation of LAPC in FP7. 2. Dialogue activities EULARINET will establish a network between European and Latin American stakeholders to identify priori- ties of mutual interest and benefi t for both regions. Bilateral sub-regional dialogues will be organised annually in the three sub-regions of: Mexico and Central America; Andean countries and Chile; and the Mercosur (Southern Common Market) countries, involving stakeholders from policymaking, science and industry communities. A co-leadership between LAPC and EU partners will ensure balanced responsibility and participation in the activities. High-level bi-regional meetings open to all EU and LA countries are planned during the duration of the project. The consortium will actively address other Member States, Associated Countries and LAPC that are currently not members of the EULARINET consortium, to participate and contribute, thus increasing the impact of the dialogue. These high-level meetings will highlight and refl ect the results from the sub-regional meetings on the identifi cation of common topics for FP7 thematic areas. EULARINET will: (cid:115)(cid:0) structure the communication channels by off ering ad-hoc fora for bi-regional dialogue on S&T policy between LA and the EU, for the exchange of views and information on national and bilater- al S&T policies relevant for bi-regional S&T cooperation, and for a comprehensive and structured exchange with LAPC regarding the research activities of the European Commission (EC); (cid:115)(cid:0) promote regional integration; (cid:115)(cid:0) address global issues of common interest, and develop scenarios and concrete recommendations for actions, including in support to the EU-Latin American and Caribbean Joint Initiative for Research and Innovation and on S&T activities addressing topics related to the EU Framework Programme. Links with broader EU S&T policies will contribute to social and economic development and stimulate an environment for transnational scientifi c cooperation of individual scientists and institutions. 17 ",
        "4 3. Implementation and dissemination activities A proactive dissemination strategy will be implemented in order to raise awareness for the potential of S&T in LA, inform interested stakeholders from science, industries and policymaking about opportuni- ties for enhanced S&T cooperation within FP7, and to foster active networking. This networking will address the science communities and innovative industries in Member States, Associated Countries and LAPC. Here, synergies with existing programmes from the EC will be widely explored. Specifi c and horizontal awareness-raising and information dissemination events will be carried out through a series of national, regional and bi-regional conferences, as well as seminars and workshops on S&T cooperation opportunities. These will address various groups of stakeholders from the scientifi c, industrial and policy-making communities. Selected targeted political events, addressed to political stakeholders on national, regional and EU level, will be targeted so as to raise awareness on the opportunities and challenges of a closer bi-regional cooperation between the EU and LA. The following outputs are foreseen: (cid:115)(cid:0) a website with public and private areas with advanced functionalities to support collaborative dialogues among the partners and that will link to other relevant websites; (cid:115)(cid:0) a new EU-LA internet portal, as a future single point of access, building on existing websites and electronic information provided by previous and ongoing projects on EU-LA S&T cooperation; (cid:115)(cid:0) publications to disseminate the major EULARINET activities, fi ndings and events to external stakeholders. 4. Monitoring and review activities Monitoring will be focused on past and ongoing cooperation activities, and will provide a complete view of the modalities and intensity of the bi-regional cooperation. Main activities will involve: (cid:115)(cid:0) developing questionnaires, interview schemes, S&T indicators and benchmarking criteria; (cid:115)(cid:0) working jointly and taking into account the results and working methods of ongoing initia- tives (CYTED, EULANEST, LAC-ACCESS); (cid:115)(cid:0) mapping the activities through an online database for the results and statistical data of all tasks as a \u2018work-in-progress\u2019 S&T observatory; (cid:115)(cid:0) developing specifi c criteria for assessing EU-LAC FP6/FP7 cooperation activities. 18 ",

        "3 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT 1. Background and objectives The principal objective of EU cooperation in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) region is to devel- op an increasingly close relationship, going to gradual economic integration, and to a deepening political cooperation. The EECA countries have signifi cant potential both in terms of their strong academic community and of worldwide leading S&T institutes in a variety of scientifi c disciplines. To make better use of each others academic strengths, to share respective resources and to prepare the ground for a joint transfer of aca- demic results to markets, there is a strong interest in enhancing S&T cooperation. Therefore the IncoNet EECA project aims at: (cid:115)(cid:0) Supporting bi-regional EU \u2013 EECA S&T policy dialogue involving stakeholders from policy making, science community and industry. The dialogue addresses S&T potentials, policy goals and demands in order to defi ne common priorities and to develop joint scenarios and implementation strategies. (cid:115)(cid:0) Carrying out activities aiming at an increased participation of researchers from EECA coun- tries in FP7. (cid:115)(cid:0) Implementing a series of analyses feeding the policy dialogue and increasing its effi ciency, monitoring the project\u2019s own activities with emphasis on their sustainability and implement- ing coherent dissemination activities in order to increase its visibility and impact. 2. Dialogue activities The policy dialogue process has been developed through implementing an initial phase of \u201cPolicy Stake- holder Conferences\u201d organized in July 2009 and April 2010. A series of additional bi-regional stakeholder conferences will be arranged, addressing key issues of the S&T cooperation framework with Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries including specifi cities of the joint policy of the Four Common Spaces with Russia. The stakeholder conferences help to share information on policy objectives and best practice in EU-EECA S&T cooperation (instruments and impact), to identify present challenges and barriers and to pave the way for more coherence and effi ciency of bilateral and multilateral approaches. They include targeted discussions at a dual level (i.e. political stakeholders and the scientifi c community) in order to optimise the bi-regional cooperation framework set by policy makers. 21 ",
        "4 Particular priority is given to: (cid:115)(cid:0) Evaluation and benchmarking practices of S&T institutions and programmes. (cid:115)(cid:0) Financial schemes for joint activities. (cid:115)(cid:0) Instruments for collaboration at regional level (e.g. South Caucasus, Central Asia). (cid:115)(cid:0) Mutual learning and priority setting. 3. Implementation and dissemination activities The implementation activities of the project include actions that would initiate and sustain the policy dialogue (e.g. content and logistics for the policy stakeholders\u2019 conferences or preparatory workshops to feed the conferences), as well as a broad spectrum of activities aiming at: (cid:115)(cid:0) An increased participation of researchers from EECA in FP7 (e.g. information days and brokerage events, identifi cation of barriers, training, support and networking of NCPs/NIPs, formulation of proposals for Specifi c International Cooperation Activities (SICAs) in the FP7 Themes, etc.). (cid:115)(cid:0) The analysis of key issues and the preparation of reports that will feed the policy dialogue including the improvement of S&T indicators, the review of cooperation patterns, the mapping of outstanding research institutes and the review of national policies towards global challenges. A series of dissemination activities will provide the visibility of the project for the scientifi c community, policy makers and stakeholders. Among these activities are: (cid:115)(cid:0) The setting up of a Central Information Offi ce, complemented by a web portal and website, raising awareness of the S&T potential in the EECA, informing interested stakeholders about opportunities for an enhanced S&T cooperation and fostering networking among the science communities and R&D oriented innovative industries.

Background and objectives The countries of Central Asia and South Caucasus (CA/SC) display a signifi cant potential in terms of research and innovation. As a consequence, a strong bi-regional EU-CASC interest in enhancing S&T cooperation has been developed with the aim to share strengths and resources in order to prepare the ground for a joint transfer of academic results to national, regional and worldwide markets. With the objectives to support and facilitate the bi-regional EU \u2013 CA/SC S&T policy dialogue, to address the coordination with other EU instruments and to strengthen participation in FP7, the IncoNet CA/ SC targets all the Central Asian and South Caucasus countries, namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, plus Moldova. The project aims to complement and deepen in the two sub-regions the activities of the ongoing IncoNet EECA 1 project, with particular emphasis on Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan that were partially addressed so far. At the same time, by avoiding duplications and by extending the synergies between the two projects which are geographically overlapping, their impact will be maximized. 2. Implementation and dissemination activities The main activities of the project include: (cid:115)(cid:0) Policy dialogue: i) the organisation of missions in every targeted country in order to contact policy makers and other stakeholders, to identify mutual interests and to pave the way for an enhanced participation in the European Research Area and FP7, ii) the organization of two Stakeholders\u2019 Conferences to formulate proposals for an enhanced cooperation, to promote mutual learning among policy makers, to identify barriers, etc. 1 S&T International Cooperation Network for Eastern European and Central Asian countries, www.inco-eeca.net 25 ",
        "4 In parallel, specifi c attention will be given to other EU policies such as the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument (ENPI) and the Development and Cooperation Instrument (DCI), for their better coor- dination with the S&T policy. (cid:115)(cid:0) Support to information multipliers (e.g. training sessions to NCP/NIP structures) and to the scientifi c community (Info Days in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, grants for the par- ticipation of scientists in Brokerage Events in the EU, etc.). (cid:115)(cid:0) Studies on Innovation policies and structures in CA/SC, on successful participations in FP6 and FP7 in order to identify critical factors, as well as extension of studies implemented under the IncoNet EECA, inter alia: mapping of key institutes, monitoring and review of cooperation patterns, S&T indicators and ways to improve them, etc. The aim of these studies is to feed the policy dialogue. (cid:115)(cid:0) Communication and dissemination activities: in addition to the creation of a web site and a communication platform ( www.inco-casc.net ), particular eff ort will be devoted to the strengthening of the coverage of KG, TJ, TM by the already established Central Information Offi ce and its network of Regional and Local Correspondents, in order to further increase the volume and quality of the information on the \u2018incrEAST\u2019 Web Portal ( www.increast.eu ). 3. Expected impact The activities included in the IncoNet CA/SC project will have a direct positive impact on the coopera- tion with the targeted countries, at both policy making and operational/ implementation levels. More specifi cally, at the policy making level, the IncoNet CA/SC is expected to: i) increase the knowledge on the S&T landscape and the S&T policies in the target regions and Moldova; ii) raise awareness and support for the bi-regional Policy Dialogue process in the targeted coun- tries; and iii) have a signifi cant impact on the development of synergies among diff erent EU policies. At the operational/implementation level the IncoNet CA/SC is expected to increase participation in FP7, through specifi c horizontal (e.g. training of NCPs) and thematic activities (e.g. Information Days) that will enhance the information dissemination and assistance, and create awareness of the opportunities for enhanced cooperation among researchers. 26 ",

CAAST-Net facilitates EU-Africa stakeholders\u2019 dialogue on S&T and supports research partnerships through identifying and prioritising researchable topics of mutual interest and through networking and linking outputs to users. CAAST-Net harnesses cooperation to address specifi c local and regional problems in Africa and common problems of a global nature. Additionally CAAST-Net\u2019s actions to foster EU-Africa cooperation and dialogue off er a strategic dimension to regions\u2019 capacity for implementa- tion of priority continental S&T programmes. It monitors the trends of EU-Africa cooperation under the Framework Programme and seeks to strengthen the participation of African countries through raising awareness, brokering partnerships and off ering training. 2. Policy dialogue activities An important objective of CAAST-Net is to support and add value to S&T cooperation policy dialogue between Africa and Europe. The activities include bi-regional senior stakeholder conferences on S&T cooperation, informal bi-regional discussion forums and facilitated dialogues between Africa\u2019s regional economic communities (REC) and interested EU parties. These activities may be also brought to the service of a new senior Africa-EU platform when needed. In such activities CAAST-Net partners seek the agreement and participation of mandated continental authorities to ensure maximum synergy with offi cial processes. 45 ",
        "4 3. Research prioritisation and partnerships CAAST-Net promotes EU-Africa S&T research cooperation partnerships also through collaboration with other INCO-NETs. By bringing together African and European experts from specifi c thematic domains, CAAST-Net partners elaborate proposals recommended for consideration within the context of future FP work programmes. In line with CAAST-Net\u2019s strategic focus on support to RECs, future expert work- shops will pay attention to regionalised priorities drawn from Africa\u2019s continental action plans. Since CAAST-Net activities place emphasis on enhancing EU-Africa cooperation under the EU framework pro- gramme, a fruitful cooperation between CAAST-Net and the new ERA-NET for Africa (ERAfrica) is much anticipated. 4. Awareness raising, dissemination and knowledge management CAAST-Net\u2019s partners off er support and information to enhance Africa\u2019s FP participation. A group of experienced partners (e.g. VINNOVA in Sweden and TUBITAK in Turkey) has been established involved in a package of awareness rising activities, that are planned and executed as collaborative events with existing EC platforms such as the \u2018INCONTACT One World\u2019 network of INCO NCPs. Implementation of CAAST-Net\u2019s primary activities relies on dialogue-based events for communication and dissemination. Therefore CAAST-Net\u2019s web-based Community Knowledge Management Platform has been created, acting as the hub of dissemination, communication and awareness raising activities. 5. Analysis, monitoring and review activities CAAST-Net conducts analyses that examine the themes and instruments of S&T cooperation and check whether they accomplished the goals. A part of the analysis is also identifi cation of the most relevant barriers to the participation of African countries in European research programmes. Analyses of thematic diversity of Europe-Africa collaboration contribute to the formulation of new research priorities and examine reasons for possible disconnections between Africa\u2019s articulated prior- ity S&T issues and Europe-Africa S&T collaboration and policy dialogue. 46 ",

        "3 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT 1. Background and objectives Mediterranean Innovation and Research Coordination Action (MIRA) is a dialogue and discussion platform which encourages scientific and technological collaboration between the Mediterranean Partner Countries and the European Countries, especially through 7th Framework Programme (7FP). MIRA is a powerful tool, a bridge between policy and research. The countries involved in MIRA are: (1) Algeria, (2) Bosnia Herzegovina,(3) Cyprus, (4) Egypt, (5) France, (6) Germany, (7) Greece,(8) Ita- ly, (9) Israel, (10) Jordan, (11) Lebanon, (12) Malta, (13) Montenegro, (14) Morocco,(15) Palestinian- administered areas, (16) Portugal, (17) Spain, (18) Turkey, (19) Tunisia, (20) United Kingdom. A working group deriving from MIRA is EMIS - the Euro Mediterranean Innovation Space. It focuses on the analysis of knowledge transfer between research and industry, which is a common problem in the entire Mediterranean area, and a 2. Dialogue activities MIRA, most importantly, contributes to the research community by identifying scientifi c priority topics, monitoring FP7 thematic priorities, sharing and analysing results through regional application within a global context. In terms of Innovation policies, MIRA contributes to mobilize and connect diff erent stakeholders to develop a more intelligent and competitive Euro-Med Innovation Space, by organizing the follow- ing activities: (1) Technology Transfer seminars (focussing on the academic sector), (2) promotion of a Mediterranean Metrology Centres Network and (3) Organisation of FORA. These FORA provide an opti- mum environment to make scientifi c and business communities exchange on their expertise, off ers and needs. They are organised in close cooperation with intermediate structures and initiatives dealing with innovation (IPR experts, Technological Parks administrators, services providers), including national administrations and multi-national actors such as the European Investment Bank. Based on the fi eld experience, MIRA also serve to gather opinions and convey messages from the sci- entifi c community to the national authorities by formulating recommendations on ways of improving administrative issues. An other role of MIRA is to support the activities of the Union for Mediterranean and European Neigh- bourhood Partnership Instruments (ENPI) that need the identifi cation and development of a Research agenda in support of its objectives. For example, MIRA mobilizes an Expert Working Group in charge of elaborating a scientifi c agenda in support to the Horizon 2020 Programme for the decontamination of the Mediterranean Sea. The outcomes of all these activities feed the S&T policy dialogue conduced within the \u201cMonitoring Com- mittee for Euro-Mediterranean S&T Cooperation\u201d (MoCo), composed of senior offi cials of the S&T Minis- tries of the EU and Mediterranean Countries Governments. 49 ",
        "4 3. Implementation and dissemination activities MIRA supports the participation of the Mediterranean Partner Countries (MPCs) in the Framework Pro- gramme through capacity building and networking activities: (cid:115)(cid:0) Setting regional networks such as the networking of research institutions or the networking of Technology Transfer Units. (cid:115)(cid:0) Organizing Brokerage Events to promote opportunities of collaboration between scientists and entrepreneurs. (cid:115)(cid:0) Increasing the capacities of MPCs with trainings to build common knowledge and compe- tences for administrators, regulators and managers. (cid:115)(cid:0) Supporting the regional network of National Contact Points (or FP7 Contact points) estab- lished six years ago to increase awareness on FP7 opportunities and other programmes and policies dedicated to support the RTD collaboration between Europe and the MPCs, and between the MPC. Project communication is provided by an Internet-based forum and a website: www.miraproject.eu 4. Monitoring and review activities One of the main objectives of MIRA is the creation of an Observatory of the EU-MPC S&T cooperation to provide the necessary feedback to the MoCo on the progress and impact of the EU-MPCs S&T coopera- tion since the 2007 Cairo Declaration. The observatory also aims to produce standard S&T indicators to analyse innovation systems, monitor bibliometric production and assess the international scientifi c cooperation in the Mediterranean region. MIRA reports to MoCo on a regular basis by presenting data produced by the observatory which in return enables policy makers to incorporate these and act upon informed decisions. MIRA also proposes a methodology for the setting of a permanent Observatory beyond the life of the project, through a network of MPC experts to monitor ST&I cooperation and policies in the Mediterra- nean region. The \u201cWhite Paper on strategic indicators for the measurement and impact of international scientifi c cooperation and collaborations in the Mediterranean region\u201d is, in this sense, a good example of the outcomes provided by the MIRA consortium. 50 ",
