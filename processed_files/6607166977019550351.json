        "5 Foreword Supporting SMEs and helping them to enhance their competitiveness is one of the key elements of a successful Regional Development Policy and remains a priority also for the next funding period. Regional competitiveness and the success of smart specialisation strategies depend heavily on the 23 million SMEs all over Europe and their ability to create wealth and high quality jobs. This guidebook is intended to serve as a \u00abcook-book\u00bb on how to design, apply for and implement concrete projects in support of SMEs from the EU Structural Funds. It bases itself very much on previous initiatives in this area and is intended to be as hands-on as possible for all those designing a concrete project. It also provides concrete examples of good practice. We recommend this Guide to policy makers, stakeholders and managing authorities especially at regional level, hoping it will inspire concrete measures to further trigger the successful use of Structural Funds in support of SME-friendly policies. The elaboration of this guidebook came as a response to the observed fact that potential project holders in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurship have often fragmented knowledge on the funding possibilities that may exist in the framework of structural funds.

        "99 Long-standing supporters of SMEs, Structu- ral Funds have now become a major instru- ment in achieving the Europe 2020 objectives for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Through shared management and especially the involvement of regional stakeholders in the definition and implementation of opera- tional programmes, Structural Funds are most adapted to the local context in which small and medium-sized enterprises develop. The 2014-2020 programming period will further focus on the role of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurship in revitalising the economy and boosting public prosperity. It is therefore crucial for information to be largely diffused to allow for regional initiatives aimed at supporting SMEs and entrepreneurship to be financed. This will in turn foster an environment in which entrepreneurs and family businesses can thrive and entrepreneurship is rewarded. This guidebook will first of all examine the context of cohesion policy, its objectives and financial tools. It will then address the issue of funds management and will end by giving practical advice on how to apply for funding. A series of good practices are presented, and provide vivid illustrations of what can be achieved in the field of SMEs and entrepreneurship supporting schemes through Structural Funds financing.

        "11 The EU Cohesion Policy: aims, objectives and tools The EU Cohesion Policy or Regional Policy is first of all an investment policy aimed at reduc- ing economic, social and territorial disparities between regions in Europe. Its budget is the second after that of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and directly targets projects on the ground. It supports job creation, competitiveness, eco- nomic growth, improved quality of life and sus- tainable development. These investments sup- port the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy. Supporting the creation and growth of busi- nesses, are key ways by which cohesion policy helps to boost regional economies. 1.1 The 2007-2013 framework Although the current funding period is coming to an end, it is still possible to finance SMEs and entrepreneurship policies under this frame- work. SMEs, the backbone of the European economy, are at the heart of regional policy which supports projects in a wide range of areas from research to energy and support for enterprises. Cohesion policy is organised around three objec- tives: Convergence \u2013 solidarity with less developed regions Regional Competitiveness and Employment \u2013 increasing competitiveness and making regions more attractive for businesses and investors European Territorial Cooperation \u2013 encourag- ing cooperation across borders 99 regions receive funding under the Conver- gence objective. These are the regions with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita under 75% of the EU average as well as regions that used to be under this threshold before the 2004 and 2007 enlargements. The latter receive transitional \u00ab Phasing out \u00bb support until 2013 ",
        "12 1. For detailed information on the categories of regions see the map: ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/atlas2007/index_en.htm 2. EU Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 legislative proposals: ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/what/future/proposals_2014_2020_en.cfm 3. The so-called CSF Funds are: The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the future European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) The remaining 172 regions are eligible for fund- ing under the Regional Competitiveness and Em- ployment objective. Those who used to be cov- ered under the convergence criteria but are now above the 75% threshold even within the EU-15 are receiving extra \u00abphasing-in\u00bb support 1 . The European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) objec- tive concerns all regions. 1.2 The upcoming Cohesion Policy (2014-2020) The 2014-2020 Cohesion Policy 2 will concen- trate funding on a smaller number of priorities in line with the Europe 2020 Strategy, focus more on results and increase the use of condi- tionalities. SMEs are on top of the agenda for smart sustainable and inclusive growth. The Common Strategic Framework (CSF) will define key actions to address EU priorities, pro- vide guidance on programming applicable to all Funds 3 , and promote a better coordination of the various EU structural instruments. The Europe 2020 Strategy sets out Europe\u2019s Objectives from 2010 to 2020 to achieve smart sustainable and inclusive growth. Europe 2020: an overview HEADLINE TARGETS - Raise the employment rate of the population aged 20-64 from the current 69% to at least 75%. - Achieve the target of investing 3% of GDP in R&D in particular by improving the conditions for R&D investment by the private sector, and develop a new indicator to track innovation. - Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels or by 30% if the conditions are right, increase the share of renewable energy in our final energy consumption to 20%, and achieve a 20% increase in energy efficiency. - Reduce the number of Europeans living below national poverty lines by 25%, lifting 20 million people out of poverty. SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION EU flagship initiative \"Innovation Union\" to improve framework conditions and access to finance for research and innovation so as to strengthen the innovation chain and boost levels of investment throughout the Union. CLIMATE, ENERGY AND MOBILITY EU flagship initiative \"Resource efficient Europe\" to help decouple economic growth from the use of resources, by decarbonising our economy, increasing the use of renewable sources, modernising our transport sector and promoting energy efficiency. EMPLOYMENT AND SKILLS EU flagship initiative \"An agenda for new skills and jobs\" to modernise labour markets by facilitating labour mobility and the development of skills throughout the lifecycle with a view to increase labour participation and better match labour supply and demand. EDUCATION EU flagship initiative \"Youth on the move\" to enhance the performance of education systems and to reinforce the international attractiveness of Europe\u2019s higher education. COMPETITIVENESS EU flagship initiative \"An industrial policy for the globalisation era\" to improve the business environment especially for SMEs, and to support the development of a strong and sustainable industrial base able to compete globally. FIGHTING POVERTY EU flagship initiative \"European plat- form against poverty\" to ensure social and territorial cohesion such that the benefits of growth and jobs are widely shared and people experiencing pover- ty and sodal exclusion are enabled to live in dgnity and take an active part in society. DIGITAL SOCIETY EU flagship initiative \"A digital agenda for Europe\" to speed up the roll-out of high-speed internet and reap the benefits of a digital single market for households and firms. For project initiators it is crucial to refer to the broader Europe 2020 objectives in the application in order to ensure optimum adequacy. The classification of regions will be orga- nised in three categories on the basis of their GDP per capita in relation to the EU27 average: less developed regions, which have less than 75% GDP per capita, transition regions that have between 75% and 90% GDP per capita and more developed regions, which have above 90% GDP per capita. The partnership principle and code of con- duct is a proposal to create a \u201cEuropean code of conduct\u201d. This will lay down objectives and ",
        "13 criteria to support the implementation of part- nership and to facilitate the sharing of infor- mation, experience, results and good practices among Member States. The menu of 11 thematic objectives to be translated into key actions for each fund in particular include a specific line on the com- petitiveness of SMEs. Most other thematic objectives can have SME or entrepreneurship components: the shift towards a low-carbon economy may for instance be used to finance projects aimed at improving energy efficiency or stimulating the use of renewable energies within SMEs. The thematic objectives further include research and innovation, information and communication technologies (ICT) and education, skills and lifelong learning, all of which are relevant in the perspective of SME and entrepreneurship-oriented policies. Partnership agreements will have to be draft- ed by all Member States (one per country). This contract will have to be drafted in cooperation with regional authorities and negotiated with the European Commission (EC). It will esta- blish the commitments of partners at national and regional level and the EC. These will be linked both to the Europe 2020 strategy and the National Reform Programmes. The part- nership agreements will include an integra- ted territorial development strategy to be supported by all the CSF funds, a list of all Operational Programmes, objectives based on indicators, strategic investments and conditionalities, as well as reporting commit- ments. The partnership agreements will more- over define structures to coordinate, exploit complementarities between CSF funds and other different EU instruments (i.e. Connecting Europe Facility, COSME, Horizon 2020 or other programmes\u2026) and avoid duplication of effort. The partners will participate in the monitoring committees for programmes. Integrated programming is enhanced by the introduction of common eligibility and finan- cial rules and the introduction of multi-fund programmes for the ERDF, ESF and Cohesion Fund as an option. An integrated approach to community-led local development based on the LEADER approach for rural development will also facilitate the implementation of local development strategies by community groups, including local authorities, non-governmental- organisations (NGOs) and economic and social partners. Financial instruments will be used increasingly as a more efficient alternative or in a comple- mentary way with traditional grants. Subject to feasibility, financial instruments can be appli- ed to the full bandwidth of policy objectives reflected in programmes, in order to deliver instruments in projects that demonstrate appropriate repayment capacity in situations of market imperfection. They can be deployed by Member States and managing authori- ties either as tailor-made instruments or on the basis of pre-defined models for national or regional instruments that allow for efficient roll-out of operations in line with standard terms and conditions proposed by the Commis- sion. Managing authorities may also contribute to financial instruments set up at EU level, with resources that will be ring-fenced for invest- ments in line with the programmes concerned. 1.3 The tools of the EU Cohesion Policy The EU regional policy is financed by three main funds, the European Regional Develop- ment Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), both referred to as \u201cStructural Funds\u201d and the Cohesion Fund (CF). These funds are based on the principles of co-financing and shared management. EU financial support always runs alongside national public or priva- te financing. Depending on a number of socio- economic factors, the co-financing may vary between 50% and 85% of the total cost of interventions. The guidelines for ERDF and ESF actions are designed at European level, where- as implementation on the ground is managed by the relevant national or regional authorities in each Member State. ",

Proposal for a regulation of the EP and of the Council on specific provisions concerning the European Regional Development Fund and the Investment for growth and jobs goal COM (2011) 614 final, Chapter I, Article 3 6. ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/projects/stories/index_en.cfm 1.3.1 The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) The ERDF supports the development and structural adjustment of regional economies, including the conversion of declining indus- trial regions. Funds can either be allocated as grants or financial instruments. The budget for the current period 2007-2013 is \u20ac201 billion out of a total budget of \u20ac347 billion which represents 58% of the total fund- ing in Structural Funds. The fund is managed by the Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO). In the new programming period 2014-2020 , the ERDF contributes to all thematic objectives, while establishing a number of investment priorities 4 . In the context of SME and entrepre- neurship policies the following thematic objec- tives are of particular interest: \u2022 objective n\u00b01: strengthening research, tech- nological development and innovation \u2022 objective n\u00b02: enhancing access to and use and quality of Information and Communi- cation Technologies (ICTs) \u2022 objective n\u00b03: enhancing the competitive- ness of SMEs \u2022 objective n\u00b08: promoting employment and supporting labour mobility \u2022 objective n\u00b09: promoting social inclusion and combating poverty The scope of support from ERDF 5 specifically includes: \u2022 productive investment, which contributes to creating and safeguarding sustainable jobs, through direct aid to investment in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); \u2022 development of endogenous potential by supporting regional and local development and research and innovation. The ERDF does NOT, however, support the de- commissioning of nuclear power stations, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in in- stallations falling under directive 2003/87/EC, the manufacturing, processing and marketing of tobacco and tobacco products, and under- takings in difficulties as defined under Union state aid rules. Another key feature of the legislation is the in- creasing importance of financial instruments. Financial instruments can be loans, guaran- tees, etc. Concretely, what can be financed by the ERDF? \u2022 Research and innovation infrastructure (R&I), R&I excellence, business R&I in- vestment, product and service develop- ment, technology transfer, social inno- vation and public service applications, demand stimulation, networking, clus- ters and open innovation through smart specialisation; technological and ap- plied research, pilot lines, early product validation actions, advanced manufac- turing capabilities and first production in Key Enabling Technologies, diffusion of general purpose technologies \u2022 Development of ICT products and ser- vices, e-commerce; ICT applications for e-government, e-learning, e-inclusion and e-health; \u2022 Entrepreneurship, economic exploita- tion of new ideas and creation of new firms; new business models for SMEs, in particular for internationalisation; \u2022 Energy efficiency and renewable energy use in SMEs; \u2022 Development of business incubators and investment support for self-employment and business creation; \u2022 Support for physical and economic re- generation of deprived urban and rural communities; support for social enter- prises.

See 1.2. \u201cThe upcoming programming period\u201d (2014-2020) 1.3.2 The European Social Fund (ESF) The European Social Fund (ESF) aims to reduce differences in prosperity and living standards across EU Member States and regions. It is de- voted to promoting employment in the EU and helps Member States make Europe\u2019s workforce and companies better equipped to face new, global challenges. The ESF Budget in the current period (2007- 2013) is \u20ac76 billion or 22% of total structural funds. It is managed by the Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs & Inclusion (DG Employment). The ESF supports the design of a more pro- ductive work organisation as well as life-long learning strategies. The fund also promotes access to employment for job seekers, the un- employed, women and migrants thus favour- ing social integration of disadvantaged people and fighting discrimination in the job market. It aims at strengthening human capital by re- forming education systems and setting up a network of teaching establishments. All regions can use the ESF; however the larg- est allocation goes to less developed regions. In the new programming period 2014-2020, the ESF will be targeted on four thematic objec- tives 7 , the first three being directly linked with SME and entrepreneurship policies: \u2022 objective n\u00b0 8: Promoting employment and supporting labour mobility \u2022 objective n\u00b09: Promoting social inclusion and combating poverty \u2022 objective n\u00b010: Investing in education, skills and life-long learning \u2022 objective n\u00b011: Enhancing institutional capa- city and efficient public administration Partnerships are to be strengthened and social partners and NGOs will be encouraged to partici- pate in ESF investments. An increased co-financing rate for dedicated priority axes will moreover en- courage social innovation and transnational coop- eration. As for the ERDF, the use of financial instru- ments will increase significantly. What does the ESF support? \u2022 Local employment initiatives, labour mo- bility; sustainable integration of young people, entrepreneurship and business creation (grants, loans...); gender equa- lity; adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs, transnational labour mobility (trainings abroad); \u2022 Reduction of early school-leaving and promotion of equal access to good- quality education; quality, efficiency and openness education; lifelong learning; \u2022 Integration and fight against discrimina- tion; the social economy and social en- terprises; Community-led local develop- ment strategies; \u2022 Capacity building for stakeholders deli- vering employment, education and social policies. 1.3.3 Other funds \u2022 The Cohesion Fund is reserved to Member States whose Gross National Income (GNI) per capita is below 90% of the EU average. In the current period all 12 new Member States and Portugal and Greece are eligible (Spain is phasing out). The Cohesion Fund is centrally distributed and managed at Mem- ber State level. It has a budget of \u20ac70 bil- lion. It finances trans-European transport networks as well as projects in the field of environment, energy and transport (energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, developing rail trans- port, supporting inter-modality, strengthening public transport, etc.) This fund is less relevant for entrepreneurship and SME policies because it mainly finances infrastructure. Although not part of the Cohesion Policy, the two following funds belong to the so-called \u201cCSF funds\u201d 8 and may offer interesting oppor- tunities for project developers in the field of SME and entrepreneurship in rural and mari- time regions.

Proposal for a new regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the common fisheries policy COM(2011) 425 \u2022 The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) finances the rural development programmes of Member States. It has a 4-axes structure: - improved competitiveness for farming and forestry - protection of the environment and the countryside - a better quality of life and diversification of the rural economy. - LEADER, a methodology introducing funding opportunities for locally based approaches to rural development. In total, the EAFRD support for the program- ming period 2007-2013 amounts to \u20ac96.2 billion. It is managed by the Directorate Gen- eral for Agriculture and Rural Development (DG AGRI). The EAFRD offers a wide range of funding possibilities for entrepreneurs and companies operating in its fields of intervention. This in- cludes measures to meet the challenges of structural change and increased competition in globalised food markets, the preservation of biodiversity and valuable landscapes, sus- tainable water management, the mitigation of climate change and renewable energy, invest- ments and innovation in the rural economy and communities. In the new programming period 2014-2020 , the regulation 9 includes rules on the prepara- tion, approval and revision of programmes that largely follow current rules, and opens up the possibility for sub-programmes (e.g. young farmers, small farmers, mountain areas, short supply chains) that benefit from higher aid in- tensities. Get inspired! The rural development database of Euro- pean Network for Rural Development (ENRD) presents a variety of rural development projects 10 . \u2022 The European Fisheries Fund (EFF) 11 aims to support the common fisheries policy. It provides 5 priorities: - measures to adapt the EU fishing fleet - aquaculture, inland fishing, processing and marketing - collective action - sustainable development of fishing areas - technical assistance The EFF has a budget of \u20ac4.3 billion for 2007- 2013. It is managed by the Directorate General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG MARE). Funding is available for all sectors of the in- dustry. Particular attention is given to fishing communities most affected by recent changes in the industry through support for the diversi- fication and strengthening of economic devel- opment. In the new programming period 2014-2020 , the Commission proposed the creation of a new fund replacing the current EFF: European Mari- time and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) 12 . The following priorities may be of particular interest for SMEs and entrepreneurs active in this field: Making fishing profitable, Support for small-scale fishe- ries, Developing sustainable aquaculture, Im- proving scientific knowledge. 1.3.4 Projects involving stakeholders across borders 1.3.4.1 European Territorial Cooperation The European Territorial Co-operation (ETC) Objective is aimed at the abolition of physical, administrative and regulatory obstacles to co- hesion as well as to reduce the \u2018border effect\u2019 between territories and regions in order to en- able them to address their shared challenges together. The European Territorial Co-operation objective is financed by the European Regional Develop- ment Fund (ERDF). Its total budget is currently: \u20ac8, 7 billion; 2, 5% of total budget.

There are three strands within ETC: \u2022 Cross-border cooperation (INTERREG A) is the collaboration between adjacent areas across borders to promote integrated regio- nal development. INTERREG A is by far the largest strand in terms of budget and num- ber of programmes. INTERREG IVA has 52 operational program- mes, each covering part of a border area between EU Member States. An organisation or authority can only participate in an INTER- REG IVA programme, if it is located in the eligi- ble area of that programme. How do SMEs participate in cross-border projects? INTERREG A supports the creation of cross-border clusters such as Biovalley 14 , the tri-national life sciences cluster co- financed by the Upper-Rhine programme, which gathers 600 companies. It supports research and development (R&D) as with the interdisciplinary research and transfer project TKV FO 15 co-financed by the Deutschland \u2013 Nederland programme as well as the creation of new activities and the maintenance of a strong industrial fabric of SMEs through the Benefits 16 project co- financed by the France (Channel)-England programme. \u2022 Trans-national cooperation (INTERREG B) involves non-contiguous regions from diffe- rent countries that cooperate because they experience joint or comparable problems. INTERREG IVB is divided in thirteen different Operational Programmes (OPs). Each OP is led by a Secretariat and covers a specific part of the EU territory. All Member States can participate in INTERREG IVB, but only if an organisation or authority is located in the eligible area of one of the programmes What\u2019s in it for SMEs and potential entrepreneurs? INTERREG B facilitates innovation and entrepreneurship in South Eastern Europe by fostering evaluation competencies in research, technology and innovation through the Eval-Inno project 17 . It encourages i-labs and entrepreneurial creativity at large with the CREA NET 2.0 18 project co-financed by the South West Europe programme. \u2022 Interregional cooperation (INTERREG C) was designed to improve the effective- ness of regional development policies and instruments through large-scale informa- tion exchange and sharing of experience (networks). Although it is the smallest pro- gramme in terms of budget, it covers all regions in the EU. How does best practice sharing improve the business environment? INTERREG C allows for tested experiences such as Framtidsfron-Future Seeds 19 teacher education for entrepreneurship in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland to be shared across Europe through the YES project for youth entrepreneurship. It further fosters the transfer of successful business support initiatives such as the 4+1 model 20 created by the Kompass centre for Business Start- ups in Frankfurt and transferred within the framework of the ENTREDI project. 1.3.4.2 Transnational cooperation within OPs Interregional cooperation can also be inclu- ded in ESF and ERDF OPs either using a horizontal approach (allowing for interregional cooperation in all areas covered by the OP) or through a dedicated priority axis (providing for interregional cooperation in one specific area). Including interregional cooperation in Ops allows for increased flexibility as project holders do not need to wait for the publication of an INTERREG call to present an application and have more room for manoeuvre when choosing their partners.

What kind of interregional projects can be integrated in an OP? The Limousin region (F) included five stra- tegic priorities in its OP, the fifth being the facilitation of interregional and interna- tional cooperation partnerships 22 . More specifically the region focused its efforts on the capitalisation of results, the sharing of experience, the development of existing international networks, and the continuity of actions undertaken in order to stimulate the dissemination and ownership of best practices. In this framework, the RUR@CT 23 project is an example of interregional cooperation initiated under an INTERREG C project aimed at sharing good practices and currently financed by the ERDF under the regional OP for the transfer of these successful initia- tives. Transferred good practices feature a wide range of rural development projects including support to creation and transfer of business as is the case with the Objectif Cr\u00e9ation 24 initiative. ",

Whereas the guidelines for ESF actions are designed at European level, implementation on the ground is managed by the relevant natio- nal or regional authorities in each Member State. These authorities prepare the OPs and select and monitor the projects. The decentra- lised management of Structural Funds implies that they are available through the Member States and regions and do not fund projects directly from Brussels. Funds are administered at national and/or at regional level. Applica- tions should therefore not be sent to the EC but to the ERDF or ESF managing authority in your region or country. Another crucial aspect of Cohesion Policy fun- ding is the fact that EU financial support always runs alongside national public or private finan- cing. The level of EU intervention is linked with the situation on the ground. Depending on a number of socio-economic factors, the co- financing may vary between 50% and 85% of the total cost of interventions. Member States or regions designate a mana- ging authority, a certifying authority and a functionally independent auditing authority for each OP. Operational programmes (OPs) 25 are multi- annual programmes agreed on at national or at regional level and then negotiated with the European Commission. These programmes es- tablish the funding priorities for the specific policy area or region and the amount of money from the different funding instruments that will be made available. OPs are either thematic or regional and are implemented through a wide range of organisations, both in the public and private sector. These organisations include national, regional and local authorities, educa- tional and training institutions, non-govern- mental organisations (NGOs) and the voluntary sector, various representative organisations for enterprise such as the various Chambers (namely the Chambers of Commerce, Cham- bers of Crafts etc.) as well as social partners, for example trade unions and work councils, industry and professional associations. ",
        "20 The managing authority (MA) is the department resuming the overall responsibility for an OP. MAs are organised either on a national, regional or local level and can be a public authority or a public/ private body. They are responsible for the effective and efficient implementation of the Funds which implies a number of functions re- lated to programme management and monitor- ing, financial management and controls as well as project selection. They are supported by one or several intermediate bodies. Together with Member States, MAs are responsible for ensur- ing that the communication strategy is imple- mented in a way to reach all citizens. MAs act as a contact point for the European Commission, certifying and auditing authorities as well as for project holders or potential beneficiaries. The certifying and auditing authorities furthermore guarantee the accuracy of accounts, compliance with applicable Union and national rules as well as the control of management systems 26 . Applications for ESF and ERDF investment are generally invited in response to time-limited calls for proposals issued by the MAs. However, the use of calls is spread in varying degrees across Europe and it is sometimes also possible to present a pro- ject in the framework of on-going programmes. Beneficiaries design individual projects, apply for funding and, if this is granted, implement their project and report to the MA on progress. Example of an ERDF call for proposals \u201cThe call for Priority 2 Stimulating Enterprise Development is seeking applications from or- ganisations that are focused on the provision of support to small and medium sized busi- nesses in the West Midlands to encourage enterprise and stimulate growth. Outline Ap- plications are invited in relation to both com- pletely new projects and extension or expan- sion of existing West Midlands ERDF Priority 2 projects.\u201d West Midlands, call launched on 3 October 2012 www.communities.gov.uk/ regeneration/regenerationfunding/european- regionaldevelopment/westmidlands/ applyingfunding/callsforproposals/ Examples of ESF calls for proposals The region of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg system- atically uses the ESF to support company creation and business transfer. A crucial element for the success of a company lies in the preparation of the start-up and indi- vidual support of the growth phase. Thus, the focus lies on raising awareness, training and advice for people that start or take over a company. Several calls for proposals have been launched between 2007 and 2012 in order to \u2022 Support an entrepreneurial spirit at the schools and universities of the regions \u2022 Help knowledge based start-ups with advice and technical support through university incubators \u2022 Support business transfer through me- diators \u2022 Provide training courses for business starters and successors \u2022 Support target group specific support, e.g. for women entrepreneurs or entre- preneurs with a migrant background \u2022 Support small companies that benefit from a micro financing with specific advice on start-up financing \u2022 Provide start-up advice through a con- sultancy vouchers. The different calls and application pack- ages can be found at: www.esf-bw.de/esf/ index.php?id=66 Know your MA! The managing authority is the reference point for region-specific up-to-date informa- tion on how exactly to apply for funding in your region. Indeed, application procedures vary according to countries and even from one region to another within the same coun- try.

If you are interested in having more details on how the EAFRD could finance an initiative to support entrepre- neurs and SMEs, contact your Ministry of Agriculture 30 . 2.2 How does one get involved in the planning of Structural Funds? 2.2.1 Partnership approach The partnership approach 31 means local and regional governments and relevant actors, for example the Chambers, are involved in the definition and implementation of policies. This multi-level governance ensures increased own- ership and builds on the experience and know- how of stakeholders. Concerning the definition of policies, the part- nership agreements illustrate best this ap- proach, which makes it all the more important to feed the process of dialogue with own obser- vations and ideas. The partners involved in the setting up of the partnership agreements and progress reports will also be in the prepara- tion, implementation, monitoring and evalua- tion of programmes. The shared management of Structural Funds as well as the joint monitoring and evaluation procedures are examples of the partnership approach put in practice. MAs have to approve of the composition of the monitoring com- mittee and are represented in the monitoring committee itself, together with the intermedi- ate body and the partners. Either the Member State or the managing authority chairs the monitoring committee. The monitoring committee is another concrete example of the partnership approach. Its role is to monitor programmes in order to review implementation and progress towards achie- ving the programme\u2019s objectives. The above referred partners also participate in the moni- toring committee. The European Code of Conduct will lay down objectives and criteria to support the imple- mentation of partnership and to facilitate the sharing of information, experience, results and good practices among Member States. 2.2.2 Participating in the definition of the priorities The 2014-2020 foreseen thematic concen- tration will make it a legal obligation for all regions to use Structural Funds for SME and entrepreneurship projects. Indeed the more developed regions, the transition regions as well as the less developed regions will have to allocate minimum shares of ERDF funding to research and innovation, SME competitive- ness and the shift to a low carbon economy, ranging from 50% (for less developed regions) to 80% (for the more developed and transition regions). This is a real opportunity for the SME sector. However, in order to ensure the general framework allows for tailor-made policy mak- ing, participating in the early stages of the defi- nition of the OP is the way to go. The partnership agreement established between the Member States and the European Com- mission will form the foundation of the OPs. Thematic priorities and major projects will also have to be mentioned in the partnership agree- ments. It is therefore crucial to be pro-active and get involved in the establishment of the partnership agreements right now. Indeed, although the European Commission recom- mends to \u201corganise a partnership\u201d with a num- ber of stakeholders, the actual degree of par- ticipation of regional stakeholders will highly depend on the way Member States organise the process.

Proposal for a new regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund COM(2011) 615 final/2, Annex IV, ex ante conditionalities 1 & 8 The existence of a strategy, be it in the field of R&D and innovation or entrepreneurship, will be a pre-condition for the partnership agreements 32 . In order to ensure a reasonable amount of the money goes to SMEs it is impor- tant to get involved already in the setting up of these strategies. Prior to the drafting of the partnership agree- ments Member States and regions will carry out a territorial diagnosis in order to evaluate the effectiveness of policies, asses the needs, strengths and weaknesses. This will constitute a basis for the elaboration of the partnership agreements. Make your voice heard! - Share your experience in SME and en- trepreneurship support, data and field observations are very welcome at this stage and will ensure closer adequa- tion between operational programmes and needs on the ground. - Participate in the preparation of the partnership agreements to ensure SMEs and entrepreneurship policies are a top priority and get properly funded. - The OP will contain concrete elements (indicators, quantified objectives...) give your input! The operational programmes \u201cshould set out priority axes corresponding to thematic objec- tives, elaborate a consistent intervention logic to tackle the development needs identified, and set out the framework for performance assess- ment. They should also contain other elements necessary to underpin the effective and effi- cient implementation of these Funds\u201d. In other words goals, indicators, expected outputs and economic, social and territorial impacts will have to be laid down already in the OP to ensure SME and entrepreneurship-oriented projects fit in the framework and can be financed out of Structural Funds. Need information on the partnership agreements? To know more about the preparation of the partnership agreement and of the OPs in your country or region and the ways you can be involved in the elaboration, contact your MA! This is an optimum way to pre- pare the way ahead for the implementa- tion of effective entrepreneurship and SME policies supported by Structural Funds. 2.2.3 Time frame Consultations for the preparation of the part- nership agreements (which will determine the share of funding priorities to be received) have already started. It is still possible to give inputs (e.g. statistics). Therefore, make it a point to apply to your business organisation at regional level or to your MA. Once the legislation governing the next pro- gramming period 2014-2020 is adopted, partnership agreements will have to be sub- mitted within 4 months. Regarding operational programmes, these will have to be submit- ted within three months. For OPs dealing with more specific projects, this depends on which indicators you chose, which will determine the kind of projects you accept. Here, one should also make it a point to apply either to business organisations at regional level or alternatively to the relevant MA. 2.3 Practical tips for optimum use of Structural Funds for SME and entrepreneurship policies 2.3.1 The project application 2.3.1.1 Who can apply? Depending on the OP, calls may be targeted at specific project developers (e.g. universities) or insist on the existence of a partnership of seve- ral bodies (various Chambers, business organi- sations, public bodies...).

This will therefore have to be demon- strated in the application. Furthermore, rules to avoid competitive distortion will be applied. 2.3.1.2 What can be financed? Conditions and topics depend on the strategy and priorities agreed for each national/regional OP. An overview of programmes and priorities is published and available on the DG Regio In- foregio website 33 (for ERDF) and on the DG Em- ployment website via the priorities database 34 (for ESF). For EAFRD, information on national and regional programmes is available on the ENRD website 35 , and for the EFF, one should visit the Fisheries website 36 . The Structural Funds offer many funding pos- sibilities to support SME & entrepreneurship policies: \u2022 Entrepreneurial education in schools / crea- ting an entrepreneurial spirit \u2022 Entrepreneurial training / training how to start an enterprise \u2022 Advice / coaching to entrepreneurs and business starters (e.g. start-up coaching) \u2022 Support for the transfer of businesses from one generation to the next (e.g. help for company owner and new entrepreneurs to plan and implement the transfer) \u2022 Support for companies to consolidate, grow, innovate, internationalise or similar 2.3.1.3 How to apply? Application procedures vary from one country to another and even within some countries from one region to another. This is due to the fact that different priorities and support activi- ties are defined in the different OPs and sup- port is organised in different ways in each region. While in some regions calls for propos- als are the only way a project holder can sub- mit an application, in others, projects are sub- mitted directly to the MA. Intermediate ways of managing Structural Funds exist as well with a combination between calls for proposals and programmes. Applications may either be submitted through a standardised, paper or online outline appli- cation form or by sending a description of the project to the MA. In any case MAs generally advise to send applications as soon as pos- sible, be it in a draft form, in order to be in a position to help applicants with the writing of the final application. Managing authorities sometimes offer specific services to assess your project application, provide help and advice. The Alsace region (F) for instance employs me- diators whose task it is to inform, advise and support application writing. You may also want to check with your local Enterprise Europe Network 37 ! ",

Support can be direct or indirect: when it is direct grants are given to SMEs directly. When indirect, grants or services are given to a project helping SMEs. Funds are allocated throughout Europe accord- ing to different socio-economic factors. The amount that will be attributed at regional or na- tional level (by the MA) to a project depends on: - The Fund\u2019s total allocation for the region/ country - The co-financing rate According to the co-financing principle, a sub- sidy is not wholly paid from European funds, but may vary between 50% and 85% of the total cost of intervention. The co-financing rate depends on the category a region is in (more developed region, intermediate region, less de- veloped region, see 1.2). Public expenditure on aid to enterprises has to comply with the aid limits laid down in respect of State aid 38 . - The amount allocated to each priority axis of the OP Depending on which priority axes are addres- sed, the project may be more or less financed by Structural Funds. It is crucial to contact the MA at an early stage of the project definition to get advice on how to make it fit best with the OP, un- less the project is already mentioned in the OP, or else to look for alternative funding. - The amount that is still available in the region and hasn\u2019t yet been programmed. - The total of eligible costs of the project In any case, be aware that funding is NOT paid in advance! You will therefore need to ensure you have sufficient re- sources to pre-finance your project! ",
        "25 39. See Annex 2 Formal requirements and procedures are both extensive and demanding but setting up and managing an EU-funded project is a skill like any other. Here is a short list of basic principles to be applied to the management of projects supported by the Structural Funds. 3.1 Schedule - Anticipate , well-researched high-quality project proposals often take two to six months to be written, starting long in ad- vance will increase your chances for success. - Seek advice from your MA at an early stage of the drafting of the project proposal to make sure it fits best with the priorities of a given OP. - Plan actions in a detailed way - Use appropriate tools to keep an up-to-date overview of the project\u2019s progress , this implies ensuring communication is properly organised in order to be aware of the state of play. - Respect deadlines , these are non-negotia- ble parameters. 3.2 Information There is a wealth of information available to the public. To increase your potential for success- ful project planning, make sure you are proper- ly informed before the start of your project (relevant OP, application procedure in your region, duties of the project holder): - A good starting point is to use the European Commission\u2019s central web portals 39 (which are available in EU languages, although some of the downloadable documents have limited language availability) to research funding opportunities. You will find informa- tion on OPs, categories of regions, legisla- tion, for the kind of initiative you would like to set up to support SMEs or entrepreneur- ship in your region. - In addition to the links listed in Annex 2, you may check locally which guides and user\u2019s manuals have been established in your region/ country or even in neighbouring regions/ countries Planning and preparing your application ",
        "26 40. See Annex 2 - Chambers across Europe have over the years acquired a profound knowledge about the management of Structural Funds projects, both as project leaders and con- sortium partners. - Other project holders may also provide you with relevant information, check the rel- evant projects databases for contact de- tails 40 - Make sure knowledge of Structural Funds stays in your company or organisation, or is transmitted to someone there. To optimise your chances for successful project planning, take advantage of ex- isting experience! Consulting project da- tabases will help you benefit from others\u2019 experience. 3.3 Practical Tips Project application procedures differ substan- tially from one region to another. In order to provide potential project holders with real-life examples The European Commission has set up an online database with genuine (successful) funding applications. These should serve as an inspiration and help potential project holders structure their project idea as well as their re- quest for ERDF or ESF funding. The applications are published in the original language together with an English translation and are available under the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/ regional-sme-policies/applicationexamples Don\u2019t overlook the importance of contact- ing your MA at an early stage (see Annex 2), to increase your application\u2019s prospects of success!

        "33 Time Frame Start Date 01 March 2009 End date 28 February 2014 Context and rationale The project strengthens the competitiveness of SMEs through the promotion of cross-border technology transfers. This leads both to improved territorial cooperation and to the implementation of the EU Lisbon Strategy. The manufacturing SMEs of all industry branches are faced with major challenges, due to increasing globalisation. For these SMEs, globalisation means significant competitive pressure in the form of increasingly higher demands on the products function and falling prices. As the economy at the German-Dutch border cannot compete with the low wage costs of rival Asian countries, existing strengths need to be optimally used or developed. In order to improve the competitiveness and the market position of these companies, demand-driven innovation in product development and product manufacturing is crucial. This can be achieved by introducing the multidisciplinary field of engineering known as Mechatronics. This ensures positive effects in terms of both job security and job creation. In the geographic area of the INTERREG program, there is a high number of SMEs. For instance, in the regions Oost (Twente) only, 1,125 establishments with 39,000 workers have potential mechatronics needs. The manufacturing industry in M\u00fcnster and in the districts of Bentheim, Kleve and Wesel employs approximately 162,000 people in about 850 companies. Main objective(s) / target(s) The project \u00abMechatronics for SMEs\u00bb promotes the cross-border development and implementation of mechatronics in almost 200 German and Dutch companies. Core of the project is a practical cross-border technology transfer from universities, colleges, technology centres and engineering firms in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The bi national cooperation contributes to overcoming border barriers and counteracts the negative effects of the shortage of engineers. The interdisciplinary cooperation between mechanical, electrical and computer science (short, mechatronics\u2019) allows many product and process innovations. The benefits are visible through, among other things, an increased degree of automation, in user-friendly operating concepts and effective manufacturing processes. The project helps SMEs to bring technological developments and innovations to the market. The companies are aware of the technical possibilities and chances of Mechatronics, they come in contact with experts from the neighbouring country and receive financial contributions for technology consulting, feasibility studies and development projects ",
        "34 Detailed description of the practice The program consists of five phases, ranging from the initial idea to the construction of a working prototype. At least the last two phases are carried out across the border with Dutch and German partners. - Preliminary evaluation discussion: a member of a competent regional economic development agency discusses with the manager to find out whether the use of mechatronics is useful for the company. If this is the case, they go over to the following stages. - Deepening conversation: in phase 2 the business developers are supported by German and Dutch universities or colleges to help the project manager specify the business problem and decide which solution is most adapted. - Intensive counselling: in phase 3, external specialists deal with the technological aspects. Once the technical questions are answered positively, the feasibility study can be planned. - Feasibility study: in Phase 4, German or Dutch external service providers enter in contact with the company to start a feasibility study. The study will examine how feasible the project is technically and if it is economically sustainable. - Development of the project: together with the German and Dutch Mechatronics service providers, the enterprises develop their own project and create a prototype. Financial support: the financial support provides companies with a strong financial incentive to work with universities, technology centres and engineering companies in the neighbouring country. The successful collaboration forms the starting point for many long-lasting partnerships. - The preliminary evaluation discussion (phase 1) and the deepening conversation (phase 2) are free of charge. This allows for a low entry threshold. - The intensive counselling (Phase 3) is subsidised with a maximum of 60% of the cost. Fees of up to \u20ac 5,000 are eligible for funding. - The feasibility study (Phase 4) can be financed at 50% of the costs in general and up to 75% in research-intensive activities. Eligible costs are external costs of up to \u20ac 25.000. - The subsidy for a development project (phase 5) is limited to 50% of project costs up to \u20ac 120.000, of which max. \u20ac 60.000 own staff costs around \u20ac 40.000 contract services and equipment costs about \u20ac20.000. Overall, the funding per enterprise amount to several ten thousand Euros, depending on the project and the costs incurred. ",
        "35 Implementing structure The project involves 11 universities, technical colleges, technology centres and economic development organizations together across borders. 11 other economic development organisations are involved as associated partners. The EUREGIO in Gronau / Enschede is lead. The project partners cover the entire German- Dutch border. The intensive cooperation has not only strengthened the cross-border contacts of SMEs, but also the relations of the promoters and associated partners with each other. Target group/ Beneficiaries SMEs, universities, colleges, technology centers, economic development organisations Human resources Difficult to estimate: The calculated labour costs in the project are estimated at \u20ac8.9 million. That is approximately 50% of the estimated total costs. Moreover, there are numerous labour- intensive consulting services, but for administrative reasons these will be counted as external costs and not as staff costs. It can therefore be assumed that human resources weight far more than that in the project. Key achievement(s) Through this project, nearly 100 German and Dutch SMEs benefited from counselling and could enhance their product or develop new products. Some of the new products include innovations aimed at saving energy and other essential resources. For instance a new heat exchanger for process industries and for swimming pools and a central control system designed for low energy houses. The participating companies have concluded contacts and partnerships with businesses and technology consultants in the neighbouring country, which will continue after the funding scheme is over.

A higher proportion of external services; Drivers and success factors that facilitate the implementation of the action - Experience from previous projects enable the appropriate development of the project structure (in this intensive consultation, feasibility, development) - Integration of existing networks and partners with INTERREG experience (e.g. support to businesses but also research institutes and foreign Leister, who know well the SMEs and SMEs have confidence), - Project Approach: Need to go out from the needs of companies. - Intercultural communication competence as a prerequisite for cross-border action, - Efficient project management and good knowledge of the support programme.

Successful business succession is an issue that is of the utmost importance not only to those transferring their businesses but also to their staff and to Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg as a place for doing business. The number of handovers within families is falling and so transfers of businesses to staff or even to outside managers are becoming increasingly important. Outside management buyouts (MBO) are more difficult than internal handovers in almost all respects. There are much fewer such transfer scenarios that run smoothly, especially since they are exposed to a much greater range of problems. For those giving up their positions, the principal problem is finding the right successor. Furthermore, many business owners are overwhelmed with this complex task and often find themselves in such a position for the first time. Almost certainly linked to this is a delayed and overly hesitant realisation on the part of owners that they have to act. ",
        "38 Business owners with no successors in their own families are very hard to target with conventional informational and training tools. They do not attend information workshops or training seminars because they avoid \u201cthe public eye\u201d and their day-to-day business has top priority. Normally, the only successful way to address such entrepreneurs is directly, and a special relationship of trust is required. It was against this backdrop that, in 2003, the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Ministry of the Economy (now the Ministry of Finance and the Economy) collaborated with Heilbronn-Franken IHK (Chamber of Industry and Trade), responsible for business support, to develop the concept of \u201cmoderators to help ensure business succession\u201d. At the heart of this concept is a qualified expert in one of the regional IHKs or sector-specific associations who acts as the direct contact person and moderator and is available throughout all the phases of the transfer. Main objective(s) / target(s) The objective is to raise awareness at an earlier stage among those transferring their businesses and thus to secure existing businesses and the jobs they provide. Detailed description of the practice \u201cSuccession moderators\u201d perform the following key tasks: - Identifying and establishing contact with potential transferors, and making them aware of the need to plan any transfer carefully and in good time. - Mentioning the emotional aspects, including personal and family-related aspects. - However, raising awareness of the commercial, legal and fiscal issues, including issues relating to the law of succession, is also very important. - The moderator goes to the transferor to determine if there are any potential successors in the family or from among staff members, or if a successor from outside has to be found. If a successor has to be found from outside, Heilbronn-Franken IHK supports the moderator, e.g. by means of the Germany- wide succession exchange \u201cnexxt-change\u201d and the IHK\u2019s own succession database. - The moderator assists in establishing contact between potential transferors and transferees by taking existing offers, developing them further and/or developing and implementing new concepts. - Establishing and maintaining networks of consultants and moderating the involvement of various expert consultants (tax consultants, lawyers, management consultants). - Assistance in drawing up a road map for the transfer. ",
        "39 The moderator\u2019s tasks do not include giving detailed advice himself or herself. Moderators are expected to meet high standards. In all phases of their work, they must guarantee a high level of discretion and confidentiality vis-\u00e0-vis the transferor and the transferee. They have to proceed with great sensitivity especially with regard to family-internal solutions. Implementing structure (with a very short description) and partners/stakeholders In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, there are currently succession modera- tors in the Chambers of Industry and Trade for Heilbronn- Franken, Nordschwarzwald, Ulm, Rhein-Neckar, and Reutlingen, in the Chambers of Skilled Trades for Karlsruhe and Stuttgart, in the Hotel and Restaurant Association for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (DEHOGA) and in the South-Western Economic Region. The moderators are experienced experts who, ideally, have been entrepreneurs themselves or have experience in management consulting or financing. Target group/ Beneficiaries Owners of SMEs affected by a transfer and (potential) transferees established in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Does the action fit into a broader strategy? The use of moderators to ensure and facilitate the transfer of business is one of the elements of our SME Policy, especially of the current start-up offensive in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Implementation method Generally speaking, or at least ideally speaking, the moderator posts are fixed units/posts in a Chamber of Industry and Trade or a sectoral association. A succession moderator has access to corporate data and can be proactive in approaching companies where the issue of succession should be raised. Human resources Generally speaking, or at least ideally speaking, the Chambers of Industry and Trade or the associations employ one person who works full-time (100%) as a succession moderator. At Heilbronn-Franken IHK, for example, Mr J\u00fcrgen Beck works full-time as a succession moderator. Key achievement(s) In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, this system of promoting succession moderators who are sector-specific or regionally based has given rise to a network comprising multiple contact persons who are at the disposal of transferors and transferees alike throughout all phases of the transfer and who offer a high degree of discretion and confidentiality. The ultimate goal is to put succession moderators \u2013 subsidised or unsubsidised \u2013 in Chambers of Industry and Trade and in associations throughout Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The idea behind this moderator system is now in demand \u2013 and implemented \u2013 not only in Chambers of Industry and Trade and associations within Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg but also in Chambers of Industry and Trade outside Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The model is held in high regard in the various such Chambers in Germany and is now available as a training course developed by Bildungs- GmbH (a company commissioned by DIHK, the German Chamber of Trade and Industry). ",
        "40 The success of the model, in the words of Heilbronn-Franken IHK: \u201cAwareness-raising and proactively approaching companies has proven to be the right way to proceed. Experience has shown that, in most cases, companies did not sustainably address the issue until they had been actively approached. The companies would not have taken the initiative to address the issue at all, or would have proceeded hesitantly, but they were glad to have been approached by the IHK, a neutral party, to talk about the issue. In the various contact sessions that followed it was possible to recommend other consulting services from the network. Emotional aspects were addressed and included personal and family-related interests. The assistance provided when determining whether a successor can be found in the family or among staff or whether an outsider has to be sought has proved a success. The support given in finding an outside successor via a regional and interregional platform was well received. In nearly all cases, awareness was raised for economic, legal, inheritance- and tax-related factors. It was also possible to answer questions about financing options. Discretion, empathy and confidentiality are essential and paid off. Awareness-raising through newspaper articles, radio, television, presentations and podium discussions was very successful. We have managed to build up a network of consultants, develop the matching procedure and raise awareness for alternative forms of financing.\u201d Main results - short description + quantitative indicators (e.g. no of companies or jobs created or safeguarded, volume of investments generated etc.) From the start of April 2008 to the end of December 2011, 10 subsidised succession moderators gave advice and supported around 7 000 company transfers in total. Heilbronn-Franken IHK has had the moderator model in place since 2003 with the following outcomes to date: - 805 businesses given personal advice and support, involving a total of 12 457 jobs and turnover of EUR 1 685 million - 305 transfers completed, involving 5 160 jobs and turnover of EUR 812 million Total cost From the start of April 2008 to the end of December 2011, ESF funding for succession moderators came to around EUR 940 000. The succession moderator at Heilbronn-Franken IHK costs around EUR 100 000 a year. Financing scheme ESF associations and chambers Lessons learnt from the practice and/or improvement recommendations The matching procedure, especially for finding outside successors, should be developed further and optimised as far as possible. The ultimate goal should be the interregional networking of individual consultants and maximum coverage. ",
        "41 In your opinion, what are the requirements to transfer the action to other areas The post of succession moderator should be firmly embedded within a Chamber of Industry and Trade or within a sectoral association.

These are food industries, mechatronics, transport and logistics and the off-shore industries. Besides these mature clusters the region also has a number of viable clusters within the \u00abnew\u00bb industries, such as energy technology, robot technology, refrigeration technology and ICT. These viable clusters have the possibility to become an actual strength of position. Finally, there are a number of potential clusters, such as bio-energy, air cleaning in the agriculture, medico, medical devices, waste treatment, IT based experience economics, biotech, and better exploitation of agricultural products. These clusters can be the key opportunity for future growth. The cluster infrastructure is therefore the central point for the Southern Denmark 2012-2020 strategy for economic development. Corporate collaboration projects have been set up in the form of public-private partnerships in a number of prioritised areas with the potential to generate growth and employment in Southern Denmark. These are: \u2022 The welfare technology cluster \u2022 The energy efficiency cluster \u2022 The design cluster \u2022 Offshore clusters \u2022 The Growth Forum foods initiative The Growth Forum is a hub for regional growth initiatives. This commercial-political partnership involving the business community, knowledge and education institutions, the unions and employers\u2019 organisations, local authorities and the region of Southern Denmark, is to play a key role, with direct influence on the commercial development of the region. It will therefore continue to focus on the development of existing and new strong clusters within the specified business areas. ",
