        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 9 2020 E XECUTIVE SUMMARY This report explores the current position in regard to gender equality as a field of intervention in European Public Employment Services (PES). Information was obtained from individual PES through their completion of a survey questionnaire distributed through the EU PES Network and to which 25 PES Network members responded. Addressing gender discrimination in the labour market has been a priority of European employment policy since the foundation of the European Economic Community. The EU PES Network Decision establishing the PES Network noted its central contribution to the achievement of a 75% employment rate for women and men as stated in the Europe 2020 strategy. The current PES Network Strategy Paper has reiterated PES commitment to this agenda. ESF has been an especially important vehicle enabling activities to promote labour market gender equality. This has been a prominent feature since at least the 2000-2007 programming period. This has been further advanced during the 2014-2020 period, particularly through the thematic objective to promote sustainable and quality employment and support labour mobility. At the time of writing (November 2020) the European economy is in the midst of very significant disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst the longer-term consequences remain a subject of considerable debate it is already clear from the immediate impact that policy interventions are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of adverse labour market consequences falling disproportionately on women. It is also recognised that the crisis can present opportunities to enhance gender equality, and for these to be realised national policies will need to be efficiently implemented, and PES are key actors in facilitating this. The first PES responses to the pandemic have focussed on measures to prevent unemployment, address the needs of jobseekers, and consider how to adjust to structural, post-crisis labour market changes. It is imperative that these positive responses are reinforced through the inclusion of gender equality outcomes as explicit objectives. In their questionnaire responses, most PES recognised that women face multiple challenges from labour market segregation hindering their successful labour market participation and leading to a greater propensity to be employed in precarious, part-time, and low paid work. Inadequate support for caring responsibilities disproportionately falling to women, limited access to skills development opportunities, and disincentives from the design of tax policies all contribute to reenforcing gender discrimination. Most PES state that their day to day activities promote gender mainstreaming through policies to promote women\u2019s employability, including in non-traditional sectors, fostering work life balance, and supporting women in vulnerable situations. PES are in a particularly good position to adopt strategies furthering several objectives of the EU Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025, namely eliminating violence and stereotypes, thriving in a gender-neutral economy, and adopting gender mainstreaming. An intersectional perspective in EU policies is consequently of especial relevance to PES. Notwithstanding their perspectives on support for gender equality through their ongoing service delivery, with 60% considering this in their strategic planning, less than half (40%) of PES, or their supervising authorities, have a distinct gender equality strategy. This is possibly reflected in the extent to which the detail of PES delivery reflects gender equality. Whilst 76% of PES regularly collect data disaggregated by gender and almost all have a stated position of ensuring gender equality in their policies and procedures very few PES currently have specific gender-sensitive procedures in regard to customer contact, and very few ever deliver gender awareness courses. ",
        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 10 2020 Responses from PES in relation to questions regarding promotion of gender equality within their organisations identified 68% as having adopted gender-neutral recruitment policies, and 64% reported family friendly work life balance polices. A majority (56%) have also introduced dedicated gender equality units. In contrast less than half of respondents reported specific support for caring responsibilities and the promotion of gender equality in career development, with gender quota systems (16%) being the least used policy instrument. In response to questions concerning gender equality targets 76% cited a personalised (and gender neutral) approach to clients\u2019 needs as their primary instrument for addressing labour market barriers. PES did also report a range of ex-ante targets, though no individual target was reported by more than half the PES replying. Monitoring progress of women returning to work from breaks (i.e. due to caring responsibilities) was the most frequent target identified, with a variety of other measures reported variously prioritising; activation measures to enhance gender equality in the labour market, and vulnerability. The latter relate to factors including age, ethnicity, caring responsibilities and migrant status. Assessment of the rate of female transitions were the least frequently mentioned targets, only four PES record transitions from education, only three from training, and only one job to job transitions. Gender equality was reported as very important or important by 72% of PES, with only one reporting the issue as of low importance and another as not considered. A number of PES report good/promising practices in addressing areas of labour market gender discrimination. These target various issues including combatting gender stereotyping, promoting work life balance, assisting the labour market situation and access of women in vulnerable social situations, supporting women returning to the labour market, and promoting gender mainstreaming. The overall picture is not homogeneous across PES in Member States. Uniform attention to gender equality is currently only present for data collection among PES (which is most likely the result of the EU policy requirements where data collection has been explicitly required for PES activities such as benchlearning or in implementation of ESF projects that increasingly require gender-disaggregated data collection for monitoring purposes. An overarching strategy to in tackle gender discrimination cutting across all aspects of PES activity is still missing in most cases. In a limited number of countries gender equality is mainstreamed in the existing employment strategy or PES have dedicated gender equality strategies. The adoption of gender equality as an objective within the renewed PES network mandate is an opportunity for PES to improve together in forthcoming years with the elaboration and implementation of a common EU model of PES intervention in this policy area.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 11 2020 1. I NTRODUCTION 1.1 Gender equality as a field of intervention in PES: current state of the art The European Union (EU) has paid special attention to women\u2019s participation in the labour market since its foundation in 1957. The principle of gender equality is included in the Treaty of Rome acknowledging the principle of equal pay for equal work for women and men in Article 119 1 . Since then, legislation has developed from the area of work (access to the labour market, and equal pay and employment) to equal treatment between women and men, equal opportunities, and equal impact. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights 2 , in Article 21, enshrines the right to non-discrimination on several grounds, including sex, and in Article 23 reiterates that \u2018 equality between women and men must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work, and pay \u2019. In addition, Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) formalise gender mainstreaming as a horizontal goal. EU institutions and EU Member States are expected to account for gender equality when formulating and implementing laws, regulations, administrative provisions, policies, and activities 3 . The Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025, adopted by the European Commission on 5 March 2020 4 , is the most recent step undertaken by EU institutions towards the achievement of gender equality. It identifies six main objectives and several sub-objectives for the next five years. Public Employment Services (PES) in EU Member States can contribute to the achievement of these objectives through their activities. In particular the PES Network \u2019s remit to implement cooperation among EU Member States in the field of employment as required by Article 149 of the TFEU, presents specific opportunities for intervention in relation to gender equality including through initiatives for developing exchanges of information and best practices among Member States. The Decision on the prolongation of the PES Network 5 recently adopted by the European Parliament 6 and the Council 7 on a proposal of the European Commission 8 makes a step towards full integration of gender equality in the Network\u2019s activities.

That initial Decision did not explicitly mention gender equality as an objective. However, it accounted for the gender equality dimension in its preamble (first recital, setting out the reasons for the contents of the act) by stating that PES play a central role in achieving the 75% target for the employment rate of women and men aged between 20 and 64 years, as set in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth (also referred to as \u2018Europe 2020\u2019).

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 12 2020 upgrades gender equality to one of the explicit objectives for PES cooperation (Article 1) for the next seven years (2021-2027). It also refers to the overall aim of benchlearning as the reduction of unemployment for all age, gender and vulnerable groups in EU Member States (Article 4). The focus on gender equality is further strengthened by the requirement of an intersectional approach (Article 1) to anti-discrimination (as the decision clearly refers in its objectives to people facing discrimination on multiple grounds). The Decision (Article 5) foresees that the PES Network shall develop cooperation with several EU agencies in the areas of employment, social policy, and gender equality. This means, for instance, cooperation with the European Institute for Gender Equality. In the Decision establishing the Network in 2014 the reference to the Europe 2020 strategy guaranteed that gender equality was considered in the framework of cooperation among PES. With the new resolution the gender equality objective has now become explicit, and more attention is therefore requested of Member States in pursuing it. Technical aspects like the choice of indicators to assess performance and to identify good practices remains unchanged since gender together with age and vulnerable conditions are mentioned as a key factor for designing indicators (see the Annex to Decision 573/2014/EU), particularly in the following circumstances: \u2022 reducing unemployment for all age groups and for vulnerable groups; \u2022 reducing the duration of unemployment and reducing inactivity, so as to address long-term and structural unemployment, as well as social exclusion. The European Union has taken several steps to achieve gender equality which is one of its common and shared values. Amongst actions to achieve this goal, the promotion of work- life balance has been emphasised through the adoption of a specific directive. Furthermore, several policy measures and EU initiatives address the specific circumstances of women in the labour market (including for women belonging to vulnerable groups, such as one- parent families, ageing and elderly women, minorities, Roma, people with a disability, and the homeless). Gender inequalities in employment are mentioned in several places in the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR) 9 . This is a milestone in the development of EU social policies that endeavours to transform the objectives established in the treaties into proper \u2018rights\u2019 for European citizens. PES, as well as the PES Network, play an important role in the implementation of the pillar. Gender equality is therein mentioned with regard to the following aspects. \u2022 Chapter 1 on \u2018 Equal opportunities and access to the labour market \u2019 . Section 2 on \u2018Gender equality \u2019 : \u2018 Equality of treatment and opportunities between women and men must be ensured and fostered in all areas, including with regard to participation in the labour market, terms and conditions of employment and career progression. Women and men have the right to equal pay for work of equal value \u2019 . Section 3 on \u2018Equal opportunities\u2019: \u2018Regardless of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, everyone has the right to equal treatment and opportunities regarding employment, social protection, education, and access to goods and services available to the public. Equal opportunities of under-represented groups shall be fostered \u2019. \u2022 Chapter 2 on \u2018 Fair working conditions \u2019, Section 9 on \u2018W ork-life balance \u2019: \u2018 parents and people with caring responsibilities have the right to suitable leave, flexible 9 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar- social-rights/european-pillar-social-rights-20-principles_en#chapter-i-equal-opportunities-and-access-to-the- labour-market.

Women and men shall have equal access to special leaves of absence in order to fulfil their caring responsibilities and be encouraged to use them in a balanced way \u2019 . \u2022 Chapter 3 on \u2018 Social protection and inclusion \u2019 , Section 15 on \u2018 Old age income and pensions \u2019: \u2018 workers and the self-employed in retirement have the right to a pension commensurate to their contributions and ensuring an adequate income. Women and men shall have equal opportunities to acquire pension rights. Everyone in old age has the right to resources that ensure living in dignity \u2019 . In 2019, the PES Network updated its strategy paper 10 in coherence with the EPSR, renewing PES \u2019 commitment to tackling gender inequality in the labour market 11 . 1.2 Prospective inclusion of gender equality as a field of intervention in PES The PES Network that will work until 2027 12 will not change on terms of the structure of cooperation, as PES will continue supporting the implementation of the EPSR by modernising and strengthening PES\u2019 activities towards the achievement of the EPSR\u2019s goals in EU Members States. Despite the reference made to the EPSR, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of the European Parliament criticised the lack of gender equality as a specific objective in the current PES Network and in the European Commission\u2019s proposal for the next mandate 13 . The European Parliament indicated in its amendments 14 where and how the gender equality objective has to be clearly described in the European Commission\u2019s proposal including stakeholders\u2019 involvement. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs supported this indication, arguing that several PES in EU Member States have already successfully put in place a gender mainstreaming strategies and therefore these are good practices that can be considered for benchlearning. 1.3 PES intervention and gender impacts of the current economic crisis European economies underwent a serious shock due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data on the effect of the crisis already available point to profound impacts on the economy and the labour market since the end of the first quarter of 2020. Unfortunately, EU countries are still experiencing the pandemic, and the overall implications are difficult to gauge. This report accounts for the initial evidence and shows that this crisis has been affecting women and men differently. 10 The original strategy paper from 2011 is: \u2018Public Employment Services\u2019 Contribution to EU 2020 PES 2020 Strategy Output Paper\u2019, available at: http://csdle.lex.unict.it/Archive/LW/Data reports and studies/Reports%20and%20%20communication%20from%20EU%20Commission/20130125-011444_PES- strategy-EU-2020_jan2012_enpdf.pdf. 11 Cf. the EU Network of Public Employment Services Strategy to 2020 and beyond, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=9690&langId=en. 12 Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 573/2014/EU on enhanced cooperation between Public Employment Services (PES), available at: https://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1568194911042&uri=COM:2019:620:FIN . 13 European Parliament Briefing requested by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL Committee), Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies, Directorate-General for Internal Policies, author: Susanne Kraatz, PE 642.366-December 2019, on European Network of Public Employment Services Setup, achievements, lessons, available at: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/642366/IPOL_BRI(2019)642366_EN.pdf. 14 The European Parliament legislative resolution was adopted on 23 June 2020 by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 14 2020 The crisis caused a sudden reduction in the demand for goods, determining a slowdown in production in most of the manufacturing sector. The sudden shortages of labour demand in some areas, for instance the hotel, restaurant, and catering sector (HORECA), that are typically feminised has placed many workers at risk of paying the highest price for this crisis in the EU 15 . Clerical occupations, especially in-service sectors and in the public administration (including education), underwent an abrupt change in working conditions: from office work to remote working, which in turn led to the reorganisation of work-family life. The shut -down of schools resulted in children home-schooling. The physical and mental stress related to the difficulties in balancing work and family commitments led to both long- and short-term career disruptions. On the other hand, women have been also on the frontline in the fight against the pandemic (nursing is a typical female occupation), with the risk of burnout. Violence against women has been drastically increasing since the first lockdown in the first wave, and the signals for the current second wave are not encouraging. Social groups have been affected differently by the pandemic, and a redistribution of wealth and resources is ongoing. There are significant cross-country variations throughout Eastern and Southern European member states, for example, where more traditional gender norms prevail, and countries might be less flexible to changes in the dominant mode of labour division. Furthermore, EU countries with a better-established aid system to prevent domestic violence are in a better position than others to prevent a rapid increase in the number of violent attacks against women. The outbreak may also induce new opportunities, which \u2013 if successfully managed \u2013 could even provoke some shift towards a more even distribution of unpaid labour between men and women by \u2018 un-stereotyping \u2019 the gender roles. This is a process that may pave the way to greater gender equality, but in order to maximise the benefits of the present spread of teleworking, it is necessary to both support employers in maintaining the flexibility of remote working and prevent abuse of workers \u2019 increased connectivity. Policy responses to the current crisis at national level can make a great difference in how caring responsibilities will be (re)distributed between men and women. National policies may play a pivotal role, and public/community services including PES will be involved in implementing these measures with employers and workers. This should be supported by e mployers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representative organisations throughout the implementation through effective social dialogue. The crisis also offers new opportunities \u2013 but for these to be fully realised policy support is needed. As already showed by the ad-hoc report by the PES network on the responses to the COVID-19 crisis, the responses to the first pandemic wave 16 in EU Member States included (Duell, 2020): measures preventing unemployment (supporting employers); measures addressing jobseekers; measures/elements of measures preparing for the recovery phase and potential structural labour market changes. 15 See the UN Policy Brief from April 2020, available at: https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/policy_brief_on_covid_impact_on_women_9_apr_2020_updated.pdf. 16 Duell N.

S COPE FOR PES ACTION ACROSS EU M EMBER S TATES BY ISSUE 2.1 Introduction This chapter deals with labour market data and trends from a gender perspective. The analysis starts from trends in employment rates to focus on gender-based differences in labour market participation and possible determinants. Aspects such as unbalanced division of care duties, lack of care facilities, and segregation in sectors and occupations are analysed in more detail, highlighting links with labour market trends. The last paragraphs are dedicated to the gender pay gap, which exhibited a stable yet mildly declining trend over the last decade. The gap is assessed in the light of other indicators concerning employment and poverty of women, thus allowing for a more complete understanding of women\u2019s position in the labour market and society of the 27 EU Member States. 2.2 Drawing the overall picture As a starting point for the analysis of gender differences in the labour market, recent trends in employment suggest the scenario is improving over time for women, yet the gap compared with men remains rather stable. More specifically, the employment rate 17 in EU-27 experienced a steady growth from Q2 2013 until the beginning of 2020, performing similar trends for men and women, the latter actually anticipating the post-crisis growth (see Figure 1 18 where values for EU-27 time series are included). Yet, whereas the overall employment rate is close to the 75% target set by the Europe 2020 strategy, the gender employment gap has narrowed only during the tail of the crisis to remain stable afterwards (from 13.0% in Q2 2010 to 11.7% in Q2 2013 and to 11.4% in Q2 2020).

Source: Eurostat, November 2020. 17 The employment rate is computed considering as employed all persons aged 20 to 64 years who were in one of the following categories: a) persons who during the reference week worked for at least one hour for pay, profit, or family gain; and b) persons who were not at work during the reference week but had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent. The denominator includes all the population in the same age group. 18 The graphs in this section were designed by Professor Antigone Lyberaki and Dr Thomas Georgiadis from Panteion University -Athens.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 17 2020 As per the latest available data (see Figure 2), the employment rate for women peaks at 78% in SE, and remains in line or above the 75% target only in DE, LV, LT, NL, FI, DK, EE. LV, LT, and FI are the countries with the smallest gender employment gap in EU-27 (2- 3%), whilst EL and IT close the ranking both for the employment rate for women (51% and 52%, respectively) and for the widest gender employment gap (19% and 20%, respectively). At EU-27 level, the gap stands at 6.6% for the 20-24 age group. It grows substantially for the age group 25-54 (11.3%) and substantially remains similar between the 25-54 and 55-64 age groups (12.9%), while much lower figures are reported for the 15-19 age cohort (2.4%). Figure 2. Employment rate of the 20-64 age group by gender and gender gap, 2Q 2020 Source: Eurostat, November 2020. The unemployment rate 19 (20-64) remains substantially similar for women and men, the gap increasing from -0.1% in Q2 2010 to 0.3% in Q2 2020. As with the trends observed for the employment rate, the youngest generations show different patterns, with higher unemployment and men having a slightly higher unemployment rate (16.3%, as against 16.0% of women) on EU-27 average. Among those employed, part-time work remains most common for women (see Figure 3). As of Q2 2020, the share of part-time workers 20 score 28% for women and only 6.6% for men on EU-27 average. The highest female part-time rate is in NL (74%, as against 24.3% for men), followed by AT, DE, and BE, all featuring gaps above 30 percentage points (p.p.). The gap is equal to or lower than 10 p.p. in all the Central and Eastern European countries, showing overall low part-time rates. 19 The unemployment rate measures the share of persons not in employment who are available to work, and are actively seeking work (i.e. unemployed), on the active population (i.e. employed plus unemployed persons). 20 Part-time work is computed as employed persons not working full-time. The distinction is generally based on the spontaneous answer of the respondent. 78 76 75 75 75 74 74 74 72 71 71 70 70 69 68 68 67 66 66 66 66 65 65 61 61 58 52 51 5 9 3 2 9 3 7 8 15 7 6 8 12 6 8 7 18 16 11 12 12 8 16 12 19 12 20 19 83 85 78 77 84 77 81 81 87 78 77 78 81 75 76 74 85 82 77 78 78 74 81 73 80 70 72 70 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 S E D K L V L T N L F I D K E E C Z S I P T A T C Y L U B G F R M T H U E U - 2 7 I E S K B E P L H R R O E S I T E L 2020Q2 women Gap 2020Q2 2020Q2 ",

A closer look at part-time work by age group also shows how men are more likely to be in part-time jobs at the early stage of their career, whilst the indicator peaks in central age cohorts for women. This seems in line with the literature highlighting how motherhood and the unbalanced distribution of care duties may bias the career of women, pushed to, or opting for less rewarding or more flexible jobs 21 . Eurostat data also confirm the division of caring duties is still far from being gender balanced. As of 2016, 35.6% of women in employment perform 10 or more hours per week of informal care or assistance, against 28.5% for men. A similar gap is observed among the total population aged 16 or more (44.7%, as against 37.4%), whilst in 26 out of the 27 EU countries women in employment are reported to be more engaged than men in informal care or assistance (the only exceptions being IE and LU) 22 . A focus on involuntary part-time shows wide differences between EU Member States, with EL, IT, ES, and CY being the countries where involuntary part-time is most common among women, and very low rates being reported in countries at the top of the previous ranking, such as DE, AT, NL, and BE. Notably, cross-country differences increase over time. 21 See Rubery, J. and Fagan, C.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 19 2020 The high share of involuntary part-time (see Figure 4) may be read at least partially in the light of the lower contractual power women hold compared with men, exposing them to less remunerative jobs 23 . In this sense, cultural norms on gender roles and biases in the hiring and promotion choices by employers may reinforce each other, perpetuating gender inequality. Figure 4. Share of involuntary female part-time between 2009 and 2019 Source: Eurostat, November 2020. The lack of care facilities combined with the gender-biased division of childcare duties, may contribute to explaining these trends. Against a EU-27 average of 34.7% of children under age of three cared for by formal arrangements (see Figure 5), 13 countries perform above the Barcelona target (33%), with DK reaching 63.2%, followed by LU (60.5%) and NL (56.8%). On the other side of the spectrum, in CZ (9.0%) and SK (1.4%), the coverage remains particularly low (less than 10%). 23 See: Rossen, A., Boll, C. and Wolf, A.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 21 2020 Some scholars point out also that, while policies have tried to overcome barriers to the employment of women by reducing possible tax disincentives to second earners or by investing in care services, measures supporting a more even division of duties within families have not been promoted 24 . An exception in this regard is the recently approved Work-Life Balance Directive 25 , introducing a paternity leave, and establishing that at least two of four months of parental leave are non-transferable between parents. Women also feature higher rates than men in regard to the share of temporary employment, with the few exceptions of BG, EE, LV, LT, and RO 26 . As already discussed above for part-time work, the higher incidence among women of temporary employment may be read in the light of their overall weaker position in the labour market (see Figure 7). This is caused by a combination of \u2018 Supply- side\u2019 factors, inherently linked with private life, cultural norms, and family choices, and \u2018demand - side\u2019 effects. The latter include employers\u2019 attitudes, organisation of working time , attention paid to reconciliation of work and private life, and possible discrimination against women. Females may be expected to attach less interest in their careers due to family duties or to be more or less suitable for some jobs in reason of gender stereotypes 27 . The unmet need for employment captured by the labour market slack 28 confirms women face generally higher difficulties in accessing adequate jobs, scoring 14.4% in Q2 2020, as against 10.2% for men, despite the indicator and the gap with men improve over time (women scoring 19.0%, as against 13.8% of men, in Q2 2010). Segregation in sectors and occupations is also a key factor highlighted in the literature as cause and effect of gender-based differences in the labour market. For instance, women are more often employed in sectors where part-time and temporary employment are more common (e.g. cleaning and care services, accommodation, and education). At the same time, women may face \u2018vertical\u2019 segregation, both as a result of employer\u2019s practices and choices in training and promotion of staff, and of the risk of quitting the labour market around motherhood, with the consequent difficulties to resume the career afterwards 29 . 24 See: Kreyenfeld, M. (2019), \u2018 A new policy paradigm for the employment \u2013 fertility nexus to respond to the \u2018 future of work challenge \u2019 , in: Crowley, N. and Sansonetti, S. (eds.)

In order to compare segregation across the EU, the Scientific Analysis and Advice on Gender Equality in the EU (SAAGE) network developed indicators on sectoral segregation and occupational segregation based on EU-SILC data. The indicators, summing the employment gap sector by sector and by occupation, respectively, reach their lowest score in EL (14 p.p. in terms of sectoral segregation, and 20 p.p. in terms of occupational segregation), and their highest score in LV (peaking at 30 p.p. in terms of occupational segregation, and at 26 p.p. in terms of sectoral segregation). Sectoral segregation is also particularly high in EE and FI (both scoring 24 p.p.), while LV is followed by SK and HR in terms of occupational segregation, with 29 p.p. Few reliable estimates exist, instead, on employment and pay of platform workers, a rising phenomenon that may trigger new opportunities and risks which exacerbate gender bias and suggests that women platform workers work longer hours than men at a lower hourly rate (two thirds than men) 30 .

More generally, algorithm-based decision-making systems, meant to reward availability to work and/or based on client\u2019s judgements , may further exacerbate risks already existing in the labour market, i.e. certain flexible work patterns may widen gender-based differences rather than representing a tool to ease reconciliation of work and family life, and participation in the labour market 32 . The observed slight reduction in the gender employment gap has been accompanied by a mild reduction also in the gender pay gap 33 , as recorded between 2010 and 2018. Whilst the gap remains higher than 10% in 20 out of 27 EU Member States, figures are particularly low in RO (3%) and BE (6%), despite in few countries the gap actually widens between 2015 and 2018 (MT, PL, and SI) 34 . However, data should all be considered in the light of the performance in employment (see Figure 8). Countries with the highest pay gaps, above all EE and DE, rank in turn much better in terms of employment gaps, whilst the opposite can be said for countries like MT, HU, PL, and RO, all at the lowest end of the scale in terms of gender pay gaps, yet scoring among the highest employment gaps in the EU.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 24 2020 With some exceptions (overall SI, BE, and LU), the results suggest higher participation in the labour market often combines with employment in low-paid jobs, recalling previous considerations on the imbalances due to vertical segregation, whilst lower pay gaps may hide, at least partially, patterns of exclusion of women from the labour market. This reading seems confirmed by data on poverty and social exclusion (see Figure 9). Whilst figures on in-work poverty suggest women and men receive similar pay at the lower end of the distribution (over-18 men being actually 0.9 p.p. more likely to experience in- work poverty than women in 2018), the at risk of poverty or social exclusion rate (AROPE) shows that women experience a higher risk of poverty across most EU countries, when the employment status is not considered. Figure 9. AROPE, 2018 Source: Eurostat, October 2020. The risk of poverty is a relevant issue among elderly women. It is expected to increase in the future due to the current demographic trends and the low and/or discontinuous participation of women to the labour market. The European population is aging and decreasing given the low fertility (1.6 was the EU-27 average in 2019 and it ranged between 1.2 in Malta and 1.9 in France, with countries with a stronger family policies in terms of allowances and services showing higher rates) and the growth in life expectancy (78.2 for men and 83.7 for women at EU-27 level). Inactivity and/or discontinuous female participation in the labour market with low salaries (due to the gender pay gap and gender segregation by sectors or occupations or type of working contracts, with women at constant disadvantage) leads to high gender gaps in the level of pensions, which in turn implies a higher risk of poverty for elderly women. Demographic trends, in addition, may affect the composition of the active population so further threatening the levels of pensions and the pension systems of the EU-27 Member States.

On the other hand, a high pension gap coupled with a high coverage may point to a more equal distribution across the society of the pension resources as the female population is more evenly covered although receiving lower pensions compared to those of their male counterparts. Although it is still early to illustrate a EU-27 wide data analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market and gender inequalities, measures introduced to curb the spread of the virus appear to be particularly concentrated on female-predominant sectors, such as HORECA activities and personal care services. On the other hand, employment is on the rise in healthcare sectors and occupations, also featuring high female employment rates Given the current situation, employees in care- related occupations, especially in hospitals, are facing increasing risks of contracting the disease or of burnout, and face consequences from austerity policies meant to overcome the 2008-2013 crisis through cutting expenditure on public services 36 . 36 For a preliminary analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on employment, see: Eurostat (2020), Employment in detail \u2013 quarterly statistics , available at https://bit.ly/39eMqnR.

A PPROACHES TO GENDER EQUALITY IN THE LABOUR MARKET IN EU M EMBER S TATES \u2013 PES QUESTIONNAIRES 3.1 Scope for PES action across EU Member States by issue In this section, we summarise the information provided by national PES authorities on policies and strategies they implement or have recently implemented to counter gender inequalities in their respective labour markets 37 . This investigation is prompted by the presentation of the potential major gender equality challenges of national labour markets, and explores the strategies and policies enacted by PES. The questionnaire proposed to national PES authorities is structured according to the main theoretical framework adopted by the EU institutions in their official documents and reports on gender equality. The most recent one is the Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025. The strategy is in line with the previous European Pact for Gender Equality 2012-2020, adopted by the Council of the European Union in 2011, and providing indications to EU Member States and all EU institutions for their own competencies on how EU gender equality policy could be pursued in the framework the Europe 2020 strategy 38 . The pact addressed gender gaps in employment and social protection and committed the EU to combatting all forms of violence against women. It indicated how gender equality had to be taken in due consideration within the European Semester process 39 main steps (the Annual Growth Survey, Country Opinions, and Country Specific Recommendations). It was designed coherently with the previous Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010-2015 and mirrored in the subsequent European Commission document: Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019 40 . The Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025 builds on the existing knowledge and achievements of EU institutions, and identifies the following future objectives: a) being free from violence and stereotypes; b) thriving in a gender-equal economy; c) leading equally throughout society; d) adopting gender mainstreaming and an intersectional perspective in EU policies; e) funding actions to make progress in gender equality in the EU; f) addressing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment across the world. Three of these objectives, i.e. a, b, and d, are particularly relevant for PES organisations (though they might also support the implementation of other objectives). \u2018 Gender mainstreaming/intersectionality is a systemic objective \u2019 and refers to the approach to policy making and is aimed at ensuring that policies and programmes maximise the potential of all \u2013 women and men, girls and boys, in all their diversity. Gender equality, as well as attention to combatting all sources of discrimination, has to be incorporated in 37 The Polish PES authority notes that the issue is not among its competences. 38 Available at: www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/industrial-relations-dictionary/european-pact- for-gender-equality. 39 The European Semester is an essential part of the EU's economic governance framework implementing the aims of the EU strategies for growth (as the EU 2020 strategy). It is the process by which the economic and fiscal policy is coordinated within the EU to achieve the objectives agreed at EU level through the EU strategies for growth (as the EU 2020 strategy). 40 European Commission (2016), Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019, SWD(2015) 278 final, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/strategic_engagement_en.pdf.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 28 2020 every single action undertaken, as discrimination can be based on several personal characteristics intersecting with gender. For instance, a migrant woman with a disability may face discrimination on three or more grounds, so her specific needs and circumstances each have to be addressed. A pivotal tool for gender mainstreaming is the Gender Impact Assessment (GIA), which consists of the (ex-ante) assessment of the expected impacts of policy measures from a gender equality perspective. In cases where a disadvantage for either gender emerges, the measure should be re-designed with a view to achieving more gender equality. Similarly, intersectionality has to be implemented to account for all other grounds of discrimination. To implement this approach, gender equality sensitiveness should be standardised as a core skill and requirement of the policy makers and administrative personnel of PES. Capacity building and awareness-raising initiatives for personnel should be specifically introduced for them. The aim is to strengthen their ability to properly design and implement gender-sensitive policy measures. PES can significantly contribute to the objective of \u2018Being free from violence and stereotypes \u2019 . Firstly, they can support women victims of violence in their recovery path. A new job is the first step for a new life after a dramatic experience of violence, especially in the case of domestic violence. In addition, PES can contribute to the fight against gender stereotypes. These represent the major and subtlest obstacle to gender equality through the (often) unconscious process by which social expectations influence individuals \u2019 behaviour and condition choices. For instance, in the past, training for unemployed women was often very much \u2018stereotyped\u2019. Th ey were offered mainly training in typically feminised occupations, although there were frequently poor job opportunities in those sectors, with the result that, at the end of the training, no concrete job opportunity was available to them. If the GIA methodology were applied, policy makers could identify the need for a different approach before a training programme was undertaken. They could offer women training for other types of occupations albeit for \u2018not typically female occupations\u2019 but rather in sectors where there is a real labour demand. \u2018Thriving in a gender- equal economy\u2019 i n turn encourages achievement of the following closely connected sub-objectives: \u2018 closing gender gaps in the labour market \u2019 ; \u2018 achieving equal participation across different sectors of the economy \u2019 ; \u2018 addressing the gender pay and pension gap \u2019 ; \u2018 closing the gender care gap\u2019 . There is still a significant gap between women and men in labour market participation. Several factors have been identified as causes of this. There are women who are structurally under-represented in the labour market due to vulnerability or marginalisation (ethnic/religious minority women or women with a migrant background). Other women are hindered from participating due to the burden of care responsibilities (caring for small children or for people with disabilities or the elderly in their families) or simply because the taxation system makes it inconvenient and not remunerative for them (as second earners in the household) to take up a full-time job. Moreover, women are not sufficiently encouraged to access sectors that are generally considered as typically male sectors, but offer more jobs and career opportunities, particularly in scientific and technological sectors, which are also the most remunerative. Women are also discouraged from undertaking positions of responsibility and entrepreneurial activities as these \u2018arenas\u2019 are considered typically male domains. ",
        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 29 2020 Each of these issues has been explored in depth by the scientific literature 41 , and policy solutions have been proposed. The European Commission has adopted many of those suggestions in the strategy. Several PES at national and regional/local level already cooperate with national and regional/local stakeholders to support women recovering from an experience of gender- based violence. These initiatives can be further developed and strengthened within the framework of national strategies addressing this. Initiatives in EU Member States in the area of education and training have been undertaken by the EU to overcome gender stereotyping in the area of science and technology. Initiatives need to be enacted starting from the lowest levels (elementary schools and even from pre-schooling), as girls are systematically discouraged from approaching mathematics and scientific studies from the start of their education. To address the unequal distribution of care responsibilities within households, EU institutions encourage EU Member States to adopt work-life balance policies that reward men\u2019s commitment and to provide adequate care services. The recent Work -Life Balance Directive is a milestone for EU Member States in this area. Through the European Semester mechanism, the EU, by issuing Country-Specific Recommendations, continuously advise EU Member States to reshape the taxation system with a view to promoting women\u2019s employment ( as was the case among countries including IT and NL). Several initiatives have been also proposed and undertaken to promote women in leadership positions (the European Commission encouraged companies listed in the stock exchange to promote gender balance on Boards with a target of 40 % and a proposal for a Directive on the gender composition of company Boards) 42 and in entrepreneurial activities (for example the \u2018WEgate\u2019 online platform, the European Network of Women Business Angels, and the Network of Women\u2019s Web Entrepreneurs hubs) 43 . In addition, PES can support the achievement of other objectives of the Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025 including for instance the active aging strategy that the Commission is about to adopt, providing training and re-training to unemployed to acquire the skills required in care sectors or in the ICT sector. In all these policy areas, PES can provide a valid contribution inasmuch as they are the main actors working on the ground, responsible for advising on training and job opportunities and for designing individually tailored responses to meet the labour market integration needs of job seekers. 3.2 The potential major challenges to gender equality in the labour market Figure 11 presents the opinions of PES authorities on the main challenges that women encounter in their labour market participation. The large majority of PES authorities agree that women find concrete hindrances in participating in the respective labour markets. These obstacles are \u2018 very important \u2019 for 20% of respondents (AT, BE-VDAB, ES, IT, and LT), \u2018 important \u2019 for 24% (BE-ACTIRIS, DE, HR, IE, IS, and PL), \u2018 moderately important \u2019 for 28% (BE-FOREM, FR, HU, LU, LV, MT, and PT), and \u2018 slightly important \u2019 for 16% (CY, DK, EE, and SI). 41 Crowley N. and Sansonetti S.

        "Study report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 31 2020 The Spanish and Portuguese PES authorities mention systemic actions undertaken to tackle gender equality issues in their countries. The Spanish PES authority refers to the legislation on gender equality plans on women\u2019s working conditions. This requires companies to prepare and enact plans to tackle gender equality issues from an organisational standpoint, in the coming years (the entry into force of the obligation varies according to the firm size with March 2021 as the final date). The Portuguese PES authority mentions the commitment of the country on gender equality for the European Presidency to explore the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on gender equality, especially in sectors with strong horizontal segregation of women and men, meeting workers\u2019 needs and expectations about reconciling work, family, and private life. For its Presidency of the EU, Portugal aims to preserve the progresses on gender equality achieved and to push for gender-responsive approaches when addressing the upcoming challenges 44 . Disproportionate female, involuntary part-time, fixed-term contracts, and precarious work (non-standard or temporary employment, including e.g. platform work) also affect women\u2019s participation. Sixteen per cent of PES (AT, BE-VDAB, ES, and NL) consider it \u2018 very important \u2019 , 40% \u2018 important \u2019 (BE-ACTIRIS, BE-FOREM, CY, DE, FR, HU, IS, LT, PT, and RO), 28% \u2018 moderately important \u2019 (BG, DK, HR, IE, IT, LU, and LV), and 12% \u2018 slightly important \u2019 (EE, MT, and SI). The PES in NL, where female part-time work is widespread (about 50% of female employment), points out that this is often an individual choice. The level of education is a relevant factor in explaining this: less educated women prefer part-time work, while higher-educated women prefer full-time work, as they have invested more in their education, and can access better positions, and obtain their reward in the form of good quality working conditions. Gender segregation by sectors and occupations (e.g. women/men working in jobs typically perceived as female/male occupations) is considered a \u2018 very important \u2019 issue by 24% (AT, DK, FR, IS, LT, and PT) of PES respondents, \u2018 important \u2019 by 44% (BE-ACTIRIS, BE-FOREM, BE-VDAB, DE, EE, ES, HR, IT, LU, MT, and RO), and \u2018 moderately important \u2019 by 28% (BG, HU, IE, LV, PL, and SI), while it is \u2018 slightly \u2019 important for one PES (CY). All PES consider skills shortages an important issue. most of them answer that it is \u2018 very important \u2019 , \u2018 important \u2019 , and \u2018 moderately important \u2019 , with a score of 16% (AT, BE-ACTIRIS, BG, and DE), 28% (BE-VDAB, EE, HR, IE, IS, LV, and PT), and 40% (BE-FOREM, CY, ES, FR, HU, IT, LT, LU, PL, and RO), respectively, but four countries answer it is \u2018 slightly important \u2019 (MT and SI) or \u2018 not important \u2019 (DK and NL), 16% together. Gender segregation in career pathways/promotion and gender differentials in pay is valued as \u2018 moderately important \u2019 by 32% of respondents (BE-FOREM, BG, EE, FR, IE, LU, LV, and SI), \u2018 important \u2019 by 48% (BE-ACTIRIS, BE-VDAB, CY, DE, DK, HR, HU, IS, IT, MT, NL, and RO), and \u2018 very important \u2019 by 16% of the interviewed national PES (AT, ES, LT, and PT). The Spanish PES authority, for instance, stresses that the \u2018 glass ceiling \u2019 persists (invisible obstacles for women\u2019s access to managerial positions) despite some progress achieved in 44 In Portugal, there is also a: a) Commission for Equality in Labour and Employment (CITE), which was created in 1979 in order to fight against discrimination and to promote equality between women and men in labour, employment, and vocational training. Its main responsibilities are to promote: 1) equality and non-discrimination between women and men in labour, employment, and vocational training; 2) protection of parentality (maternity, paternity, and adoption); 3) reconciliation of professional, personal, and family life. b) Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality (CIG), which is the official mechanism responsible for the implementation of the public policies designed to promote gender equality in Portugal. The main policy instrument in force is the National Strategy for Equality and Non-Discrimination; c) the National Strategy for Equality and Non-Discrimination \u2013 More Equal Portugal (ENIND), for the period 2018-2030, which includes three plans: equality between men and women; violence against women, gender-based violence, and domestic violence; and discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender, and sexual characteristics.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 32 2020 the country since 2007. The Flemish PES, VDAB, refers to the effects of gender stereotypes on educational choices. These initial choices hamper wome n\u2019 s future access to specific sectors that offer more jobs and career opportunities. This is the case of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discipline as noted by the Italian PES authority. Very important educational choices might be one of the reasons why, although girls perform better at school (they are more likely to progress up to higher educational levels and to finish school successfully and faster, and less likely to drop out), they find it difficult to access and remain in the labour market avoiding precarious work. According to the national PES interviewed, the low availability of family friendly working time arrangements is \u2018 very important \u2019 for 16% of respondents (AT, BE-VDAB, ES, and PT), \u2018 important \u2019 for 44% (BE-FOREM, BG, CY, DE, HU, IE, IS, IT, LT, MT, and NL), \u2018 moderately important \u2019 for 16% (BE-ACTIRIS, EE, FR, and LV), and \u2018 slightly important \u2019 (DK, HR, LU, RO, and SI) for 20% of them. Shortages in care services (for children/people with disabilities, and the elderly) that hinder women\u2019s participation are considered \u2018 not important \u2019 (8%) or \u2018 slightly important \u2019 (8%) by few PES (respectively, by FR and SI and by DK and LU). Other EU Member States indicate it \u2018 moderately important \u2019 (BE-FOREM, LV, MT, PL, and PT \u2013 20%), \u2018 important \u2019 (BE-VDAB, DE, EE, HR, HU, IE, IS, LT, and NL \u2013 36%), and \u2018 very important \u2019 (AT, BE-ACTIRIS, BG, CY, ES, IT, and RO \u2013 28%). Affordability plays a crucial role in the availability of services: often childcare is available but is not affordable. The Dutch PES authority refers that, in this EU Member State, parents are not fully reimbursed for childcare costs, and this is a relevant factor in determining women \u2019s labour market participation. Some taxation regulations operate as disincentives to female participation in the labour market (e.g. issues impacting on women as more likely to be carers and second earners in couples). For 12% of PES, this is a \u2018 slightly important \u2019 issue (BE-FOREM, EE, and HU), for 28% it is \u2018 moderately important \u2019 (BE-ACTIRIS, DE, ES, FR, LT, LV, and SI), and for 28% it is \u2018 important \u2019 (AT, BE-VDAB, CY, IE, IS, IT, and NL). The conditions of women in vulnerable groups (such as victims of violence, women in poverty, single women with children, elderly women, ethnic minority women, migrant women, and refugee women) is considered \u2018 very important \u2019 by 28% of PES (BE-ACTIRIS, BE-VDAB, CY, DE, HR, LT, and PT) and \u2018 important \u2019 by 24% (AT, DK, ES, HU, IE, and IS), as well as \u2018 moderately important \u2019 by 20% of country PES (BG, FR, IT, LV, and SI) and \u2018 slightly important \u2019 by 20% (BE-FOREM, EE, LU, MT, and RO). Only 8% answer \u2018 do not know/not relevant \u2019 (NL). The Polish PES notes that the issue is not among its competences. VDAB adds the implicit (unconscious) forms of discrimination against women in vulnerable conditions, which hinder their access to the labour market. 3.3 Gender equality objectives for PES activities PES authorities adopt gender equality objectives in their daily activities to a varying extent. Figure 12 shows the replies to the questionnaire by topic. It is particularly interesting that a large majority state that gender mainstreaming is promoted in their day to day activities. ",

Figure 13. Does your country have a strategy to promote gender equality in employment, that is reflected in PES activities? Source: questionnaires collected among PES Network members, Summer 2020, 25 respondents. Forty per cent of respondents indicate that the national strategy for gender equality in employment provides the legal basis for implementing PES actions (BE-ACTIRIS, CY, DE, FR, HR, IE, IS, LU, MT, and PT). The strategy defines the policy and includes objectives to enhance women\u2019s participation in the labour market. Twenty per cent of PES authorities indicate that \u2018 gender equality in employment is addressed in the existing mainstream PES employment strategy \u2019 (AT, DK, ES, LT, and RO), 16% that \u2018 the PES has gender equality measures but these do not form part of a national strategy for gender equality in employment \u2019 (BE-FOREM, HU, IT, and PL), and 4% that \u2018 the PES \u2019s employment strategy includes specific targets and actions to increase women\u2019s participation in the labour market \u2019 (BG), while 20% of respondents choses \u2018 other \u2019 (BE-VDAB, EE, LV, NL, and SI). The PES respondents from EE, NL, LV, and SI provide more details. The Dutch authority indicates that a national strategy for gender equality is in force, and the Minister for Education and Science is responsible for it. Every year, new data are collected and published, but the PES has no active role in it. There is no specific national strategy for gender equality in employment in EE. The Gender Equality Act has the general aim of promoting equality between men and women in the labour market. The Latvian PES states that its annual strategy does not entail specific actions for gender equality, as all clients are treated equally, irrespective of their gender. The Slovenian PES refers to its actions as part of the National Programme for Equal Opportunities between Men and Women 2015-2020, which is based on the National Law on Gender Equality (adopted in 2002). The Flemish PES, VDAB, specifies that BE has a national organisation (the Institute for Equality between Women and Men) that specifically works on gender equality. VDAB works with this organisation on, for instance, raising employers \u2019 awareness, defining a strategy where 'inclusion' is a transversal programme or frame. 40% 20% 4% 16% 20% National strategy for gender equality in employment Gender equality in employment addressed in the PES's employment strategy The PES's employment strategy includes specific targets and actions There is no national strategy, but it would be needed The PES has gender equality measures not part of a national strategy Other ",

Figure 14. How does your PES ensure that gender equality is taken into account in everyday activities? Source: questionnaires collected among PES Network members, Summer 2020, 25 respondents. On the positive side: 76% of respondents regularly collect data disaggregated by gender (AT, BE- ACTIRIS, BE-VDAB BG, CY, DE, DK, EE, ES, FR, MT, HR, HU, IT, LT, NL, PL, PT, and SI), and only 6% do not (BE-FOREM, IE, IS, LU, LV, and RO); almost all PES ensures gender neutrality in processes and procedures applied to clients/customers (96%, i.e. 24 out of 25), with only Ireland answering, \u2018 do not know/not relevant \u2019 . However, regarding the second result, it should be clarified that gender neutrality does not necessarily involve gender sensitiveness. The former implies having no gender prejudice in approaching clients/customers, the latter regards taking in due account the specific conditions related to clients \u2019 /customers \u2019 gender. On the negative side: specific procedures for women accessing PES are less common, as only 16% of PES respondents declare they have these (AT, CY, DE, DK, LT, HU, MT, and PL), while 60% (BE-FOREM, BE-VDAB, BG, EE, ES, FR, HR, IE, IS, IT, LU, LV, PT, RO, and SI) do not. Twenty per cent of PES interviewed \u2018 do not know\u2019 (NL and BE-ACTIRIS); gender awareness courses for clients/customers are seldom provided though gender neutrality in processes and procedures is guaranteed. More clearly, only 16% of PES authorities (AT, BE-VDAB, ES, and LT) provide gender awareness courses, while 64% do not (BE-ACTIRIS, BE-FOREM, BG, CY, EE, FR, HR, HU, IE, IS, LU, LV, MT, NL, RO, and SI).

In Spain, women are a priority group in active labour market policies (ALMPs) 45 . The Flemish PES, VDAB, reports that a systematic analysis for bias in data or outcomes is carried out before they launch a new project or programme. 3.6 Promoting gender equality among PES employees To an extent, PES actively pursue gender equality among employees by undertaking various initiatives, especially in the area of work-life balance, in personnel recruitment, and by hiring specific support staff to work on internal gender equality issues, as shown in Figure 15. It is important to note that, in some cases, the PES authorities replied, \u2018don\u2019t know/not relevant\u2019 , as the human resources management is not always under their responsibility. For instance, the Danish PES has no competence in personnel management or in providing services to jobseekers and employers. Municipalities are responsible for both, and the PES agency has no overview of the actions undertaken. Figure 15. How does your PES promote gender equality for its own employees? Source: questionnaires collected among PES Network members, Summer 2020, 25 respondents. Sixty eight per cent of PES respondents adopt a gender equality policy in recruiting personnel (AT, BE-ACTIRIS, BE-FOREM, BE-VDAB, BG, DE, ES, FR, HR, IE, IS, LU, MT, NL, PL, PT, and RO), 8% do not (HU and SI), and the remaining 24% reply they do not know, or think this is not relevant (CY, DK, EE, IT, LT, and LV). As to the option \u2018 by promoting \u2019 , 44% of PES authorities support gender equality by promoting women\u2019s careers pathways in management positions of the organisation.

Seventy-two per cent do not (BE-ACTIRIS, BE-FOREM, BG, DE, EE, FR, HR, HU, IS, IT, LT, LU, LV, MT, NL, PL, PT, RO, and SI), while the remaining 12% do not know, or think this is not relevant (CY and DK). Tools for work- life balance and for facilitating the adoption of family friendly working time arrangements are adopted by 64% of respondents (AT, BE-VDAB, BG, DE, EE, FR, IE, IS, IT, LT, LU, LV, MT, NL, PT, and SI); 20% (BE-FOREM, HR, ES, HU, and RO) do not, and the remaining 16% do not know, or think this is not relevant (BE-ACTIRIS, CY, DK, and PL). More concrete support for caring responsibilities (childcare and long-term care for elderly people and people with disabilities) is provided by 44% of respondents (AT, BE-ACTIRIS, BE-VDAB, DE, ES, FR, IE, LU, MT, PT, and SI). Thirty-six per cent do not (BE-FOREM, BG, CY, EE, HR, HU, LT, NL, and RO), and 20% do not know (IS, IT, LV, PL, and DK).

Finally, specific support to employees in vulnerable conditions (such as victims of violence, single women with children, elderly women, and ethnic minority women) is provided by 40% of national PES (AT, BE-ACTIRIS, CY, DE, ES, FR, HU, IE, LU, and MT). Thirty-two per cent do not opt for this policy (BE-FOREM, BG, EE, HR, NL, PT, RO, and SI), and 28% do not know (BE- VDAB, DK, IS, IT, LT, LV, and PL). Further information delivered by the national PES reveals various initiatives. The Dutch PES authority has a special women's network in place to support initiatives for gender equality among employees. The Walloon PES, Le Forem, has developed the Gender Equality and Diversity Plan 2019-2021, which collects good practices to identify new actions to be implemented. The plan focuses on short (one or two-day) training activities on diversity/equality and on job design to make open positions attractive to women. In addition, a newsletter ( \u2018 Equal opportunities and diversity \u2019 ) informs about news, including publications on gender equality, and the internal social network on Yammer offers updates on the topic. The Irish PES developed an LGBT+ group and an internal network to strategically promote equality, diversity, and inclusion among its staff with the aim of improving the service to LGBT+ customers. The internal network undertook a week-long diversity awareness, educational, and data-gathering project as part of Pride 2020 celebrations. More in general, the Department of Social Protection, in line with the commitments identified in the People Strategy of the Civil Service 2017-2020, set up a diversity and inclusion function in the Human Resources Division. The aim is to build diversity and to support inclusion by extending the functions of the previous Disability Office to other grounds of possible discrimination. 3.7 Gender equality target groups for PES Figure 16 presents the gender equality targets that PES authorities most frequently choose \u2013 in this case, respondents could provide multiple answers. They promote a personalised approach to clients \u2019/customers\u2019 needs as 76% of them (BE-FOREM, BE-VDAB, BG, CY, DE, DK, FR, HR, IE, IS, IT, LT, LU, MT, NL, PL, PT, RO, and SI) indicate that \u2018 access to measures is determined by individual needs irrespective of gender\u2019. But in regard to ex-ante gender equality targets the most frequently employed (40% of respondents) is \u2018 women returning to work after career breaks due to caring duties related to maternity or care for people with disabilities or the elderly \u2019 (AT, BG, DE, FR, HR, HU, IE, IT, LU, and RO). This reflects the worrying situation of women returners, a topic that has been widely explored in the literature and that the EU institutions indicate as a priority to support women\u2019s access to employment. Another target clearly suggested by EU institutions, and commonly addressed by PES in EU Member States (36% of them) is \u2018 unemployed women including long-term ",

PES authorities opting for activation measures to enhance gender equality in the labour market operate in BE-VDAB, BG, DE, HR, HU, and IT, whereas vulnerability is prioritised by AT, ES, HR, HU, LT, and LU. Aging women (+50) is a target chosen by 20% of respondents: AT, BE-ACTIRIS, BG, HR, and HU. Figure 16. Please state whether your PES has specific gender equality measures targeted at the following groups Source: questionnaires collected among PES Network members, Summer 2020, 25 respondents. \u2018Women in transition from education to work \u2019 (mainly younger women) is a target chosen by 16% of PES (AT, BE-ACTIRIS, BG, and DE), 12% indicated \u2018 women in transition from training to work \u2019 (AT, BE-ACTIRIS, and BG), and only one of them indicated \u2018 women in job- to-job transitions \u2019 (BG). Among respondents, four provide more details, or add other targets. The Estonian PES specifies that no specific gender equality target is designed in advance, but that needs and solutions are detected and planned according to individual needs; the Italian PES provides hiring incentives at national level (specifically devoted to unemployed or inactive women, in particular those living in southern Regions. Spain has a specific allocation to target women living in rural areas. The Latvian national authority clarifies that no specific ALMPs are designed according to gender, but every client may access measures that are designed according to individuals\u2019 needs. This is also the case for CY, HR, IE, NL, and PL. Other authorities provide additional useful insights. The Walloon PES, Le Forem, organises the information day \u2018 Tuesdays of the future \u2019 about shortages in occupations, targeted at unemployed people, employment counsellors, trainers, sectors, and employers. Some of these events are also targeted specifically at women. The Flemish PES, VDAB, reports that their initiatives do not address women only, although many actions do reach out to women.

The Cypriot PES stresses that, although no gender-specific lens is adopted, women are more frequently recognised as \u2018 people in vulnerable conditions \u2019, especially when their status intersects with other vulnerabilities, e.g. single mothers, long-term unemployed, inactive population, etc. In Croatia, the PES adopts incentives and measures for employers employing persons in vulnerable conditions, such as people aged over 50, and promotes access to employment for unemployed people (including long-term unemployed) and people in vulnerable conditions by providing institutional training. Despite the fact that they do not consider women as a specific target for these measures, statistics show that women are more likely to be involved in those programmes. In IT, the PES is managed by Regions, and the national PES authority is not able to centrally collect data on policies implemented at local level. This is the case for all measures, including measures that address women's employment and gender equality; the only data available at central level are on employment incentives targeting women, as these measures are implemented and therefore monitored at national level. The Dutch PES reports that targets are identified using an evidence-based work profiler, which takes into account gender and gender- specific situations. The Portuguese PES authority refers that the National Strategy for Equality and Non-Discrimination for the period 2018-2030 46 includes measures promoting gender equality in the labour market that are part of the Programme for the Promotion of Gender Equality in the Labour Market. In DE, the establishment of the \u2018 Girls \u2019 Day \u2019 is aimed at improving educational qualifications of girls by combatting gender stereotyping in educational career choices. Of particular relevance are the following national PES measures: Austria Women in Craft an Technics, which is focused on unemployed women in traditional low- paid jobs, with the goal of attaining higher salaries and of providing more career opportunities in the sector ; and Women Who Re-enter, focused on women after parental leave. Both measures have been valued by the Austrian PES as \u2018 very effective \u2019.

Gender equality is high in the ranking of PES priorities, as reported in Figure 17. \u2018 Very important \u2019 is the most popular answer, 40% of respondents answer so (BE-FOREM, BE- VDAB, BG, CY, DE, ES, FR, IS PT, and LT), followed by 32% labelling this objective as \u2018 important \u2019 (AT, DK, HR, LU, LV, MT, PL, and RO); another 12% consider it \u2018 moderately important \u2019 (EE, BE-ACTIRIS, and HU). Only one PES authority (SI) chooses \u2018 a factor of low importance \u2019 , and another one (NL) \u2018 not considered \u2019 , whereas it is a \u2018 pivotal element \u2019 for 8% of respondents (IE and IT).

G OOD /P ROMISING P RACTICES 4.1 Introduction The 12 good/promising practices provided by PES are detailed in this section. They are classified and presented by objective. For each practice, the following elements are considered: type of measures target groups logic of intervention impacts effectiveness challenges/barriers. A more detailed description for every measure is available in Annex II of this report. Where there is not yet sufficient information on impact cases should be considered as promising rather than good practices. 4.2 The good /promising practices by objective 4.2.1 Contrasting gender stereotyping Three good/promising practices focus on gender stereotyping. They are Women in Craft and Technics in AT, Women4IT in LV, and Promotion of Gender Equality in the Labour Market in PT. The Austrian good/promising practice has been financed for five years, and it is intended to extend it. The leading institution for this project is the national PES itself (Arbeitsmarktservice, AMS) operating in cooperation with training centres. The total budget for this measure is EUR 55 million, which is aimed at combatting gender stereotypes to support women\u2019s access to non-typical (and the most rewarding) positions. The rationale for this measure is to expand employment opportunities by challenging gender stereotypes. The Latvian State Employment Agency has just started cooperating with the Latvian Information and Communication Technology Association (LIKTA) to promote the involvement of young women in the ICT sector and digital jobs. The organisations have signed a cooperation agreement aimed at informing and involving young women about the initiative. The project benefits from a EUR 2,714,304.00 grant from IS, LI, and NO through the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the Norway Grants Fund for Youth Employment. The aim of the project is to increase the number of EU vulnerable girls and young women in the digital sector. PT mentioned Promotion of Gender Equality in the Labour Market. This is a national measure financed by the European Social Fund (ESF), and lead by the national PES. This measure is now associated with Estrat\u00e9gia Nacional para a Igualdade e a N\u00e3o Discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o (ENIND) 2018-2030 and is aimed at: promoting gender equality in the labour market; combatting gender-based discrimination in the labour market; encouraging the hiring of unemployed people from the under-represented gender in a profession; and encouraging young unemployed people to choose a profession or job, according to their vocation and without constraints motivated by gender stereotypes. The plan is focused mainly on the under-represented gender in a particular occupation, as identified from the databases of job centres. In 2019, 1,478 labour inclusion actions were conducted under this measure. ",
        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 43 2020 4.2.2 Work-life balance IT reports two policy measures in the area of work-life balance. The first one is a policy measure implemented in the framework of the Equality for Work & Life (EQW&L) project, which has a national scope of action, and a duration of two years (2019-2020). The leading institution for EQW&L is the country \u2019s PES (National Agency for Active Labour Market Policies, ANPAL), supported by Fondazione Giacomo Brodolini, Reform, Iweo, CGM, and the Italian Labour Union (UIL) and funded by the European Commission. The gender equality challenge addressed by the project is women \u2019s unemployment and work-life balance. The EQW&L project aims to develop and test strategies, a new intervention model, and a toolkit that facilitate labour market access of unemployed women, who encounter hindrances in finding and sustaining a job due to family care responsibilities. The project also intends to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \u2013 and in particular, social enterprises \u2013 to adopt work environments sensitive to work-life balance. The second measure mentioned by the Italian PES is \u2018 Work life balance and women \u2019s participation - A proposal from ANPAL to Regions supported by the ESF National Operational Programme \u2018 SPAO 2014-2020 \u2019 . It addresses the still unsatisfactory participation of women in the labour market, targeting women with care responsibilities who wish to (re-)enter the labour market by increasing work-life balance measures and services in the territories, and women's employment rate. The implementation of the measure has been slowed down by the COVID-19 pandemic. 4.2.3 Women in vulnerable conditions Two policy measures address this issue. Future Search, by the Flemish PES, VDAB, and a Croatian project promoted by the PES, in cooperation with the Croatian Red Cross and Caritas. Future Search targets inactive women with a migrant background. It is a regional measure (Flanders) started in 2019. VDAB is the institution leading this initiative, with the support of 13 partners (representatives from employers, target groups, and intermediary organisations). The specific objective is to detect the barriers and to create innovative measures/policies to tackle them, including liaising with potential employers. VDAB adopted the role of connector, instead of a delivery actor, between the stakeholders involved in this activity. The Croatian national project from 2016 addressed the mismatch between supply and demand in the labour market, and the growing number of women with a lower level of education in rural areas and from vulnerable groups (among them, women with disabilities, women victims of human trafficking, women victims of domestic violence, asylum seekers, young women drug addicts, Roma women, and homeless women). Employers avoid hiring them as they are considered less productive. Originally, it was planned to involve 2,547 women, whereas, at the end of the project, as many as 2,583 women (and 348 employers) benefitted from the project. 4.2.4 Women returners Two measures on long-term unemployment address the specific conditions of women wishing to re-enter the labour market \u2013 in most of the cases having left it to care for their children or other family members in need. The two measures (one from AT and one from ES) address possible situations. Re-entry for the Future is an Austrian national initiative implemented by the Austrian PES through the women\u2019 s counselling centres. It provides compensation to women after parental leave who wish to re-enter the labour market (e.g., to do an apprenticeship). ",
        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 44 2020 The Spanish PES implements measures for equal opportunities in access to employment. Axis 4 of the three-year Plan to Prevent and Reduce Long-Term Unemployment 2019-2021 targets long-term unemployed women or women at risk of remaining outside of the labour market. This is a national programme implemented at regional level in rural areas from 2019 to 2021. The authority responsible for the programme is the national PES in cooperation with the Autonomous Regional PES, the Women \u2019s and Equal Opportunities Institute, the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces, and the social partners, among others. 4.2.5 Gender mainstreaming Two good/promising practices were provided in this area, both from Belgium. The Brussels Capital Region PES, ACTIRIS, reports that a gender mainstreaming process in regional policies has been implemented since 2007, when the National Gender Mainstreaming Strategy (2007) started to be affected. This process has been renewed for the period 2019-2024. The Board of Directors monitors the activities and the results of gender mainstreaming, supported by the Institute for Equality between Women and Men. The main focus during the last period was on gender balance in access/conditions of work/careers, especially for women employees, with the aim of impacting on gender equality at work. Further results of the intervention are reported by the Diversity Annual Plan and Evaluation. The second programme is implemented by the Flemish PES, VDAB. It promotes the use of gender-neutral words in job offers. This is a regional programme without a deadline, managed by VDAB itself. The main objective of the initiative is to monitor the job offers posted by employers on VDAB \u2019s website, and to give suggestions about (among others) gender-neutral terms (job titles, job descriptions, etc.); moreover, when discrimination is detected, the offer must be adapted before it can be posted. The target of the project are the employers themselves, with the aim of developing a gender-sensitive approach to the language, as well as to tackle discrimination in job offers. The Flemish PES, VDAB, also cooperated in an academic research aimed at determining which are the \u2018gender -neutral' terms to be used (in education but also in other contexts). Long cooperation with partners is reported as to research on women, the creation of tools for target groups or employers, and the organisation of seminars on the topic, among others. The Dutch PES authority highlights that, despite the great importance attached to gender equality, it has no mandate in this area. It reports on the commitments for equality for all genders (LGBTQIA+), religions, minorities, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable individuals. The rationale behind such commitments is that excluding anyone from the labour market is a waste of talent and resources. Finally, the Latvian authority reports its commitment to providing gender-disaggregated data as gender statistics are a basic tool to design and monitor gender-sensitive measures. The Slovenian authority also reports that all statistics on ALMPs related to participants are provided by gender on a regular basis: data show that the share of women among the beneficiaries of ALMPs has been over 50% for many years now.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 45 2020 5. I DENTIFY THE MORE COMMON APPROACHES EMERGING FROM THE ANALYSIS The PES responses reflect positive developments in considering gender equality in that 40% of respondents ranks the overall objective as \u2018 v ery important\u2019 , 32% as \u2018important\u2019 and another 12% consider it \u2018moderately important\u2019. This perspective is supported by some strategic considerations reported by 60% of respondents: for 40% by a specific PES gender equality strategy PES and for 20% by the inclusion of a gender equality objective in the existing mainstream PES employment strategy. Awareness about gender equality translates in activities for both PES employees and PES end-users. On one hand, PES undertake various initiatives for their employees in the area of work-life balance, adopt gender-sensitive criteria in personnel recruitment, and hire specific support staff to work on internal gender equality issues. Actions to promote gender equality within the organisation are pivotal to raise awareness among personnel and therefore promote an adequate implementation of gender equality policies for end-users. On the other hand, PES implement gender-sensitive activities for end users. They include the collection of regular gender-disaggregated data (76% of respondents) and the imple mentation of policies to promote women\u2019s employability, including in non -traditional sectors, fostering work life balance, and supporting women in vulnerable situations. However, specific procedures to assist women accessing PES are less common, only 16% of PES implement these. Similarly, gender awareness courses for clients/customers are seldom provided. It is important to note that several respondents conflated gender neutrality (meaning non-discrimination which is obviously a legally mandated guarantee) in processes and procedures, with gender equality policies. To properly implement gender equality in policy making the European Commission advocates gender sensitiveness: this implies analysing the issue from a gender perspective and then taking appropriate measures to counteract existing gender inequalities and address potential gender biases which may ensue from the newly implemented policy. Among the good/promising practices mentioned by PES, several are EU funded. This result confirms the important role played by European institutions in promoting gender-sensitive labour market policies. In particular, the ESF has been playing a prominent role in supporting gender equality since 2000-2007 programming period. So, for instance the ESF Regulation for the programming period 2014-2020 addresses some of the most burning gender equality issues and strategies to overcome gender gaps 47 . The good/promising practices recently implemented or still under implementation by PES in the area of gender equality have benefitted in particular from the initiative supporting work-life balance through the ESF thematic objective \u2018promoting sustainable and quality employment a nd supporting labour mobility\u2019 . This includes a section on \u2018 Equality between men and women in all areas, including in access to employment, career progression, reconciliation of work and private life, and promotion of equal pay for equal work \u2019 . 47 Casavola P., Rosselli A. and Sansonetti S.

Some PES take a more strategic approach and apply gender mainstreaming to labour market policies to combat gender discrimination. This requires their active promotion of gender mainstreaming as an overarching framework for their policy design, development, and implementation. ",
        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 47 2020 6. C ONCLUSIONS A number of PES report practices to address areas of labour market gender discrimination, describing these initiatives as effective. However, limited information was supplied on the targets, success criteria/profiles for programmes described, or results achieved. The initiatives relate to the following aspects of gender discrimination: gender stereotyping, supporting work life balance, supporting women in vulnerable positions to overcome labour market discrimination \u2013 including from recruitment practices stigmatising women from disadvantaged groups, structural youth unemployed compounded by gender discrimination, women returners to work, and gender mainstreaming policies. Further investigation of these promising practices can identify the potential for application more widely, including across the EU, with possible adaptation to meet the requirements and situation in various member states. Though most PES report at least one or in some cases several objectives to, at least partly, consider the advocacy of inclusion through, promoting themes such as: women\u2019s employability, standard working contracts, the employment of women in non-traditional occupations, women\u2019s career pathways/addressing pay gaps, supporting work life balance, and particularly assisting women from vulnerable groups, almost all PES can do more to further these agenda. PES are crucial agents in this regard and this study has identified particular areas where they have scope to positively intervene. PES can play an active role in combatting gender stereotyping through active engagement with employers and workers\u2019 organisations. This can take place at enterprise level and through employer associations and workers\u2019 organisation s discussions within the usual framework for social dialogue. This can promote the recruitment of women in sectors where they are under-represented including through drawing the attention of enterprises to the advantages in seeking to attract workers from the widest possible talent pool. Particular efforts should also be made to emphasise the possibilities for women in seeking to enter sectors where they are currently under-represented, especially in the more rewarding and well remunerated jobs. Similarly, PES can engage with both employers \u2019 and workers \u2019 representatives within enterprises to promote and explain the advantages for both business and employees, which can ensue from the promotion of work life balance policies. Advice in the form of Tool Kits and other guidance for employers \u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives at firm level , particularly addressing issues faced by SMEs, can assist in promoting this agenda. Women from vulnerable groups can face considerable labour market disadvantage due to barriers to both their social and labour market integration from their precarious situations. PES are well placed to identify these barriers and intervene to combat and remove them, including through combined interventions with other agencies. Their engagement, interacting with workers\u2019 representatives at firm level or at a higher level with trade unions could actively challenge negative employer stereotypes if adopted as a priority for their employer liaison activities. Problems experienced by women returning to the labour market were identified as the issue most frequently monitored by PES. The PES can offer specific dedicated counselling to assist women in overcoming and removing barriers, including those experienced by returners. This should include identification of training and skills development programmes suited to women\u2019s\u2019 needs and identification of, and access to, funding to facilitate positive transitions. Ultimately, PES success in addressing gender discrimination requires their active promotion of gender mainstreaming. This needs endorsement from the most senior levels within PES to ensure equality both within their organisations through internal HR policies, and in all aspects of job matching, counselling, and employer engagement within the overall framework of open and effective social dialogue involving workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 ",
        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 48 2020 organisations. This can only be possible through frequent review, assessment, and monitoring of progress towards tangible and clear equality milestones and targets. Notwithstanding the varying competencies and responsibilities of PES in regard to equality policy and legal enforcement, only 20% of PES reported gender equality as being explicitly addressed in their employment strategies. Reflection on how gender equality can be embedded within PES mandates and future delivery plans can potentially drive further progress and enable PES to fulfil their potential as key labour market actors to challenge and combat gender discrimination in the labour market. PES provision of personalised services described as gender-neutral approaches are unlikely in themselves to be sufficient as instruments to combat and alleviate structural and systemic labour market gender bias. Consequently, action orientated programmes will be necessary to ensure that gender considerations are mainstreamed in all areas of PES activity, with bespoke active labour market policies (ALMPs) provided which can, where necessary, specifically address barriers to labour market equality. Though most PES still lack an overarching strategy to tackle gender discrimination the adoption of gender equality as an explicit objective within the renewed PES network mandate is a very positive development, which presents significant potential to enhance the PES focus on this issue, and make a substantial and very significant contribution to EU development in this crucial area of employment and labour market policy.

        "Study Report on PES approaches to the promotion of gender equality 49 2020 A NNEX : Q UESTIONNAIRE Questionnaire to support small-scale study - PES approaches to combat Gender inequality in the labour market The EU has made significant progress in gender equality in recent decades. Encouraging trends are the higher number of women on the labour market and their progress in securing better education and training. Unfortunately, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis is endangering the improvements achieved in women\u2019s labour market participation and now more than ever PES commitment is needed in this area of intervention. Additional shortages in labour demand to those already present before the crisis have worsened women\u2019s conditions. Statistics show that before the COVID-19 crisis compared to men, women were less likely to work full-time, more likely to be employed in lower-paid occupations, and less likely to progress in their careers. As a result, gender pay gaps were persisting and women were more likely to end their lives in poverty. Expectations are now even worse as in many Member States women have been most affected by the crisis: they are more likely to work in part-time, fixed term and precarious forms of work and in the sectors most affected such as the hotel restaurant and catering sector, culture and communication, childcare/family/domestic care activities. Furthermore, the interruption of schooling and childcare services during the lockdown has further hindered women\u2019s participation more than that of men, as family and care commitments are still primarily considered women\u2019s dutie s in most of the EU countries. The overall impact of the crisis has been to push women out of the labour market: consequently, the number of inactive women has increased. The Commission 2020 PES Work Programme therefore included a Gender Equality Strategy to address the key challenges that women still face, including a lack of economic independence and reduced access to the labour market. PES can contribute to reducing gender gaps by applying a gender lens in their services such as career guidance, counselling, ALMPs and raising the awareness of stakeholders (in particular employers) and wider society. The aim of this small-scale study is to explore the role and activities of PES in: alleviating labour market gender inequality, contributing to national gender equality strategic frameworks and applying measures which address women\u2019s labour market integration and enhance their employability. The study is also intended to identify promising and good PES Practices. Thank you for agreeing to contribute to this study by filling in this survey. It will take you a maximum of approximately 30 minutes. Your response will be central to obtaining an overview on existing measures for alleviating labour market gender inequalities.
