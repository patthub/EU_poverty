        "Is \u2018Competitive Europe\u2019 compatible with \u2018Social Europe\u2019? The Foundation Forum 2006 promises to be even more lively and pertinent than ever before, with a line-up including high-profile speakers, expert participants and a very hot topic for discussion. On 2\u20133 November, the third Foundation Forum will attempt to find answers to the following fundamental questions: are the models of a competitive Europe and Social Europe partners or rivals? To what extent are the various European social models compatible with competitiveness? More specifically, the Forum will look at how recent trends in globalisation, new technologies and the ongoing economic integration of Europe influence the relationships between social models and competitiveness. While the Forum may not be able to give definitive answers to the questions, it should shed light on one of the most pressing issues facing Europe today. The two-day conference will be hosted by Miche\u00e1l Martin TD, Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Taoiseach Bertie Ahern (Irish Prime Minister) will open the conference with an address on competitive Ireland in a social Europe. Jeremy Rifkin, President of the Foundation on Economic Trends (USA) and Hans-Werner Sinn, Munich University, will then explore whether the Lisbon aim of competitiveness is feasible, appropriate or desirable for Europe. More about the Foundation Forum 2006 on www.eurofound.europa.eu/events/forum2006/ Promoting flexible working time arrangements The Foundation will present findings from its research on working time and work\u2013life balance to European policymakers, in a seminar organised jointly with the European Parliament. Working time has long been a central element in political and social debate in the European Union. The duration, organisation and predictability of working time raise questions about the health, well-being and wider social life of workers, and about the productivity, efficiency and competitiveness of enterprises. However, despite a growing number of working time options available to employees in companies, the actual take-up of some options (home or teleworking, long-term leave) remains limited in practice.

Over the past 50 years, Member States have strived to reconcile economic and social goals \u2013 with varying degrees of success. However, over the same period, the global economic environment in which Europe operates has changed dramatically: the Union\u2019s global competitiveness depends more than ever on a highly motivated and well- educated labour force. In such an environment, the potential for policy to promote greater productivity and competitiveness has never been greater. But is a highly developed social model a luxury that only affluent nations can afford, and only when times are good? Or is it a vital element in a well- functioning, competitive market economy? Research suggests that a high degree of competitiveness is compatible with an extensive (even an expensive) social model. Most of the new EU Member States cannot currently afford to adopt the extensive social models of the Nordic countries or Germany; they can, however, make choices according to their own strengths and limitations. The challenge is to apply the principles of the European social model to their individual social, economic and institutional circumstances. We hope that the work of the Foundation and the discussions at the upcoming Foundation Forum 2006 in November can provide some guidelines and recommendations as to how this be can achieved. This month, the Foundation\u2019s Governing Board will meet to adopt its programme of work for 2007. On 17 October, in a joint initiative with the European Parliament, the Foundation will present its qualitative and quantitative research on working time and work\u2013life balance to high- level policymakers in Brussels.

Industrial relations in the print media sector Europe\u2019s print media sector has lost its prime position in the organised labour movement \u2013 with its history of creating trade unions and developing industrial relations practices \u2013 due to industry-wide rationalisation, consolidation, and digitalisation over the past two decades. The changes, which have had profound effects on industrial relations in the sector, have effectively restructured the industry from a labour-intensive industry with a large pool of employees to technologically advanced work carried out by a limited number of workers. The latest comparative survey of industrial relations in Europe\u2019s media sector from the Foundation\u2019s Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) points out, however, that these changes have also created a disproportionate number of precarious contracts in part-time work, distance working, and teleworking. The new study, covering 18 EU Member States, focuses on changes in employment levels and practices, the views of employers and trade unions, and the level of social dialogue and industrial conflict. Read the full report online at www.eiro.eurofound.europa.eu/2006/08/study/ Food and drink industry in Europe Increased international competition and the elimination of trade barriers, coupled with stringent food safety regulations, new consumer trends and technological advances, are drivers that challenge the future structure and competitiveness of Europe\u2019s food and beverage industry. The Foundation\u2019s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) will gather together leading industry actors, including social partners, policy makers and experts, to find ways to tackle these at a workshop in Dublin on 23\u201324 October. Building on the successful concept of involving all participants in scenario building and group work to share experiences based on EMCC research, the seminar entitled \u2018Feeding Europe\u2019 will provide a greater insight into the sector and offer practical tools on how to anticipate and manage change in companies and organisations.

Project participants will meet in Dubrovnik, Croatia, in early October to plan the next steps, which includes how to seek administrative and financial support from the European Commission (DG Enlargement, and DG Social Affairs and Employment) and to learn about online tools that are available as help to realise their plans. The project, initiated in 2005, brings together social partners, government representatives and researchers in an effort to collectively find ways of building solid social dialogue to promote employment, better working conditions and industrial relations. Learn more about this project on www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/socialdialogue.htm Job satisfaction and working conditions Almost four out of five workers in Europe consider themselves as either \u2018very satisfied\u2019 or \u2018satisfied\u2019 with their job, according to Foundation research. However, there are large differences in the levels of perception of job satisfaction in the former EU15 countries and in the new Member States. The Foundation\u2019s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO), which reports on trends and developments in working conditions in the EU, aims to raise awareness of the issue among national authorities and social partners by holding a seminar on job satisfaction and working conditions during the Finnish EU Presidency. The event, to be held in Helsinki on 9\u201310 November, will outline the positive and negative factors contributing to job satisfaction and put them into an EU perspective with the help of new findings from the Foundation\u2019s fourth European Working Conditions Survey.
