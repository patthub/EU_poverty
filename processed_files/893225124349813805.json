        "European Economic and Social Committee The EESC 's activities during the Slovenian Presidency July \u2013 December 2021 ",
        "Slovenia now holds the Presidency of the Council of the EU for the second time. And for the second time, the presidency comes at a challenging moment: in 2008, it was just after the onset of the financial crisis, and in 2021, Europe is still dealing with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is no wonder that one of the presidency\u2019s key priorities focuses on the EU\u2019s preparedness for and resilience to crises \u2013 particularly in the areas of pandemics and health, but also of cybersecurity. The EESC is looking forward to working closely with the Slovenian Presidency, especially since our priorities are closely aligned: the EESC is also focusing on recovery, on fair, green and digital transitions, and on defending the rule of law. Another central topic is the Conference on the Future of Europe, as the majority of its tasks will need to be implemented during the Slovenian presidency, with a view to concluding the Conference in 2022. I welcome the presidency\u2019s supportive stance, having stated that the voice of the EESC must be heard. I am convinced that the EESC\u2019s exploratory opinions on adult learning, sustainable quality work during and after recovery, inclusive digitalisation, and fair food chains will provide valuable input to the Slovenian presidency\u2019s work in these fields. I am looking forward to our joint initiatives and discussions, and I would like to wish the Slovenian leadership every success in guiding the EU into the post-COVID-19 era!

        "In the last few years, the European Union has faced a variety of challenges that have taken a heavy toll on our lives. An exceptional, additional test has emerged with the pandemic, to which the European Union has responded with unity, solidarity and \u2013 we can hopefully now say \u2013 success. Now the time has come for recovery, for building a crisis-resilient Europe, a safe and credible Europe that respects its fundamental values and principles, and for turning to Europe\u2019s future again. The Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU will focus on adopting decisions and measures that will allow us to move forward successfully on the path to recovery and together shape an even better, greener, fairer and more socially-oriented future for Europe, where it is strong both on the inside and in its relations with the outside world. A key task for Slovenia during its EU Council presidency will be to strengthen the Union\u2019s resilience in crises, including by ensuring the EU\u2019s open strategic autonomy and the recovery of the European economy, based on the digital and green transitions. We will be paying particular attention to pandemic preparedness and also to other strategic challenges, one of which is cybersecurity. The Conference on the Future of Europe will be taking place during Slovenia\u2019s presidency; a key element of which will be a debate with the European public as to what kind of Union they want. During our Council presidency, we will be endeavouring to ensure an open, inclusive debate aimed at finding answers together to the challenges that lie ahead. During its presidency, Slovenia will be steering discussions with a view to promoting the rule of law as a shared European value and will strive to preserve the European way of life. Respect for the EU\u2019s fundamental values and principles is indeed essential for the functioning of the EU as a whole and for its legal order. We will also be contributing to bringing EU interests and values to bear effectively on the world stage. In the EU\u2019s external relations, two key priorities in particular will be to strengthen transatlantic relations and to support the countries of the Western Balkans in their convergence with the European Union. At the core of our work will be efforts to step up the EU\u2019s security, the debate on the future of the Schengen area, and the issue of migration. Europe is facing major challenges, but there are also opportunities for progress, which we can only achieve if we act in as coordinated a manner as possible. The European Economic and Social Committee\u2019s support for the Slovenian presidency\u2019s ambitious objectives is therefore of the utmost importance because, as the voice of organised civil society, the EESC is making a valuable contribution to tackling the difficult challenges that lie ahead.
