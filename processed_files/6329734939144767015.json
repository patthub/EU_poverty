        "Preface From 18 to 20 October 1999, an International Conference on \"Policies and Statistics in the European Union: Challenges and Responses\" was held at the Berlin House of Parliament. It was jointly organised by the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. The conference, which was attended by about 180 guests from the political, business and academic communities, was aimed at making stat isticians and the general public aware of the demands made on statistics on the eve of the 21st century. The theme was dealt with in four sessions: challenges in the information society; regional and structural policies; social and labour market policies; economic and monetary policies. Our special thanks are due to all speakers and participants whose speeches and contributions helped to make the conference a success. The conference succeeded in revealing the current major challenges to official statistics in Europe. The dialogue between the producers of official statistics, i. e. the statistical offices, and the users of official statistics in the political, business and academic communities is of funda mental importance for the further development of official statistics at the national and Euro pean levels. This is illustrated clearly by the present volume, which contains all the speeches and summaries of the plenary discussions.

        "Johann Hahlen*) Welcoming address Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you all to our conference on \"Policies and Statistics in the European Union\" in the Berlin House of Parliament. I am particularly pleased to wel come you in the German capital. I trust that you understand this feeling of pleasure of a Ger man statistician. We have invited you to a historical place, to the old conference building of the Prussian state parliament, where the Parliament of the Land Berlin and the city of Berlin, has held its meetings for several years now. You have probably read in the newspapers that the people of Berlin have elected a new Parliament only last week. Exactly one month from now, on 18 November, that new Parliament will convene for its constituent assembly in this very room. I am pleased that we can hold our conference at this place of great parliamentary importance. First I should like to give my sincere thanks to my colleague, Director General Yves Franchet, for his collaboration in the organisation of this conference. Without his active assistance, without the considerable financial contribution made by Eurostat and without the close coop eration of many Eurostat colleagues this would have been impossible! Thank you very much, dear colleague, for agreeing to hold this European conference here in Berlin. I should also like to extend my thanks to my Berlin colleague, the head of the Land Statistical Office of Berlin, Prof. Appel, for granting us access to these venerable parliamentary surroundings. Thank you very much, dear Prof. Appel, also for joining us here though in your function of Returning Officer for the Land of Berlin you successfully held the important elections to the Parliament of the Land of Berlin only one week ago. Many heads of Land statistical offices are among us today, and I apologise for not welcoming them all by name. I am pleased to see that quite a number of heads of statistical institutes from other countries are here today already, and not only from the European Union. I should also like to welcome those speakers who are already here with us. First of all let me welcome the representative of the country which holds the presidency of the European Union (EU), and that is Finland. Welcome to Berlin, dear Timo Relander, I am glad that after the brilliant Conference of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Helsinki in August this year you have found the time and taken the trouble of joining us here. A cordial welcome also to a colleague who is new in our circle, my Swedish colleague \u00d6berg. Dear Mr. \u00d6berg, welcome to Berlin and to the circle of European statisticians. Among us are also Prof. Dr. Martin-Guzman, our Spanish colleague, and our Danish colleague, Mr. Plovsing. A cordial welcome to both of you. Finally, I should like to welcome our Swiss colleague Malaguerra, hoping that he will not feel overwhelmed by the presence of so many representatives of the EU. But so far he has always succeeded in holding his position as a Swiss statistician, and I trust it will not be otherwise at this conference. Among us are quite a number of colleagues from institutions we cooperate closely with in Germany and Europe. Let me mention the European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres (CEIES), let me mention our large industrial *) Johann Hahlen, President, Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Wiesbaden.

        "Welcoming address associations. It is a great pleasure for me to welcome all representatives of these associations and institutions. The same holds true, of course, for the ministries, many of which moved to Berlin in July already. Several colleagues from Bonn have also travelled to Berlin, I am pleased that you are here. Finally I should like to welcome the President of the German Sta tistical Society, Prof. Wilrich, who as a Berliner enjoys the favour of the place. After ex tending my welcomes let me thank my staff who spent much time and effort on the prepa ration of the conference during the last few weeks. At the beginning of my speech I pointed out that we have met here in a parliamentary building. Let me cast a look back into the past. This evening we will be able to visit the Reichstag together. The Reichstag was the first building of the German Reich erected for a parliament in Berlin; it was opened in December 1894. This summer we had the pleasure of seeing it in parliamentary action again with the German Bundestag. The building we are in at this moment is nearly ten years younger, it is the parliamentary building of the old state of Prussia: the building in which we have met today was erected for the Prussian Upper Chamber and the Prussian Parliament only after the Reichstag, although in a very antiquated democratic tradition. At that time the Prussian state parliament was still elected according to the three-class electoral system, while the Reichstag was already elected on the basis of equal suffrage for everyone; however, only men aged 25 and over had the right to vote. As a conse quence, for instance, five out of six Berlin members of the Reichstag were Social Democrats to the last days of the German Reich because universal and equal suffrage applied in the case of the Reichstag, while due to the three-class electoral system another party remained in power in the Prussian state parliament, the National Liberals. And as a footnote to the story: While in 1912 the Social Democratic Party (SPD) had the support of three fourths of the Berlin electorate here in Berlin, one week ago it was only just under one fourth when the Berlin Parliament was elected. That much about the place where we have assembled. Now for our conference: We intend to cover the relation of politics and statistics within two and a half days. I feel that it is really necessary to discuss this subject because in Germany, in all Member States of the EU and also in the EU itself, now represented by the European Parliament, we experience a specific conflict. On the one hand, great demands are made on official statistics, on the timeliness of the data, while on the other hand our resources, be it in terms of personnel, be it in terms of finance, are not increased but reduced. One of my colleagues put it this way: \"We have to knit a bigger and bigger pullover with less and less wool!\" About fifty years ago, in November 1950, the mayor of this city at the time, Prof. Reuter, opened a general meeting of German municipal statisticians. It is interesting to note that the subject of that conference was almost identical with ours today, it was also statistics and politics. The conference dealt with the question of what statistics can do for politics and vice versa, what statistics may expect from politics. It is obvious that the last fifty years have not brought about essential changes in this conflict. We know from our many conferences in Brussels, in Luxembourg and in the capitals of the Member States that we are faced with ever more urgent requirements originating from the Maastricht criteria, the Stability and Growth Pact, and last but not least the European Central Bank. In contrast, we statisticians find that we are listened to only seldom and that our resources remain cut, at least here in Germany. Two years ago we held a German statistical conference in Dresden, with the Minister- President of the Land of Saxony, Prof. Biedenkopf, participating. In his speech he drew our Federal Statistical Office. Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 7 ",
        "Johann Hahlen attention to an observation we can but confirm from own experience, namely that the sphere of politics is partly not very willing to face reality. Politicians who are unwilling to face facts have little interest in statistics and in those who process and document reality. In this context Prof. Biedenkopf reminded us of Berthold Brechts drama \"Galileo Galilei\". Having set up his telescope in the midst of the cardinals at the papal court, the great astronomer asked the cardinals to look through the telescope to see that Jupiter in fact has a moon of its own. However, those cardinals declined, they did not want to look through the telescope. They were willing only to discuss the question of whether there might be a moon or not, but they refused to face reality through the telescope! I think that we statisticians sometimes expe rience just the same. We have the telescope, that is the data, and we have processed them so they can be understood. But those with decision-making power in politics refuse to take note of the data, they only want to discuss them politically. And as we all know, political assess ment is the point where our competence ends. At this conference we intend to shed some light on that conflict. We have formed four groups of subjects to be treated in individual sessions: 1. Challenges in the information society 2. Regional and structural policies 3. Social and labour market policies 4. Economic and monetary policies We have managed to recruit very renowned speakers for this conference. A special welcome to our first speaker, Prof. Spinner, who has come from Karlsruhe to join us here. Unfortu nately, Prof. Spinner's co-speaker, Dr. Stolorz, Chairman of the managing board of the Ploenzke AG, has informed us this morning that he cannot come, he is still in Munich en gaged in important business negotiations for his company and much to his regret he cannot leave these very important negotiations. I hope that you will understand. For that reason, Prof. Spinner will speak to us first this afternoon - after some introductory remarks by our colleague, Mr. Relander- then we will have a coffee break, and after that we can look forward to Mr. \u00d6berg's speech. But now my colleague Yves Franchet will speak to you, fo cusing on European aspects. Again I should like to say 'Welcome to Berlin', and I do hope that you will have pleasant memories of these Berlin days. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Yves Franchet*^ Welcoming address Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, As the century is drawing to a close, it becomes apparent that the political decision-makers in the European Union (EU) make increasing use of statistics. The rapid and ambitious process of European integration and, above all, the 11 Member States' decision to introduce a single currency has placed EU statistics in the limelight. Statistics and currencies have a great deal in common. Just as the value of a currency, the value of statistics depends on the trust users put in them. Yet, ordinary citizens certainly prefer having some currency in their pockets than statistics. In an increasingly complex, incomprehensible and deregulated society, the production of trustworthy and reliable statistics is a permanent challenge. Where do we stand in the EU, what challenges does the future hold? I hope that this seminar, that we have organised together with the Federal Statistical Office, will provide some responses to the numerous challenges we shall have to meet. I give the floor to Timo Relander. *) Yves Franchet, Director General, Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), Luxembourg.

        "5j\u00a1\\ Timo Relander > Challenges in the information society Introductory remarks Official statistics are expected, first and foremost, to give an accurate account of what is going on in society. They must be able to provide numerical information and support to decision-makers. For this purpose, the description and measurement of the information society development has been introduced in most statistical offices over the 1990s. As the amount of information rapidly increases, it is more and more important that statistical offices are able to produce data on social and economic development in a compact and understand able form. The interest areas of information society statistics are wide-ranging. For example, telecom munications markets have been revised and liberalised through legislation, and a growing number of legislative initiatives on electronic commerce are also underway. Consequently, attention has been focused on business prospects and competitive edges. The development of labour markets, innovation and education is also significant for the information society. Other areas of interest include such questions as the openness of information networks, copyright, data security and protection of privacy. In addition, the abilities of individual citizens and companies to take advantage of the new electronic services are followed closely in many countries. The information needs of companies have also grown immensely. In the new markets, de mand, supply and competition conditions are changing fast. The information society can thus render more efficiency to individuals, companies and nations alike. Only efficiency, in rela tion to competitors, can lead to a positive change. Real-time business activities are increasing rapidly. Companies are merging and sectors converge all the time. Furthermore, investors show a great deal of interest towards the new growth areas of the information society. Accumulation of capital is essential for the devel opment of the information and communications sector. One of the central objectives should thus be a policy that will strengthen the confidence of capital markets in the development of the sector. The significance of information as a basis of decision-making will gain more em phasis, although intuition and the \"I think\" principle have not lost their significance for every one. In this situation, national statistical institutes are faced with an increasing demand for hard facts on the information society, or knowledge-based economy. The development of infor mation society statistics is part of a long line of projects in the 1990s, by which national statistical institutes and the international statistical community have improved statistical descriptions of new phenomena. Moreover, several new challenges are involved in carrying out the collection, processing and dissemination of statistical data. For example, the present international standards relating to statistical concepts, definitions and classifications are not always relevant to the description of the information society. In addition, it is not sufficient that we develop international standards, but they should appear timely and be followed as well. *) Timo Relander, Director Genera), Statistics Finland, Helsinki. 10 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Challenges in the information society - Introductory remarks In measuring the informational elements of the economy we lie far behind the measurement of conventional goods production - and we still have great difficulties in describing and measuring conventional service sectors, too. The new service sectors and informational elements are now, however, the driving force of the economy. Official statistics should thus be able to describe both regressive, static and dynamic activities as well as possible. The present speed of progress is truly breathtaking. This same logic of development also applies to scientific information. Since the amount of information, as is claimed, doubles almost every ten years, researchers living now will soon see a world where more scientific information is produced in one minute than anybody will have time to read in their entire life. At the moment, the information society is developed in various places without having an accurate definition of its contents. Huge sums are allocated by the public sector in support of the desired development, but we have hardly any systematic means to measure what is achieved. Other important topics, such as sustainable development, should also be considered alongside the advance of the information society. Consequently, we should be prepared for a flexible change both when setting social objectives, and when selecting new ways of measuring the direction and rate of change in the economy and society. Furthermore, information society issues have a clear global dimension. International cooper ation in this area has been very close. Collaboration in the European Union (EU), Organisa tion for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other international organi sations is important for developing the framework of the information society. The strong demand for international models extends to the development of statistics, too. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with just having good national statistical systems and leave international statistics in disarray, because this will undermine official statistics at the national level as well. No more can we talk only about European problems and applications when measuring the global economy. We all share this problem. The USA, Canada and Mexico, for example, apply their own industrial classifications. As we all know, one of our objects, in fact, is to compare the development of different economies and economic areas. A further statistical problem involved in comparisons between countries and continents concerns the distribution of software production, as well as the expansion of information technology and its use by households and companies. It is the duty of the public sector to develop the framework of the information society to meet the needs of citizens and companies by means of legislation, research and education. The public sector should also advance the progress of generally applicable technology and infra structure. The specific task of official statistics is to produce numerically measurable infor mation on the state of society. The information society has been a subject of statistical study and general interest in Finland for almost twenty years. At the moment, Statistics Finland is involved in three large projects that measure its effect on people's everyday life. The interview survey 'The Finns and the Future Information Society' is a second study of information society skills, expectations and experiences of Finns as users of the new information technology. The time use survey will, in due course, give us a picture of the changes in overall time use. In addition, Finland has been an active participant in the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). Statistics Finland has Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 11 ",
        "Timo Relander also compiled and published two special studies describing the information society devel opment during the past two years, On the Road to the Finnish Information Society, volumes one and two. The portfolio of the Finnish government contains several key objectives that aim to develop the information society. They have to do with the development of people's skills, research and education and the evolution of information networks and the services offered by them. Connecting administration, companies and homes to the information society is a national objective that has an impact on the whole society - with telework, electronic public services and electronic commerce as its direct consequences. Applications of distance learning and telemedicine have already transformed the nature of entire operational activities. To this end, the Finnish government has set up a special National Committee for Information Society Issues to promote important objectives related to the development of the information society, and to act as a co-operative foi urn between different bodies. The development of the information society does not, however, progress uniformly in the whole country or among various population groups. In Finland, for example, new jobs are created in places where most of them already exist. In theory, the information society makes it possible for us to work outside our usual workplaces. The general policies of each country or region will determine how often this will really happen. Different population groups have not acquired mobile phones, PCs or Internet connections at an equal rate. Although sending text messages or e-mail and making cashpoint transactions are nowadays commonplace to many Finns, we must remember that part of the population does not use these services for various reasons, at least not yet. It is essential that the statistical description of the develop ment of the information society include questions of equality between sexes, generations and regions, not to mention possible or even visible polarisation between various population groups We are faced with very important statistical challenges in the information society. We need information, for example, about the following issues: 1. telecommunications and information networks, 2. information and communications technology applications and services intended for the general public, 3. education and entry into the labour markets, 4. business, production and foreign trade, 5. employment and productivity, 6. use of information technology in business and at work, 7. information society and private homes and leisure, and 8. research and development work on hardware and software. Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming closer to an information society in our modern economies. The next question is: what will come after it? 12 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner*) Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society Abstract This presentation is based on the Karlsruhe approach to the integrated study of knowledge. Its aim is to apply the problems raised and the solutions proposed in that research to some interdisciplinary topics related to official statistics. This is accomplished on three levels: First, basic reflections on the order of knowledge of official statistics, which is similar to the academic order of knowledge. Second, diagnoses of the substance of knowledge, for the sort of knowledge represented by statistical data. Third, functional analyses of the activities in the social division of knowledge activities, with respect to the knowledge contributions (and also knowledge deficits) of official statistics to the process of solving social problems within the interaction of leading information, counter- information, and disinformation. Regarding the role and the function of official statistics in the societal knowledge economy, questions are asked about its contributions to the basic and supplementary public information services for the information society; information policy and order policy; the statistical style of knowledge and the statistical image of society; specific contributions and deficits; broader functions in the strategic triangle of leading information, counter-information, disinformation; the role of processes of solving social problems by way of knowledge. Introduction How are visions of the knowledge society, the contributions of knowledge theory and the functions of official statistics interrelated? To explain something means to put it into a broader context, a context that should be as comprehensive and instructive as possible. It requires a context that is relevant in terms of meaning and subject matter, a context which may at first sight seem quite far-fetched and to have little in common with the subject we are discussing. This context does not have to be plausible from the outset and it does not have to fit in easily into our usual ways of thinking. As for official statistics, into what context could it possibly be placed other than the context into which it was put by the legislature which gave it the constitutional function of generating statistics for federal purposes (Art. 73 No. 11 Basic Law) and which made it an element of the public administration, where it is now firmly established in line with its own self-image? What else should official statistics do other than to perform its official function in the best way possible, which according to the Federal Statistics Law of 22 January 1987 is to collect, process, present, analyse and publish data about social facts? Isn't this challenge enough? If *) Prof. Dr. Helmut F. Spinner, University of Karlsruhe. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 13 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner that were so, the statisticians at this Conference could have left it at that and could have stayed among themselves. But here I am as someone who is not a statistician nor a specialist, to perform the function of an external consultant, to point a finger at the professional bias of the insiders and to eliminate any prejudices they might have.') I will therefore try to present some useful external criteria for this institution which is so well-established in modern society and which plays such a central role in our country. For this purpose I will put the following topics into close context (which does not mean that this can be done easily or without some friction): On the one hand there is the vision of the knowledge society, a term which I use as an abbreviation for the more recent developments in cognitive technology in the entire sphere of knowledge and for the contemporary cognitive situation of modern society. On the other hand there is official statistics, a constitutional element with the function that I have just described, a function which should not only be perpetuated but extended and which should perhaps even be radically changed. And as the connecting element between these two there is the concept of \"knowledge\" which permeates both of these elements and the entire set of instruments used in the Karlsruhe approach to the integrated study of knowledge. The connecting element is \"knowledge\", and the elements being connected are the sorts of knowledge, the institutions of knowledge, the knowledge activities in society. In this sense official statistics is a participant in all these elements: It partakes in the socially relevant sorts of knowledge through statistical data as a sort of empirical knowledge; it partakes in society's ways of gaining knowledge through the additive style of knowledge that is apparent in the matter-of-fact mode of its reports on society; it partakes in the knowledge institutions through its statistical offices and experts; it partakes in knowledge activities through its information, consultation and documentation functions. This requires a lucid explanation and critical examination. 1 Questions about the role and function of official statistics in the knowledge society The idea that the knowledge society must give its citizens something useful, namely knowledge for problem-solving, is not a compromise formula in the sense of the lowest common denominator but a formula that is capable of enhancement and improvement. The improved and enhanced definition is: The knowledge society is a well-informed society, a society which must become increasingly better informed. A recent vision tells us: In the complete knowledge society, all the knowledge of the world will be available to everyone, everywhere, at once, and free of charge. 2 ) But this requires that the non-technological infrastructures which are lagging behind must first be upgraded to the level of development that has already been achieved in the technological core structures. What contribution can official statistics make? This question must be asked twice, on two levels, to different respondents, for different tasks, with different possibilities for a response. On the empirical and statistical level - at the forefront of the statistical information process, from the collection to the processing, analysis and dissemination of data to intermediaries and end users - this question is about the functions, objectives, means and methods of statistics. 1) On this, see Litz, Lipowatz(1986, p. 5): \"A systematic analysis of the contributions and deficits of the statistical information services is thus to be expected more from outside the statistical services.\" 2) Emphatically demanded in Grau, Spinner, Nicolai (1996). 14 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society This first question can naturally be answered only by statistical experts who can make use of their specialist knowledge and the inside information that is available to their profession and their institutions. This picture is made complete by the supporting regulations produced by government, law, empirical social research, information and communication technologies. On the theoretical and programmatic level, this question is about the role of official statistics in the societal knowledge economy and about the function of its contributions of empirical data and statistical information to the processes of solving social problems. To answer this second question it is useful to put official statistics into context: not just into its own context but into the broader context which includes the total cognitive situation of society, the func tional division of knowledge activities, the regulatory orders, the huge stores of information in society, and the information flows which feed them. Seen in this light, official statistics is only one of many knowledge institutions like academia, the media, art and literature, the administration, the numerous information services of modern society. In terms of the substance of knowledge, the same also applies to the related sorts of knowledge, that is, the theoretical knowledge of science, the occasional knowledge produced in journalism through on-the-spot investigation, administrative information, statistical data knowledge, the fictitious and counterfactual potential knowledge of utopias and visions, etc. This brings to view the government agencies, businesses, social security institutions and security services (police, secret services, private detective agencies), if not as information producers then at least as collectors and users of information. However, despite their many similarities, they all have different functions. To compare the different information pro grammes pursued by statistical institutes it would be instructive to consider the two parallel institutions located in Wiesbaden, the Federal Statistical Office and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, which appear as members of one family although they maintain their mutual distance. 3 ) Using this question as a guide I would now like to write a scenario on the cognitive situation of the information society and to locate the position and function of offi cial statistics in it: First, in terms of order policy, with a view to the provisions and conditions defining the general frame of reference for official statistics in society: - What order or what regulatory regime (legal, economic, technological) is imposed upon statistics? Does statistics have or does it require an autonomous order of its own, as aca demia has in the freedom of teaching and research according to Art. 5 (3) of the Basic Law, as the public-sector media have? Second, in terms of the substance of knowledge, with a view to the specific sort of knowl edge represented by statistical information and to its position in the societal sphere of knowl edge in accordance with the coordinates of information theory and knowledge theory: - What sort of knowledge is statistical information,- compared to other sorts of knowledge (especially those that give us information about society)? 3) For the most recent critical comparison, see Dietl (2000). On the security services and their function of pro viding information about society, see Spinner (1995). Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 15 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner Third, in terms of functions, with a view to integrating the statistical knowledge activities (data collection, processing, analysis) into the social division of knowledge activities: - What knowledge services are performed by official statistics in the context of the social division of knowledge activities, supplementary to and in competition with academic re search, journalistic investigation, public and private administration, etc.? These three questions have raised more problems than I can handle in a single presentation, and I will therefore use them as a guide and limit my discussion to a few major topics. 2 The information society's cognitive map as an aid to orientation In the following I will draw a rough sketch of the information society's cognitive map for the purpose of locating the position of statistical data knowledge in it. For this it will suffice to have a general outline that can give us a good overview. It will consolidate a few areas (though not without some overlaps and conflicts) and provide an orientation pattern along cognitive markings which are like watersheds between the sorts of knowledge, the knowledge activities, the levels of understanding, the technological developments, etc. There are six basic divisions in the cognitive map, but there are also some overlaps: First, the societal sectors of knowledge are divided into academic and non-academic, with academia on one side and everyday life on the other side of this dichotomy of cultures. Second, the locations of knowledge activity and storage are divided into public and private sectors, or more concretely, into the duality of public-sector and private-sector institutions. Third, the knowledge activities are divided into non-purposive and commercial activities, a concrete manifestation of disinterested and interested objectives, tasks, and regulations. Fourth, levels of knowledge are divided into high and low, that is, criteria-based high-quality information and criteria-free low-quality information, like the \"serious\" and \"light\" categories in music, art, and literature. Fifth, the cognitive instruments are divided into non-technological (natural and cultural, including the traditional cultural techniques of writing and printing) and technological (information and communication technologies). Sixth, the worlds of knowledge are divided into the historical world of experience and the electronic world of networks. (Although the electronic world is a virtual world, it is no less real, and along with its growing use it is also becoming a new type of experienced world). These divisions between academic and everyday, public and private, non-commercial and commercial, high and low, non-technological and technological, real and virtual (which are consciously made distinct through bifurcation) allow us to perform a multi-dimensional pre- structuring of the characteristics of knowledge. Accordingly, the set of characteristics that is generally applicable to official statistics is: non-academic, public, non-commercial, serious 4 ), 4) Parallel to the common distinction between serious and light music, the distinction between criteria-based seri ous knowledge and criteria-free trivial knowledge indicates differences in quality based on relevant criteria. 16 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society increasingly technology-based, increasingly computer-supported. Although the discussion has not yet progressed so far in every respect, this delineation should nevertheless be used for the further orientation. 3 The Karlsruhe approach to the integrated study of knowledge The studies conducted at Karlsruhe include basic research on the permeating categories and attempts to apply them to concrete problems in specific sectors. The following will therefore be a brief introduction to these studies in order to examine their applicability to the functional field of official statistics. Basic research in the integrated study of knowledge concerns three closely interrelated topics: First, studies on an order policy framework for structuring the spheres of knowledge, the knowledge activities, and the stores of knowledge; second, studies on the substance of knowledge for a conceptualisation of the cognitive field and a description of the structural diversity of the sorts of knowledge; third, behavioural studies on the social division of knowledge activities and the functional description of knowledge activities. These studies have led to three basic concepts which shall be applied to official statistics: - the order of knowledge as a framework, and the legal, economic and technological knowl edge regimes which may be established with it; - the modular concept of knowledge of a differential theory of knowledge, for a structural description of all types, quantities and qualities of knowledge and a topography of the societal sphere of knowledge; - the functional model of the social division of knowledge activities and the phase concept for processes of solving social problems. 3.1 A framework concept for the order of knowledge The \"order of knowledge\" project is concerned with basic reflections on an order theory to establish a framework for the world(s) of knowledge and on an order policy to structure it (them) by means of regulations and constraints. This primarily concerns the fundamental distinction between two order alternatives which can briefly be called the non-commercial and the commercial knowledge regimes. Now, at the end of the 20th century, this is just as important as it was earlier, at the beginning of the 19th century. This line of conflict has con tinued until today and radiates out into all spheres of knowledge. It runs through the German dual system of public-sector and private-sector media, and for this reason the importance of the \"order of knowledge\" project for the knowledge society extends far beyond the interests of academia and the specific conditions prevailing at the universities. 3.1.1 The order of knowledge Just as law requires a legal order and the economy requires an economic order, so the world of knowledge requires an order of knowledge that is appropriate to the specific characteristics of the substance of knowledge and to its importance for man, a creature which is curious by nature, which needs knowledge and searches for, uses and enjoys knowledge, not only for survival but more than anything else for its own sake. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 17 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner An order of knowledge must regulate the four basic relations between man and knowledge: The availability of knowledge (for the few or the many); the ways of using knowledge (for specific purposes or entirely disinterested); the relationship between knowledge and action; the relationship between knowledge and power. The old or classical order of knowledge establishes the order policy framework for the major freedoms of knowledge in academic research and in private and public communication. This is done by a more or less consistent uncoupling of these sectors from the exclusionary effect of property rights, from the commitment to tangible interests, from the burden of costs and the liability for consequential damages, and from the external interventionist powers of gov ernment, the church, and even business. The autonomous order of knowledge for the academic freedom of teaching and research and for the citizen's constitutionally guaranteed freedom of opinion and information postulates the following fourfold separation: - the separation of knowledge and property, to make freely accessible knowledge possible; - the separation of ideas and interests, to facilitate a disinterested handling of knowledge as a precaution against committed ideologies; - the separation of theory and practice, to effect an exoneration from the constraints of decisions and actions; and - the separation of knowledge institutions and the government, to ensure independence. The order of knowledge is in a way built into specific spheres of knowledge, and just a few key words will suffice to sum up that ancient European cultural heritage which demands of society an ideal knowledge constitution in order to secure by means of an order policy: the free availability of ownerless knowledge, the disinterestedness of orientation to the truth, the exoneration of actions in academic research and in the expression of personal views, and freedom from government interference in most institutions of knowledge, from academia to the mass media. These provisions make the world of knowledge (with few exceptions) into an ex-territorial realm of higher quality standards and greater freedoms, but these are not satisfied everywhere or automatically. From the perspective of the history of knowledge institutions, the model for this condition is the university type called Humboldt's university. It is evident that official statistics comes close to this model, but some reservations must be made due to its functions. 3.1.2 Models of order policy and knowledge policy For the further development of the information society into the knowledge society, with improved information possibilities and secure knowledge freedoms, we have prepared a few recommendations which I will just mention briefly and without comment for reasons of space. Some of these recommendations are just as congenial to official statistics and can be used for the order policy framework of official statistics. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society (1) Basic knowledge freedoms under all knowledge regimes: Freedom of modification for the purpose of improvement through criticism and refutation; freedom from encroach ment as a protection against information interference; distribution freedom for public information. (2) Independent institutions of knowledge without external controls: Room for development in societal zones of freedom especially established for the formation of personal views, the public expression of opinions, academic research, journalistic investigation. (3) Equal opportunity for leading information and counter-information: Order policy means to facilitate the free flow of information in all directions, not just for the criteria- free information (and/or disinformation) in entertainment and advertising. (4) Order pluralism instead of monopolistic knowledge regimes: No order monism of a totalitarian polity or universal economy. (5) Order-fields of knowledge for different problem situations: Quality fields for the higher- level standards of knowledge in science, education, information; distribution fields for public knowledge and the formation of personal views; protection fields for privacy, utilisation and secrecy spheres protected against information interference and misuse. (6) Liability and improper use regulations: Free access and free use regulations and liberal liability rules for the non-commercial handling of knowledge, with an extensive exoner ation from liabilities; stricter regulations for commercial uses. (7) Infrastructure of criticism: Corrective institutions for the continuous verification of knowledge, public criticism, and rapid error elimination. (8) Public information services for a knowledge-based participation in social and political life: Equal cognitive opportunities and equitable knowledge-based participation of citi zens through unobstructed access to socially significant, interesting and politically rele vant sorts and stores of knowledge. (9) Informational self-determination: On the high level of knowledge of well-informed discussion participants, that is, if possible not from a weak position of knowledge by means of legal defences and technical protection but from a strong position of informa tional symmetry. (10) Effective division of knowledge activities: Instead of only an internal division of linked knowledge activities within an organisation according to hierarchical and administrative views, an all-round coordination according to the functional requirements of job descriptions, performance criteria, professional qualifications. (11) Decentralised organisation of knowledge to prevent a monopolistic power of knowl edge: Flat networks accessible from below and outside (non-discriminating), broad- range (global), densely knit (networked), all-round (interactive), and multiply transmit ting (multi-media). (12) Dual strategy of technological and non-technological means: Competing technological and non-technological means to use the entire solution potential of state-of-the-art knowledge and techniques.

        "Helmut F. Spinner 3.2 The \"sorts of knowledge\" project 3.2.1 A new knowledge concept for all types, quantities and qualities of knowledge When we consider the substance of what is called the world of knowledge, the sphere of knowledge, the cognitive field, etc. we see a vast medley of numerous types, sorts, styles and activities of knowledge. With the exception of a few fields of knowledge that are easily defined, rather homogeneous, and the subject of intensive research - science, the subject of scientific theory; news, the subject of journalism- all this is still a largely unexplored field. What the diversity of knowledge requires is not the idea that everything is communication, information, knowledge (because this throws everything into the same pot, as if it were a stew), but a differential theory of knowledge with precise terms to help untie the package of all types, quantities and qualities of knowledge in order to closely examine its contents. To this end we must liberate the ideas of knowledge, understanding, information, etc. from the philosophical burdens imposed on them and eliminate marks of perfection like the Divine view, the exclusion of alternatives through discriminating epistemological concepts, the safeguard procedures of traditional epistemology and the illusions of certainty in amateur epistemology, and we must give these ideas empirical substance and make them available for practical use. And in addition we have the above-mentioned possibility of and necessity for the dual-track approach with non-technological and technological means. For the analytical clarification and conceptualisation of all types, quantities and qualities of knowledge, the Karlsruhe approach to the integrated study of knowledge uses a new concept of knowledge which is based on these three main components of knowledge (see Table 1, p. 21): - knowledge as (semantic) information; - knowledge as high-quality understanding (e. g., scientific understanding); - knowledge as selected, activated and applied insight, competence and authority. 20 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",

        "Helmut F. Spinner This leads to a differential theory of knowledge for the performance of three tasks which must be accomplished separately but which can then be combined for the result: First, the definition of knowledge as (semantic) information, irrespective of empirical valid ity or pragmatic relevance. This defines the lower substantive limit of all knowledge and thus the entry level for the analysis of knowledge on which the subsequent steps are based. Second, the qualification of knowledge as understanding (i. e., high-quality information: serious knowledge in science, as opposed to trivial knowledge in entertainment, advertising, public relations, amateur epistemology, etc.). Third, the evaluation of knowledge as selected, activated and applied insight, competence and authority in accordance with specific rules of preference (such as for psychological selection, news selection in journalism, the creation of added value through knowledge management, etc.). These are the three knowledge modules for the main components: information, understand ing, and insight or competence. The concept of knowledge constituted of these three compo nents is differentiated in substance and held together as a whole by the following chain of thought: That which is informative (1st dimension) is not necessarily valid (2nd dimension), and that which is valid (true, or otherwise qualified in validity terms) is not necessarily important, worth knowing, useful, usable (3rd dimension). 3.2.2 Styles of knowledge Objects are described on the basis of their characteristics. For this there are two possibilities: Either we make a complete and detailed list of all the individual characteristics, or we specify a few of the most important characteristics. In the first option we add up or summarise all the characteristics in every detail; in the second option we reduce the objects to their underlying structural characteristics which comprise general relations between individual characteristics. These two options correspond to two distinct styles of knowledge and forms of representa tion. My space is limited, and so I will limit my discussion to a comparison of the additive and the theoretical style of knowledge without going into detail on the hybrid and the modified forms. Before the additive style of knowledge was rediscovered and for the first time implemented with technological means through the use of modern information technologies it was regarded as pre-scientific or non-scientific, and the theoretical style of knowledge was regarded as the only truly scientific style of knowledge. After all, the theoretical style of knowledge was the source of the ancient Greek and Western forms of theoretical science, the foundation of all other forms of science. The additive style of knowledge which prevailed prior to ancient Greece is pre-scientific in the sense that it represents the world as the sum of many different details which are combined by parataxis into an additive or summative view of the world. Thus the world is represented in an enumerative, exhaustive and frequently repetitive juxtaposition, temporal sequencing and spatial concentration of lists, rows, series, tables, compilations, accumulations. (Contrasted with parataxis is hypotaxis, the method of super- ordination and sub-ordination.) As a result of the rise of electronic data processing, this style of knowledge is now practised on a large scale and in a modern way, and in the age. of information technology it has become a highly scientific style of knowledge. As diverse as 22 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society the subject matter may be, what is always similar is the (additive) style of knowledge manifested in the data knowledge of all fields, from the data collections of biology 5 ) to those of statistical yearbooks. Opposed to the additive style of knowledge is the theoretical style of knowledge; this was the source of theories from the beginning, and already quite early (i. e. among the ancient Greeks) it became the basis of science. Scientific knowledge in the Greek and Western sense of the word means to express reality in terms of theory, to formulate, test and apply theories in order to understand general relationships, explain concrete details, verify theoretical statements, and guide the practical measures designed for intervention into the relationship of events. 3.3 The \"knowledge activities\" project 3.3.1 The social division of knowledge activities by functional groups The activity for which the order of knowledge establishes a framework and whose essence is analysed with the concept of knowledge is, during its performance, subdivided into many types, agents and areas of knowledge activity. Thus, in the \"knowledge activities\" project we designed afunctional model of the social division of knowledge activities in order to progress from the description of static characteristics and stocktaking to the analysis of dynamic activities. The following provides only a summary of the knowledge activities, functionally subdivided into five groups of activity, without giving a detailed description of the function ally divided activities, in order to locate the position of the statistical knowledge activity. (1) The research and science group of activities in science and research is concerned with the continuous production and sustained improvement of knowledge; it includes the activities: production, application, implementation and utilisation of knowledge. The production, application, implementation and utilisation of knowledge in science and technology are accomplished primarily by science in its various forms (as theory, prac tice, technology, and increasingly also as industry). Viewed from an order policy per spective, this major group of knowledge activities constitutes the most specialised and the most extensive quality field of knowledge (although it is not the only one), due to its high degree of specialisation. (2) The processing group of knowledge activities consists of the processing activities in knowledge processing, where processing is understood in the non-technological sense; this group includes the activities: storage, processing, presentation and linkage of knowl edge. This second major group of knowledge activities is supported by the cognitive technologies and is symbolic of the information age. (3) The documentation group of knowledge activities is concerned with the collection of knowledge for the purpose of its preservation; it includes the functionally similar activi ties: preservation, conservation, administration and disposition of knowledge. These are knowledge-accumulating activities. This is not meant in any derogatory sense, although researchers and scientists regard them as activities which do not require original thought; they are therefore not considered as conducive to obtaining academic laurels. The pur- 5) See Flindt ( 1995) and Gleich et al. (2000). Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 23 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner pose of these activities is to record and incorporate existing information, not to produce new knowledge. The functional homogeneity of this group does not prevent the exis tence of differences between the various concrete tasks. What we have here is not collec tion in the ordinary sense, which smacks of \"carrots and cabbage\", but the stocktaking of knowledge in the sense of a truly non-bureaucratic inventory of knowledge with the aim of preserving it. In view of the central role of technical documentation and its function of protecting against the loss or falsification of knowledge, the knowledge-storing activities of the documentation group can be regarded as doubly important for the protection fields of knowledge in society: as a threat to the protection of data privacy and as protection against information interference. (4) The distribution group of knowledge activities is concerned with the activities: dissemi nation, distribution, transport and transfer of knowledge. This field of activity is current ly experiencing a great expansion due to the many different forms of individual and mass communication, including individualised telecommunication. The distribution of knowl edge into smaller and larger distribution fields of knowledge at the same time defines the framework for the utilisation of knowledge by the few or the many. (5) The utilisation group of knowledge activities in the ordinary practical use of knowledge includes the activities: acquisition, evaluation, utilisation and end use of knowledge. The term \"end use\" may imply that a full turn of the knowledge cycle has been completed, from the producer to the end user, but this is certainly not the end of the knowledge activities. When knowledge has arrived at the user, the entire process starts all over again. 3.3.2 The phase concept for social problem-solving processes Problems can be solved in many different ways, more or less well. Traditional action makes use of old solution patterns whose suitability has ostensibly been proved, and these are then simply repeated, in principle if not in detail. Charismatic behaviour breaks with (traditional) rules in order to lead to success (or to seduce into it) in unusual ways. In extreme cases, new ways can emerge with force and compel us to pose problems and find solutions. In the Karlsruhe approach, by contrast, we have conceived problem-solving processes which are conducted by way of knowledge in all phases, from asking questions to formulating and implementing answers. This is more than merely basing individual steps on a foundation of knowledge. All steps in the process are guided by knowledge and controlled by criticism. Guidance by knowledge presupposes that theory precedes practice: with theoretical proposals for solutions that are empirically tested and then implemented in practice. On the one hand this requires direction-giving leading information, but on the other hand it requires counter- information for validation and correction. Information which belongs to neither the first nor the second category but which is irrelevant, misleading or counter-productive is always part of the game. It makes up the major portion of the knowledge in circulation, and for this reason alone it cannot be ignored. Where there is leading information and counter-infor mation there is also noninformation and disinformation. This completes my brief survey of the strategic triangle of knowledge in the information age, whose cornerstones are: leading information, counter-information, disinformation. 24 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society 4 The threefold integration of official statistics in the knowledge sphere of society What do these highly theoretical knowledge-related concepts from science and information theory, the cultural and social sciences and the information and communication technologies have to do with statistics? Although these concepts do not provide complete solutions, in my view they allow us to ask the right questions which show the way toward true progress. The Karlsruhe approach reveals the further relations for the threefold integration of official statistics: In order theory and order policy terms, integration with the \"order of knowledge\" project; in knowledge theory and social theory terms, integration with the \"sorts of knowl edge\" project; in organisational terms, integration with the \"knowledge activities\" project. 4.1 The order policy framework Official statistics is comparable to academic science, not in terms of knowledge theory and information policy but in terms of order theory and order policy. Both academic science and official statistics need an order of knowledge for an orderly task performance. Their orders of knowledge are comparable in many respects, and in some respects they are even identical. The basis of comparison lies in the above-mentioned provisions of the classical order of knowledge for separating knowledge and property, ideas and interests, theory and practice, science and government. The claim that the statistical knowledge activity is politically neutral and institutionally independent corresponds with these general conditions. If there are differ ences between academia and official statistics in order policy terms, they are most likely to be found in the separation from government. Official statistics is certainly closer to government than is the academic freedom of teaching and research in accordance with Art. 5 (3) of the Basic Law. Official statistics, just like the universities, belongs among those state-owned institutions of knowledge in Germany which constitute the public branch of the public-private dual system. Official statistics therefore requires and already has an order of knowledge similar to that of academia, and like academia it runs the same risk of suffering from a con genital defect that grows like cancer: that the administrative penetration by government (which is external) could lead to the nuclear fusion of nationalisation or even to a political party alignment. For this reason there should be an order policy for statistics to establish a framework for the use of statistics, instead of an exploitative information policy with the use of statistics. 4.2 The additive style of knowledge and the summative image of society in statistics Three questions arise with regard to statistical data knowledge: (1) What makes statistical data into information? (2) What makes statistical knowledge into understanding, on a scientific level of validity? (3) What makes statistical knowledge into insight, to be activated as a knowledge base for practical action? Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 25 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner The specific characteristics of statistical data knowledge can now be defined more exactly in terms of cognitive theory: Statistics is an extra-scientific form of social reporting with the aid of highly scientific methods (used mainly in the analysis of data and trends). Statistical knowledge is thus a cognitive hybrid with a specific profile of standards and characteristics. On the one hand, statistical knowledge is not nomological theory knowledge but empirical data knowledge about details concerning the current condition of society. The facts are only collected and aggregated without being generalised into theory. The original data are deliberately retained in their natural form like election results, although for different reasons. But regardless of the sophisticated methods used, this is not a scientific process to discover underlying relationships. Statistics is not concerned with objective rela tionships and meanings, with reasons and consequences, with causes and effects. The data are counted, not weighted 1 . For example, the price index and the unemployment rate are not val ues derived from theories, like constants in physics; they are important statistical values in practice, but they do not explain anything in scientific terms. The methods by which statistics are improved do not conform to the development pattern of science. In science, the findings are always provisional; they are proposed as hypotheses which may be rejected, and they are improved by a sequence of theories during the research process. By contrast, statistical data which are already complete are improved by updating. When they are obsolete, new data are collected, and this is done from one census to the next. On the other hand, official statistics claims that its findings conform to the quality criteria of scientific research, especially the criteria: validity, objectivity, neutrality, independence. 6 ) Official statistics are more than just information in the sense of the concept of knowledge discussed above; they are reports about society on a major scale, on the empirical basis of the facts that have been collected and analysed. Although the data may be of modest quality as raw data, they are collected in large quantities and are then carefully analysed. Statistical data are high-quality findings used to record the most important social conditions and develop ments; they are for the most part highly relevant to the contemporary situation. What differ entiates the statistical image of society from the scientific one is not the claim to validity (which is certainly no less stringent in statistics than it is in theoretical sociology and in empirical social research), but rather the claim to the explanatory power of general theory. From a cognitive theory and order policy point of view, statistical data knowledge (like the theoretical knowledge of science) is an autonomous sort of knowledge which is comprised of extra-scientific findings. The major part of statistical data knowledge is knowledge about ac tions, events, structures. Due to its integration into technological data carrier systems, this is a highly computerised kind of knowledge about facts and rules. Statistical data are individual data about particular persons, objects, processes, societal segments, and social structures, linked by technological facilities of data processing, improvement, and distribution. In epis temologica! terms, this is the lowest type of human knowledge at the aggregate level, al though it is knowledge with a maximum quantitative accumulation at specific points through the above-mentioned facilities. The image of society which is collected and summed up by means of the additive style of knowledge is a universe of aggregated details to which we can apply Wittgenstein's dictum: 6) Details in Federal Statistical Office (1997, pp. 18, 59 et passim). 26 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society \"One factor can change and all the rest would remain the same\". 7 ) To the scientific universe of systems, on the other hand, we can apply the principle: Due to the inherent interrelation ships, a change in one element will basically affect all the other components. 4.3 Knowledge functions in the \"social division of knowledge activities\" model and the strategy of information in the problem-solving process In modern society, science has the major responsibility for the creative production, practical application and technical implementation of theoretical knowledge. The research programme of science is aimed at explaining the nature of the world in terms of concepts and theories. This has allowed science to leave all its competitors behind, and it can therefore claim to have an undisputed monopoly of competence for progress in scientific and technological knowledge. This does not apply to the statistical data knowledge that is used to study the social realities. Numerous institutions of knowledge study the past development and the current condition of society. In academic institutions this is done by the modern social sciences, and some of them (like the specialised disciplines Empirical Social Research and Survey Research) come quite close to official statistics in terms of cognitive theory, and within the university framework they also come quite close to it in terms of order policy. The knowledge activity of official statistics is performed at many different locations in the functional model of knowledge activities, depending on the kind of activity. Data collection includes a wide range of activities, from the indiscriminate collection of curiosities by hobby statisticians to selective searches in closely circumscribed fields of interest to the systematic collection of data in a population census. If data are collected with methodical procedures and if the main interest is to use scientific methods of analysis to produce new findings (which is less true of opinion polling centres, more true of modern market research, and quite characteristic of the systematic statistical information services), then data collection can be regarded as a part of the process of the discovery, search for and production of new knowledge. Such a process of data collection is the normal procedure prior to the storage, dissemination and utilisation of data, and although this is not a highly creative process, it is nevertheless not a trivial one. To answer the question, \"Where, and for what purposes, can statistical data knowledge be used to expand, extend and improve the knowledge base of society for processes of solving social problems?\" we must determine where such knowledge is located within the strategic triangle of information strategies. For example, statistical knowledge could be integrated, - first, into the leading information which usually flows from the top down, for example in the authority of the political leadership in the government to establish the policies for the administration, or in the advice that is given by academic institutions to the government (but in reality, and quite often, vice versa); - second, into the corrective counter-information which is generated by elections (from the bottom up) and the press (from the outside to the inside); and - third, into the broad flow of disinformation whose purpose is to exercise a corrective and controlling influence on leading information and counter-information by means of public relations, lobbying, advertising, and the dissemination of ideologies throughout the length and breadth of the information jungle of the various interests and factions of society. 7) Discussed in Spinner (1998, p. 109 f.).

        "Helmut F. Spinner 5 The role of official statistics in the societal knowledge economy Although official statistics is among the quiet, underestimated and unrecognised institutions of knowledge, it is nevertheless notably present on a broad front, as is evident in the function it was given under the constitution, its secure legal status (including appropriate facilities), its infrastructure (statistical offices) throughout the country, its autonomous type of information (its specialised data knowledge about mass conditions and trends in society), its increasing responsibilities (privilege of independence, the citizens' obligation to provide information), and its honourable status of belonging among the quality fields of criteria-bound knowledge. What is the position and function of official statistics in the societal knowledge economy? - What contributions can we expect from official statistics in the provision of basic and supplementary services for the information society, after deducting all the exaggerated expectations (about secure, complete, reliable, future-oriented knowledge), unexplored opportunities (e. g. statistical data about policy successes), and the inherent limitations (including legalised knowledge errors such as labour market statistics)? - What knowledge policy can be pursued with official statistics? - What order policy should be pursed for official statistics, whose independence and whose integration with the quality fields of knowledge should be enhanced, if possible? - What broader knowledge function can official statistics have beyond the present state? Shouldn't official statistics also play an important role in the information society's strategic conflicts: as an empirical knowledge base, decision-making aid and friction against reality for the leading information of government and business; as a balance for the disinformation to which the public is exposed by propaganda, advertising, and entertainment; as a corrective counter-information to balance the built-in corroboration bias of the self-referenced and closed informational subsystems of society? Is there even such a broader knowledge function of official statistics that points beyond the present situation? Where are the major current challenges? In the unresolved (yet repressed) problems of industrial society, or in grand visions of the future knowledge society (which are far removed from present problems)? Isn't the extension of informational self-determination in private matters to informational co- determination in public matters an appropriate demand for the day, a demand which meets up with such great reservations and so much resistance especially because it is so highly challenging but not utopian? 5.1 Positive knowledge contributions of official statistics The (relative) importance of official statistics is primarily determined by the functions it has been assigned. The knowledge activities of official statistics are based on a legal mandate, which is to provide the government and society with information about specific social facts. As I see it, official statistics has three functions to improve the society's level of information about itself, primarily in the area of providing information about the domestic situation: - Official statistics has a constitutional mandate to provide the German Federal and L\u00e4nder governments, the business community and the public with basic information about clearly specified facts concerning society. 28 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society - It has the additional function of providing the public with basic informational services in areas which are not (yet) clearly specified by law, but this function can be derived from rulings of the Federal Constitutional Court. - And it has the additional, self-imposed task of providing information to raise the level of information in society. In addition, official statistics makes other positive contributions which go beyond what is contained in the official reports, contributions that are hardly noticed by the public and that are not sufficiently appreciated: (1) Key data as orientation aids Some key data (primarily the price index, but unfortunately at present also the unem ployment rate) serve as an \"anchor\" of public opinion (as it is called in cognitive psy chology) and as an aid to orientation for making one's own judgements. (This does not apply to mass data, which are hardly noticed by the public.) But due to a lack of more accurate knowledge, the key data are no more than estimates based on common knowledge and heuristic judgements serving as rules of thumb. Although the data are mostly wrong and more or less distorted, they still give us orientation for practical conduct. Without them we would have no orientation at all and would be incapable of taking action. The fact that politicians usually make less appropriate use of them will be discussed later on. (2) Contributions to the basic and supplementary information services for the public Informational services should enable the citizen to establish and maintain his position in life. (There is currently a controversy going on over whether this should include the radio and TV broadcasting of sports events, free of charge.) To me it is unclear how far this unofficial function can go and how official statistics could accomplish it in the con crete. (3) Knowledge base for counter-information Information which may be unsuitable, undesirable or even impermissible (the latter not only in a dictatorship) for use as leading information (e. g., as a knowledge base for government decisions) may nevertheless have a positive function. Statistical information from an independent source can make an essential contribution to correct the false infor mation and disinformation disseminated by interested knowledge institutions for use in official propaganda and for the public relations of political parties, for business lobby ing, and for social ideologies. In my opinion this would not only balance the corrobo ration bias built into many institutions as a result of intentionally preferred positive information; it would also promote the public enlightenment through better knowledge. To achieve this public information function and the corrective effect it entails, it is important that, in contrast to media campaigns, such counter-information should be presented in a quiet and non-dramatic way so that it can circumvent the resistance of the entrenched interests. (4) Statistical advice for government This function is usually mentioned first, but in my view it is mostly overestimated, and I have therefore placed it last. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 29 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner 5.2 Knowledge deficits of official statistics Let us not forget the other side of the coin. Contrasted with the positive contributions of official statistics there are also considerable deficits which may be classified as follows (without any claim to completeness): (1) Unavoidable knowledge gaps: Areas where there can be no statistics The biggest knowledge gap is the future. Unemployment statistics do not tell us anything about the specific circumstances, deeper causes, future developments, and required rem edies. That kind of knowledge is beyond the scope of statistical information. And in crime statistics there are estimates of unreported cases that will never be completely cleared up. (2) Intentional ignorance: Areas where there should be statistics but there are none When we speak of the well-informed society, we should not forget that knowledge is not always preferred to ignorance. No government has an interest in scientific or statistical information that could serve as a test for the success of its policies. There are no sta tistical reports about policy successes and failures or broken election promises. That is intentional. Statistics about property possession and taxation intentionally do not provide any information about the real tax burdens and the equity gap that is claimed to exist. Only the public has a serious permanent interest in that kind of information, while the political opposition as a rule has only a temporary interest for opportunistic reasons. (3) Limited partial knowledge: Areas where there are inadequate statistics Nothing can be done against an absence of knowledge due to unavoidable knowledge gaps. Official statistics (!) can hardly do anything against the intentional ignorance of politicians. Perhaps its independence could take it that far, but its impartiality would not. Just as there is a \"handicapped separation\" between the church and the state and between the universities and the academic administration, so there is also a \"handicapped separa tion\" between government information policy and political party politics. (4) Legalised knowledge errors The knowledge restrictions and distortions that I call legalised knowledge errors are another matter. These are the result of the definitions and specifications by which the government and the administrative agencies try to exercise control over data collection offices by assuming an authority to define the terms in a manner that is not covered by the constitution. (For example: Who is to be considered unemployed? What is to be regarded as poverty?) In this matter, official statistics should not remain silent but should recall its own objectives, standards, and competence. (5) Inherent limits of statistical information: Where statistical reports about society and informational services end Statistics can provide information, and to a certain degree it can even deliver some find ings, but it cannot deliver insight in the sense described above. Statistics can contribute practically nothing to the qualification and evaluation of knowledge, aside from verify ing the empirical correctness of the appropriate information. Any other questions con cerning the evaluation, weighting and selection of knowledge are beyond the statistical method. This also applies to the formation of political views. Official statistics can only offer information, but that can be turned down, and it must expect that its information offers will be rejected. 30 Federal Statistical Office. Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society 5.3 Knowledge policy with statistics 5.3.1 The interpretation of statistical information The government and governmental agencies exploit official statistics in the pursuit of their information policies, but they do not do so with an open visor. It is my impression that few knowledge contributions, including those of science, are accepted as uncritically as is basic statistical information. The \"data for everyone\" which official statistics propagated until re cently are almost sacrosanct figures; they are accepted without challenge or questioning. But this does not mean that they are being honoured. Politicians and political parties handle them like apologetic theologians handle the Bible or hair-splitting lawyers handle the law. Where the wording cannot be changed, the text can be reinterpreted. While this does not change the letter, it changes the meaning. Both groups of users are masters in the art of hermeneutics. Almost all statistics are being used for policy confirmation, if only from the perspective of those pursuing or supporting that policy. In cognitive psychology, this phe nomenon is called corroboration bias. It has been discussed whether this is due to man's inherent tendency to be irrational or to the social pressures of conformity (as in the so-called spiral of silence). While this phenomenon may be natural and even understandable to a certain degree when it is observed in individuals, when it occurs in institutions and organisations it must be regarded as intentional information bias in the terms of bias research. Corroboration bias is then built in as a dual filter: on the one side for the dissemination of promotional disinformation (in the broadest sense of the word), and on the other side for the neutralisation of corrective counter- information, so that one's own leading information can lead without hindrance. The price which must be paid for this strategy is the loss of learning skills, with its typical progression. Such a closed informational system continues to move along its path until it collapses. The former East Germany can be regarded as a serious warning and a deterrent in this regard. Now the question arises whether the information function of official statistics is limited to the collection, processing and provisioning of data or whether it should not also include the responsibility to ensure that the data are properly accepted and interpreted. As an outsider I cannot avoid gaining the impression that the Statistical Offices could do more to promote the correct use of their own statistical findings. Let me emphasise this point with irony, but with serious intent: Just like the Pope wants to have a certain statement included in the official forms certifying that pregnancy counselling has taken place, so the statisticians could include in their reports a warning against the misuse of data, or a statement prohibiting the opportunistic exploitation of knowledge: These data shall not be used by political parties for their self-portrayal or for fighting their opponents! 5.3.2 Intervention with statistical information The collection and publication of statistical data is not a matter without problems. Both the involuntary transmitter of data and the person being informed in such a coercive manner that the information cannot be ignored could consider the collection and publication of statistical data as a form of intervention with the use of statistical information. For this reason, the aim of official statistics is to give the citizens general information without insight into the details, Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 31 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner and to give the government counsel and advice rather than instruction. 8 ) Statistics are thus employed on a medium level of information activity, with limited effect. Beneath that level, figuratively speaking, are the lower level information activities which do not provide a general understanding, and above it are the higher level information activities which provide full insight and participation in the substance of knowledge. The result is an instructive gradation of information activities: 9 ' - The blind handling of information, without insight, understanding or intervention (the mailman who is not allowed to read private information); - the discreet handling of information, with insight and understanding but no intervention (the butler with knowledge about private matters who must not comment on them); - the anonymous handling of information, without insight or intervention but with under standing (the statistician who only takes note of mass data); - the mechanical handling of information, with insight and intervention but no understand ing (put maliciously: the politician who does not understand what he knows but who nevertheless makes use of it); - the participatory handling of information, with insight and understanding but without intervention (the scientist who considers information only as material for his theories); - the interventionist handling of information, with insight, understanding and intervention (knowledge turned into power, in whatever hands). 5.4 An order policy for statistics The twelve models of order policy and knowledge policy that I explained in Section 3.1.2 describe an interdisciplinary spectrum of objectives whose purpose is to improve the general situation of official statistics and to give it new functions. These tools will now be used for a detailed examination of which of these specific aims and measures apply to official statistics, and which of them should be adopted as its challenges. There is no need for any special justification of the indispensable contributions made by official statistics to the public infor mation services (No. 8) within the framework of the German dual system, in which official statistics, the universities and the public-sector radio and TV networks constitute the public branch. However, that is not so self-evident with regard to the important contributions which official statistics also makes to the corrective counter-information (No. 3). In this regard offi cial statistics should give the public more information about itself, it should place a greater emphasis on its institutional independence, and it should be more active in demonstrating that it is part of an infrastructure of criticism. In my view, the restricted order pluralism (contra 4) and the official centralism (contra 11) of the federal statistical system do not fit into this pic ture, and this impression is not changed by the existence of statistical offices at the L\u00e4nder level. 8) The following reflections, which I admit are still somewhat playful, were inspired by the title of Holder's \"Durchblick ohne Einblick - Die amtliche Statistik zwischen Datennot und Datenschutz\" and by my own work on the ethics of knowledge, which is focused on a yet to be determined difference between information inter vention that must be accepted (such as permissible criticism) and intervention that must be rejected (such as an impermissible power of knowledge). 9) Research on the first two items in this list, under the heading \"information and communication activities\", is currently being done by a member of my research staff, Michael Nagenborg, M.A. 32 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society 6 The future of official statistics in the knowledge society 6.1 High and low expectations of social reporting 6.1.1 Disillusioned dreams of knowledge To sum up in a few sentences what we have learned from 2,000 years of epistemological theory, we can briefly and correctly say that some of mankind's grandest dreams about the capabilities of human knowledge are over. These dreams have included the following: (1) The dream of certain knowledge This dream o\u00ed Plato and Descartes lasted until the falsification revolution was ushered in by Karl Popper in the thirties of the 20th century. There can be no human knowledge which is simultaneously both informative and absolutely certain in terms of validity, that is, not empty and yet irrefutably true (sufficiently substantiated, i. e. proven). All we have is individual and collective illusions of certainty, but these play an important role in our daily lives (as an irrational excess of confidence), in politics (as petrified ideologies), and unfortunately also in science (as dogmatic errors). (2) The dream of complete knowledge While illusions of certainty are a typical sin of philosophers, the longing for complete ness is the temptation into which the devil leads the natural scientists. Their list of sins ranges from the end of physics and closed theories to the world formula which covers everything (in both senses of the word). (3) The dream of extensive knowledge about the future The future is uncertain and unpredictable, not least because it is subject to our influence, and it therefore depends on knowledge that we cannot anticipate. The cognitive trans formation which occurred in nearly all of the formerly behavioural social sciences under the influence of the psychology of perception and cognition has made us all aware that all human knowledge is hypothetical. The euphoria which is the basis of planning detailed and perhaps even global controls is founded on Nos. (2) and (3). (4) The latest dream: A worldwide integrated system of networked knowledge The technological networking of knowledge in freely accessible global networks is neu tral in content and makes the linked knowledge neither consistent nor accurate nor better in quality. (5) Finally: Herold's dream of networked statistical information for sanitary purposes When Herold was Chief of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation from 1971 to 1981, that institution had a dream regarding the new police information systems which extended criminal statistics into a kind of social report. They dreamed about the so- called cognitive privilege of the police, about \"Socrates turned round\", about converting statistical quantity into statistical quality, and about transforming data knowledge into theoretical knowledge. 10 ' 10) For a critique, see Spinner ( 1998, pp. 30 f., 49 ff.). Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 33 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner 6.1.2 Unexplored knowledge opportunities No one has yet compiled a catalogue of unexplored or deliberately neglected knowledge opportunities. All I can do here is to suggest that such a catalogue should be compiled. Perhaps I can now make a modest start. For example: So far there is, unfortunately, no record of policy failures that could be made available for processes of solving social problems. Official statistics could give important assistance in this regard. In this function official statistics can be regarded as an element of the non-technological infrastructure of criticism and control in society, and it could even be expanded into an instrument of counter-infor mation. It could then supplement the press, and although it would be less visible in public it would have a considerably better data base. Another example: What is official statistics doing to give policy-makers sustained assistance to facilitate more equitable taxation and more equitable welfare support for poor people? \") In my opinion, neglected knowledge opportunities are due to the procedure used to compile the \"big\" statistics, which combines the intermittent collection of data with data updates that often lag behind. Although this may be reasonable from a cost perspective, it is not so much understandable from an information policy point of view. The bigger the data collections are, the slower and the costlier are knowledge activities compared to the market, which is always up-to-date (although never prescient). But the market can collect only those economic data that are related to purchasing power and integrate them into the economic process. 6.2 Challenging questions for official statistics In conclusion, let me now pass the baton to the presenters who will follow me and hand them a list of challenges to which they will hopefully find appropriate answers. The biggest challenge is the problem which runs like a red thread through my presentation, and that is how to reach the apparently modest goal of a better informed society. This is a truly provoca tive challenge (in contrast to the visions that have recently been propagated), because raising the information level of society is definitely a socially desirable goal that is technically feasible, so there is hardly any excuse for not reaching it. In my opinion, these considerations raise four central questions that should be regarded as challenges for official statistics. The first three questions are derived from the concept of knowledge that I have discussed, and the fourth question concerns the appropriate order of knowledge. The four questions are: (1) What makes statistical data knowledge informative, that is, what makes it into non-empty statements about the current condition and/or the future development of society? (\"Sta tistical data\" as I understand them always include all the relevant analyses and inter pretations.) (2) What qualifies statistical data knowledge as understanding that satisfies the demanding quality standards of validity, importance, verification? (It must certainly meet higher quality standards than ordinary survey data do.) (3) What makes statistical data knowledge worth knowing for the citizen, the end user, so that he will feel obligated to take note of it and make more active use of it as a welcome base of knowledge for his activities? 11) See Holder (1985, p. 54). 34 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Data knowledge for everyone? What official statistics can contribute to a well-informed society (4) Do the existing legal regulations still set appropriate standards (concept of knowledge, order of knowledge, division of knowledge activities) to ensure that the above-men tioned knowledge functions can be performed even under the new, overpowering eco nomic and technological knowledge regimes of global markets and freely accessible networks? So far, the order policy models of official statistics (independence, neutrality, freedom from intervention) have been secure under national law. However, these order policy models are increasingly being evaded by limitless markets and freely accessible, criteria-free networks. These are not all of the contemporary challenges to official statistics, but they are certainly the greatest contemporary challenges from a knowledge policy and order policy perspective. However, are they not challenges without a challenger! Isn't official statistics a master of domestic information whose throne no one wants to ascend? Where are the opponents? Surprisingly, no one wants to stop the flow of statistical information. This is quite in contrast to the press, which has so often been fiercely attacked. But why is that so? Obviously because nothing is called into question and no one feels challenged. In contrast to the institutions which supply information that cannot or can hardly be rejected (Federal Constitutional Court, mass media, the academic community), the Federal Statistical Office and the statistical of fices of the L\u00e4nder are currently not the subject of public criticism, as they last were in 1983 at the time of the population census. The data being published by the official statistics insti tutions are simply accepted as they are. As I said, this does not mean that there are no reser vations. But instead of openly voicing the usual criticism, the public reacts by ignoring the data and politicians react with unscrupulous reinterpretations for their opportunistic purposes. The unemployment rate is just an example. My own answers to the four questions are: Question 1: Yes, without reservations. Question 2: Yes, with some reservations. Question 3: Strict No. Question 4: No, if we let matters run their course and do not intervene properly in time. 6.3 A look to the future: Should all data be available to everyone, at once, on a daily basis, free of charge? Or should properly selected knowledge be available for proper applications? The popular slogans are: - Data for everyone. - Knowledge for everyone. - Entertainment for everyone. - But which data, which knowledge, which communication? From whom? To whom? And for what purposes? Like all productive knowledge institutions, official statistics produces too much information, but this is unavoidable and unfortunately it is also expensive. A small part of the knowledge being produced would be sufficient, but which part? For practical actions in everyday life, a Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 35 ",
        "Helmut F. Spinner little knowledge is enough, if it is the right kind of knowledge and if it is the best possible knowledge. If that is so, then continuously updated data knowledge as produced by official statistics is just as important as a knowledge base and corrective for the social problem- solving process as is the powerful leading information of government and business, the theoretical knowledge of science, the occasional knowledge gained in journalistic investi gations, or the citizen's situational knowledge about economically relevant circumstances that he may have picked up in the market. None of these streams of information must be allowed to dry up in the cognitive map. All types, quantities and qualities of knowledge, for everyone. This should therefore be the expanded title which can be used to describe the new informational task of official statistics. And I can add the following recommendation: Instead of the current strategy of producing quantity, official statistics should have a selective strategy to produce quality with a view to knowledge worth knowing and to information that can be used for the solution of problems.

        "Svante \u00d6berg*' Challenges in the information society Thank you Mr. Chairman and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I'm Svante \u00d6berg, Di rector General of Statistics Sweden, and I'm pleased to be here in Berlin at such an exciting time in the life of this great city. The purpose of my talk today is to consider how statistical institutes could meet the chal lenges of the information society. I'm pleased to be able to stand in for my friend and col league Tim Holt, who was to participate in this first session as a co-speaker, but who unfortu nately is unable to do so, owing to other urgent commitments. In my speech I will address three issues: First, how information technology will affect the production of statistics. Second, how information technology and international integration will affect the demands of people, politicians and markets. Third, how statistical institutes could meet these demands. Let me begin with the first issue: how information technology will affect the production of statistics. We are all aware that information technology is changing the world dramatically. This is true also in the statistical area. Information technology has been used extensively in statistical production for more than one hundred years. In the 1880s, the American engineer Herman Hollerith developed the first punch card machine. It was used in the US census in 1890. Hollerith's company later formed part of the company that is now called IBM. When modern computers were developed in the late 1940s they were soon introduced in national statistical institutes. In Statistics Sweden modern cor-puters have been used since the early 1960s. Since 1995 we have a web-site, where we publish more and more of our statis tics. With the use of computers productivity increases. In 1976, Statistics Sweden had 2,560 employees. Now we have only 1,280. The number of personnel has thus halved. This purely numerical comparison, however, exaggerates the underlying development, for at that time we had a larger number of temporary and part-time employees than we do now. In fact, in terms of a full year and full time equivalents, the number of man-years has declined by about one third. And we are doing much more today than we did 20 - 25 years ago. Though we do not have statistics on the agricultural sector that are as detailed as we had then, we cover other areas much better, such as the service sector, the labour market, and the environment. Furthermore, we have taken over the production of statistics on foreign trade from the customs authorities and we do much more commissioned work and technical consulting. We estimate that our production volume has increased by nearly 50 percent since 1975. This development, with less labour input and more statistical output, has doubled our pro ductivity. Much of this increase in productivity has been possible because of information technology. *) Svante \u00d6berg, Director General, Statistics Sweden, Stockholm. 38 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Challenges in the information society Information technology will affect all stages in the production of statistics: input (data collection), throughput (processing of data), and output (dissemination and availability). Data collection will be more efficient and flexible. It will be possible for companies to trans fer data, more or less automatically, over the Internet, from their internal information sys tems, to statistical institutes. This will provide opportunities to make data more up-to-date. And it will also reduce the burden of form-filling for statistical purposes. The use of administrative data and registers in the production of statistics will increase, especially in the Nordic countries. The next census in Sweden will be completely based on administrative registers. People will not have to fill in forms any more - for this purpose at least. The processing of data will be easier and faster. The speed and capacity of computers is increasing radically. What took months 25 years ago takes seconds today. Calculations that were impossible 10 years ago are easy today. Such capabilities increase possibilities for re searchers to use and combine large-scale micro-data to analyse important issues. And im provements in software make it easier to produce tables and statistical reports. The dissemination of data will change radically and be more adaptable to varying user de mands. The Internet provides opportunities to distribute data at low costs, over long dis tances, and to a large number of users. The Internet also provides possibilities to combine statistics from different countries in statistical networks. I'd like now to turn to the second issue: how information technology and international inte gration will affect the demands of people, politicians and markets. In the European Union (EU), in particular, countries are getting more and more dependent on each other. The European Economic Area has resulted in a successively more integrated internal market. The European Monetary Union, with a single European currency taking full effect in the year 2002, will reinforce this process of European integration. Prices and costs in different countries will be much easier to compare. People are travelling much more and have a much more international perspective than 25 years ago. They want to know not only about the situation in their own country, but also about how their own country compares to other countries. They want to know if they earn more or less, and if it is more expensive or cheaper, in one country than in another. They want to know about the social developments in different countries. And so on. Politicians face the challenges of much harder competition between countries. They have to take into account much more the interdependence between countries with respect to regu lations, in particular tax laws, and efficient public sectors. We see the result in the harmo nisation of legislation, in convergence criteria for membership of the Economic and Mone tary Union, in the Growth and Stability Pact, and so on. Companies also face challenges of much harder competition. When prices are easily compa rable between countries and when you can order for example a refrigerator just as well from a web-site in one part of Europe as in another, competition gets much stiffer. New companies will appear on the market with new and more efficient production techniques. Productivity will increase faster. Differences in prices and costs will result in much faster changes in market shares. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 39 ",
        "Svante \u00d6berg In the economie area, the demands of European politicians are rather well articulated. The Treaty and subsequent agreements reached on the Stability and Growth Pact give quite pre cise specification for information that is needed for economic policy purposes. This informa tion includes statistics on national accounts and growth, on inflation, on public finances and budgetary positions, and also on financial developments. There are other areas as well, where the demands are well articulated. This is the case with agricultural and trade statistics. European common policies have a long tradition in these areas. In the social area, however, the demands of European politicians are less well articulated. One area where the requirements have been specified in a Council Regulation, is the organi sation of a sample survey of the labour force in the Community. Cross-country comparisons of labour markets and labour costs will demand more attention now that the European Eco nomic and Monetary Union (EMU) has started. The link between labour costs and employ ment is now stronger since it is no longer possible to adjust exchange rates. Another area where demands have started to result in regulations on common European statistics, is the environment. So far the scope is limited to waste management, but this is an area where we can expect a substantial increase in the coming years. I'm turning now to the third issue: how statistical institutes could meet these demands. But first let me reflect on the rapidly changing environment for statistical institutes. Traditionally, politicians, public authorities, organisations and big companies have been the prime users of official statistics. In the future, people, small companies, researchers, the edu cation system, and other users, will play a bigger role. Alternatives to statistical information will be developed. Other producers of information will appear. Statistical institutes too will meet harder competition. To a large extent, we have already seen this kind of development. There are many more and stronger producers of statistical information now than 25 years ago. Information on the Inter net plays a much greater role than only 5 years ago. People spend more time consuming in formation, but not necessarily traditional statistics. And this development will continue. It has only now started. Statistical institutes will have to consider how to meet these challenges. We have to think and plan today, to meet the demands of tomorrow. In this context, I would like to address one important aspect that I believe we have to focus on to meet the challenges in this new information society: standards. I'm convinced that, in coming years, the statistical institutes will have to focus much more on international comparisons. To be able to compare different countries, you have to define and measure things in the same way. You need standards. Statistical institutes will have to devel op these standards. Let me mention one important example. At the European level, the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the European Central Bank (ECB) are co-operating with national statistical institutes and national central banks to develop economic statistics that are needed as a basis for economic policies. We have to improve the coverage and the 40 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Challenges in the information society quality of statistics, and also how up-to-date they are. This work includes harmonisation of standards, e. g. the harmonised consumer price index (HICP) and the new European System of Accounts (ESA 95) that is implemented this year. It also comprises developing further certain statistics like short-term statistics and quarterly national accounts, including quarterly national account data for the general government sector. We will also have to reduce the response burden and increase the availability of statistics. Within the European statistical community, we are working on initiating and promoting the development of systems that would make it possible to deliver data to statistical institutes in electronic form. One such project, the TELER project, has just been finished. The aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of a common model and related standards for the exchange of statistical data be tween enterprises and data collectors. The project has shown that the potential is enormous. It has made some calculations that suggest that the administrative burden on companies could be reduced by 85 percent if such new technologies were used. But it has also shown that there is a great deal that still has to be done, in terms of developing and implementing computer software, for this potential to be explored and fulfilled. We will have to increase the availability of statistics both at the national level and at the inter national level. The Internet will play a crucial role in this respect in coming years. In Statistics Sweden, we have decided on a new policy for publishing statistics. This new policy puts our web-site at the core. All official statistics will be published on the Internet. There will be two versions of every statistical report. One for easy reading on the computer screen, and also one for printing a well presented hard copy. As from next year, all official statistics that we produce will be available free of charge on our web-site. Of course you can also get paper copies at a price that covers the costs of administration, printing and distribu tion. This is quite a dramatic change. Within a few years, the share of official statistics that we distribute free of charge will have increased from nearly nothing to one hundred percent. At the international level, we are now discussing how best to combine statistics from different countries in statistical networks. In some cases you can download national statistics to a com mon database. In other cases you can keep the databases in national statistical institutes and create links to all institutes. In both cases the purpose is to establish the possibilities for com paring developments in different countries. In conclusion: Information technology will affect all stages in the production of statistics. Information technology and ongoing international integration will affect demands from people, politicians and companies. There will be more focus on international comparisons. Statistical institutes will have to meet these new demands by improving the content and the production of statistics. In particular, we will have to develop standards to make international comparisons possible. We will also have to make it easier to deliver data to statistical insti tutes, and to increase the availability to statistics through the Internet and international statis tical networks. Finally, I would like to express my appreciation for having the opportunity to take part in this conference and to say that I'm looking forward to working together with you in the future in this rapidly changing environment, with all its exciting possibilities. Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 41 ",
        "Discussion of the first Session \"Challenges in the information society\" The contributions for discussion covered largely three areas: 1. Availability of information on the information society 2. Application of new information technologies in statistical production 3. Statistics' role in the information society As regards the availability of statistical information on the information society, the partici pants agreed unanimously that there still is a considerable deficit of information. The task of the public sector to create the legal framework for developing an information society also includes the provision of reliable data on the structures and trends in that area. Information on new technologies and their providers in the information sector and on the application of information technologies by the business community, administration, the scientific commu nity and finally also the citizens is indispensable. The availability of information and tele communication networks, the use of information technologies in the job and the private area, and hard- and software research and development are only some of the issues which are of interest in this context. In the future, statistics will increasingly have to respond to that new challenge in order to accomplish its task of depicting social developments as a whole. The participants in the discussion agreed that the opportunities opened up by information technology have already been used by official statistics in all phases of statistical production (data collection, data processing, distribution of results). A wider use of the means of elec tronic data transmission with the aim to further shorten the phases of data collection and processing, together with a reduction in the response burden, will be as important in the future as the efforts to make the provision of up-to-date and reliable statistical results, which are tailored to the needs of their users, even more efficient by using the new information technologies. In view of the globalisation of markets, international cooperation will be of par ticular importance in this context in order to provide comparable statistics. The role of official statistics in the information society, particularly with respect to the infor mation it offers as a basis for economic and political decisions, was discussed in a very con troversial manner. Against the view that statistical activity mainly consists in the mere collec tion and uncommented provision of information, it was objected that official statistics may by no means be reduced to that. Of course, its activities also include the description and analysis of the results obtained and, observing the principles of neutrality and objectivity, also their interpretation. The picture resulting from the different contributions in the discussion of the question whether and to what extent political and economic officials are influenced or even guided by official statistics was not clear. The recommendation was made to statisticians to analyse in a realistic way the effects of their products, i. e. not to overestimate their effective ness. On the other hand, it was stressed that official statistics may have an informative value of extreme topicality, and immediate effects of statistical information may not be ruled out. The example mentioned in this context was the release of information on price trends which may definitely trigger a reaction in the stock markets. 42 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Timo Relander*' Concluding remarks Thank you, Professor Spinner and Director General \u00d6berg, for your excellent presentations. The two perspectives represented here, that of the academic world and the other of official statistics, complemented one another. On the other hand, they also highlighted certain differ ences, and it is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, to wrap them up in a consistent set of conclusions. Business executives have long been stressing the importance of information and knowledge to any modern business operation. There is no doubt that information is a useful and powerful tool in controlling risks in a constantly changing environment. However, there is today growing concern among businesses about the relevance of their knowledge pool. It is cru cially important that companies can define and sift out from the ever growing mass of information that particular knowledge which is directly relevant and strategically significant to their own operation. We must also stress the importance of successful management of information. This, I think, may be one of the key challenges presented to business companies. Although the role of in formation is emphasised in general terms, it often seems to be difficult to carry over this viewpoint into concrete decision-making. There are, as yet, only a few European companies that can be said to have some sort of knowledge management strategy. Viewed from the angle of national statistical agencies, the information needs of the business world are perhaps still the area that is most poorly understood to us. In this regard there remains much work for us to do, and again I believe we can make much headway through closer collaboration. I feel that companies themselves could be more active in making known their information needs, both current and future. On the other hand, national statistical agencies should take a more active role in guiding and helping business companies and other customers to make better use of statistical sources. It is also more and more important for statistical agencies to work closely with the academic community. Statistical agencies need to use scientifically sound methods in order to maintain their credibility and independence. They also need the help and support of the academic world in defining and measuring new phenomena. Professor Spinner listed in his presentation various areas of national information and knowl edge resources. In addition to the information produced by statistical offices, he referred to the leading knowledge of the political and business world, the theoretical information accu mulated by the academic community and the knowledge possessed by citizens. I think Professor Spinner perhaps underplayed the role of official statistics. I would argue that statistical agencies do in fact contribute quite significantly to all these areas of knowl edge. Consider for instance the sensitivity of interest rates or the stock markets to the release of official statistics. The theories produced by the academic world need to be tested empiri- *) Timo Relander, Director General, Statistics Finland, Helsinki.

        "Timo Relander cally. The rising level of education in the general population increases the demand for infor mation among citizens, etc. Professor Spinner's conceptual and theoretical analysis may be of great use for empirical statisticians. Director General \u00d6berg referred in his presentation to the challenges thrown up by the infor mation society to national statistical agencies. I suspect that we still do not fully appreciate all the opportunities nor indeed all the challenges that are presented to official statistics by the Internet, by electronic trading and by new technology in general. Different countries are in very different positions in this respect. It is only with the development of the infrastructure of the information society that official statistics will be able to make full use of the opportunities opened up by new technology. Indeed, statistical agencies will have to make considerable investments over the next few years to upgrade their technologies. Technology policy remains an important issue even though the main accent in the develop ment of the information society (at least in frontline countries) is shifting towards the devel opment of applications and services. Statistical agencies have a major role to play as a leading force in the content industry. It is crucially important that statistical agencies can strengthen their position to counter the continuing growth of so-called disinformation produc ers, to which Professor Spinner also referred. Information technology also has a major influence on the competition in the information markets. Both public statistical agencies and their competitors have access to a wide range of increasingly powerful and cheaper technology for statistics production. In this situation the markets will easily bring out their own measures and indicators if statistical agencies fail to respond to the new needs. How the competition shapes up will largely depend on the success of information producers in integrating new technology into their production and in in creasing the productivity of their investments and capital stock. The change of the technology paradigm also throws up new challenges for the management of statistics production, organi sation structures and staff comDetencies. Another important environmental factor, in addition to technology, is globalisation and the growing demand for internationally comparative information, to which Mr. \u00d6berg also re ferred. The trend towards globalisation raises questions that cannot be answered by means of traditional statistical monitoring. The international statistical community has a significant role to play in this context. Unfortunately, however, this community has limited resources and is too fragmented to respond to the new challenges. Indeed, the problems with international statistical classifications and standards as well as the problems with the definition of new phenomena are increasingly emerging as bottlenecks in the development of statistics. This, for instance, is clearly reflected in the development of statistical accounts of the information society. Once again, many thanks to the speakers and to everyone who has been present. 44 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Carlo Malaguerra*' Regional and structural policies Introductory remarks Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of welcoming you very cordially as participants in Session 2 of our Con ference. This morning, we will discuss a very important topic, namely regional and structural policies. The following two speakers will each deliver a paper in this context: - Mr. J\u00f6rg Bickenbach, State Secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Small and Me dium-Sized Businesses, Technology and Transport of North Rhine-Westphalia, and - Dr. Jim Higgins of the Ministry of Finance of Ireland. Comments on the two papers will then be made by Prof. Dr. Pilar Martin-Guzman, President of Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Spain. And finally, I will open the general discussion and, in this context, would ask you to mention your name, first name and the institution you represent right at the beginning of your contri bution. Allow me in the beginning to give you a brief introduction regarding today's topic. Though the concept of regional and structural policies is not new, neither in politics nor in statistics, it is a concept whose content has changed considerably in the course of time. The challenges of today's regional and structural policies are hardly comparable to those of the past. Technological progress in general and progress in the area of electronics and its fields of application such as information technology and telecommunications, the development of transport infrastructures, the decline in transport costs, continued liberalisation trends, increasing international competition owing to the gradual abolishment of trade and customs barriers, particularly in a regional context (EU, NAFTA, etc.) - all of them have increasingly enabled businesses, institutions and individuals to extend their activities to the regional and global levels. The end of the bipolar system and the opening of the block of states charac terised by planned economies have had an additional legitimising, intensifying and acceler ating effect. The developments mentioned have constituted the basis of a highly diverse and complex pro cess which is generally referred to as globalisation. This process has in several areas been characterised by a worldwide shrinking of space and time and, consequently, an increasing density of international interactions. *) Dr. Carlo Malaguerra, Director General, Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland, Neuchatel. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 45 ",
        "Carlo Malaguerra Many trends becoming apparent today, which certainly will fully develop in the course of only the next few years or decades of the next century, are still characterised by considerable uncertainties though, in the long run, they might result in far-reaching structural changes worldwide. It is this kind of changes which the highly industrialised countries face irrespec tive of their specific historical and national characteristics. Allow me to briefly outline a process of globalisation which, in my view, will have an enor mous impact on the regional and structural policies and, of course, the statistical information required for their purposes. You will certainly agree that transnational businesses are and will continue to be the main operators in the globalisation process. The seventies saw a phase of expansion of multinational businesses which sometimes were caricatured as octopuses with many tentacles and only one head (a geographical centre where the strategies were worked out). Since the mid-eighties, the situation has appeared in a differ ent light: - Since that time, businesses have made efforts to change into networks of business func tions in order to optimise the exploitation of their own production factors on a worldwide scale. They have endeavoured to decentralise their activities (profit centres). The nature of the production process has become less autonomous and complete in a single business. In competition with one's own profit centres, orders have been placed with third parties (outsourcing). This trend has led to integrating small and medium-sized enterprises into global networks to an ever greater extent. The opportunities offered by computer tech nology and telematics have made it possible for businesses to intervene in markets in real time and have made it easier for medium-sized and individual smaller enterprises to oper ate at the global level. - Another characteristic feature is the increase in the number of mergers, takeovers and strategic business alliances with the aim to reduce research and development costs, to have at one's disposal a comprehensive pool of highly qualified personnel, technology competence and financial resources, and to ensure access to new markets and/or to eliminate competitors in the long run. This process, which will probably accelerate in the next 20 years, leads to a higher degree of integration of national and international com panies into the world market. It will become increasingly difficult to know who does what and which part of the network is connected to which production centre and which com pany. Businesses of various countries cooperate, jointly work on developments, do re search, produce and market the products. In many cases, this trend leads to oligopolistic structures of the world market characterised by an increasing danger of cartelisation in individual global goods and services markets. - To an increasing extent, large enterprise groups see themselves as transnational organisa tions whose regional branches and activities are adjusted to the worldwide market require ments. By nature, a major part of the current trade in the world constitutes intra-business transfers, which are not completely covered by statistics. Both intra-business and extra- business exchange processes have resulted in cross-border technology transfers which in creasingly call into question the know-how advantage of the western industrialised countries that once was thought to be reliable. Hence the most important decisions regard- 46 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Regional and structural policies - Introductory remarks ing the allocation of technological and economic resources are mainly made by large- scale transnational businesses. About 45,000 businesses of that kind with more than 276,000 branches worldwide have become the actual driving force in globalisation. The shifts in workplaces entailed produce a state of uncertainty in places where jobs become redundant. - The globalised business networks try to circumvent imponderables like frontiers of indi vidual nations and legal stipulations. Deregulation in the economic area and the liberal isation of the transport of goods, services, capital and partly individuals have facilitated those attempts and forced competitors to make optimum use of information and communi cation technologies in order to adequately exploit the potential of global markets. There are positive feedbacks between the technological facilities of the information age, the deregulation and liberalisation tendencies and the competing global business networks. - The intellectual potential required for a new product may originate from anywhere and be rapidly transformed into that new product. To an ever greater extent, the corporate culture loses its national character, and many products no longer have a clear origin. The nature of the work methods, the origin of the labour force, and investments have increasingly become multinational. Globally operating businesses no longer commit their activities to a single country. On the whole, the importance of locations is changing. And what does that mean? The overall economic interest of a country no longer consists ex clusively in providing \"its\" businesses with framework conditions that are as favourable as possible, but rather has increasingly focused on settling attractive parts of the cross-border value-added chains down in its own locations. In other words, location qualities which attract direct foreign investment and facilitate the globalisation of domestic businesses have gained in importance. It is an open question whether, on the one hand, businesses need national states to be in a position to respond to globalisation requirements and, on the other, states need globally successful businesses to substantiate their existence and legitimisation as national entities. It is however obvious that an area of conflict has developed between the processes of globalisation and national self-determination in politics. Though the national states may re main the main protagonists in the world, they are - due to the processes of globalisation - faced with challenges with respect to both their internal and external policies. The internal political challenge the national states are faced with is the fact that globalisation, on the one hand, leads to increased requirements regarding the individual societies' capability to undergo structural changes and, on the other, subjects them particularly to an international competition for locations. The national states are required to design and subsequently to pursue internal regional and structural policies. In this context, the importance of future- oriented political and institutional reforms within a country is increasing. As regards their foreign policies, the challenge the national states face is the fact that, to an ever greater extent, supranational regulations determine political activities in areas where ei ther international public goods (statistics are included here) are at stake or international exter nalities play an important role. Linked to this development is the continuous transfer of tradi tional national powers to the international or supranational levels. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 47 ",
        "Carlo Malaguerra Regional and structural policies now require a problem-oriented statistical information policy based rather on the challenges of the globalisation process than on the interests of national states. It seems to me that we as statisticians sometimes take great pains to meticulously fit or press the economic activities of businesses into the corset of political space, running the risk of obtaining artificial results. Undoubtedly, the dimension of space is indispensable for business statistics. However, a new dimension has been added now, namely the temporal one - in the sense of monitoring businesses over time. To say it in one word: business demography. De signing this business demography must not be restricted to the national level. We need an internationally accessible business information base, to which the individual countries may add information on business activities and from where they may derive such information. Sta tistics are subject to a process of internationalisation and r\u00e9gionalisation, and that is what the national statistical institutes should understand. We as statisticians are right in the process of changing paradigms. Today, globalised statistical information is particularly required for re gional and structural policies. 48 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "J\u00f6rg Bickenbach*' Regional and structural policy requirements to be met by official statistics 1 Statistical requirements of the German federal L\u00e4nder in a European context Thank you very much, Dr. Malaguerra! Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank you for having invited me to talk today at your Conference on the wishes of a federal state (Land) of the Federal Republic of Germany with regard to statistics. I am going to speak also on behalf of the other L\u00e4nder of the Federal Republic, and I enjoy doing so because we need the discussion and the dialogue between political institutions and statistical agencies. We are living in a world of numbers and data. The German weekly periodical \"Wirtschafts- woche\" took this as an occasion to entitle its first issue this year \"In the beginning was the number\". What is meant here is of course not just numbers but rather how to select the \"right\" numbers and data and, in particular, how to interpret them. As users, we often take it for granted to utilise economic data without really caring about the concepts and work they are based on. At the same time, we hear about complaints especially of companies concerning the burdens placed on them by statistical surveys, which makes us demand that statistics be reduced to what is absolutely necessary. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Land I am representing here today is the one with the largest population and the most powerful economy among all L\u00e4nder of the Federal Republic of Ger many. North Rhine-Westphalia today is a modern business location showing a dynamic de velopment. At the same time, it is a business location with a long industrial history, and the problems resulting from that history have not finally been solved yet. Thirty years ago, North Rhine-Westphalia with its Ruhr area was the symbol of coal and steel, heavy industry and mechanical engineering. But now, it has become a symbol of media and communication. There are not many regions in the world which, within a period of 20 - 30 years, have undergone a structural change which has been similarly radical and dramatic. To cope with such structural changes, it is very important to have a highly precise and valid picture of existing structures and, in particular, of emerging new structures. This can be achieved only through statistics, there is no other way. In the federative structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, the L\u00e4nder - and the commu nities, too - have to perform functions of their own and on their own responsibility. The underlying principle is that problems may best and most efficiently be solved at the level where they emerge. *) J\u00f6rg Bickenbach, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Small and Medium-Sized Businesses, Technology and Trans port of North Rhine-Westphalia, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 49 ",
        "J\u00f6rg Bickenbach The smaller unit should perform the functions regarding only its own sphere of competence; the higher level should take over only those functions which are beyond the capacities of the lower level. Basically, this is what is meant by the principle of subsidiarity. To apply that principle, the lower levels, too, need a reliable statistical data basis with a breakdown of sufficient detail. When compared on a European scale, the economic power of North Rhine-Westphalia (measured by the population, employment, and the gross domestic product) roughly corre sponds to that of our neighbour country, the Netherlands. I am drawing this comparison be cause it illustrates the importance of the L\u00e4nder level in the Federal Republic of Germany even on a European scale. This aspect, too, may help to give sufficient weight to our demands and wishes regarding statistics. 2 The example of regional and structural policies Not only the L\u00e4nder and nations have demand for statistical data, the European Union (EU) too has a vested interest in establishing harmonised statistical systems all over Europe. This is because only with standardised definitions and methods is it possible to compare and assess trends within and between Member States. In this context, the European Commission periodically reports on the socio-economic situa tion and development of the regions in Europe. With its Periodical Reports, it gives an over view of the cohesion process, the regional and structural policies, and the challenges faced by the regions. As far as the L\u00e4nder are concerned, the increasingly harmonised statistical methods and procedures have a two-fold impact: First, old reporting systems are replaced by new ones. This produces irreparable breaks and discontinuities in statistical series; recent examples are industrial and production statistics, national accounts, and employment statistics - which is particularly delicate in the political context. As everyone knows, reliable information on employment trends are currently available only until the middle of last year. Second, selecting and using statistical indicators has an impact on the scope for action in terms of regional policy. Statistical indicators are an important criterion regarding the selec tion of regions to be supported within the framework of regional economic development. This applies both to determining national development regions and defining development re gions as part of the European structural policy. The importance that statistical indicators may assume is illustrated by the procedure currently under way to define development regions under the European regional policy: - According to Article 3 of the regulation regarding structural funds, the objective-1 region covers regions whose gross domestic product per inhabitant- to put it in simplified terms - is more than 25% below Community average. As we all know, in Germany the five new L\u00e4nder fall within that regional category. From 2000 to 2006, they will receive some EUR 20 billion of regional development funds from Brussels. - Regarding objective-2 regions, that is regions with structural problems, some areas were suggested also by North Rhine-Westphalia. They include parts of the Ruhr area and the 50 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics. Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Regional and structural policy requirements to be met by official statistics Heinsberg district. The range of criteria for selecting such regions is much wider. Howev er, there are some areas even in this category which are included practically automatically if specific statistical indicators are fulfilled. An important indicator in this context is the unemployment rate. The problems we are facing here arise from the fact that the EU Commission uses the results of the EU Labour Force Survey. The unemployment rates determined there for the district level, however, are comparable only to a limited extent with the unemployment rates supplied by the German labour administration. - As a result, it is quite difficult to prove the need for development funds if the district level is not used as a basis for assessment. This example clearly shows that statistics is not just playing with figures but that it can have very far-reaching effects. The objective-2 regions in North Rhine-Westphalia will receive about EUR 940 million between 2000 and 2006. Western Germany will receive about EUR 3.5 billion altogether. 3 Obtaining statistical data in a situation of conflicting goals: reliability, financial constraints and reduction of bureaucracy Collecting and processing statistical data is not a purpose in itself- as I have just illustrated - and, what is more, it is not free of costs. Therefore, the scope and detail of statistical surveys must continuously be re-assessed. The statistical system must be adjusted to the structural changes in the economy so that we get data which properly reflect the changing reality. This means that statistical surveys have to be extended where the economic development opens up new areas, and it means that surveys must be reduced where the relevance of indi vidual economic branches for the overall economy is decreasing. The L\u00e4nder of the Federal Republic of Germany actively participate in checking to what extent specific economic statistics are still necessary at the national and European levels. I would like to mention the activities of the Statistical Committee of the Federation and the L\u00e4nder and the relevant working groups of the statistical offices. As a result of such activi ties, 45 proposals for reduction have been implemented since November 1994. This has led to cost saving of about DM 15 million per year for the Federation and the L\u00e4nder; also, the response burden on companies has been reduced. A recent example of how the burden on businesses has been reduced is the redesign of pro duction statistics as from January 1999; it has allowed the exemption of 11,000 local units from monthly reporting and 17,000 from quarterly reporting. Further efforts will be made to reduce the burdens. When discussing the potential for cost saving, it must always be taken into account, however, that the availability of necessary information has to be ensured for the future - also at Land level. A lack of sufficient data will inevitably lead to expensive misplanning, for instance in the field of public infrastructure such as. schools, hospitals and roads, but also in the field of politics. Damage caused by a lack of data or by incorrect data may quickly and easily exceed the costs of producing reliable statistics. An example here is the latest population census in Germany, which had been postponed se veral times and was then conducted with considerable delay. That delay caused many prob lems and subsequent costs. For instance, the housing construction policy had been based for Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 5 1 ",
        "J\u00f6rg Bickenbuch much too long on the assumption that the housing market was roughly balanced; consequent ly housing promotion programmes were cut. It was population census data which then showed that actually there were not enough dwellings available. 4 The example of service statistics As I have just mentioned, new statistica' surveys will have to be introduced where necessary. I would like to illustrate this, taking the service sector as an example. In North Rhine-Westphalia, just as in the entire Federal Republic, today more than 65% of gross value added are produced in the service sector. In the last few years, the service sector has experienced a much more dynamic development than the traditional industry sectors. Consequently, new jobs are created almost only in the service sector. What has grown most strongly in North Rhine-Westphalia over the last ten years is production-oriented services (+55.5%); a good 210,000 new jobs have been created there. The growth was not only in high-level business services (+ 101.3%) -such as business consulting and auditing, architec tural and engineering offices - but also auxiliary services (+ 121.5%). These trends clearly show that assessing the development in the service sector must by no means be separate from, or subsidiary to, the industry. On the contrary, in many respects there is a close relation between the two: The development in the service sector supports modernisation trends in the industry or is a result of outsourcing, which increases business flexibility. The importance of the service sector for the entire economy can thus definitely be rated at a high level. - New products and modern production processes are characterised by a high, and still growing, knowledge content; this leads to a further increase in the service character of the activities. - In knowledge-based markets, value added is high, demand has great purchasing power, and development shows rapid dynamism. - The trend towards knowledge-intensive products not only improves the position of busi nesses and regions in international competition but also opens up new opportunities of combining economic progress with the protection of resources. - But growing employment opportunities are offered on the service market not only in the upper segment but also for simple activities. - Therefore, economic policy must show differentiation and creativity in promoting the op portunities offered by the service sector. So, in view of the certainty that the service sector will continue to grow in importance and that it is very relevant for economic policy in general, it is highly regrettable that, in the Federal Republic of Germany, we have no service statistics yet which is based on data origi nally collected for that purpose. At the regional level, too, we need detailed and reliable in formation on the tertiary sector. Up to now, we have used assumptions on regional develop ments on the basis of plausibility studies. Such assumptions must be replaced by empirical data. 52 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Regional and structural policy requirements to be met by official statistics Only if we have that information will we be able to document the progress made in structural change, only then will it be possible to provide reliable information on regional development patterns, only then can economic policy measures be designed in a well-aimed and efficient manner. This is true for the structural and small and medium sized-business policy, for the research and technology policy, and of course for the labour market policy of a federal Land. We have an obligation to supply informative service statistics to the EU - and also the Con ference of the L\u00e4nder Ministers of Economic Affairs, the Statistical Advisory Committee, the Council of Economic Experts, and the umbrella organisations of the German industry de mand statistics on services. The present draft law submitted by the Federal Government on introducing service statistics provides for annual surveys with a maximum sample of 20% of the enterprises. Such a sam ple would cover 90,000 to 120,000 enterprises all over Germany which would be obliged to respond to the survey. Comparable and reliable results would become available for the re gional, national, and European levels. Considering the enormous benefit of reliable service statistics available at all the three levels, I think that the efforts to be made and the additional burdens to be placed on businesses would be justifiable. What I do not regard as sufficient is setting up service statistics based on a sample of just 5%, as is discussed especially at the top level of the Federal Ministry of Economics. Although such a sample would suffice for EU and federal results, it would not be suited to produce reliable L\u00e4nder data. From the viewpoint of the L\u00e4nder, this would mean economising in the wrong place. Especially the last item of my paper has illustrated that issues that seem to be of a purely methodological nature may turn out to be highly interesting and politically important.

        "Jim Higgins*' Regional policy: Trends and statistical requirements Introduction In this paper I discuss the emerging trends in regional policy in the European Union (EU) and the statistical requirements associated with these trends. The paper is w.'tten from the perspective of one who is involved in the formulation and implementation of regional policy at the Member State level, particularly from an Irish perspective. So I hope that I will be forgiven if I do not include certain strands of regional policy that may be of importance in some Member States. Historically regional policy was a matter for national Governments. It was, and indeed still is, primarily concerned with addressing uneven development within the national territory. The main objective of the policy continues to be closing the income per capita gap between re gions by increasing employment opportunities and productivity levels in less developed re gions. While fiscal transfers through taxation and social welfare payment systems between rich and poor regions were, and continue to be, important instruments in equalising dispos able incomes between regions, they tend to take a subsidiary role to supply side instruments in regional policy debates. This has become even more evident over the past decade as re gional policy in Europe has taken on an increasingly transnational character with the in creased importance of Structural and Cohesion Funds as instruments of regional policy. Taxation can of course also be used as a supply-side regional policy instrument through the use of certain tax concessions, for example for urban renewal. Measuring regional convergence Up to the beginning of this decade the primary concern of regional policy was one of eco nomic convergence in terms of income and output per capita between regions within member states and between regions across member states. The main indicator of economic conver gence, and by implication of the success of regional policy, continues to be gross domestic product (GDP) per capita measured in terms of purchasing power standards (PPS). It is the indicator used by the EU Commission for deciding which NUTS 2 regions qualify for the highest level of Structural Funds aid, namely Objective 1 regions, and is also used in deter mining the eligibility of NUTS 3 regions for Objective 2 funding. This measure has many well known inadequacies when used to measure regional income differences 1 '. Being a mea sure of output it does not take account of outflows and inflows of factor incomes. For exam ple, in the case of Ireland, GDP is some 13 percentage points higher than gross national prod uct (GNP) which is of course a more appropriate measure of national or regional income, while in Luxembourg you have the reverse with GDP some 6 Vi points lower than GNP. While it would be desirable to have better regional income measures the difficulties in compiling such measures will probably consign us to using regional GDP. However it needs to be used with caution. *) Dr. Jim Higgins, Department of Finance, Dublin, Ireland.

        "Regional policy: Trends and Statistical requirements Regional income or output alone may not be adequate measures of the state of economic cohesion in a region. One also needs to have some measure of the quantity, quality and vintage of public infrastructure, the stock of human capital and the stock of knowledge capital (i. e. Research and Development [R&D]). Ireland again is a case in point here; Ireland's GDP per capita is now at about the EU average yet the stock of public infra structure, in terms of quality road and rail infrastructure, modern waste water and waste management infrastructure and Research and Development infrastructure, is well below the EU average. While it has been possible to achieve convergence with a lower stock and qual ity of public infrastructure because of the relatively large inflows of Foreign Direct Invest ment concentrated in the high technology high value low volume products, it is clear that in order to sustain growth at the high levels of the past number of years, and to spread that growth to less developed regions within the country, it will be necessary to address this infra structure deficit. This will be a major priority for Ireland over the coming years and for poorer regions in other Member States and for the new applicant Member States Objectives of regional policy As I have already mentioned the primary objective of regional policy continues to be conver gence of regional output and income per capita. However this is not the sole objective of regional policy. Regional policy objectives now include, to varying degrees, environmental sustainability, gender equality, social inclusion and rural development. For example we are currently finalising a National Development Plan in Ireland which has economic and social cohesion as its primary objective but in the implementation of the Plan, account will have to be taken of the impact of various measures on the environment, equality, poverty and rural development. When you have multiple objectives they may not all be complementary. For example environmental sustainability may require a reduction in CO2 emissions which may conflict with the objective of economic cohesion. Of course this is nothing new as all policy making involves trade-off between competing objectives. With increasing integration of product and factor markets across the EU, spatial development considerations are increasingly becoming a feature of regional policy. In planning investment in transport infrastructure in a region account needs to be taken of investment plans in other adjoining regions and possibly throughout the Community. The need for more integrated planning, particularly in the area of infrastructure, is now widely recognised and the Euro pean Spatial Development Perspective is setting the agenda in this regard. These emerging trends in regional policy have implications for the compilation of official statistics. While I am reluctant to suggest that the statistical collection burden on Official Sta tistical Offices should be increased, as invariably Finance Ministries tend to be niggardly when the question of additional resources for this purpose is raised, I think that if we are to have effective and efficient execution of regional policies the indicator information required for evaluation and monitoring of these policies must be compiled. Regional policy instruments As mentioned earlier fiscal policy, through the medium inter-regional fiscal transfers, is a major policy instrument for regional income convergence within Member States. While I do not wish to raise the fiscal federalism issue at this meeting, we cannot ignore the importance Federal Statistical Office. Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 55 ",
        "Jim Higgins of such transfers in regional convergence and in my view the measurement of these transfers should form part of regional statistical databases. While Structural Funds transfers to the regions, through the EU Budget, are of course important they are relatively small compared to national governments fiscal transfers, even in the poorer countries of the Union. The other main macroeconomic policy instruments which have the potential to contribute to conver gence between countries are monetary and exchange policies. While there are differences of opinion as to the effectiveness of these instruments, they are \u00bfno longer available to members of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), making supply side instruments even more important for regional convergence. Turning to supply-side instruments for regional policy, the trend in the past has been to concentrate investment in physical infrastructure - roads, rail, water services, telecommuni cations, etc. Indeed prior to 1988, the principal EU regional policy instrument was the Euro pean Regional Development Fund (ERDF) which mainly funded infrastructural projects. Selective support for industrial investment to encourage firms to locate in less developed regions or help regenerate regions with concentrations of declining industries such as textiles, coal, steel, ship building are also important instruments of national regional policy. These declining industrial regions are also the focus of EU regional policy through Objective 2 Structural Funds programmes. While it was always recognised that regional convergence would require more than the provision of infrastructure and targeted support for productive investment, much greater attention is now being placed on other instruments of regional policy. These include human capital and research and technological development in particular. Human capital The success of any region is ultimately dependent on the quantity and quality of its human capital. Enhancing a region's human capital stock requires investment in training and edu cation. Well educated and trained people increasingly demand a range of social and recrea tional infrastructure close to where they work and live and regions which cannot provide such infrastructure risk a leakage of high quality human capital, whereas regions with this infra structure are likely to see inflow of this capital. In Ireland investment in recreational and cultural infrastructure was seen as an instrument to attract tourist into a region but now it is seen more as means of making regions attractive places in which to live and work. In many regions female labour force participation is well below that of male participation. This is a reservoir of human capital which can contribute to regional growth and conver gence. One of the principal barriers to increased female participation in the labour market is inadequate child care facilities at a price which makes paid employment worthwhile. Policies to facilitate female participation in the labour force, including the provision of good quality affordable child care, are now becoming a feature of national and regional policy in Ireland. In our case it is a policy born out of the necessity to address emerging labour shortages in the economy as well as helping the wider objective of gender equality. 56 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Regional policy: Trends and Statistical requirements Research and Development Economic growth theory has always attached a high priority to Research and Technological Development (RTD) in explaining the economic performance of countries. While regions can converge in the medium term without having high levels of investment in Research and Development (R&D), through importing technology associated with Foreign Direct Invest ment (FDI) - Ireland is a case in point -, over the long run, indigenous industry will not remain competitive unless it engages in, or has access to, good quality R&D. The RTD infra structure in a region is therefore considered an important instrument of regional policy. This includes a network of dedicated research institutions linked to research institutes world-wide and to domestic industry. While the Community's Research Framework programmes have supported research across the EU, the bulk of public funding for research comes from nation al governments which places less prosperous countries at a disadvantage in this regard. Within countries, research activity is invariably located in the wealthier more urbanised areas; this is unlikely to change. The challenge for policy makers is to design policy instru ments which will spread research results into production process and products in firms in less developed regions. Sectoral policy instruments Sectoral policy instruments will continue to have a role in regional policy. These include direct aid to manufacturing and natural resource industries. With increasing economic inte gration in the EU, the scope of policy interventions in these areas is being determined by Community wide policies in order to ensure fair competition. For manufacturing and traded services industries levels of aid (both direct subsidies and tax expenditures) are dictated by Regional Aid Guidelines (RAGS), while agriculture and fisheries policies have been con ducted under the umbrella of Community policies for some time now. I think that the trend towards sectoral policy intervention being centrally determined at EU level will continue and the objective of fair competition will be given increased weight. Spatial aspects of regional policy I have already mentioned that regional policy thinking at Community level is taking on a transnational character through the Economic and Spatial Development Perspective. Another aspect of regional policy is the appropriate territorial unit for regional policy interventions. I need hardly remind an audience here in Germany that spatial economics owes much to the work of German economists; Johann Heinrich von Thiinen, Alfred Weber, August L\u00f6sch and Walter Christfaller are among the most celebrated. They highlighted the importance of urban centres in economic activity. Paul Krugman has revived interest among economists in the role of urban centres in economic development. It is now widely accepted by policy makers that modern high technology manufacturing industries tend to cluster around urban centres because of agglomeration economies. In pursuing regional policies the role of urban centres, and their interrelationship with their hinterlands, to the convergence process is getting in creasing attention. These zones of economic activity do not necessarily coincide with the territorial regions used in official statistics (NUTS 2, NUTS 3, NUTS 4). This create prob lems for policy makers in evaluating the territorial effectiveness of policies. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 57 ",
        "Jim Higgins Statistical requirements for regional policy makers The widening of the depth and scope of regional policy has increased the statistical require ments for the design and execution of effective policies. There is now much greater attention to ex-ante and ex-post evaluation of regional policies. In addition more attention is given to on-going evaluation and monitoring of policies. While the introduction of the programming approach to Structural Funds in 1988 gave a strong impetus to this evaluation culture, evalu ation was a feature of programme and policy formulation in many countries prior to then. Statistical requirements for policy evaluation One of the challenges facing policy makers is choosing the most appropriate instruments to achieve policy objectives and deciding what level of resource deployment is required to achieve these objectives. While policy making is not a scientific exercise, good policies in variably emerge from well executed empirical research on the effectiveness of past policy interventions which inform ex-ante evaluation of any proposed policies. Good policies emerge from researching of existing policies across regions and nations. This research is crucially dependent on having time series and cross section data available for the target vari ables (i. e. dependent variables), the policy intervention variables and the other exogenous control variables. While econometric tools for measuring the effect of policy interventions are well developed, the data required to parameterise these econometric models are not as well developed or not always readily available. There is quite a considerable volume of data compiled at national and regional level in La bour Force Surveys, Household Expenditure Surveys, Business Surveys for manufacturing and services sectors and Farm Surveys, as well as periodic Censuses of Population and Busi ness. These data are potentially a rich source of information for policy analysts but they are not always readily accessible to these analysts in the form or at the level of disaggregation required for policy analysis. In order to analyse the potential effectiveness of some proposed regional policy intervention it may be necessary to have data at the individual or firm level; for example if one wants to know the effectiveness of a particular training measure on the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed in a region, or the effect of an R&D measure on firm level productivity. Individual and firm level data are also important for the measurement of dead-weight and displacement, important concerns of policy makers. In designing regional policy, the policy maker needs to have information on the strengths and weaknesses of the regions concerned. He may need it at a territorial level that does not coincide with the conventional NUTS classification; for example the territorial area could be a regional gateway or hub and its surrounding spokes. Assembling the information required for such an area from conventional official statistics may not be possible unless these sta tistics were complied from relatively small territorial units which of course is expensive. For some policy variables in which the regional policy maker has a keen interest, the information he requires is often not available from National Statistics Office data banks because it does not lend itself to conventional collection methods. I have in mind variables such as the physical stock and quality of various types of public infrastructure - roads, rail, telecommuni cations, water services, etc. One often has to rely on special surveys conducted by imple menting agencies and Local Authorities. I would see merit in integrating these type data into National Statistics Office data bases. A good example of this, which is currently under dis- 58 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Regional policy: Trends and Statistical requirements cussion in Ireland, and which I understand is also at various stages of development in other Members States, is an Integrated Transport Database. I have been involved with this project in Ireland and, while from the point of view of the policy maker looking from the outside in this appears to be a simple tasks, once one gets involved in the details one finds it is quite complex. It is a good example, in Ireland's case, of those responsible for transport policy for mation, transport economists and official statisticians working together. Policy monitoring Monitoring the effectiveness of regional policies, usually associated with EU Structural Funds programmes, involves the structured monitoring of expenditure and various output and impact indicators by Monitoring Committees. Monitoring is essential for assessing the effec tiveness of policy implementation and for informing policy makers when to make adjustments or call for further evaluation. Indicators are at the core of monitoring the effectiveness of regional policies. There are two main categories of indicators: resource indicators and per formance indicators 2 '. Resource indicators are measures of the inputs deployed and are usually expressed in monetary terms. Performance indicators can be categorised into output, result and impact indicators. Output indicators measure the physical quantity of output arising from the inputs deployed (e. g. kilometres of road constructed). The results indicators mea sure the immediate results of the intervention (e. g. reduction in journey time resulting from the road output). The impact indicators measure the economic impact of the interventions (e. g. the reduction in costs as a result of reduced congestion). Much of the data for input and output indicators have to be gleaned from administrative rec ords, or compiled from special surveys commissioned by programme implementing bodies. They are therefore to a large extent not part of National Statistical Offices' data banks. While it would be a huge burden on these Offices to have the responsibility for banking all of these data, originating from diverse administrative sources, in a systematic and user friendly fash ion, there are distinct advantages in moving in this direction given the expertise of these Offices in compiling and disseminating information. However, the resource implication of such a move would have to balanced against the value-added from such an endeavour. New data requirements for monitoring and evaluating regional policy As I have already mentioned regional policy markers are increasingly concerned with the environment, gender equality and social exclusion. There is therefore a requirement to devel op environmental, gender and social inclusion performance indicators as well as the tradi tional indicators of output, income, employment, etc. Policy interventions extend from the traditional physical infrastructure - roads, rail, energy, telecommunications and supports for productive sectors, to RTD, human capital, child care supports, multidimensional area-based local development initiatives, cultural and recreational measures, direct income supports, as well as regulatory measures in areas such as the environment. 2) There is a good discussion on indicators in the context of Structural Funds programmes in \"Evaluating socio economic programmes: Selection and use of indicators for monitoring and evaluation\" MEANS (1999).

        "Jim Higgins At the theoretical level the regional policy makers needs better calibrated models of the rela tionship between policy objectives - output, employment, income per capita, environment quality, gender equality and social inclusion - and the policy interventions in order to guide him or her in the design of more effective policy interventions. I would argue that we are a long way from achieving this, partly because the type of data needed to calibrate such models are not readily available but also because the theoretical relationships are not well developed. The new trends in regional policy need to be matched by more and better data on the environ ment. This will include data on various dimensions of air and water quality and the natural habitat. While much of this data is being collected and compiled by regulatory authorities, in cluding Environmental Protection Agencies and Local Authorities, it ought to be integrated into National Statistics Office data banks. In this regard Eurostat are playing a very useful role. The Quarterly Labour Force Surveys give us detailed information on labour market activity by gender but give us little indication of the barriers to female participation in the labour market generally, or to specific occupations, which is crucial to the policy maker if she/he is to design effective policies for gender equality. For this one has to rely on special survey data which are often subjective in nature. The Quarterly Labour Force Surveys do provide very useful benchmark data for measuring the effectiveness of policy interventions at national and regional level. As in the case of environmental quality, social exclusion (or its converse social inclusion) is also multidimensional and may also be territorially bounded. Long-term unemployment is frequently used as a proxy for social exclusion because the long-term unemployed tend to have higher incidences of poverty and ill-health and often are concentrated in communities that have higher incidences of crime, and drug addiction and low levels of cultural and social amenities. To measure all the aspects of social exclusion on a regular basis would be costly and probably not very cost effective. Periodic surveys to establish or verify the correlation between long-term unemployment and social exclusion should be sufficient. Turning to the policy intervention variables our data bases need improvement here also. As I mentioned earlier information on the physical stock of various categories of public infra structure and the quality of that infrastructure is not always available at national or regional level. The aggregate capital stock variables that can be derived from National Accounts data are of limited use to the policy makers when trying to decide how much to spend on road construction. Likewise v!th R&D, the most widely available measure is R&D expenditure but the policy maker requires more refined measures on various R&D inputs and outputs. These are not always available. Conclusion Regional policy objectives are getting more multidimensional. Some of the old theories about regional convergence may no longer be valid; for example in the case of European integra tion conventional theories would not have predicted the rapid growth and convergence for a region, such as Ireland, on the periphery; yet this is what has happened, aided in part by the integration process. As the EU expands East, the focus of Community regional policy will shift from the western and southern periphery to the East.

While the data required for the analysis and design of more effective regional policies are improving there are still many gaps in our information. In my view there needs to be more dialogue between the policy makers, the official statisticians and policy analysts and researchers. I know that progress is being made in providing data from national statistical data banks for research and evaluation purposes to the policy evaluation community but more needs to be done in this regard. There also needs to be a greater sharing of information and experiences internationally and the electronic media at our disposal today should make this a manageable task.

        "Pilar Mart\u00edn-Guzm\u00e1n*' New challenges to face the demands of regional statistics I would like to begin my presentation with an optimistic statement. This is, no doubt, the age of statistics. In fact, we have never been so important before. - Governments use our statistics to plan and design their policies, and to monitor the results of these policies. - The opposition and the social forces are also interested in our figures, and they judge and criticise the performance of the government based on them. - Also ordinary citizens become increasingly interested in statistics, not only to judge the performance of the government, and cast their vote consequently when the election comes, but also because they know that our figures will allow them to follow the trend of the economy, something that is going to affect their lives, and condition their possibilities. As a result, we, statisticians, are very much under the public eye now. This is, on the whole, a positive fact. But it also means that we have to face many new challenges. One of the challenges that we have to meet is an increasing demand for statistics at regional level, or even at sub-regional level, for small areas, at levels NUTS 4 or NUTS 5 of the European Community classification. There are several reasons to justify this demand. - First, an important part of the policies for economic and social convergence within the European Union (EU) are, to a good extent, implemented on regional bases. Structural funds are a good example of it. - Second, a process of regional decentralisation is taking place in many countries. Some countries are already decentralised, and have a federal structure, as is the case of Ger many. Others are midway in a process of power transferring to regional governments. Spain is a good example of it, but not the only one. This process is also starting in the United Kingdom and in Italy too. And this is only part of a wider process. A shift towards transferring more decision powers to local governments, to give to municipalities a higher participation in the organization of the local life, of the health and education services, is taking place not only in Europe but all over the world. According to the principle of subsidiarity, a wide range of problems is better solved at local level. And increasing the powers of the municipalities usually develops a higher level of democra*'\" participation, by involving more people in the decision processes. A natural result of all that is an increasing demand for statistics at regional and municipal level. But, in order to fulfil these new needs, these statistics have to be comparable. The fact that North Rhine-Westphalia is growing is an interesting fact. But it is as important to know if it is growing faster than Bavaria, or faster than the Piamonte, or Catalu\u00f1a. *) Prof. Dr. Pilar Mart\u00edn-Guzm\u00e1n, President, Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (INE), Madrid, Spain. 62 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "New challenges to face the demands of regional statistics The more decentralised a structure is, the more it needs comparable statistics, the more it needs harmonised standards for comparison. And all that means a few extra problems for us, statisticians, to solve. And here I will men tion a couple of them: - To create, at EU level, an integrated statistical system, and this implies. 1) Harmonisation of the statistics already existing. 2) Filling statistical gaps, in the countries. This process is not being easy because we come from different countries, with different cul tures and with different administration systems. And statistics are very connected with admin istration systems. For example, the harmonisation of something so apparently innocuous as the consumer price index (CPI) is giving us a lot of trouble in items such as health, or edu cation. Because the organization of these public services is so different in the EU countries, it has been extremely difficult to come to methodologies that could suit all of us. And I believe that this is a good opportunity to show my appreciation for the very active role that Eurostat is playing in this process, and to thank them for the effort and enthusiasm that they are putting in this task. - A second challenge to meet is to produce good and timely statistics at regional level. And here are several aspects to consider. 1) For the basic statistics, for example, the production of good estimations at regional level means increasing considerably the sample size, and in many cases, adapting the survey designs when regions have very different population sizes. 2) There are also the problems derived from globalisation, and the increasing presence of transnational companies. For example, how to impute at regional level figures, such as benefits or expenses, of companies that have several branches all over the country. In the industrial sector, for instance, companies usually know about the production in their different branches. But investments like marketing, or research and development are run from the central office, and the companies will not be able to impute which part of it is linked to each region. For the services sector it is often still more difficult. For example, how to impute re gional figures for the railway company. That is something that the company can not properly do. And, anyway, each company will probably apply a different methodology for the regional allocation of the economic variables. This is obviously a task to be performed by the Statistical Office. 3) The difficulty to measure the trade flows between regions. External trade figures are already problematic enough within the EU. Interregional trade is still more difficult to measure, and the production of Input-Output tables for regions is a difficult and risky task. As a result, regional accounts are usually produced from national accounts, by assign ing a portion of the national values to each of the regions, instead of proceeding the other way round, that is, instead of aggregating regional accounts to get the national figures. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 63 ",
        "Pilar Mart\u00edn-Guzm\u00e1n 4) Another problem for statisticians is that, when decision power is transferred to region al governments, these governments establish different regulations, different admin istration systems. The result is that data coming from administrative registers are no longer harmonised and cannot be used for comparisons or aggregation. There is also another challenge that we have to meet: the production of estimations for small areas, at municipality level. And we should try to produce them with a methodology that allows comparison. My guess is that this is soon going to be a must for the European Sta tistical System, and I want to take advantage of this opportunity to suggest that Eurostat or ganise a leadership group (LEG) on this subject and develop some guidelines. All this means that a higher number of politicians, and of citizens, are demanding our statistics and will use them. Our social utility is increasing, and we statisticians, are coming to be better known and appreciated. And then, last but not least, a consequence of this devolu tion process, this process of transferring decision powers to smaller units, is that we have to impart statistical education to a higher number of politicians. For instance, the regional government of the Canary Islands asked us to produce statistical figures on unemployment at the island level (7 islands). Since the sample design of the Span ish Labour Force Survey is stratified at the province level (2 provinces in the Islands), stan dard statistical results of the survey could not be provided. Thus, we offered the possibility of producing estimates based on small area estimation methods, which had to be explained to the politicians. It was a tremendous effort to convince them, but it was worth, since no new statistical operations had to be carried out. In spite of all the effort that we have to put in facing the described challenges, the balance of all this is very positive. We have increased the number and satisfaction of our users. And this means that we are bet ter known in the Spanish society, more useful to it and more popular. We are proud to say we are now contributing to develop a wider democratic system. Let me venture an opinion on a statistical policy issue, which I deem worth of discussion. It is about the subsidiarity in the production of statistics at the national level. In Spain, data collection and processing is a joint task of the central and regional offices. Many conventions passed between INE and the regional offices distribute the tasks in a very efficient way in order to minimise the different costs (time, economic and human resources, burden on respondents) of the statistical operations. The greater capability of the central office in the data collection phase (52 regional offices, permanent interviewers), in the computer assisted data processing, have justified the delega tion of those responsibilities in the central office, INE, in many of the conventions. Of course, that does not 'lean that the regional offices do not have an important role. In the case of structural surveys or censuses, the regional offices often collect the data, which are transmitted to INE. In all the cases, they analyse regional data, produce information for smaller areas within the region and impulse, with their demands, the production of better regional data by the central office. Thus, different subsidiarity models exist between the EU and the Member States and within Member States. At the national level - at least in Spain -, the model described above has greater efficiency in terms of resources and timeliness. 64 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Discussion of the second Session \"Regional and structural policies\" The need to provide up-to-date and reliable official statistics with a high degree of regional and subject-related detail for purposes of regional and structural policies was underlined by all participants in the discussion. That basis was found to be indispensable for planning, decision-making and an efficient monitoring of policies. It was repeatedly stressed that a high degree of harmonisation has meanwhile been achieved within the European Statistical Sys tem, with the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and the European System of Ac counts (ESA) being given as examples. However, the supply of regional data by European official statistics does not fully meet the requirements of regional and structural policies, in particular where the data are needed as a basis for planning and evaluating policies at region al level. To what extent the need for regional statistics may be covered by the European Statistical System essentially depends on whether adequate financial means can be made available for the production of relevant statistics with a high degree of regional and subject-related detail. Participants emphasised several times in the discussion that the current budgetary restrictions do not allow to finance a system of exhaustive surveys or large-scale samples. An increasing use of administrative registers was seen as a possibility to produce the required statistics in a less expensive way and to reduce the burden on respondents at the same time. However, at tention was also drawn to the limited availability of registers and the often insufficient quality of register data. The disparate information requirements at various levels may be fulfilled by conducting sample surveys with different sampling fractions that are geared to the needs at specific levels (supranational, national, regional, municipal) and by adjusting to this basis the set of vari ables to be covered. Such a system would also take into account the problems associated for the European Statistical System with the planned enlargement of the European Union (EU). A step-by-step aggregation of regional data, covering the whole range of subject-related detail, at first by the national statistical offices and then by Eurostat would be very time- consuming and hardly feasible in a larger EU. This issue is also closely related to the in creased demand for timely macroeconomic core indicators that has come up especially with regard to monetary policy decisions for the euro area. The timeliness of statistical data is of vital importance for day-to-day policy-making, particu larly at regional and municipal levels, with a view to analysing the effectiveness of political programmes at short notice. Hence, policy-makers are making clear and urgent demands that statistics should provide the most timely information possible. However, policy-makers must also be prepared to create the basic financial conditions for statistics. Substantial amounts of funds are spent every year for expert reports evaluating the impact of political programmes. Apart from gathering own data, those expert reports often draw on results of official statis tics. It would be a sound investment if at least part of these funds were used to strengthen official statistics with the aim of enabling statisticians to do a better job in the field of re gional statistics. It is an investment that statisticians should demand from policy-makers. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 65 ",
        "Discussion of the second Session - Regional and structural policies The deficit of official statistics at supranational, national and regional levels was identified in the discussion as the fact that they are still too much focused on representing the situation in individual areas such as the economy, environment, transport, infrastructure, education and labour market, while neglecting to illustrate - as urgently required - the interrelations be tween these areas by linking individual statistics. In this context, the establishment of a sys tem of environmental-economic accounting was seen as just a first, though highly welcome step. Official statisticians were requested to increase their efforts at improving and further developing the instruments they have available. 66 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Carlo Malaguerra*' Concluding remarks We have arrived at the end of Session 2. The agenda in front of me states: Plenary discussion, summary by the chair. I do not suppose that you really expect me to give a summary of the rich and multidimensional discussion we have just had. However, I would like to emphasise the following points. This Conference focuses on Policies and Statistics, and in this context, I first of all would like to thank those who have organised the Conference for having prepared it and having provided an opportunity of direct exchange of opinions between statisticians and users of statistics. Statistics will have to become increasingly open and to conduct an ever closer dialogue with the users of information, which I think is a very good idea. Once again many thanks to the organisers. At the same time, I would like to thank the speakers for the excellent papers which they delivered this morning. Since those papers were very rich in information, they are certainly worthwhile to be studied in depth again. And thanks also to all of you who have actively participated in the discussion. I believe that it has very clearly turned out in the discussion that statisticians must come much closer to the political decision-makers. We as statisticians are still too far away from those who take the political decisions. Our work is still characterised by the compilation of infor mation which is derived from the production processes. And we have not yet recognised the function of the synthesis of information, of the multidimensional and multisectoral presenta tion of information for specific decisions. The role of the different statistical institutes espe cially at the regional level, but also at the national level, should be more or less that of observatories. Attempts should be made to assess social phenomena at the global level. And it should be possible to quantify those phenomena by means of a set of indicators. However, we must try to reflect the complex reality in the best-possible manner, and I believe that, for us as statisticians, quite a lot is left to be done in order to ensure the functions of monitoring society and providing the information required. As I believe, another very important point is that only a federal structure - in the sense of the subsidiarity principle - is capable of supplying the necessary information due to the very complex nature of society which we all experience every day. I follow Mr. Franchet's opin ion that it is just correct that a set of information is required at a rather high level which does not always correspond to the sets of information at the national and the regional level. And I believe that information should not always be comparable at the regional level because, otherwise, you would risk making inappropriate comparisons. However, there must be a cer tain degree of freedom at the regional level in order to adequately present the particularities of regional economies. Finally, I would like to add that the epoch of national information is long over and we require an international, preferably even supranational authority for defining standards, nomencla tures and conceptual stat:i>tic: I believe that we must increasingly convince statisticians of an \"evidence-based society\" as our Anglo-Saxon colleagues would put it. Only with this assign ment will we be able to serve the democratic institutions and, in fact, generate a more rational democratic discussion. *) Dr. Carlo Malaguerra, Director General, Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland, Neuchatel.

        "Johann Hahlen*' Social and labour market policies Introductory remarks Ladies and Gentlemen! This morning we have dealt with the highly interesting issue of regional and structural statis tics and the political requirements to be met by that area and we could have continued dis cussing for hours. This afternoon we are going to treat a similarly interesting topic: The statistics for social and labour market policies. I am pleased that high-ranking speakers have accepted to participate, and I would like to welcome Mr. Bill Wells from the United Kingdom's Department for Education and Employment. I am also pleased that a well-known colleague from the responsible Directorate-General V of the Commission of the European Union (EU) has come, too: Welcome, Mr. Armindo Silva! Finally, I am very pleased that my Danish colleague, Mr. Jan Plovsing, has accepted to act as a co-speaker. He will comment from a statistical viewpoint on the demands made by the administration and the ministries. Before we start dealing with our actual topic, please let me add some reflection regarding the place where we are holding our Conference: Some colleagues took the opportunity to visit an exhibition just opposite this building; it is a depressing exhibition on the topography of terror, that is the places of Nazi terror. In this context, official statistics is concerned, too. The Ger man system of official statistics must be prepared to answer the question for its role in the Third Reich, during the Nazi terror regime. Therefore, some years ago, the Federal Statistical Office commissioned a historical expert report to analyse the role statistics played during the Nazi regime, taking as an example the population census of 1939. A draft version of that ex pert report became available to me a few days ago. It shows that official statistics in Germany as part of the administration at the time did not resist the temptation and the infringements by Nazism, that statistical confidentiality was violated for ideological reasons in a number of cases, and that, in a way, statisticians became implicated in what happened at the time. Therefore, as we are about to begin this afternoon's discussions on social and labour market statistics, I wish to recall, as a German citizen, that we as statisticians bear particular responsibility especially in the field of social and societal population statistics. One may live up to that special responsibility, or one may fail - German statistics did fail, at least in part, during the Nazi regime. This is why we - that is those in charge of German statistics - are all the more obliged today to keep up and defend with all our strength the ethical principles of official statistics. But let me come back to our actual issue. When European integration started, attention fo cused on the statistics of the iron and steel sector, then on the statistics of the agricultural sec tor. When the decision was made to set up the European Single Market, the focus was on eco nomic statistics. Since we tuve started implementing the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the statistics mainly concerned have been those for monetary and business cycle policies. Statistics regarding the social sector and the labour market rather played a minor part in the European Union (EU). This has changed since the Maastricht *) Johann Hahlen, President, Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Wiesbaden 68 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Social and labour market policies - Introductory remarks Treaty and especially the Amsterdam Treaty were concluded. Labour market and social is sues have now become one of the focuses of EU policies, and of course this is what we, as statisticians, have to take as a basis of our activities. If we summarise what the European Commission has said with regard to that area, we may get the impression that the Commis sion wishes to set up a European Social Reporting System. Harmonised European Social Re porting would be a highly demanding and ambitious goal. This afternoon we are going to dis cuss that issue, and I am looking forward to hearing what Mr. Armindo Silva will say about whether that goal really exists. At the beginning of our discussion, I myself would like to mention two aspects raising doubts about the goal of setting up a European Social Reporting System: First: It is true that employment policies and the labour markets in all Member States are in the focus of interest; of course, this applies to Germany too, where unemployment levels are particularly high. In the EU as a whole there were about 10 million unemployed in 1981, when Europe had 12 Member States. In 15-member Europe or, more precisely, in the euro zone, that is in the 11 Member States of the Monetary Union, we had nearly 14 million unem ployed in December 1998. So, the overall trend has been quite negative. This is why employ ment and unemployment statistics are major elements of our work, and much remains to be done for European statistics especially in this sector. In Germany, the situation of our employment and unemployment statistics is all but satisfac tory at present, especially because we calculate different unemployment rates in Germany. The Federal Institute for Employment has an unemployment definition of its own, while we at the Federal Statistical Office base our statistics on the definition of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva, and Eurostat again uses a slightly modified definition. If we talk to politicians in Germany, again and again we meet with a lack of understanding of the fact that different unemployment rates and different employment figures are published in newspapers; they say, people want to know what the situation really is like. It is very difficult to explain to politicians that each of the various definitions is justified and covers specific aspects of employment and unemployment. This being so, it might even turn out that it is im possible to represent the phenomenons of employment and unemployment by just one defini tion. The former Chancellor Kohl once criticised that situation quite vehemently and drasti cally towards his staff. We then made an attempt in Germany to harmonise the definitions to some extent. That was one year ago. However, I cannot really see any progress in this matter. The second reason why I am sceptical about a European Social Reporting System is this: As every statistician knows, the social and societal conditions are highly complex. Just think of the issues of poverty and wealth. The new Federal Government has decided to prepare and publish a report on poverty and wealth in Germany. Our initial preparatory work on such a report quite early showed how complex that topic is and how the most different definitions and concepts of poverty compete with each other. If this is the situation even within Ger many, I am sure that the situation will definitely be the same within the European Union and within the euro zone. This is why I wonder whether the goal of a harmonised Statistical Re porting System on social conditions in the EU really can be achieved - or whether we rather should accept the existence of different national statistical cultures, which presumably are best suited to represent the various forms of social conditions in the individual Member States.

        "Johann Hahlen Let me finish my introduction by making a proposal: If we discuss the social and labour mar ket conditions in Europe and if we statisticians make a contribution, would it not be prefer able to follow the approach of ex-post harmonisation instead of basic harmonisation? That is, we should take the various national systems, try to compare their results and draw ex-post conclusions. That approach should be seriously considered. To sum up, establishing a Euro pean Social Reporting System is a highly ambitious and comprehensive goal. Let us discuss it. I am looking forward to seeing what conclusions we will draw during the discussions and I am looking forward to listening to the speech of Bill Wells now. 70 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Bill Wells*' A coherent picture of the labour market Introduction 1. This note considers three issues of how labour market statistics might be presented in order to inform policy better, what this implies for the development of statistics and what role the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) has in this process. 2. The three issues are: - that labour market information should be presented in a more coherent and com prehensive way and that the centrepiece of this presentation should be employment rather than unemployment; - that the principle of subsidiarity ought to be applied in terms of EU statistics as much as in any other field and Eurostat should only require common statistics in a harmo nised form when it is necessary. Where appropriate and possible national statistics should be assembled and presented by Eurostat. - that hybrid measures such as 'full time equivalents' should be avoided as they tend to confuse rather than illuminate. They are also based on a set of value judgements which, when made explicit, imply a ranking of particular types of employment in terms of worth which is very questionable. 3. The way these three issues in this paper are addressed stems from two propositions. First, that statistics have no value in themselves but rather represent a means to an end. The collection of statistics involves the use of resources and requires time and effort from those who provide the statistics - people and businesses. Therefore, the statistics collect ed should be kept to the minimum necessary to achieve their purpose. They should also be collected in the most cost effective and least onerous way. Not only that, but when the statistics have been collected they should be used to the fullest extent and also be pres ented in a readily accessible form. 4. The second proposition is that all statistics embody value judgements. What statistics are collected and the way they are presented are policy choices and, therefore, statistics are part of the political economy. Normally these value judgements are implicit and, hence, sometimes statistics are regarded as 'pure' or 'scientific'. However, as I hope the discus sion on 'full time equivalents' brings out this is not the case. And, more generally, given that there are differences between the political economies of the countries of the EU, statistics which ostensibly measure the same thing using the same definitions and method of collection will mean different things in different countries. In many cases the differ ences are likely to be small but even then bodies such as Eurostat should be aware of these differences. They will also need to decide when it is appropriate to harmonise sta tistics and when it i' necessary to recognise the national differences. *) Bill Wells, Department for Education and Employment, London, United Kingdom.

        "Bill Wells A coherent picture of the labour market 5. Labour markets have generally tended to be described by a single statistic, unemploy ment. The debate in the past, particularly in the UK, has tended to be which measure of unemployment to use - the numbers on unemployment related benefits or a household survey based measure - and whether it was the level or the rate of unemployment which should be the focus. Across the EU, too, the focus has been on unemployment with the monthly press release on the labour market concentrating entirely on different aspects of unemployment. 6. However, such a narrow focus does not adequately capture the complexities of the labour market, real life or the experiences of individuals. Nor, at a European level, does it make full use of the main statistical instrument on the labour market - the Labour Force Survey (LFS). 7. Recently the national statistical agency in the UK - the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - has considered the regular presentation of its labour market statistics. The outcome of this review is a hefty document called the integrated first release which is published monthly. The document not only tries to provide a comprehensive set of infor mation but also to present it in a coherent way. This approach has, I believe some lessons which might be drawn by Eurostat not only as to what might go into its monthly labour market report but also for developments in the EU LFS. 8. Central to this new approach is employment. In this the work of the ONS chimes in with the new Government's approach to the labour market. The government has restored as their central economic objective the achievement of high and stable levels of growth and employment. What is more, unlike in the past, they are not considering this indirectly by focusing on the achievement of low levels of unemployment but rather they are directly considering employment partly because (as will be described more fully below) they are considering all people without jobs, not just the unemployed but also the economically inactive. This approach is not just confined to the UK, there are major similarities to the descriptive statistics used by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop ment (OECD) in their Jobs Study. 9. There is, therefore, much more emphasis on the level of employment but also, more importantly, on the employment rate - the proportion of the population who are in work. The reason why it is not sufficient to consider just the level of employment is that, gener ally, population grows. Therefore, higher levels of employment can still be associated with more people without work. The current UK position is an example of this. The level of employment is at record levels. However, the employment rate, although it is just above the levels reached at the economic peak of 1979, is not yet up to the levels of the peak of 1990. 10. There is a question of how to define the most commonly used employment rate. In the UK it is defined as the number of people in employment of working age (16 to 59 for women, 16 to 64 for nrjn) as a proportion of the population of working age. It, therefore, ignores people below the minimum school leaving age and above the state pension age. I would suggest that such an approach is appropriate at a European level as well because relatively few children and people above pension age work. However, the one amend- 72 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "A coherent picture of the labour market ment to the UK approach I would suggest for international comparisons would be to adopt the OECD approach and equalise the upper age of consideration for men and women at 64. That would, I believe, allow more appropriate comparisons across coun tries without offending the principle of subsidiarity. If this approach is accepted then I believe that there is a case for including the employment rate in the EU labour market report. This rate could be based on the EU LFS and uprated in a similar fashion to the way the International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment rates are updated. Such an approach would not require the collection of new or different statistics but rather the assembly of existing material in a different form. 11. Some argue that different age bands than 16 to 64 for the employment rate are more appropriate. A particularly strong case for this is made for excluding young people as a large proportion of this age group are in education. However, I believe that this is a particular case of a more general proposition that all people without work should be considered. Not just those in the population who are not employed but are in the labour force - the unemployed - but also those who are outside the labour force altogether - the economically inactive. In the particular example of young people in education if information is provided on the numbers who are not in work and are outside the labour market because they are full time students it would enable the information on employ ment rates to be illuminated. 12. Thus, I believe that information on inactivity as well as unemployment should be provid ed. Again I believe that the UK provides a good example of the sort of information that might be collected on the economically inactive. Here, unfortunately, if the UK approach was adopted it would require more information on economic inactivity to be collected as most countries in their LFS do not have much more than rudimentary information on the economically inactive. So, currently, this statistic is not comparable across countries. At present I do not believe that this statistic ought to be included in the Eurostat monthly labour market report. However, I do think that more ought to be made of it in the main LFS publications. 13. I believe that the labour market provides a particular example of a more general princi ple. Because I believe that new requests for information from Member States should be kept to the necessary minimum then the maximum use of information should be derived from the statistics which are actually provided to Eurostat. Subsidiarity in statistics 14. The integrated first release in the UK provides much more information than that provid ed from the LFS. It also includes information on average earnings, the numbers on unem ployment related benefits and Jobcentre vacancies and an employer based estimate of employment. The inclusion of such information in an EU labour market release would, I believe, be inappropriate. This is not only because of the sheer bulk and effort associated with assembling and pi'OIisHng the information but also because these statistics are asso ciated with the national ra'her than the European picture. For example, claimant unem ployment is society's measure of the people who should be assisted through benefits because they are unemployed. Different countries have different rules and administration on claimant unemployment and it would be inappropriate to harmonise either the policies Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 73 ",
        "Bill Wells or, indeed, the statistics. Using these national statistics in conjunction with the LFS based information enables people to consider, in the context of the UK labour market, how policy should be developed and what measure of success is being achieved. 15. More controversially, there is a case for Eurostat assembling information on national statistics and presenting it, in as comparable a form as possible, for purposes of compari son. Thus, the assembly of claimant/registrant unemployment for each country and its publication alongside the common measures of ILO unemployment from the LFS would, I believe, add to the debate. It would provide a national context because registrant/ claimant unemployment are still widely regarded by the people of the individual coun tries as the measure of unemployment. 16. There is also, I believe, sometimes a case for using national rather than harmonised EU statistics as the basis for EU decisions and policy development. The EU labour costs sur vey has always been very difficult to run on a consistent, harmonised way because the components of earnings and particularly non-wage labour costs vary enormously across the EU. The reason for this diversity is bound up with the rules and regulations in the labour market and the tax and benefit systems. In such circumstances it seems to me that there is a case for using the information already collected nationally to inform their poli cy debate and use that rather than trying to shoehorn concepts that do not fit into an inappropriate framework. Value judgement and statistics 17. The LFS is based upon people. However, implicit in some presentations of the informa tion in the LFS there are also value judgements incorporated. Thus, if we take the LFS results publication for 1997 certain things strike you. 18. Firstly, there is a concentration on employees rather than other forms of employment, In fact, it is not possible using the published data without a lot of effort to get total employ ment broken down by full and part time status whereas information on full and part time employees is readily accessible. Thus, the presentation implies that employees are worth more than other forms of employment - self employment and family workers. 19. Implicit value judgements are even more in evidence when hybrid measures such as full time equivalents are constructed. Chief amongst them is the implicit value judgement that full time workers have a greater worth than part time workers - they are given a greater weight. In its crudest but most popular form a full timer is equivalent to 2 part timers. 20. It is sometimes argued that the use of full time equivalents is a way of adjusting for the different hours worked. This is not true. For example, in 1997 average usual weekly hours in the EU as a whole were 38.2 (for all in employment); in the UK they were mar ginally less at 38.1, in France 37.9 and in Germany 37.6. Yet, despite the fact that the UK had higher average hours than the other two countries, any adjustment to translate the UK figures into full time equivalents leads to a greater reduction in employment than for France and Germany because the UK has a much higher proportion of part time workers. And, the difference can be large. Adjusting for the hours difference between the 74 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "A coherent picture of the labour market UK and the EU makes virtually no difference (7 thousand less than actual employment) whereas adjusting for full time equivalents\" reduces the UK numbers by around 3 - 3 \u03b9 \u0394 million. 21. There are a large variety of ways of adjusting for full time equivalents. All of them in\u00ad volve questionable implicit value judgements. Therefore, if such calculations are carried out these value judgements should be made explicit. Preferably, however, the value of all employment - full-time, part-time, temporary, permanent, employee, self employed, fam\u00ad ily workers and government supported trainees - be treated equally as set out in the ILO guidelines. This is because they all represent a person in employment. 22. Of course it may be useful to set out the composition of employment and people may make express choices about the worth of various types of work. However, concepts such as full time equivalents mask these value judgements rather than illuminate them. I would, therefore, suggest that such concepts are not useful and if some form of hours adjustment is required then it ought to be explicitly using average hours. Such an ap\u00ad proach would allow all the hours worked, whether by full or part time, to be treated equally. Conclusion 23. This note considers three issues and aims to provide practical suggestions about how la\u00ad bour market statistics at both a national and EU level might be assembled and presented. 24. I suspect that some of the proposals might be considered controversial. However, I hope that they stimulate debate. 1 ) For employees because information on all in employment is not available.

        "Armindo Silva*' Employment strategy and EMU: Policy challenges versus information needs Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, 1. Let me first thank you for your invitation to participate in today's workshop. It offers indeed a good opportunity to address, with the participation of key actors and technical experts, a key challenge for Europe today: the need for accurate, comparable and timely- provided data as a technical support for decision-making in economic policy. 2. Why is this a challenge and a top priority? There are essentially two driving forces be hind the changes ahead: the European Employment Strategy and the Economic and Mon etary Union. First, the Employment Strategy. We have seen how powerful simple, transparent, syn thetic indicators can be in fostering change - making policies move. What is measured, gets done! The Maastricht Treaty would never have created the movement in macroeco- nomic policies required for the euro, had it not been based on a set of a few quantified objectives based on verifiable indicators across which progress could be measured. 3. We have a similar process underway in the area of the European Employment Strategy, where by virtue of the Amsterdam Treaty, we have introduced a \"management by objec tives\" approach - an approach which forges determined action towards higher levels of employment through peer pressure and the setting of quantified objectives and targets. This process must be based on a quantum leap in the production of adequate data. 4. Since the Luxembourg Summit in November 1997, which adopted the first Employment Guidelines, all European Summits have stressed the need for common indicators based on comparable statistics, in order to monitor the implementation of the guidelines. 5. Secondly, European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) strengthens the need for monitoring labour costs trends in the euro zone in order to enhance the accuracy of monetary policy. Moderate behaviour of unit labour costs will contribute to overall price stability, thereby widening the margin of manoeuvre for the European Central Bank (ECB) to set the monetary policy best conductive to economic and employment growth. 6. Until now, wage developments have been monitored mostly at national level. Now, given the integrated nature of monetary policy, decision-makers have to keep an attentive eye on developments of wages and productivity in the euro zone as a whole. Local or sec toral wage agreements should also be monitored, when they influence the behaviour of price and wage-setting actors elsewhere. 7. In the debate in Cologne about the European Employment Pact, the European leaders have called for an improved monitoring of wage developments to help foster transpar ency and create a better base for policy dialogue. Here also, the improvement of the data content and the agreement on common indicators are at the centre of concern. *) Armindo Silva, Directorate General V, Commission of the European Union (EU), Brussels, Belgium. 76 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Employment strategy and EMU: Policy challenges versus information needs 8. Both challenges, EMU and the employment strategy, stress the need to make efforts for improving labour market statistics, as the basis for monitoring and improving the func tioning of Europe's labour markets. 9. We have a long way to go. We have to make progress soon. Otherwise, neither the Com mission, nor national authorities, nor the ECB, each with their own responsibility and autonomous capacity, will be able to live up to the commitment of implementing effi cient economic and employment policies towards common objectives. 10. Nor will the social partners be able to contribute efficiently to these objectives. Let me emphasise here the key responsibility that the social partners have in providing better and timely information as well as ensuring its utilisation in their everyday decision making. The progress achieved so far Let me move on to describe the progress that we have been able to achieve so far. 11. Over the last couple of years, we have made some progress in developing indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of the Employment Guidelines, as this was a key feature of the mandate received from the Luxembourg Summit. - A first set of basic performance indicators has been agreed for monitoring the over all employment performance of the Member States. There are six indicators on em ployment and unemployment broken down by gender and three economic related indicators; such as growth of the gross domestic product (GDP), apparent labour productivity growth, and real unit labour costs. - Agreement was also reached on the policy indicators to be utilised for monitoring the implementation of the three European targets on preventing long-term unem ployment and on activation of the labour market policies. 12. In 1999, a significant majority of Member States was able to provide for the first time register-based data for both output and input policy indicators. This has allowed the Commission to assess more objectively the achievements of Member States in imple menting the guidelines. The shortcomings In September, the Commission adopted a draft Joint Employment Report, containing its analysis of the Member States' National Action Plans. The conclusions of this report underpin the Commission's proposal of guidelines for 2000, as well as its recommendations to indi vidual Member States on employment policy. While recognising the progress achieved in measuring performance and policy implementation, the report reveals a number of short comings to be corrected in our Community statistics. Let me mention some of them. 13. Measuring employment still faces considerable difficulties, both across Member States and over time, due to differences in concepts, survey sample design, rotation patterns, or reference periods. For this reason, we are not using uniform sources for measuring em ployment: national accounts are used in some cases and the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in others. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 77 ",
        "Armindo Silva 14. Survey-based unemployment data still see their comparability flawed to some degree by persisting differences in questionnaires of the National Surveys and in the implemen tation of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition by Member States. De spite these shortcomings however, inter-country comparisons of unemployment rates based on a common definition and progressively harmonised data collection systems, are by far more reliable than comparisons based on administrative registers. However accu rate and professionally elaborated they might be, registers do naturally reflect deep dif ferences in unemployment benefit systems across the Member States, and cannot in gen eral be used to measure unemployment stocks in a comparative way. 15. A crucial gap is the lack of flow data, in particular, data on inflows and outflows of short- and long-term unemployment, training schemes and other active measures. We need to know how labour moves along certain paths and crosses certain thresholds. What is behind the dynamics of the labour market? For this, mere stock data will not do. We urgently need to develop longitudinal data, based on either administrative sources or representative surveys. Otherwise we cannot measure policy effort and impact, particu larly as regards the new preventive policies launched by Member States in response to the first and second guidelines. In this respect, it is crucial that those Member States which do not track the unemployed persons throughout the whole duration of unemploy ment, start to improve their monitoring systems, so as to produce data comparable with those of the other Member States. 16. Another crucial shortcoming is the lack of comparable data on levels of participation of unemployed people in active labour market measures, disaggregated by gender, age and unemployment duration. This is needed not only in order to assess Member States' com pliance with guideline 3, which stipulates that at least 20% of the unemployed should be participating in some type of active measure. It is also, when combined with expenditure data, a necessary tool to assess efficiency of Labour Market policy. 17. We need also to develop comparable statistics in employment related areas that are of crucial importance for the monitoring of the guidelines such as tax and benefits, transi tion from school to work, participation in life-long learning, working time, enterprise demography and employment in new service and the social economy. 18. Last but not least, there are considerable tasks ahead in improving statistical information about labour costs. Available data at national level, such as labour costs indices and Quarterly National Accounts can meet the most urgent needs. But these indicators have some gaps in terms of timeliness, comprehensiveness and ability to be used as leading indicators. Therefore the Central Bank and other users might be faced to a deficit of sta tistical short-term information on labour costs (as compared to U.S. users and especially the Federal Reserve Bank). An evaluation of this deficit must be carried out and used as a basis for further development. 19. Effective and timely monitoring of labour costs is crucial to monitor and anticipate, as an early timely warning tool, cost-driven strains of price inflation in the short-run. But accu rate data on wages and other labour costs are also crucial for employment and structural policies. They are a condition for sound policy advice, inter alia, in: - identifying long-term trends in job creation related to the substitution of capital for labour; 78 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Employment strategy and EMU: Policy challenges versus information needs - determining the size and effect of policy-driven factors of labour costs, such as social security contributions, for different levels of wages; - assessing the effect of minimum wages on employment. For these reasons we believe that the role of unit labour costs as a predictor of inflation pressures in the economy must be combined with an analysis of structural data on labour costs. 20. Also, we doubt that trends in unit labour costs should be read in isolation. It is not easy to discern the ultimate case for observed changes in prices. Whether inflation is cost- driven, through wage pressure, or demand-driven, getting the right interpretation of the data is crucial. Each option will require a different policy mix to control inflation and maintain price stability. This is only possible by underpinning policy decisions with analysis on structural data on wages, labour costs, employment and sectoral output. 21. As a consequence there is a need to avoid a \"simplistic\" approach to reforming EU sta tistics on labour costs. Thus, the development of a labour price index in the EU is wel come and highly valuable. But, there is still a great deal more to do, for instance by revamping and extending the Structure of Earnings Survey (SES). In its present form, the survey does not provide data on production units below ten employees or in the public sector, leaving uncovered a significant part of the employed population. Moreover, data or non-wage labour costs are not gathered. It is important to relaunch the survey on a more comprehensive basis. The action 22. We must recognise that most of these shortcomings are being addressed by ongoing ini tiatives led by the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), with the active support of several other services of the Commission, and in particular of the Directorate General responsible for Employment. Let me highlight in this respect the following actions: 23. First, the continuous Labour Force Survey (LFS), as adopted by the Council 1998, thanks to which it will be possible to obtain quarterly data on unemployment and em ployment and to improve the consistency of data over time. It is essential that the con sensus already achieved among 13 Member States, the EFTA States and most of the applicant countries be extended to cover also Germany and Austria. 24. Second, the new LFS will allow for greater flexibility to the extent that it will include a different topic for in-depth treatment every year. In 2000, transition from-school-to-work will be a specific module of the EU LFS, and also here it is important that all Member States could participate actively. 25. The second Continuous Vocational Training Survey (CVTS 2) will be carried out in 2000, with 1999 as reference year, with the aim of providing data on participants and costs of training offered by the enterprises, as well as management's and social partners' attitude towards training. The results of the survey will be instrumental in assessing pro gress in a key area of lifelong learning. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 79 ",
        "Armindo Silva 26. ESSPROS, the social protection statistical system, is being extended in order to integrate a specific module on expenditure and participants in labour market policies. An experi mental data collection has been carried out already in 1999, and work is progressing so that the first results come out by the end of next year. If all goes well, this instrument based on existing administration data, will plan a key role for the monitoring of the guidelines. 27. Finally, a number of interesting projects are now being examined, on which my col leagues from Eurostat have more information than I do: I would like to mention here the current development work on a Labour Price Index, a European index of collective bar gaining wages, comparable statistical information about job vacancies for the euro zone as a key for detecting labour shortages and rigidity in labour markets, and the new mod ule for the 2001 EU LFS on working time and new forms of employment. Over recent months, the Member States have accepted the political priority of developing more and better comparable common indicators as a key to reinforcing the credibility and en forceability of the Employment Strategy. Our efforts will continue in the months to come. The Cologne European Council has wel comed the progress made thus far and has renewed our mandate to work, in particular through inviting the Member States to translate the Employment Guidelines into additional verifiable objectives, with precise deadlines for achievement, both at European and national levels. The same European Council also mandated the Commission and the Member States to improve monitoring of wage developments in order to create a more transparent base for the macroeconomic dialogue. We are now embarking on a process that will lead us to a European employment reporting system as a necessary tool for the European strategy. It is an ambitious goal, commensurate with the policy goals of cutting unemployment down from the present 10% to socially ac ceptable levels, and increasing the employment rate up from 61% to about 70%, the level reached by our trading partners. We hope that this ambition can be shared by the Member States and that the current efforts undertaken by the Commission will correspond by all, whatever their domestic difficulties. Let me however state that such a European system does not replace national reporting sys tems. These will always be necessary, to underpin national employment policies for which Member States are ultimately responsible and to reflect specific concerns and circumstances, falling beyond the scope of the European guidelines. Better employment in Europe needs the timely provision of accurate, representative and com parable data to support our economic and employment policies. I am convinced that there are great benefits to reap from a strong partnership and co-ordination of our efforts to make this happen.

        "Jan Plovsing*' Do we elucidate the development in the labour market and social conditions adequately? Thank you Mr. Hahlen and thank you very much indeed for inviting me to speak in the city of Berlin in these exciting times. Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen. The main question in my speech is: Do we elucidate the development in the labour market and social conditions adequately? 1 Introduction The answer is, of course, no, because we can always do better. In fact, we have much devel opment work ahead of us in social and labour market statistics. But there are also many areas where we fully meet the expectations the users of statistics have. The Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the National Statistical Institutes (NSI) have already made considerable progress in many statistical areas. In relation to the former discussion of the concepts of unemployment and employment I would like to say that I am a strong believer in the professional independence of statistical institutions. Statistics should be trustworthy and reliable. Statistics should not be directed by specific political interests. Governments or ministries should not define the concepts of un employment and employment. Ministries should not produce general statistics. Statistics should be politically relevant, but not politically directed. That is why general statistics should only be produced by professionally independent statistical institutions. Today I will address five key questions that European politicians would like to have an swered in the form of current statistics. I have selected areas where the work of developing statistics needs to be continued at the European level. Consequently, I will focus attention on areas where we are not doing quite adequately at the European level today. The five ques tions are: - How does the transition from training or education to labour market proceed? - What is the effect of an active labour market policy? - What do we know about retirement from the labour market and about the ratio of recipi ents of transfer payments to employed persons? - Which Member States of the European Union (EU) have the highest social expenditure? - Can we measure poverty and marginalisation in the labour market? There may be current statistical answers to these questions at the national level, as I will show. But we need resources to develop such statistics at the European level. *) Jan Plovsing, Director General, Statistics Denmark, Copenhagen.

        "Jan Plovsing 2 EU statistics and national statistics The Amsterdam Treaty Cooperation in the EU has been increasingly enhanced, and the Amsterdam Treaty has given us a framework within which national employment policies have to be coordinated within the entire EU. This was specified in connection with the European Council's decision in Novem ber 1997 to prepare national employment action plans which are to be assessed using com mon indicators based on comparable statistics. The euro At the same time, in connection with the establishment of the common currency, the euro, the European Central Bank (ECB) was set up, and it needs to have a timely and accurate view of developments in, for example, the labour market. This has contributed to Eurostat intensi fying its work of establishing harmonised statistics for the entire EU. Here I would like to say that I very much appreciate the efforts of Eurostat to facilitate this process. And especially the role that Yves Franchet plays in the process. Creating harmonised statistics on the basis of a wide range of different national statistics systems is a huge task. But our users rightly expect comparable statistics within the EU as well as within the entire Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) area. Comparability greatly enhances quality. Subsidiarity Out of consideration for the companies' response burden and the costs of producing statistics in individual countries, we must give great weight to the principle of subsidiarity. This means that the method of producing statistics is not always what should be harmonised (so-called input harmonisation). It is the output that should. Consequently, it should be possible to use both surveys and register-based information. After this introduction, I will comment on the five questions I posed earlier, and in this con nection I will also apply the experience gained by Statistics Denmark. You have to excuse me for using Danish figures, but they are only meant as illustrations. The first question was: 3 How does the transition from training or education to labour market proceed? A good tool for measuring employment and unemployment The European Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a tool for swift and harmonised statistics con cerning key figures for developments in the labour market, such as employment and unem ployment. Likewise, the LFS provides a good description of the composition and perform ance of the workforce. Moreover, the establishment of ad hoc modules provides a possibility for further surveys of the European labour markets. Thus, in 1999, we have surveyed the scope of occupational accidents. 82 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Do we elucidate the development in the labour market and social conditions adequately? From training/education to occupation In the year 2000, the EU member states will conduct an ad hoc survey of the transition from training or education to labour market. Many difficult negotiations went into determining the actual questionnaire, and I believe that this reflected the problem that the LFS is perhaps not the best tool for measuring this phenomenon. Of course, it is possible to obtain usable results, but other methods may give stronger results. I am sorry that I have to disagree with Mr. Silva about the quality of register data versus interview surveys, as you will understand. I believe that we have to differentiate between countries. And why should the statistical institutes interview the population or companies if we have the information in registers? In Denmark and some other countries, we have for many years conducted surveys of the transition from training or education to occupation on the basis of register information, and I will briefly mention a few of the results. Let us compare the labour market situation for those between the ages of 15 and 29 who are not in training or education, with the somewhat older share of the population (those aged 30 - 59), see tables 1 (p. 84) and 2 (p. 85). Young people's employment Table 1 shows that the level of education is very decisive for subsequent employment. Per sons who have a higher education or vocational training are most frequently in employment. This applies to 9 out of 10. On the other hand, only 6 out of 10 are employed among young people whose only education is basic school. From my point of view this clearly shows that there is not much future in being unskilled. Especially not for women, as only half of these young women are in employment. Table 1 also shows that young people whose highest completed level of education is basic school or upper secondary school have a lower employment rate than 30 - 59 year olds. But if young people have received vocational training or higher education, they are in employ ment just as often as the older age group.

Conclusion All in all, we can conclude that the transition from training or education to labour market proceeds without any major problems for young people who have received vocational training or have a higher education. On the other hand, many of the young persons whose only education is basic school have considerable problems with the transition to the labour market. Such statistical figures should be produced every year so that politicians can monitor the development in the labour market and evaluate policies. 4 What is the effect of an active labour market policy? Active labour market policies and data sources Another question frequently asked by politicians is whether all the money spent on an active labour market policy has a positive effect. This question is difficult to answer on the basis of the present LFS. Panel surveys with a great random sample or register-based statistics are needed to be able to follow such small groups in the labour market. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 85 ",
        "Jan Plovsing The majority of Danish statistics on social and labour market conditions are based on register information which allows us to follow individual Danes over time. Job training Let me give you an example. We have chosen those persons who were in job training in pri vate enterprises, or in public authorities in November 1996. How was their situation one year later in November 1997 after they had completed their job training in the intervening year? The result is seen in table 3. Firstly, it should be noted that half have found an ordinary job after completed job training. Secondly, it should be noted that job training in private enter prises has the greatest positive effect, because this form of job training leads to ordinary em ployment much more frequently.

Retirement from the labour market and data sources That was my third question. In this area, too, we have good data possibilities in Denmark and some other countries, since our register-based statistics fully cover the entire population. By defining retirement as those persons over 50 years who belong to the workforce one year and who are outside the workforce the following year, we have calculated the average age of retirement in the period 1970 to 1997. Table 4 (see p. 87) shows that the age of retirement fell from 63 years to 59 years in the period from 1970 to 1995. In most recent years, from 1995 to 1997, the average age of retirement has again risen to 61 years. In the 1990s, the development has been the same for both sexes, as can be seen from figure 1. 86 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",

' ' , ' : *) In Denmark. Consequences Why has the retirement age risen since 1995? Part of the explanation is probably that unem\u00ad ployment in Denmark has fallen since 1994, another reason may be changes in the govern\u00ad ment financed retirement schemes making it more difficult to retire between the ages of 50 and 60. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 87 ",
        "Jan Plovsing Throughout Europe, the consequences are being discussed of the fact that the elderly will make up a growing share of the population in the coming years. What burdens does that put on those in active employment? Seen in this light, knowledge about the development in the retirement age is very important to our politicians. The ratio of recipients of transfer payments to employed persons An even more general and important question is how large a share of the population, all in all, receives transfer payments, i. e. pensions, unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, ma\u00ad ternity benefits, cash benefits, and so on. If we compare this with the number of employed persons, we have an indicator of the ratio of transfer recipients to employed persons. Using information in the Danish registers, we can describe the development in this ratio, see figure 2.

In 1994, an all\u00adtime peak was reached with 70 transfer recipients per 100 em\u00ad ployed persons. The ratio of transfer recipients has since fallen to 65 per 100 employed per\u00ad sons.

        "Do we elucidate the development in the labour market and social conditions adequately? 6 Which countries have the highest social expenditure? The social dimension This was the fourth question. Following the introduction of the social dimension in the Maastricht Treaty, harmonised statistics on social expenditure have gained increasing impor tance at the European level. Eurostat has for many years worked on harmonising the Member States' statistics on social expenditure. The result is the EU classification ESSPROS. Total social expenditure Table 5 shows for some selected countries their total expenditure in per cent of gross domes tic product (GDP). ESSPROS includes not only transfer payments but also expenditure for services in a wide sense, for example day-care facilities, residential nursing homes and hospi tals. Moreover, expenditure is included regardless of who finances it, i. e. not only public ex penditure, but also expenses financed by employers and the persons secured. Table 5: Social expenditure in selected European countries in per cent of GDP Country Denmark Sweden Germany Netherlands France United Kingdom 1975 26 ... 30 28 23 19 1985 28 ... 28 32 29 24 1995 34 36 30 32 31 28 1996 34 35 31 31 31 28 Among the countries shown, Sweden and Denmark have the highest expenditure, the United Kingdom the lowest if we are to believe table 5. Problems of comparison But we are not. Not fully, at least. The problem is that the figures are not totally comparable. It is true that the figures show expenditure in the various countries. But they do not take into account whether social benefits are tax-free or taxable, or whether special tax allowances are granted as part of social policy. For example, almost all social cash benefits in Denmark are taxable, while many of such benefits are tax-free in Germany. In my opinion, this means that, in reality, social expenditure is more or less the same in Germany and Denmark when seen in relation to GDP. Conse quently, present statistics do not give our politicians a completely accurate view of reality. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 89 ",
        "Jan Plovsing Eurostat is aware that statistics on social expenditure need to be adjusted for the effect of dif ferent tax systems. However, this is a very complex task which has been discussed for many years. I think that the problems ought to be solved now and that Eurostat ought to start this work as soon as possible. 7 Can we measure poverty and marginalisation in the labour market? Poverty This was the last question. The adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty has given the EU formal political authority to deal with poverty or social exclusion. This has, of course, resulted in a need for statistics elucidating poverty. Do we have such statistics? Both yes and no. 'Yes\", because Eurostat publishes statistics on poor people. Most recently, this occurred three weeks ago in a press release headed \"Social transfers other than pensions reduce EU poverty rate by one-third\". In the press release we are told, among other things, that 18 per cent of Germans and 11 per cent of Danes are poor. \"No\", because they are not genuine poverty statistics. In my opinion, we have not succeeded in developing and agreeing on a concept of poverty that can be measured in terms of sta tistics. Eurostat's statistics on poverty, which are solely defined by income, may be criticised for several reasons: - Firstly, the statistics are based on an interview survey, the European Community House hold Panel (ECHP), where the interviewees themselves state their income. Besides the uncertainty involved in this, really poor people hardly participate in interview surveys. - Secondly, the survey does not measure poverty - social exclusion - but solely economic inequality and low income. The fact that we may have varying income from one year to the next is not taken into account. To be poor must, in my opinion, at least mean that you have low income for several years in succession. - Thirdly, the survey does not allow for institutional differences between the EU Member States. When we compare the countries, it is important to know, for example, whether the population receives free medical services and free education among other things. In other words, we have much development work ahead of us before the statistical institutions are able to prepare reliable statistics on poverty. I do not believe that, as a result of the present lack of possibilities of producing good statis tics on poverty, we should produce statistics that are not fully reliable. The concept of poverty is politically very sensitive. For this reason it is important that statistical institutions refrain from using it until we are sure not to misinform the political debate and put our reliability at stake. 90 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Do we elucidate the development in the labour market and social conditions adequately? Marginalisation On the other hand, we statisticians may provide the politicians with information as to what persons are marginally attached to the labour market. By marginalised, I here understand per\u00ad sons who have been unemployed for an extremely large proportion of a given period, for example the last three years. Figure 3 shows an example of how we might delimit the marginal group. The figure shows that about 25 per cent of those who were unemployed at the end of the second quarter of 1998 had been unemployed (or activated) for at least 80 per cent of the time in the previous three years. They are indeed marginalised. In the Danish statistical register system, marginalised persons may subsequently be described in terms of sex, age, family situation, ethnical background, etc. They can be followed over time, making it possible to see if they find ordinary employment or if they become supported by the Government for an extended period of time, perhaps even permanently.

        "Jan Plovsing 8 Conclusion The questions In the introduction, I posed five questions which I am convinced the European politicians would like to have answered. In individual EU Member States, we are more or less able to answer the questions. But what is needed now is for us to answer the questions at the European level. I am thinking of both present and future members of the EU. Resources and answers For this reason, we have much development work ahead of us. There is clearly a need for more comparable European statistics. But this presupposes that sufficient resources are allocated for this task by our politicians. If this becomes reality, Eurostat may, in cooperation with the NSIs, develop European social and labour market statistics in a way that enables us, to a higher degree than previously, to provide the information called for by the politicians. 92 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics.

        "Discussion of the third Session \"Social and labour market policies\" The starting point of the discussion was the goal set in this context, namely to develop a European Social Reporting System on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty. The participants in the discussion agreed that setting up a Social Reporting System was a highly ambitious goal and, at the same time, a great challenge which the European Statistical System would have to face. The participants in the discussion stressed several times that, for reasons of political priori ties, the development of labour market and social statistics had so far been allocated only a subsidiary role compared to the monetary, currency and short-term economic statistics required for building European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Apart from that, eco nomic statistics have met with a considerably wider response by the media, too. And besides, the institutional preconditions in the two areas differ at the European level. There is, for in stance, no such coordinated body like the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB) for labour market and social statistics. Furthermore, the compe tencies of the individual Commission directorates are by far more subdivided in the area of labour market and social statistics than in the field of economic statistics. Against those argu ments it was objected that the Member States had themselves neglected social and labour market statistics for years. And, though not being as far-reaching as in the area of economic statistics, progress had been achieved in that field, too. For about two years, the coordination of labour market and social statistics has been pushed by the Commission. The intended de velopment of a European Social Reporting System and hence the creation of a reliable statis tical basis are indispensable for further developments in the important, though at the same time very complex and difficult area of labour market and social policies. There was a very controversial discussion on the extent to which comparability of the related statistical results could at all be achieved at the European level. Currently, the social systems of the EU Member States still differ widely, and a harmonisation of the systems cannot be expected soon. The statistics of the national statistical offices have so far been largely based on national structures. The majority of the participants in the discussion were of the opinion that complete harmoni sation including an input harmonisation in the area of labour and social statistics was not use ful because it could hardly be put into practice due to the differences in the national systems and the costs that would be incurred. However, an approach of output harmonisation aimed at achieving a certain degree of comparability of the national statistical results which would consider, on the one hand, the requirements of common European employment and social policies and, on the other, the different situations in the Member States was regarded as more realistic. Such an approach would at the same time be in line with the principles of subsid iarity. Developing and applying common standards, definitions and classifications such as the ILO\" definition in the field of unemployment statistics would however be indispensable. 1) International Labour Organisation Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 93 ",
        "Discussion of the third Session \"Social and labour market policies\" The issue of using information from administrative registers was discussed in particular in the context of unemployment statistics. The opinion was raised that using data of national regis ters for unemployment statistics was leading to a large variety of results whose informative value would be rather small in the European context since the definitions of registered unem ployment still differed considerably between the Member States. It was objected that the quality of the registers was not as bad as claimed. The registers are developed by profes sionals and, despite the different definitions used, useful results could definitely be derived from them for the purpose of a European employment policy as well. As regards political matters at the national level, they constitute an indispensable source of information anyway. Several participants in the discussion pointed out that the results of social statistics were often based on assessments. For this reason, it would be absolutely necessary - particularly when publishing statistical indicators used for comparing the social situation in the different EU Member States - to avoid misinterpretations by users by exactly explaining to them the un derlying definitions. 94 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",

I would like to thank the speakers of this afternoon, also on behalf of all the people present today, because we have looked at very different aspects of this highly difficult issue of labour market policies and the relevant statistics. So thanks very much to Mr. Wells, Mr. Silva and Mr. Plovsing. I am in an awful position now. I am supposed to present a summary of the highly different statements on this very complex issue. I am sure that I cannot be as neutral as I am supposed to be. Mr. Franchet already mentioned recently that I had a well done opinion on this matter. I do not want to deny that. Nevertheless I will try to give a summary which is as objective as possible. I start with a principle statement that Mr. Wells has put down not in stone but in a very important manner. He said that you have to use any data material available. I am sure that nobody will disagree with him there. Secondly he said we should be especially careful be cause each issue by force contains a value judgement particularly in the area of social statis tics. I will come back to this when I go on to talk about what Mr. Plovsing said. So when we statisticians are working in the area of social and labour market policies we always have to bear in mind this problem of value judgement. The third point Mr. Wells mentioned is the principle of subsidiarity. We talked a lot about subsidiarity this afternoon; what is important with regard to that principle is the details of application. In his important contribution, Mr. Silva explained the very important decisions and conclu sions of the Summits and the Council meetings of the past months. They give us concrete objectives for labour market policies. These Councils have recommended a kind of moni toring and a reporting system. I think that the official statistical offices would not do very well if they were not able to give an answer to the questions of labour market policies in the European Union (EU). Mr. Silva said quite rightly that this is a broad spectrum indeed and that Eurostat is involved in various ways in working together with the Member States to come up with such answers. This is a very ambitious objective, Mr. Silva said. When I move on to the main principles of Mr. Plovsing's speech, I would like to remind our selves - Mr. Wells said it as well -, that social questions often contain value judgements; however, we must be confident in the neutrality of official statistics. It is not the ministers or politicians that should provide definitions for statistics but it is up to us. We, the experts, should develop definitions. Mr. Plovsing encouraged us in his speech to use everything we have in the way of sources and resources but to use them in a differentiated manner depend ing on the premises involved. Now I am coming to the user aspect and I would like to address especially Eurostat: My first conclusion from this afternoon's speeches is that Eurostat has a special responsibility in the field of labour market and social statistics. It is a high level of responsibility because Eurostat intends to publish EU-wide statistical results. A good example in this connection is *) Johann Hahlen, President, Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Wiesbaden. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 95 ",
        "Johann Hahlen statistical information on the question of poverty. Of course Eurostat, when publishing its re sults, shows its definitions as well but, Mr. Franchet, we have to discuss jointly how, and based on what concept, we are going to describe poverty. It is not sufficient that people at Eurostat sit down together and reach a certain result. I think that all 15 Member States should have a say and work together to come to a joint concept. But I think Eurostat is moving in the right direction in this respect. Here is another element that one should always bear in mind: Mr. Franchet quite rightly said that in macroeconomics we had ten years for EU-wide harmonisation of statistics. We have used that time and have achieved good results. In the field of labour market and social statistics, the development has been different. While in economic and monetary policies we have a joint and solid basis laid down in the Treaties, that is the freedom of capital, labour and companies, the EC Treaty has accepted national specificities in the field of social and labour market policies. Certainly, some degree of convergence will gradually be achieved across the EU in these areas too. However, as long as there is not at least some degree of convergence among the Member States, we should be careful about statistical harmonisation. We have to monitor the development and take into account that our statistics are based on very different social and labour market systems. That is why I am sceptical when it comes to harmonised data. Therefore we should not be too ambitious. As long as the social systems within the EU are so different we will not be able to produce better statistics. I would like to finish by endorsing what Mr. Wells said: We need an honest description of the existing social conditions in the 15 Member States. When we have reached that, we will have made a great deal of progress! I think the discussion this afternoon has brought a lot of clarity into the debate; it has been a very honest and open debate. Thanks very much to everyone. 96 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Yves Franchet*) Economic and monetary policies Introductory remarks Ladies and Gentlemen, As we approach the end of the conference, we come to the last session which is on economic and monetary policy. We have three distinguished speakers: State Secretary Koch-Weser with whom I had the privilege of working for many years in development banking, Professor Walter from the Deutsche Bank and Paul Champsaur, Director General of the French Statis tical Institute (INSEE). As we discussed yesterday, the support of the economic and monetary policy is where we have achieved most during the last decade. Macroeconomic statistics in the European Union (EU) have an unprecedented level of comparability thanks, in particular, to the work achieved in national accounts with the European System of Accounts (ESA 95): prices, har monised index of consumer prices (HICP), production indices, consumer surveys, and public debt and deficit. We have been able to deliver convergence criteria statistics which were the undisputed basis for making the essential decision: the creation of the euro with eleven par ticipants. And finally, the preparation of candidate countries for future membership is well on its way. One might be forgiven then for thinking the job must be nearly completed in this area and I should be a happy and quiet man, but this is not exactly the case. The creation of the euro has brought EU macroeconomic statistics into a completely different game. Prior to the euro, a delay of 15 days in the publication of an EU statistic may not have mattered much. Now, a three minute delay in the publication of one euro indicator creates a crisis! We have to pro duce enough good and timely short-term statistics to monitor economic and monetary policy in the euro zone, and we have still a substantial effort to make in that respect. I will now give the floor to State Secretary Koch-Weser. *) Yves Franchet, Director General, Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), Luxembourg.

        "Caio Koch-Weser*) Economic and monetary policy in Europe Johann Wolfgang von Goethe claimed that increasing knowledge was causing increasing doubts. Sometimes, this applies to statistical information as well, which has repeatedly un masked apparently sound views as prejudices. Statistics confront economic policymakers with the real consequences of the policies pursued. As we mark the 250th anniversary of Goethe's birth this year, I dare to quote this poet a second time who said that he was sure that figures showed whether the world was governed well or badly. However, statistics do not only serve as a mirror which is held up to economic policymakers. They also constitute one of the major input factors to policy which may not be successful if it is not based on a correct and current image of reality. We as politicians - and I explicitly include the central bankers here - have to rely on statistics, too. Statistics are a fundamental basis for planning and decision-making processes regarding European policies, too. In this context, I would like to remind you of the following exam ples: - The convergence data of the Member States based on official statistics have served as a yardstick for accession to the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). - A statistical basis which comprises data that are comparable throughout the EU is re quired to implement the Stability and Growth Pact. - A comprehensive development of the macroeconomic dialogue in the context of the European Employment Pact, which was launched at the European Council meeting in Cologne, is possible on the basis of detailed statistical data only. - The EU budget's own resources are linked to the gross national income, as it is called based on the new terminology. Adding more examples to the above list would pose no problems at all -just think of the areas of agricultural, trade and regional policies within the European Union. You would al most get the impression that statistics have politicians well in hand as, in political terms, things do nearly not go without statistics. However, the relations between policy and statistics are of a mutual nature which means that politicians and statisticians depend on each other. Policy needs statistics and statistics require policy. I admit that political bodies make most challenging demands on statistics. They require sta tistics to be of best-possible quality, objective, up-to-date and reliable. Statistics are to show continuity over time and facilitate international comparability. And they are expected to be issued by specified deadlines. If in doubt, however, quality has priority over timeliness be cause policy will end up on the scrapheap if an image produced by statistics is not in line with reality. Misplanning and wrong decisions would be the consequence of it. However, the sta tistical information requirements of political bodies must be realistic, meaning that feasibility must take priority over desires. *) Caio Koch-Weser, Federal Ministry of Finance, Berlin, Germany. 98 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Economie and monetary policy in Europe What do statisticians expect from politicians? Above all, certainly due support for their work, which of course and above all includes protection against political influence. Statistical offices must be sure of the opportunity to publish their results in an \"uncensored\" form. And it is important to them that the political bodies specify in a clear manner which data require ments they regard as most important and which as secondary. Political bodies have to set clear priorities in this respect. When Monetary Union was launched, statistics were faced with new requirements, which the Council has taken account of in the Multiannual Community Statistical Programme. For the period 1998 to 2000, those statistics which are required for the purposes of the EMU, for competition, growth and employment policies, and for enlargement have been classified as of highest importance. The programmes for the individual years additionally specify other statis tics as of high priority. Thus, for instance, the annual programme for the year 2000 has set new priorities in areas of consumer protection, public health, and migration. In our view, however, those additional requirements by different political branches constitute a problem. They are not in line with the 1998 Council Decision. And, allow me to add the following: The national statistical offices are not in a position to fulfil those additional information requirements since they have been fully occupied with the most urgent work on the data base required for the purposes of EMU and with the other priorities mentioned earlier. In the past few years, a considerable increase in productivity has been achieved by applying sophisticated technologies and means of communication in statistics. Nonetheless, the fol lowing continues to apply: If political institutions commission statistical bodies with new tasks, they will at the same time have to provide the financial means required to accomplish those tasks. In particular the founders of new businesses and smaller and medium-sized enterprises often complain about the bureaucratic burden caused by statistical surveys. For this reason, we have made an effort to keep as low as possible the costs incurred by businesses and industry with reference to surveys. The statistical offices, too, have tried to reduce the burden imposed on the business community to a minimum. However, the availability of reliable statistics should be in the interest of the business com munity too, since an absence of adequate statistics would impair the reliability of the basis for both political decisions and investment planning. The German Federal Government supports the justified matters of concern of statistics. It is only on the basis of sound statistics that a rational and transparent economic and monetary policy can be implemented in Europe. What is that policy like at the moment? The prospects of the world economy have gradu ally become brighter after the crises in 1997 and 1998. The continuing strong growth of the US economy has decisively contributed to the improving situation. The Asian countries are facing a strong recovery now. Presumably, the world economy will grow nearly three per cent this year, and growth is expected to gain further momentum in the next year. Economic development within the European Union has largely met the expectations we had in spring this year. After the economic slowdown in winter 1998/99, which was attributable Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 99 ",
        "Caio Koch-Weser to the foreign trade situation, the upswing is clearly gaining momentum at the moment. This year the European Union will experience a growth of approximately two per cent. However, the growth rate might come close to three per cent in the next year. Important bases for a sustainable non-inflationary growth process have been established, though a great effort is still required to make real progress in the struggle against unemploy ment. And, as far as the consolidation of public finance is concerned, Germany and many other Member States of the European Union are required to make further progress, too. The German DM 30 billion austerity package for the year 2000 must be judged against the back ground of a federal debt of about DM 1.5 trillion. Pursuing a policy which promotes growth and employment is undoubtedly the top priority in Europe. Reliable statistical data that are available at an early time and comparable for all Member States are important to us in taking decisions in the European bodies about the policies to be pursued in our countries. At the beginning of 1999, the Euro-11-group discussed the econom ic situation, prospects and desirable policy mix. Up-to-date economic data are indispensable for adequate decision-making. This applies in particular to the European Central Bank (ECB) as one of the major users of the data to be newly produced. Due to the introduction of the euro, the conditions for employment policy in Europe have changed. The introduction of the euro as such does not yet solve the problem of unemploy ment in Europe. However, its introduction has increased the demand for coordination of economic policies and made employment policy a common goal of all Member States. The European Employment Pact is the beginning of cooperation in the area of employment policy designed for the long term. Named after the venues of the European Council meetings where the essential decisions were taken, its three pillars are the Cologne, the Luxembourg and the Cardiff processes which I do not intend to specify in detail here. Those three pillars of the European Employment Pact are meant to supplement and reinforce each other, which requires an intensified coordination of economic policies. The central in strument for that coordination is the Broad guidelines of economic policy. There, the strate gic lines are drawn for our common policy aimed at sustainable non-inflationary growth and increased employment. And the crucial elements of a growth and stability oriented macroeco nomic policy are brought in line with the necessary structural reforms. The Cologne, Luxem bourg and Cardiff processes have to be based on the main principles, which, to the extent possible, should provide concrete specifications and consider the specific conditions in the individual countries to an even larger extent in the future. In a uniform currency zone, things which might take a wrong course at the Community level may not be offset by national policies. The introduction of the euro requires intensified coor dination in order to - account for stronger spill-over effects - avoid a free-rider behaviour - ensure a fair competition of locations. 100 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Econom\u00ece and monetary policy in Europe All measures have to take into consideration Community-related and national requirements. Subject to the principle of subsidiarity, this requires the preparedness of all to offer good advice and follow such advice. National responsibilities, the independence of the ECB and free collective bargaining, however, remain unaffected. Coordination of economic policies would come against limits if existing responsibilities became blurred and coordination were made ineffective via the market. Coordination of economic policies must in particular not lead to shifting the conse quences of one's own mistakes and failings onto others or replacing national measures by actions at the Community level. The role of competition between the countries must instead gain in importance. Pressure for adaptation within the Community - the so-called peer pressure - as well as best-practice comparisons and benchmarking may strengthen the dynamic forces in the economic area and contribute considerably to stability orientation in the euro zone. However, competition between countries will come against limits if unfair practices violate the Community interests. Thus, for instance, avoiding a harmful \"tax cut race\" is an important objective of coordina tion. Partly, coordination of economic policies within the European Union today still suffers from ponderous procedures and a lack of transparency. Improvements are intended to be made in this area. We have in mind to reduce overlapping which partly exists between differ ent processes. In the context of the Cologne process, for instance, a fruitful dialogue between the parties to collective wage agreements and the organs of financial and monetary policies should contrib ute to preventing overall economic conflicts which, in the past, have time and again been the cause of substantial recessions. The overall economic policy approach of the Cologne process will be the more effective the better labour supply and labour demand are matched and the more efficient the commodity, service and capital markets are. Hence, growth and stability oriented macroeconomic policy will have to be accompanied by efficient and comprehensive structural reforms if it is in tended to be highly successful in the struggle against unemployment. In this context, the point at the European level is in particular to compare experience with given reform approaches and, on that basis, to draw adequate conclusions for a country's own economic policy. Structural reforms are a decisive prerequisite for reducing the high structural unemploy ment in Europe. They increase the businesses' competitiveness and capacity for innovation and hence contribute to meeting the challenges of globalisation and technological change. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to come back to the relationship between policy and sta tistics. The introduction of the euro has led to a demand for statistics which cover the whole euro area. Reliable statistics are a necessary basis for effective coordination of economic policies. Eurostat and the national statistical offices have meanwhile presented consistent statistical data for various areas, e. g. price trends, gross domestic product, and unemploy ment. However, the statistical coverage of wages and labour costs is still expected to be harmonised. The statistics available in this area differ from country to country. Therefore, the task to be accomplished is to ensure comparability in the future. It is especially in the context of the macroeconomic dialogue that those data are urgently required. The Economic and Fi nancial Committee of the EU will closely observe the progress made in this area. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 101 ",
        "Caio Koch-Weser The financial crises of the past few years have also highlighted the need for precise, detailed and up-to-date data especially at the international level. Greater transparency in all relevant fields - in economic, monetary and financial policies, and at the business level - may con tribute a lot to prevent crises of that kind. The main point is to enable market operators to make more accurate risk assessments - especially as far as lending to newly industrialising countries is concerned - by providing them with an enhanced flow of information and data. In their report on the consolidation of the international finance architecture submitted to the economic summit in Cologne, the finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading indus trial nations (G 7) therefore underlined the great importance of increasing transparency and promoting tried and tested practices. In fact, it may be stated today that great progress has been made in adapting standards and codes of conduct. Allow me to mention the following aspects in this context. - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to expand the publication duties in the framework of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), including in creased requirements regarding data on foreign reserve assets and external debt. In coop eration with the G 10 central banks, a common reporting scheme was agreed. By now, 47 countries have joined the standard, including Germany. - On the occasion of the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, which took place a few weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund submitted a Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. It is particularly aimed at enhancing the credibility of the central banks and the authorities supervising the financial markets by disclosing relevant information and data. Last year, the International Monetary Fund adopted a Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Policy. - The Basel Committee has submitted a new scheme for assessing the adherence to the basic principles of efficient bank supervision, which is expected to be adopted soon. In view of the progress achieved, there was wide agreement at this year's annual meeting in Washington that the focus of work should now be shifted to implementing and supervising the adherence to the codes and standards. The International Monetary Fund is to take a lead ing role in this process. To ensure that the reform efforts aimed at strengthening the international finance architecture will make good progress, the industrialised countries must set a good example. This will set new challenges to German and European statistics in respect to timeliness and reliability. I know that the fulfilment of the above tasks is in good hands at the Federal Statistical Office and Eurostat. 102 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Norbert Walter*) Challenges and problems Introduction Policies and statistics depend on each other. Policy-making requires good statistics, and good statistics depend upon the understanding and the provision of appropriate funds by policy makers. Official statistics, however, do not only serve politics, but are part of the everyday tools of a multitude of users in business, science and society. They may provide an objective basis for collective wage negotiations, a data source for empirical economic and social re search or an independent, neutral source of social and economic information for the general public. International cooperation in the field of statistics dates back as far as to the 19th century (foundation of the International Statistical Institute in 1885) and has been advanced especial ly by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations (UN). Through the treaties establishing the European Community, legal acts relating to statistics have become an integral part of statistical legislation in the individual Member States. Statistical cooperation, however, is aimed not only at meeting the political require ments of Community institutions, but also at enabling the general public to draw international comparisons and at supplying reliable and comparable data bases to institutions and enter prises operating increasingly at the international level. Challenges and problems The introduction of the Single Market and the implementation of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) essentially require that a common European Statistical System be set up that will provide data of comparable standards of reliability, accuracy, relevance and timeliness to all member countries and all groups of users in the political, academic and business com munities as well as to society in general. In this context, it is crucial that the European Sta tistical System should not only be geared to the needs of European institutions. The EMU has pushed up all the users' need for reliable supranational statistics. Now that the main interest has been centred on Euroland, the statistical deficiencies have come to the fore. Yet, it should be pointed out that, considering the magnitude of the task on hand, remarkable progress has already been made. The conversion of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) calculations according to a common European concept is a good example. The first GDP figures based on the European System of Accounts (ESA 95) have been available since summer 1999. Furthermore, the harmonisation of the collection of consumer price data is proceeding well, which, in view of the data's key significance, is particularly satisfactory. Another asset is that the European Central Bank (ECB) already has a considerable number of instruments available for analysing the monetary flows between the 11 EU countries. Since summer 1998, the national central banks have been *) Prof. Dr. Norbert Walter, Deutsche Bank Research AG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

        "Norbert Walter providing data for the MFI sector (MFI = Monetary Financial Institutions) on a harmonised basis. The ECB published its first consolidated MFI balance sheets and monetary aggregates in December 1998. On the other hand, a great deal of work still needs to be done, especially if the objective is to attain the statistical standards of the USA. The deficiencies range from macroeconomic ag gregates such as the GDP and the income, generation and distribution accounts via labour market data all the way to banking statistics such as statistics on borrowers. Three problems can be identified in general: I) a lack of statistics (information crisis), 2) a lack of coordina tion as regards contents and 3) a lack of coordination of the timing of statistical surveys in Europe. Information crisis The information crisis affects, among others, national accounts. To date, income, generation and mainly distribution of income accounts do not exist for Euroland. Thus, it is still impos sible to gain an overview of the levels of labour income and profits across Euroland, or of disposable incomes, savings and savings ratios. Statistical information has so far only been available for the private, non-financial sector which comprises, apart from households, the non-financial corporations and non-profit institutions. But households need to be covered separately so that informative financial accounts can be set up to show whether private indi viduals in Euroland accumulate their monetary wealth, for instance, mainly at private banks and insurance funds or in the public sector (e. g. social insurance funds). In addition, it would be very interesting to have a detailed disaggregation of saving deposits in Euroland in the form of fixed-interest securities and shares. From an international bank's point of view, such data are of utmost importance. In general, there is still a substantial need for information in the field of banking statistics. Statistics on borrowers, as the Deutsche Bundesbank has been compiling them for years, are not available for Euroland as yet. This means that we still do not know whether the notable credit expansion of the private sector which has been observed in Euroland for some months now should be attributed primarily to households or enterprises. As far as short-term business data are concerned, an extension of the statistics on orders received is highly desirable. Apart from manufacturing, the construction industry is of par ticular interest. The orders should be classified by origin (Euroland, non-Euroland). A great deal of information is also required on the services sector. Even though this sector has become a motor of growth and employment in Germany, too, there is hardly any informa tion available on major branches of services (such as data processing and telecommuni cations). The Statistical Advisory Council of the German Government identified this defi ciency in its report of June this year. The labour market, too, is being affected by the information crisis. Employment in Euroland has so far only been recorded as an index. Detailed information on the creation and elimi nation of jobs is not available. Yet, such data are absolutely necessary to ensure sound labour market and structural policies (e. g. where decisions on the use of Structural Funds have to be taken). A reform of the employment and earnings statistics is also necessary because the 104 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Challenges and problems working world is changing. New types of employment, such as teleworking and flexible working time models, are not sufficiently reflected by either national or common European statistics. Finally, let me point out the significance of reliable demographic data. Europe is suffering from unfavourable demographic trends which are not only affecting the old-age security sys tems, but also have a general economic impact. Hence, regular population censuses as in the United States are an absolute necessity for Europe as well. Lack of harmonisation and time coordination of European statistics As far as the subject-matter coordination of statistics in Euroland is concerned, there is an enormous need for action, too. Several countries are still using disparate definitions and cal culation bases for some statistics. Let me cite an example: although the ESA 95 provides common rules, individual countries are still basing their statistics on different concepts of capital formation. This is one of the reasons why a detailed disaggregation of gross fixed cap ital formation cannot be set up yet in Euroland. As regards information on the level of prices, there are very few indicators on labour costs which represent the most important cost factor, but are calculated on the basis of purely national and incompletely harmonised indicators. As for another important cost component, namely the development of import prices, no indicator is available at all. The further development of European official statistics must be geared to the principle \"harmonisation before national continuity\". What needs to be ensured, however, is that high quality national time series will not be interrupted until a comparable standard has been met at European level. It is imperative that the harmonisation of European statistics should not proceed along the lines of just combining - not even in parts - the contents and charac teristics of all national statistics. For statistical practice, this means that the statistical figures to be recorded at European level must be coordinated with each other, the underlying meth ods must be harmonised and uniform classifications need to be set up. Another aspect, though one of lesser importance, is the time coordination of the production and dissemination of statistics. Some countries are still lagging behind with the reorganisation of their statistics on the common basis (ESA 95). This concerns, among others, such impor tant aggregates as the European GDP statistics. At present, only six EMU countries publish quarterly national accounts. This is the reason why a reliable quarterly rate of growth of the Euroland GDP is not available as yet. The short-term business indicators are also in need of better coordination because many national indicators are still based on differing scopes of coverage and time schedules. Consequently, the aggregated data are of lower quality than the national indicators themselves. For that reason, projections and expansions have to be used time and again, most of which require considerable revision later on. Economic efficiency of statistics Some policy-makers consider the system of official statistics as too expensive, inefficient and cumbersome. What is often left out of account is that official statistics have for the past 20 years already undergone substantial \"adjustments and rationalisation\". Good policies need reliable statistics. Economic considerations, of course, should not be disregarded; the benefits Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 105 ",
        "Norbert Walter statistics provide must be reasonably proportionate to their costs. Any cost-benefit analysis, however, should take into account not only direct costs, but also the costs that would arise if some of the statistics were abandoned (opportunity costs). The increasing engagement of private providers in data acquisition, processing and dissem ination, as for instance by Reuters, should be judged favourably. Here again, the free-market principle applies that the private sector should supply all that it is able to. To keep costs as low as possible, sample statistics could be used in some areas. Hence, the Federal Govern ment's Statistical Advisory Committee has suggested that annual services statistics be intro duced on the basis of sample surveys. That approach would also help to reduce the burden on respondents. Challenges to common European statistics From the viewpoint of the users of official statistics, high data quality is an indispensable criterion. The data should be relevant, up-to-date, complete, correct, reliable and as easy to use as possible. In part, high data quality is an inherent feature of the systematic structure of statistics. The integration of individual statistics into an overall concept permits to broadly harmonise definitions and delimitations and to use uniform classifications. A sufficiently reli able microcensus, for example, presupposes that population censuses are taken at dependable intervals (in order to obtain data on the total population). A multitude of surveys are indis pensable building blocks of national accounts. The basket of commodities for the consumer price index is being compiled and updated on the basis of the Sample Survey of Income and Expenditure. As the data collected can be used for a variety of statistical purposes and the statistical results can be combined, it is possible to avoid duplication, reduce the burden on respondents and save costs. This systematic approach must not be weakened by European ef forts at harmonisation. Considerations have partly been made to measure the need for statistics only against the current requirements of general government. This approach entirely disregards the infrastruc- tural character of official statistics in a pluralistic society. The statistical requirements of gen eral government must not be the sole yardstick in a democratic political system. General government must not decide on the statistical requirements of other users without sufficient feedback. Likewise, it would be wrong to define the demand for statistics in terms of the total demand for specific individual statistics, thereby leaving out of account that the information gained from these individual statistics is used in processing other statistics and that only an overall statistical picture of the society and economy can eventually provide appropriate tools for political action. The pulse of business life and thus of economic policy-making has risen notably over time. As a result, the timeliness of data has become a more decisive quality indicator of official statistics than ever before. The delays and qualitative shortcomings of the major business indicators resulting mainly from the EU-stipulated revision of the economic activity classifi cation in 1995 made users rather painfully aware of that. A more frequent use of sampling methods, wherever pertinent, may enhance data timeliness in this area as well. 106 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Challenges and problems It seems logical that the statistical reorganisation on common European bases should be used to further develop the statistical offices into statistical service centres. Mention should be made, for instance, of the use of modern distribution channels (online services/Internet, CD- ROM, etc.), provision of methodological-statistical advice to interested users, user access to data bases and evaluation systems, and a Europe-wide network of data supply. Conclusion All in all, the statistics of a country or union of nations can only be as good as demanded and financed by the policy-makers and the business and academic communities. A lot of action is still required in Europe. Considerable risks go along with a lack of coordination and com parability of official statistics in Euroland. Insufficient quality of common European statistics is an impediment to political and economic integration in Europe. Hence, reliable statistics will enhance market transparency and, at the same time, increase the efficiency and prospects of success of the Single European Market. Without figures and data that are comparable across the nations it will not be possible to guarantee an efficient and equitable distribution of funds within the Union, which, in turn, may easily lead to abuse and dissatisfaction. Reliable statistics will build up confidence in European politics and institutions. Common policies re quire common statistics as a basis for decision. The standard of statistical reporting in the USA - which in itself is partly open to improve ment - could initially serve as the yardstick against which to measure statistical achievements in the European Union. In order to meet this standard, demands will have to be made on the ECB, Eurostat, the EU-Commission, and also on national governments and the business com munity. The academic community is required to provide unanimous support. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 107 ",
        "Paul Champsaur*) Statistical needs for macroeconomic policies in the euro zone Macroeconomic data on the Monetary Union as a whole are of paramount importance both for the assessment of the economic outlook and the management of economic policy in each Member State. I have experienced that in many instances. For example, when the French Minister of Econo my and Finance asks the Committee of the Directors of the Ministry to make an assessment of the economic prospects, we begin with a detailed review of the latest trends of the Euro pean Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) as a whole before turning to the French econo my. We proceed in the same way when we release the quarterly short-term forecasts of INSEE for the French economy. If we turn from assessment to management, we can see that aggregated data on the euro zone and the European Union (EU) are also essential, both to European institutions and to each country because of the close links between the national economies. Since I assume that we are all convinced of the need for aggregate macroeconomic informa tion on the euro zone, I will concentrate on operational issues where statistical production problems are at stake. I can list three: - What kind of statistics do we require at the European level for the needs of macroeco nomic policy? - How do we build these Euro-statistics? - Finally, in the light of the current situation, I will advocate that further work is needed. 1 What kind of Euro-statistics do we require for the needs of macroeconomic policy? In each Member State, economists specialised in forecasting identified the relevant national short-term indicators a long time ago: business surveys data, statistics on wage inflation, or quarterly national accounts. Similar indicators should be available at the EU and EMU levels. These aggregated indicators must meet the same basic requirements that are usually met by the nationally available indicators. I can list three: - Firstly, they must be available over a long period of time, at least the length of a business cycle, and stable over time. The availability of long time series is essential for short-term analysis: indicators must have a \"history\". In other words, movements in the indicators are relevant only if they can be interpreted by reference to similar trends in the past. - Secondly, they must be interpretable as cyclical indicators and be able to indicate or announce up- or downswings in the business cycle, as well as inflationary pressures. Indeed, the predictive ability of an indicator cannot be assessed a priori. It has to be em- *) Paul Champsaur, Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (INSEE), Paris, France. 108 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Statistical needs for macroeconomic policies in the euro zone pirically tested by a specific study. At a national level, those studies already exist. The indicators aggregated at the EU or EMU scale should satisfy the same conditions of eco nomic interpretation, which are to be assessed a posteriori by specific studies. - Thirdly, indicators must be produced in the shortest possible delay compatible with statis tical quality. Aggregated indicators also require two additional specific conditions. Firstly, when fully harmonised statistics are not, or not yet, available, aggregation requires that they be com parable enough, not in terms of statistical inputs but with respect to economic or cyclical interpretation. Secondly, the short-term diagnosis obtained at the European level has to be consistent with the diagnosis for national economies. As a consequence, when several in dicators of the same economic variable are available for a specific country, one should choose the one which is most widely used nationally. More generally, we can see that aggregated statistics have to meet both economic and statis tical requirements. In many cases these requirements are mutually incompatible, and aggrega tion requires a trade-off. For example, it might be necessary to aggregate national indicators differing in coverage or in statistical content, notably wages indices, as a means to insure the coherence between national and European diagnoses. This should be preferred to the aggre gation of harmonised indicators, if the relevant series are too short. In other instances, it may be necessary to have only a partial geographical coverage, either because the statistics of some countries are not sufficiently comparable, or because they are released too late, even if they are fully harmonised. Harmonisation should remain a top priority for the European Statistical System, but its achievement will be a long process. In the meantime, we must adopt a pragmatic approach leading to the aggregation of existing national statistics provided they are comparable enough, from a user's point of view. 2 How do we build these Euro-statistics? In the areas where fully harmonised statistics are not yet available, the choice of aggregated indicators should not be determined by purely technical criteria but should be based on their relevance for short-term economic analysis. Even in the case of harmonised statistics, this criterion should be ranked first. I will take six examples of practical issues statisticians have to face regarding aggregation methods and the final choice of aggregated indicators. 2.1 My first example relates to the most basic statistical need: the measure ment of output growth in the EU or EMU on a quarterly basis Since only six countries of the EMU publish quarterly national accounts, it is impossible to compute a 'pure' statistic of the Gross. Domestic Product (GDP) growth for the EMU. Pub lishing, as such, the aggregate of the six countries' GDP is natural. But an estimate of the EMU total based only on these six countries is riskier. Indeed, such an estimate could be biased or later revised to a great extent, if the other five countries hold different positions in the business cycle. As far as I know, the method currently used by Eurostat includes an esti mate of the missing countries on the basis of annual data for these countries. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 109 ",
        "Paul Champsaur This leads me to underline the issue of the understanding and the interpretation of an estimate by the users. This also leads me to emphasise the need for a perfect transparency of the estimation methods and of the revisions. I will return to that later. 2.2 The example of short-term business surveys Business surveys have been conducted since 1962 in the Member States. They have a wide coverage and provide information on firms' expectations. The harmonized short-term indica tors derived from these surveys are one of the strong points of European statistics insofar as they help to predict industrial production growth. However, calibrations of the industrial pro duction in some countries of the EMU that have been done at INSEE, show that the ability of the various indicators compiled by the business surveys to forecast the industrial production index differs from one country to the other. This does not mean that some national business surveys are better than others. What I want to stress here is that these indicators do not have the same predictive content, within each Member State and above all between countries. As a consequence, a simple arithmetic mean of the indicators provided by the survey is clearly sub-optimal. While the indicators derived from business surveys are a decisive element of the short-term diagnosis and forecast, they should be used rationally. By that, I mean that priority should be given to their interpretative role in order to define and compute synthetic indica tors. 2.3 The third example is one of a trade-off between the need for a broad geographical coverage and the forecasting quality of the aggregate In this regard, a detailed study on the biggest European countries shows that retail sales are, to a greater or lesser extent, a good indicator of household consumption. In one of those countries, however, retail sales are a poor indicator of household consumption. It is to be feared that, because of the poor forecasting quality of the indicator in one large country, the European total will also be of poor quality. In that case, a partial geographical aggregate should be preferred, the European indicator being computed on a subset of countries where it is robust. The loss in coverage will be offset by a greater forecasting quality 2.4 Fourthly, I would like to stress that bilateral co-operation helps to select national statistics suitable for aggregation INSEE and the Federal Statistical Office have conducted a joint study on structural wages statistics in France and Germany and have recently analysed the comparability of various short-term wages indicators in both countries. One important lesson that we can draw from this very fruitful co-operation is that even if available statistics are currently far from being harmonised, it is possible to find statistics of comparable use and suitable for aggregation, with respect to short-term analysis. This experience should be pursued and enlarged to more and more countries. 110 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Statistical needs for macroeconomic policies in the euro zone 2.5 The fifth example gives me the opportunity to emphasise the need for compiling new or improved statistics The need to compile reliable and consistent international transactions data both at the nation al and European levels is not questioned. In this regard, external trade statistics, trade balance and balance of payments for Member States are presently a cause of concern. The trade balance of the European Union as a whole is computed in a reliable way, from trade statistics with third-party countries. However, the abolition of custom barriers in 1993 deteriorated the knowledge of intra-community trade and led to inconsistent statistics. The total of sales ex ceeds the total of purchases by 5%, a gap that represents 0.8% of the GDP of the Monetary Union. Clearly, the Union's trade balance surplus is not the sum of members' trade balance surpluses, since this sum is overestimated by an amount equal to the intra-community gap. But the measurement of EU or EMU net exports in national accounts, as the sum of nation al foreign trade statistics, is still biased. Furthermore, the European GDP is also overesti mated and it is difficult to know which component of GDP is affected by this error. This situation creates an inconsistency at the European level between the Balance of Pay ments (BoP) approach and the national account approach. In order to improve the consis tency of these approaches, the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics suggested to reduce the asymmetries in a phased way: first to address this issue at the European level to reconcile national accounts and BoP statistics. Then to see whether the recommended changes can be implemented at Member State level. This cannot be done without a prior assessment of the respective needs of different kinds of users, at the European and national levels. 2.6 I will end this review with a more general issue, the one of estimation of missing data versus partial aggregates Many EMU or EU indicators are now calculated by Eurostat as soon as the national available data represent 60% of the zone. In some other cases the total is estimated on a fixed sample of countries. According to Eurostat methodology, the data for the missing countries are esti mated (with automatic time series procedures), either because the required statistics are not available or are released too late. For want of a precise description, it is to be feared that most users may have trouble in interpreting the data. Moreover, estimated data are potentially subject to important later revisions. These methods are clearly less reliable than aggregation methods based on national published data of an explicit subset of countries, the latter being determined on a case-by-case basis. If estimation methods were nevertheless needed for missing national data, they should be agreed upon by the Member States concerned. 3 Further work is needed The main requirements that pan-European indicators have to meet are those of the users. They can be summarised as follows: Firstly, there is a general demand for timeliness, but not at the cost of a loss of reliability. Secondly, transparency and consistency are required, in order that the data be easily interpretable in the economic analysis and that national and Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 111 ",
        "Paul Champsaur European analyses be consistent. Respecting these conditions should help the main users of European data to agree on the European aggregates and would improve the credibility of European statistics. Considerable progress has been made by Eurostat in supplying the public and policy-makers with short-term indicators and aggregated pan-European data. However, emphasis has so far been laid more on formal criteria than on interpretation issues. A great deal of work remains to be done in the latter field to make the indicators widely recognised. As an example, I could refer to the September issue of the quarterly review of the Financial Times on the euro-zone economy. It presents euro-zone economic forecasts from several leading economic institu tions and banks, dating from March 1999 to July 1999. The tables show discrepancies in the order of one to one and a half percentage point in the measurement of some major economic variables, even for the year 1997. Of course, we cannot exclude that economists might be using different concepts or data that could have been later revised. However, we all know that many economists build their own aggregated data at the EMU or EU level. We actually do it at INSEE, when we feel that published data are not the most relevant for short-term forecasts. This situation is not satisfactory for the European Statistical System. It may come from a lack of dialogue between the main users and the statisticians. It may also come from a lack of transparency in aggregating rules or estimation methods regarding short-term indicators that, in turn, may cast doubt even on relatively old data. I will thus strongly advocate a much closer co-operation between Directorate General II (DG II), the European Central Bank (ECB) and Eurostat. The scope of this co-operation should not be limited to the definition of required macroeconomic variables or timeliness issues. It should also include the precise aggregation methods Eurostat should use. It stands to reason that national economists special ised in short-term forecasting should be consulted by Eurostat in order to identify the most relevant information in their country and to provide advice on the way it can be used. The present situation suggests that we need further work on the relevant aggregation methods of national indicators and the precise assessment of their statistical quality. This work has to be done by the European Statistical System, but in strong interaction with the users. In all cases, users' needs have to be taken into account, before compiling new statistics. Aggrega tion methods also have to be transparent to all users and must be discussed and assessed more widely before they are put into practice. The possibility of estimating missing data to improve freshness has also to be reconsidered in terms of reliability. Let me just add that INSEE will do its best in the joint effort of the European Statistical System to meet these important challenges. 112 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Discussion of the fourth Session \"Economic and monetary policies\" In the field of statistics for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the activities of the bodies of European statistics have thus far been most impressive and at the same time most evident to the general public. Nevertheless, the requirements and demands of users are rising, especially those of monetary policy-makers and market agents. The increasing orientation towards statistical information on the euro zone, however, also reveals a certain tension between the data supply that is geared to regional and national conditions and the need for supranational statistical information. 1 National versus European orientation of statistics Several participants referred to possible conflicts arising from the fact that the statistical requirements articulated at the national level do not necessarily harmonise with those of the euro zone and the Union. That may have an impact on publication practices where, for in stance, indicators tailored to national problems are difficult to compare at the international level but become available far earlier than the ones that have been harmonised across the European Union (EU). In such a case, any Member State's statistical office would be ill ad vised to withhold speedily available but only nationally oriented data material. However, special efforts then need to be made to prevent confusion among the users by making the aims and objects of harmonised and specific national concepts perfectly clear. Emphasis was laid on the fact that harmonisation is indispensable whenever there exist EU- related political requirements. This applies in particular to monetary policy but also to agri cultural, regional and employment policies. It stands to reason that the national statistical agencies will continue to be at liberty to supply complementary information that is geared to special national requirements. Furthermore, some participants expressed concern that the orientation towards European per spectives may fail to take into account that many smaller enterprises are less interested in global indicators than in statistics illustrating their national surroundings. Other participants objected that nowadays even small- and medium-sized enterprises have to adapt to transna tional and international market developments and hence require corresponding information. Incidentally, the statistical offices would of course be well advised to keep an eye on the whole spectrum of their customers. 2 Challenges arising from globalisation, Single Market and new developments In this context, two aspects were in the centre of interest: On the one hand, the necessity that statistics keep abreast of the world-wide economic changes. Reference was made to the tremendous upheavals caused by the information and telecom munications areas. Special attention should be paid to adjusting nomenclatures which are a central element of the infrastructure of economic statistics. The participants also agreed unan imously that a swift setting-up of services statistics is long overdue. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 113 ",
        "Discussion of the fourth Session \u201eEconomic and monetary policies\" On the other hand, it was pointed out that the introduction of the Single Market has had a less favourable side for statistics: central areas such as the statistics of domestic trade inevitably suffer quality losses when goods and services can be traded freely inside a common market and border controls are a thing of the past. This has an impact also on national accounting which is deprived of data bases at the national level. The resulting gap may - at least partly - be closed by increasing cooperation between the statistical offices of the Member States. 3 Statistics and politics At the European level, the last decade has been marked by an increasing use of statistics for administrative purposes (convergence criteria, Stability and Growth Pact, regional develop ment). During the discussion, participants underlined the threats involved with that: there is a permanent risk of political interference, every future conceptual change - even if statistically well-grounded - may quickly raise suspicions of manipulation, and overall, statistics will be come less flexible. Statisticians will have to adapt to these new conditions. They cannot afford to have their objectivity and credibility questioned. Transparency is of utmost impor tance. The participants also stressed the significance of incorporating safety mechanisms. One of those mechanisms is that statisticians should keep up a constant dialogue with all of their clients, especially those of the academic community. This will help to prevent political interference. 114 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
        "Yves Franchet*) Concluding remarks After this two days' workshop, we certainly have a broader view of the challenges we face in response to the policy needs of European integration, but probably not all the answers. Professor Spinner introduced our discussion with the following paradigm: - knowledge is important - statistics are important - politicians want to use statistics. Most of the speakers agreed to work within this paradigm, some of us even thinking that we are living in the age of statistics. It is true that policy makers demand more and more statis tics, even if they are not ready to allocate adequate resources for that purpose. The speed and nature of change introduced by the information society and globalisation pre sents new challenges but also creates opportunities to produce more timely and register based statistics, good register based statistics. It brings both more decentralisation of decisions and more needs for central co-ordination on macro issues. Both require a higher level of comparability of statistics and better statistical standards. As the number of members of the European Union (EU) increases, we may have to make greater use of the opportunity brought by the information technology, and move away from a mere aggregation of national statistics to a more statistical approach for the elabo ration of EU-statistics; systematic use of existing and standardised data, use of European samples to produce the required short-term aggregates, creation of European knowledge bases accessible by all interested parties on the economic activities of multinational compa nies. In other words we have to be bold enough to question how we are working. In these fast changing times many businesses feel that a production process which is more than 10 years old, some even say 5 years old should be fundamentally reengineered. There may be something for us to learn for us in the European Statistical System. We all agreed that an extensive use of the principle of subsidiarity must be made for Europe an statistics, the principle being applied in both directions. Statistics must be produced both for local, and regional needs, national needs and supranational needs, and resource con straints should not lead to excessive and unjustified cuts at the local level. However, it may be possible to cut the cost of statistics at local or regional level with more flexibility on stan dards and more use of administrative sources. More work needs to be done on small area statistics. And flexibility between the regional/national and supranational levels should pre serve the required levels of consistency and relevance for policy decisions. And I am quite aware, when I say that, that it is full of contradictions. *) Yves Franchet, Director General, Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), Luxembourg. Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 115 ",
        "Yves Franchet The discussion on social statistics brought more controversy. We all agree that this domain is more complex than the economy because it reflects different cultural and administrative prac tices. We also agree that comparability of outputs and an extensive use of existing data should be given a higher priority. But some participants questioned the relevance of harmo nising statistics when social systems remain so different, when others on the contrary insisted that the politically agreed social convergence needed a set of comparable indicators to follow the performance of national policies. Good policies require good statistics: that was the statement of State Secretary Koch-Weser, and these statistics must be produced by independent statisticians. It is clear that in most countries policy makers do not provide adequate resources to official statisticians so that they can respond to their growing demands. The necessary priority setting exercises have to be made and costs must be cut by the extensive use of the facilities offered by information tech nology and the introduction of more flexible statistical systems. But also we have to try to raise public awareness about the usefulness of statistics in our societies, and get more in volved in the preparation of policy decisions. The ambitious programme of EU-integration which was presented by State Secretary Koch-Weser: We must be able to respond to it with a programme of adequate and cost-efficient statistical information. Finally, I would like to thank a number of groups that have made this seminar possible. First: Mr. Hahlen and the Federal Statistical Office of Germany who have worked hard to make this event a success. Second: the Land Statistical Office of Berlin who have also been very active in this event. I am reminded that the building we are in has also played a very active role in statistics being the venue of an international statistical congress in 1863, a conference of the International Statistical Institute (1ST) in 1903 and today this very important event. In 2003 it will again be the venue for a conference of ISI, so we are at the core of statistical activity in this very magnificent building. I would like to thank you for your participation in this statistical event and I would also like to thank the interpreters. 116 Federal Statistical Office, Forum of Federal Statistics, Vol. 37/2000 ",
