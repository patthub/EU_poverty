        "EDITORIAL E aster has come and gone, and the green shoots of spring are all around us. Hope is in the air. But what about the green shoots of economic recov- ery? The long, hard economic winter triggered by the crisis froze millions of Europeans out of the job market, and \u2013 as so often happens \u2013 the thaw in the economy is not yet fully reflected by a similar thaw in jobs growth. What hope can the EU offer to young people searching for their first job, to the long-term unemployed, to the disabled and the socially excluded? What is the EU doing to keep workers safe from work-related health and safety risks, and provide jobseekers with the skills they need? This edition\u2019s dossier takes an in-depth look at the latest developments in the EU\u2019s employment and social policy, and what colleagues in DG EMPL are doing to get Europe back to work. Vice-President Dombrovskis talks about the relaunch of the social dialogue and efforts to make the European Semester more social, while Commissioner Thyssen explains how this Com- mission is investing in people, and ensuring that eco- SOCIAL SPRING by Antony Gravili , EDITOR(cid:2)IN(cid:2)CHIEF, CEND \u00a9 F o t o l i a nomic growth and social progress go hand in hand. Also interviewed is DG EMPL Director-General Michel Servoz, who stresses the importance of health and safe- ty legislation, and the need for more data and deeper analysis when making policy for a rapidly-changing work environment. Elsewhere in this edition, you will find some fasci- nating information about behavioural science and its role in policy making, and there\u2019s a trip down memory lane as we look back at 20 years of the Schuman Tro- phy.

        "POST EMAS We were really pleased to read in CEND #28 about the new Circular Economy package, aiming to \u2018close the loop\u2019 of product lifecycles through greater recycling and re-use, bringing benefits to both the environment and the economy. CEND readers may like to know that the Commission sets an example, for instance, by making its obsolete Brussels IT equipment available for humanitarian purposes, resulting in 80% re-use. It has reduced non-hazardous waste by nearly 30% (2005-14) and sorts more than 60% into potentially reus- able waste streams. In Brussels we have purchased electricity from 95% renewable sources since 2009, and in 2014 incorporated \u2018green\u2019 criteria in 80% of OIB procurement contracts above \u20ac60,000. Also, 36% of items listed in the Brussels office supply catalogue in 2014 had some form of \u2018green\u2019 designa- tion. With EMAS, the Commission can say it leads by example!

        "8 Fewer Member States with economic imbalances EU Member States are making progress in addressing imbalances in their economies. This is the conclusion of in-depth reviews the Commission decided to carry out for 18 Member States\u2019 economies, to assess whether they were experiencing macroeconomic imbalances. The efforts reflect the focus of this year\u2019s European Se- mester: re-launching investment, implementing struc- tural reforms and pursuing responsible fiscal policies. Commissioner Marianne Thyssen, responsible for Em- ployment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, said: \u201cAlthough the situation varies from country to country, Member States are making overall progress in bringing back unemployed people to the labour market, including young people. The European Semester continues to drive Member States\u2019 reforms to help people back into jobs.\u201d Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, responsible for Eco- nomic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, said: \u201cToday we can see clearly that those countries that have moved furthest and fastest in reforming their economies are reaping the rewards of those efforts.

The Register currently applies to the European Parliament and the Commission; the consultation proposes to extend it to the Council as well. The Transparency Register covers all activities car- ried out with the intention of directly or indirectly influencing the decision-making processes of the EU Institutions. It includes lobbying, interest representa- tion and advocacy. Stakeholders range from public affairs consultancies and law firms to in-house lobby- ists working for professional associations, NGOs, reli- gious organisations, think tanks, academic organisa- tions and regional and local authorities.

To finance the additional emergency funding, AMIF and ISF funds foreseen in the EU\u2019s budget for 2016, which had not yet been allocated, will be used. The increase in emergency funding follows the conclusions of the European Council of 18-19 February 2016, which called for urgent action to address the humanitarian situation in Greece and along the Western Balkans using all available EU and national means. The original budget of \u20ac188.98 mil- lion for emergency assistance under AMIF and ISF for 2016 has now been reinforced with an additional \u20ac193.5 million for AMIF and \u20ac 82 million for ISF, for a total of \u20ac464 million in 2016 to address the most urgent funding needs of Member States in the context of the refugee crisis.

These are rules on how, where and when fishermen may fish. Until now, these rules have been decided at EU level through a lengthy adoption process, and over the years this regulatory structure has become highly complex. Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Karmenu Vella said: \u201cWith this proposal we ensure that our objectives for sustainable fisheries and the protection of marine habitats are reached throughout the EU. Its regionalised approach simplifies the rules, in line with our Better Regulation agenda. It allows for fisheries management decisions to be made locally, closer to the people they affect.\" The Commission is now tabling a more flexible system of governance, empowering regional actors, who know their local context best, to customise technical conser- vation measures in their own sea basins. The proposal also condenses a number of distinct Regulations into one single text which should ease interpretation and make compliance easier.

        "10 EUROPE & BEYOND THE SINGLE MARKET STRATEGY THE YEAR OF DELIVERY by Michael Scheerer, CEND The Single Market is crucial for Europe\u2019s economic development. El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, Commissioner for the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, tells Commission en direct what barriers remain, and then outlines the latest developments in the Volkswagen case. Last autumn, the Commission published its new Single Market Strategy. What are the main challenges in delivery? Actually, I prefer to put the accent on the opportunities \u2013 and these are significant. The EU Single Market al- ready allows goods, services, capital and people to move more freely. It offers opportunities for professionals and businesses and greater choice and lower prices for con- sumers. However, many of these opportunities do not materialise in full, because S ingle Market rules are not known, are not properly implemented or because they are jeopardised by unjustified barriers. In the present economic circumstances, where EU productivity com- pared to competitors has been declining in a straight line for more than ten years now, this is a huge missed opportunity. With the strategy, we focus on a number of areas where improvements are needed. Let me give you an example. In 2010 a British con- struction company won a building contract in Tou- louse. According to French rules, liability insurance is mandatory. No British insurance company was able to provide it. Nor was the construction company able to buy such insurance in France because it was not established there. In the end, the project was awarded to a French company at a much higher price. Construc- tion services are very important for our economy, but because of these barriers they aren\u2019t provided across borders. That\u2019s why we need to act. Can you highlight the economic benefits for the EU of a deeper and fairer Single Market? We estimate that a more ambitious implementation of the Services Directive would add 1.8% of EU GDP. If we get rid of existing barriers to the free exchange of products and services, improve the enforcement of existing rules, boost cross-border public procurement and encourage political support for structural reforms, we expect to see many new opportunities for businesses and citizens, resulting in new jobs and lower prices. What are the most important steps in 2016 to develop the Single Market further? 2016 is the year we start delivering on what we an- nounced in the Strategy. This summer we will publish guidance on how EU law applies to collaborative econ- omy business models. This is urgently needed, because collaborative economy companies and their users face very different regulations across the EU. As I have told competitiveness ministers, if we don\u2019t get our act to- gether and find a way to embrace these new business models, we know exactly what will happen: five years from now, our successors will be complaining and re- gretting how Europe \u201clost\u201d the collaborative economy. Just as many today anguish about how Europe \u201clost\u201d the consumer internet. Europe cannot afford to miss this opportunity. Our S ingle Market must help these new business models to grow. By the end of the year we want to introduce a ser- vices passport to make it easier for service providers to demonstrate their compliance with requirements in other Member States and operate across borders. We will also propose a tool to analyse the proportionality of regulation concerning professions in the Member States. There are more than 5,000 regulated professions across the EU. Studies have shown that less restrictive regulation has a positive impact in terms of job cre- ation, prices for consumers and overall efficiency of resource allocation in the economy. How are you responding to the Volkswagen case? The revelations of wrongdoing at Volkswagen under- lined the urgent need for change. We have to make sure ",
        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 11 EUROPE & BEYOND that it never happens again. This is why we are already working on closing the loopholes and tightening the rules. We are introducing new tests to measure NOx and other air pollutant emissions in real driving conditions. These will deliver results that are more accurate and harder to corrupt. And we are not stopping there. We need to fine-tune the testing methods to take into ac- count that short city trips starting with a cold engine are responsible for most city pollution. We are also working to introduce a new test procedure for measuring CO 2 emissions to ensure that the test is more representative of real driving conditions. In January this year, we pro- posed a major overhaul of the rules for type approval and market surveillance of cars. With these actions we will raise the quality and independence of vehicle testing and improve the oversight of cars already in circulation. The Volkswagen case showed that we need both tighter rules as well as more European oversight. Will the Commission be able to impose penalties in case of non-compliance with the rules? In the current type-approval system, the Commission\u2019s task is to set the regulatory framework. But market surveillance and control of compliance with the type- approval legislation, including imposing penalties, fall under the responsibilities of the Member States. As regards Volkswagen, the Commission has invited all Member States to carry out the necessary investiga- tions at national level and to report back. We have also offered to facilitate exchange of information between the countries and called upon the type-approval au- thorities of the Member States that have type-approved the vehicles from VW group to verify the existence of defeat devices in these cars and take necessary remedial actions. Our proposal for the far-reaching reform of the type-approval framework will give the Commission the power to impose penalties on car manufacturers and technical services if the rules are violated. In future, not only the national authorities but also the Com- mission will carry out compliance verification checks on vehicles already placed on the market to verify that they comply with applicable EU legislation.

        "12 way into the EU consumer rights legislation, currently protecting more than 500 million consumers from the abuse of pre-checked boxes in online contracts. Recent- ly, behavioural insights were used in the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive and in a Recommendation on Online Gambling. The Junker Commission is committed to the prin- ciples of better regulation, calling for evidence-based policy-making for delivering more effective policies. Alongside other disciplines, behavioural sciences have been included in the \u201ctoolbox\u201d for better regulation. Behavioural trials can also be used to test and com- pare different policy options and tailor policy remedies before implementation. This testing approach, focus- ing on individuals, helps adapt policy-making to the needs of citizens. Behavioural sciences help to identify what works in order to design policies that are fit for purpose. A state-of-the-art view In light of these developments, our team of foresight and behavioural insights experts in the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the Commission\u2019s science and knowl- B ehavioural sciences \u2013 including behavioural eco- nomics, psychology, sociology, and anthropol- ogy \u2013 offer the chance to look at policy issues from a broader perspective, by taking into account how people really behave, instead of relying on untested assump- tions. In other words, insights into human behaviour can improve legislation to better protect consumers. Real solutions for real people The individual behaviour of people often determines the effectiveness of the policy we design. A proposal for a new energy label, encouraging the purchase of greener appliances, may seem sensible on paper, but it will not be effective unless the label is clear to consum- ers. Behavioural insights and testing methods, such as randomised controlled trials, help us to get it right by telling us that too much or overly complex information makes the label less effective. Since 2008, the European Commission has been a front-runner in using behavioural insights to inform legislation and regulatory policy, with explicit applica- tions to consumer and competition policy, as well as health and food policy. Behavioural insights made their \u00a9 A l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d (cid:2) From le(cid:6) to right: Report authors Emanuele Ciriolo, Joana Sousa Louren\u00e7o, Sara Rafael Almeida and Fran\u00e7ois Dessart. How well do you know yourself? The power of defaults means you would probably ignore pre-checked boxes for \u2018optional\u2019 extras in online contracts, resulting in unwanted legal obligations.

        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 13 The Secretariat-General took a close interest in the JRC\u2019s work on behavioural science for policy making. Deputy Secretary-General Jean-Eric Paquet explains why. The European Commission has been a front-runner in applying behavioural insights to inform legislation and regulatory policy since 2008. For example, behavioural biases and behavioural economics are explicitly recognized in the Better Regulation Toolbox. So we were very interested to see how the JRC\u2019s latest research could enrich and expand that experience. Applying behavioural insights to policy concerns off ers possibilities to pursue policy objectives or regulatory goals without resorting to additional rules or sanctions. In the Secretariat-General itself we have looked for ways to ensure compliance and foster success without resorting to new rules or procedures. Take the new Structural Reform Support Service, established last year and off ering tailored expertise and practical technical support to any Member State that requests it. Instead of merely issuing instructions to Member States and monitoring progress \u2018from a safe distance\u2019, the Commission actively engages in helping Member States induce change and achieve structural reforms. So a lot is already being done, but it is a fair assumption that with the roll-out of the Better Regulation Agenda, behavioural insights will have an even bigger infl uence in EU policy-making in the years ahead. This makes the JRC\u2019s work both timely and welcome. edge service, recently mapped out behavioural policy interventions in 32 European countries. The resulting report (see link below), complemented by a set of coun- try overviews, provides for the first time a state-of-the- art view of the contribution of behavioural insights to policy-making, and puts forward an analysis of institutional developments. It was launched during a dedicated conference in February. Tibor Navracsics, EU Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport and responsible for the JRC, said: \u201c Behavioural sciences introduce new thinking but also new methods into policy- making. They invite us to test before we act, and design new policy solutions with real people in mind.\u201d Behavioural insights have increasingly been influ- encing policy-making. They are used to promote waste sorting, to encourage the purchase of energy-saving appliances, to assist people in getting back to work, or to help modernise public policy through simplification of administrative procedures and the adoption of user- centred approaches in communication strategies. The report also identifies areas for further improvement, such as closer cooperation between policy-makers and the academic community, and effective commu- nication and evidence-sharing with citizens to address scepticism and increase public support for behavioural policies. Behavioural policies around the world Several EU countries, including the UK, the Nether- lands, Germany, France, and Denmark, have already set up dedicated teams to apply behavioural insights to policy. At the global level, international organisations such as the World Bank and the Organisation for Eco- nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have recently published reports emphasising the importance of behavioural insights and even US President Barack Obama referred to them in an Executive Order.

Olivier Salles, a Head of Unit in DG FISMA responsible for Retail Financial Services and Payments, tells Commission en direct what he and his colleagues are doing to rectify the situation. FINANCIAL RETAIL MARKETS PUTTING AN END TO CROSS(cid:7)BORDER BARRIERS by Michael Scheerer, CEND DG FISMA is busy overhauling the cross- border financial retail markets. What is going wrong with these markets? A Single Market for retail finance does not yet exist. For instance, only 3% of consumers have used bank services in another EU Member State, and credit card fees vary drastically between countries, as does the cost of similar insurance products. It also remains difficult or impossible for consumers to access or transfer certain financial products across borders. Simultaneously, we are seeing a market being turned upside-down by the shift to digital technology. The internet is the turning point which could give a boost to integration in the Single Market. Face-to-face sales now matter less than in the past, and it is getting easier to reach for customers and find the best deals across borders. However, new barriers can hamper progress. For example, firms may choose not to allow interna- tional customers to apply for their products, arguing that legal and regulatory requirements differ too much, or that they cannot identify these customers at a dis- tance. Who will benefit most from removing existing barriers? A better integrated Single Market for retail finance would bring greater product choice, better value for money and lower prices for consumers. It could also mean more opportunities for firms to market their products abroad without physically establishing them- selves in other Member States, therefore increasing the opportunity to do business on a larger scale at lower cost. In addition, the Commission is keen to look at ways of meeting the challenges and opportunities of online technology, including ways to support innova- tive financial technology companies. What is the biggest challenge you face? Our biggest challenge is the scale of the problem we are trying to tackle; retail financial services cover many dif- ferent products and touch the lives of most EU citizens. They are also highly dependent on consumer protection rules, which can differ substantially between Member States. Given the complexity of these markets, there is likely to be no \u2018silver bullet\u2019 to solve all our concerns. At the same time, we need to make sure that any action we take does not limit the potential of digitalisation to help consumers. We need to find the right balance between fostering innovation as a potential driver for competi- tion and growth in financial services, and ensuring at the same time that financial stability, consumer protec- tion and security are not undermined.

        "18 A ccording to a Eurobarometer poll \u2013 The Europe- an Year for Development \u2013 Citizens\u2019 views on Development, Cooperation and Aid, citizens have more confidence in EU development actions than over the past 6 years, and the vast majority think development has to be a priority for the European Union. Straight after the economic downturn in 2008, EU support for development dropped slightly. As a result the EU redoubled efforts to show taxpayers what was being achieved. Today we can reap the rewards \u2013 this year 9 out of 10 European citizens support the work of DG DEVCO; 8 out of 10 believe that development is also in the EU\u2019s own interest; more than one-third of Europeans have heard or read about the Sustainable Development Goals and almost 1 in 5 Europeans knew that 2015 was the European Year for Development (an increase of some 50% since 2014). \"I am delighted with the Eurobarometer results, which clearly show that EU citizens know about and value the importance of the EU\u2019s international cooperation and de- velopment. At a time when Europe is facing all sorts of challenges, it is more important than ever to let our tax- payers know what we are achieving in their name,\" Neven Mimica, Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, said. When reviewing the results, it is important to look back at the bigger picture. The survey was carried out be- tween November and December 2015, when France was waking up to a new wave of terrorism; more than 1 mil- lion migrants and refugees were crossing into Europe in 2015 (three times more than 2014); and Germany, Hungary, Sweden, to name a few, were struggling with a rising number of asylum claims. Despite this climate of uncertainty and fear, Europeans showed their solidarity and openness toward external aid. And this gives us the inspiration and legitimacy we need to move forward in our commitment towards developing countries. A further positive sign of support can be seen in the personal behaviour of EU citizens. More than 1 in 2 Europeans think that individual actions matter and would personally be prepared to pay more for groceries or products from developing countries. The next challenge will be the 10th edition of the European Development Days in June. Over 5,000 par- ticipants from more than 140 countries are expected, representing 1,200 organisations from the field of de- velopment cooperation, human rights and humani- tarian aid. While there is still a lot of work to be done, these results make extremely positive reading to anyone who works in development, and we are now even more de- termined to work on the legacy of the EYD. (cid:2) The poll in full (cid:2) http://europa.eu/!wx94uu With the European Year for Development (EYD) just ending, the stakes were high when a Eurobarometer poll on the issue was carried out at the end of last year.

THE FIRST WORLD HUMANITARIAN SUMMIT ...RESHAPING HUMANITARIAN AID by Lisa Hastert and Gosia Pearson, DG ECHO T oday, over 100 million men, women and chil- dren worldwide depend on humanitarian assis- tance due to violent conflicts or natural disasters that are ever increasing in scope and intensity. Against this background, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon has called for the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit (see link below). The summit is the culmina- tion of a two-year consultation process and will bring together humanitarian stakeholders on 23-24 May 2016 in Istanbul. The EU, as the world\u2019s largest donor of humani- tarian aid, will seize this opportunity to help reshape the way humanitarian assistance is delivered in the future. This is why the European Commission, first and foremost through its Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), has been actively and intensively involved in the preparations and consulta- tions around the Summit. The European Commission\u2019s strategic vision for reshaping humanitarian action is set out in its Communication \u201cTowards the World Hu- manitarian Summit: A global partnership for principled and effective humanitarian action\u201d (see link below). In essence, it calls for more linked and coordinated action, allowing the global community to respond to the escalating and multifaceted crises and disasters that demand humanitarian assistance. A set of key priorities The Commission will address a set of key priorities at the Summit, from the promotion of international hu- manitarian law and the protection of humanitarian workers and the people in need of aid, to the effec- tiveness and efficiency of humanitarian financing. A stronger focus on building up the resilience of vulner- able populations rather than merely responding when disasters hit, and strengthening cooperation between humanitarian and development actors are also key challenges the Commission will tackle in Istanbul. \u201c The World Humanitarian Summit takes place at a criti- cal juncture. We have to adapt to the realities of our times, be bold in our thinking and act decisively in partnership \u201d, said EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides, who will represent the Commission in Istanbul. \u201c The summit must conclude with clear and concrete ideas to better serve those who need our assistance .\u201d The World Humanitarian Summit is indeed a unique opportunity to find solutions for these and many other challenges the humanitarian world \u2013 including the EU as a major donor \u2013 is currently facing. It will allow stake- holders across the board to collectively redefine what principled and effective humanitarian action should look like in the 21st century, and to set the working agenda for beyond 2016.

        "20 T he second phase of the new My IntraComm project has started. It involves local DG in- tranets coming on board and adopting a unified My IntraComm style and functionality \u2013 part of ongoing work to rationalise resources and strengthen the Com- mission\u2019s corporate culture. The My IntraComm team have been redesigning and harmonising local DG intranets so that they better fit the My IntraComm platform. The timetable is am- bitious: to convert all 32 DG intranets currently hosted on My IntraComm by the end of 2016. What will actually change? Local intranets will adopt the new My IntraComm look and feel, but each DG will choose their own intranet colour, so that users can tell the difference between their local sites and horizontal sites (such as the My IntraComm homepage). Each DG will then reorganise their web content to fit this new template, including the responsive design elements, which will allow their intranet to work on screens of all sizes, including mo- bile devices. The Internal Audit Service, PMO, DG EMPL (see box) and DG JUST were in the vanguard of making the switch. Why change? Given the amount of effort, why are we standardising our intranets? After all, these sites work fine for their users. The answer is simple: to complete the integration and harmonisation of internal websites on My Intra- Comm and in doing so, improve the user experience and make the whole portal more sustainable. Thanks to the new common navigation and standardised web- sites, users will be able to navigate seamlessly across the portal, not just on their local sites. They can find the information they need faster in a more corporate environment, which at the same time remains tied to local users and their needs. Another considerable advantage of this revamp is the rationalisation of resources related to the mainte- nance of internal sites. There will be standardised lay- outs and a common design for the most-used modules, even though the content itself will remain DG-specific. On 1 November 2015, DG HR launched the new My IntraComm with a fresher look and feel and improved navigation and search. Although this was a big milestone for the teams in DG HR and DIGIT, it was only the first phase of a much larger project. NEW(cid:7)LOOK MY INTRACOMM DG INTRANETS GO CORPORATE, STAY LOCAL by Maria Te, DG HR ",
        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 21 Content duplication will be kept to a minimum because the links to the main corporate sites are accessible from every page on the portal through a common My Intra- Comm header and footer. In this shared environment, when the portal needs to be changed, it can be done centrally with minimum work at local level, saving both effort and resources. The change brings the My IntraComm family closer than ever. Navigation and design are more intuitive, coherent and, importantly, mobile-friendly. The project NEW(cid:21)LOOK INTRANETS (cid:22) THE LOCAL EXPERIENCE DG EMPL is happy to be one of the fi rst to adopt the new visual identity for local intranets. Local intranet manager Niall Judge explains why. Prior to moving to My IntraComm, we were very satisfi ed with our intranet. In 2014 it even won an award for the Best Intranet at the Commission\u2019s annual Internal Communication Awards (see photo above). However, as it was running on an older version of SharePoint, the time had come to upgrade. Initially, we were hoping that the roll-out of the new \u201clook and feel\u201d could be done with this so(cid:6) ware upgrade, so we could do everything in one big bang. However, this was not possible as our move to My IntraComm, on 1 November 2015, coincided with two events: on that same day, the corporate sites switched to SharePoint 2013 and our DG underwent a big reorganisation. With the assistance of DG HR and DIGIT, we built our new intranet on the My IntraComm platform in such a way as to anticipate the new look and feel so that when it was eventually applied, the process would go as smoothly as possible. For example, reserving the le(cid:6) column of the homepage for the menu only (whereas previously it was across the top), so that the navigation in the new design would work well on mobile devices. Of course the migration was also a good time to do some housekeeping when it came to the content. In addition, the structure of some of the internal pages was modifi ed, again to better fi t the new design. Since the beginning of this year, we were in constant close contact with our colleagues in DG HR and DIGIT and we are moving forward with the implementation of the new look and feel. There are certain things that we would like to defi ne ourselves in terms of shading and layout. We would also have liked to do some user testing before putting the new version online. However, ultimately we feel that the new visual identity is a positive development. Apart from liking the new look in general, we particularly appreciate the \u2018pop-out\u2019 style of the new menus and the way the corporate information is integrated into our local intranet. We are also curious to see how the use of personal SharePoint profi les can be developed further in the future in terms of the social aspects. Overall, we think the new visual identity adds a layer of cohesiveness to intranets and will allow colleagues across the Commission to navigate more easily on the local intranets of other DGs. is an integral part of the Commission\u2019s efforts to find synergies and efficiencies to rationalise, improve and do more with less.

        "22 Why was the AST Network created? It was around the year 2000. I was in DG EMPL and it struck me that we didn\u2019t have any common prac- tices within the DG or between DGs. So a group of us thought it would be good to have a network to share best practices, and enhance efficiency, satisfaction and motivation. The Network became official in 2002. What is your role now? I am the liaison officer for European Management Assistants (EUMA). This is an international network of management support professionals who focus on their personal development and on the future of their profession. The Commission became a corporate mem- ber in 2008. In 2010, EUMA Belgium organised the international annual conference in Brussels, and over 200 assistants and secretaries from all over Europe at- tended. Catherine Day, former Secretary-General at the European Commission, was our keynote speaker. The benefits to the Commission are that we can broaden our horizons \u2013 interinstitutionally, nationally and internationally, keep up with the latest develop- ments in our profession, share in a unique Europe-wide network, help influence the development of the man- agement assistant profession, and take an active part in the recognition of the importance of this profession throughout Europe. How does this work in practice? Corporate membership is financed by DG HR and al- lows a number of ASTs to attend EUMA Belgium events as well as international events. Missions, training and/ or conference fees are financed by the DGs of the ASTs concerned. Until last year, there was financing for five ASTs to attend such events. After talking to Vice-Presi- dent Georgieva about the benefits of EUMA member- ship, it was agreed to increase the numbers able to participate to nine ASTs. And now you are looking for volunteers? Yes. The next Training Day will take place in Stockholm in mid-April whilst the Annual Conference will take place in Copenhagen in October. In April 2017, EUMA Belgium will host the International Training Day in Antwerp. We hope once again that the European Com- mission will be well represented. If you are an AST or AST/SC (including all categories) and are interested in representing the Commission at external events, please get in touch with me. There are still some places left for the international events, or there are plenty of op- portunities to meet like-minded people at one of EUMA Belgium\u2019s monthly events here in Brussels.

        "26 OUR STORIES This year Klarafestival presented classical music from several centuries on the theme \u201cErbarme Dich!\u201d \u2013 Have mercy on me! Henriette van Eijl from DG MOVE, tells Commission en direct about her experiences as a member of the Klarafestival Board of Directors. What is the Klarafestival about? Klarafestival is an international music festival organised for 40 years in the context of the Flanders Festival Brus- sels. The festival is about western classical music, with performances by both established artists and new tal- ents from around the world. Festival productions often try to modernise the western classical musical repertoire by combining pieces from hundreds of years ago with recent compositions. Their performances take place in different venues in Brussels, Antwerp and Bruges and are generally held in March for two consecutive weeks. Each year, the Klarafestival attracts more than 25,000 spectators, connecting people through music. And all the performances are broadcast by the Radio Klara sta- tion and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). What was the theme of Klarafestival 2016? This year\u2019s edition of Klarafestival was the second part of a trilogy devoted to passion and compassion. While in 2015 the emphasis was on love and passion, now we fo- cused on universal suffering, compassion and religion. We live in complex times and contemporary classical music can serve as a means to understand others and find spiritual consolation in recent tragic events. Klarafestival 2016 aimed at exploring the main is- sues of our society, while artists of different religions and cultures came together to convey messages of peace and reconciliation through their music. When did you join the Klarafestival Board and why? I joined the Klarafestival Board about 18 months ago. I don\u2019t play any instruments but I have always liked classical music. I still hold onto my grandfather\u2019s old vinyl records, of Chopin and other famous classical musicians. When I moved to Brussels 14 years ago, I immediately got involved in its cultural life. I enjoyed going to numerous concerts organised in this city and I became a member of several cultural clubs. In this way, I met two members of the Klarafestival Board of Directors, who asked me to join their Board. In fact, the organisation of this festival requires a \u2018crew\u2019 of around 50 dedicated people and many volun- teers. Organisation starts between two and three years in advance, under the guidance of an artistic director and an operational director. We have a budget of around \u20ac2.3 million per year. In particular, 40% of the funding comes from the pub- lic sector while the rest is provided from ticket selling and private sector sponsorship. As a consequence, the Klarafestival Board of Directors is composed of people of different professional backgrounds coming from the cultural, legal and financial sectors. They undertake great responsibilities and develop meaningful relations with all the Festival\u2019s stakeholders.

        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 27 How do you combine your professional life with the Klarafestival organisation? I generally have very long working days so each time that a Klarafestival event takes place, I arrive just in time not to miss it. Then I take a seat, relax and get inspiration from music and performances. This really helps me to be creative during my everyday life. The Board\u2019s meetings are generally held after working hours. This allows me to combine my professional life with my responsibilities in event organisation. In particular, I support the Board of Directors in de- veloping partnerships and networks among the Belgian and international community. This year\u2019s edition had a strong link with the city of Wroc\u0142aw, European Capital of Culture 2016 (see pag- es 58-60) and Poland. For instance, we collaborated with the musicologist Nicholas Reyland, the conductor Zbigniew Preisner and the Wroc\u0142aw Philharmonic & Choir. Numerous musicians and artists from the Nether- lands \u2013 holding the Presidency of the Council of the EU till June \u2013 also participated. Among them, Andris Nelsons and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra from Amsterdam. I am also involved in the Dutch Professional Wom- en\u2019s network and I promote the event among my col- leagues. What have you learned from this experience? First of all I have realised that music is a powerful lan- guage, able to influence our emotions and feelings more than words and images. Last year, for instance, I was particularly impressed by Hilary Hahn\u2019s performance. She had just received a Grammy Award. Then she came to Brussels to play her violin in a very unusual context for a classical music performance: the Fuse nightclub. When she started her performance the atmosphere became immediately quiet and more than 300 specta- tors, touched by the sound of her instrument, became immediately silent as if they were at the theatre. From the Klarafestival experience I have also learned the importance of good team working. The Klarafestival Board of Directors is composed of a very varied team of people, able to deliver the most effective results thanks to their different competences. I take this example as a lesson for my activities in DG MOVE, where I am in charge of Smart Cities-related projects. Our society is so complex that when I work to deliver new projects I need to bring together people of different backgrounds so as to come up with the most creative and effective ideas. Music can help to connect and unify people as well as to work and do daily activities in a better way. For this reason, I invite all my colleagues to discover the Klarafestival next year and enjoy the unique occa- sions this big event presents to see so many artists of different nationalities coming to Brussels to convey messages of compassion, love and peace to the rest of the world.

        "28 OUR STORIES How did you get into yoga? Yvette Izabel: I started to practise yoga almost eight years ago. At that time, I had severe back pain and yoga helped me to overcome it. Yoga produces numerous positive effects on our body and benefits our mind by offering ways to manage and reduce stress. For this reason, the Commission\u2019s Yoga Club proposes classes especially during lunchtime, when we have already accumulated some stress and need more energy to get through the day. Yoga poses \u2013 or asana to use the Sanskrit term \u2013 help us to concentrate on the sensations in the body and open a dialogue between our body and our mind. Be- ginners may have difficulties to achieve some of the asana , but this should not be a deterrence. Yoga is like embarking on a long path of transformations. Gradual, incremental improvements and changes can only be achieved through regular exercise. How did this change your life? Carles Blas: When I discovered yoga I had an injured knee. The rehabilitation exercises I did initially were not sufficient to recover. Then, I tried yoga and discovered a valid alternative to the solutions proposed tradition- ally by our culture. In fact, by practising yoga my pains gradually disappeared. Yoga has also changed my lifestyle. It generally helps me to slow down and listen to my body, despite the frenetic pace of modern life. Moreover, each time I practise yoga I discover something new about myself. This ability to understand my body sensations has im- proved significantly with time and experience. Many men tend to think yoga is not for them. What would you say to them? Alain Daligault: In Europe, men are generally interested in those sports able to improve muscular strength, un- derestimating the effects of yoga. In fact, yoga can be far more demanding than a gym workout, allowing practitioners not only to develop strength, but also balance and flexibility. There are different styles of yoga. Some of them focus on the precision of the postures and others can be very dynamic, but all put an emphasis on breathing and body sensations. I would encourage men and women to find a style that suits them and their particular needs, and this may change over time. Founded in 1967, the Yoga Club is one of the Commission\u2019s oldest cercles de loisirs . Club President Yvette Izabel (DG ENV) and some of the yoga teachers/club members talk to Commission en direct about the benefits of yoga and how to find a style that may suit you. YOGA DEALING WITH LIFE\u2019S STRESSES by Nilde Marchitto and Zach Hester, CEND \u00a9 E U ",
        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 29 Which styles does the Yoga Club offer? How can you find a style to suit you? Y.I.: The Commission\u2019s Yoga Club has twelve yoga teach- ers and a meditation teacher. Four of our teachers give lessons on a voluntary basis. They propose different styles of yoga \u2013 Vinyasa, Iyengar and mainly Hatha yoga. Vinyasa yoga focuses on alignment and breathing in safe, dynamic move- ment. Iyengar yoga is a practice of precision. Poses are held for long periods and often modified with props \u2013 belts, blocks and blankets \u2013 to help develop strength, flexibility, stability, and awareness of body sensations in a progressive way. Finally, classic Hatha yoga works on helping the body to relax and get prepared to meditate through breath control and slow movements. For each of these styles, there are classes for both beginners and more experienced practitioners. There is also a prenatal class, which proposes adapt- ed postures and helps future mothers to become more resilient during and after pregnancy. Each class lasts 55 minutes, while the guided medi- tation session is 30 minutes. They are provided all year long. Moreover, workshops to focus on particular as- pects of the practice are organised on a Sunday each month, so as to allow a wider participation. Each teacher personalises his or her class in a dif- ferent way. So by trying different classes, you can eas- ily find a style that suits you. Moreover, the different styles are complementary and can be combined to- gether. (cid:2) (cid:2) The Yoga Club proposes Vinyasa, Iyengar and mainly Hatha Yoga classes, and a prenatal class. The Yoga Club (cid:2) http://cyce.info/ \u00a9 E U \u00a9 E U Yoga at the Commission The Yoga Club has a full programme of 25 classes per week, totalling more than 1,000 hours annually, given in four diff erent buildings \u2013 VM2, SC27, BU25 and G1 \u2013 by a selection of highly qualifi ed teachers (including some who volunteer their time). Another handful of people put their hearts into running the club, investing in the administrative and practical eff orts to keep it going, as well as proposing new activities like meditation, prenatal yoga, and special Sunday workshops. Check out the full programme on the Club\u2019s website. A lifetime practice A long-time practitioner of yoga and former Yoga Club President, Dave Skinner (ex DGT and DG ENV and now retired) shares some of his memories and thoughts about yoga . I joined the Cercle de Yoga des Communaut\u00e9s Europ\u00e9ennes in 1973 when I came to Brussels as a stagiaire interpreter. I had started yoga at university where I saw it as a hippyish kind of activity that went well with my guitar and long hair. So I was surprised \u2013 but pleased \u2013 to fi nd that the European institutions had a Yoga Club (as I later christened it when I took over the presidency). At the time, I did not realise that Belgium had a very well established yoga tradition, thanks chiefl y to Andr\u00e9 Van Lysebeth, who trained a lot of teachers and wrote several seminal yoga books. The fi rst class I went to was nearly my last. To begin with the yoga room at No 63 rue Archim\u00e8de was not easy to fi nd \u2013 and the windowless basement room off an underground car park was not particularly salubrious. Things have changed a lot since those early days, and the club is still going from strength to strength. But you always feel good at the end of a yoga lesson \u2013 and vaguely virtuous \u2013 so I kept on going... and I am still going, even though I retired over three years ago. ",
        "30 OUR STORIES \u201c JE NE SUIS PAS TOMBE SUR LA PHOTO ELLE EST TOMBEE SUR MOI \u201d par Dominique Labourdette, CEND Economiste de formation, passionn\u00e9 d\u2019informatique, Georgios Gavanas (DG ENER) s\u2019est d\u00e9couvert une passion pour la photographie il y a presque vingt ans. Il nous parle de cette activit\u00e9 artistique devenue indispensable \u00e0 son \u00e9quilibre. Comment avez-vous commenc\u00e9 la photo? J\u2019avais environ 12 ans quand mon p\u00e8re m\u2019a offert mon premier appareil photo, mais je ne m\u2019y suis pas int\u00e9- ress\u00e9. C\u2019est seulement des ann\u00e9es plus tard, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une d\u00e9ception sentimentale, que j\u2019ai vu dans la pho- tographie un moyen de me changer les id\u00e9es. Au d\u00e9but, je m\u2019int\u00e9ressais surtout \u00e0 l\u2019aspect technique, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agissait encore d\u2019argentique. Je suis un autodidacte passionn\u00e9 et j\u2019ai alors r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que je pourrai pratiquer la photographie toute ma vie sans m\u2019en lasser. C\u2019\u00e9tait aussi le premier art visuel que j\u2019abordais. Comment votre travail a-t-il \u00e9volu\u00e9? J\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 par des portraits de mes proches, je cou- vrais des \u00e9v\u00e8nements familiaux, mariage ou bapt\u00eame. Mes photos plaisaient car j\u2019avais une approche repor- tagiste, c\u2019\u00e9tait le d\u00e9but de cette mode. Le bouche-\u00e0- oreille a fonctionn\u00e9 et rapidement des inconnus m\u2019ont contact\u00e9. J\u2019ai ensuite revendu mon mat\u00e9riel pour acheter un Leica, un appareil dont la philosophie est bien par- ticuli\u00e8re. Il est enti\u00e8rement manuel, son maniement d\u00e9licat demande un investissement et il permet de voir ses erreurs. Avec un Leica, la mani\u00e8re de voir est totale- ment diff\u00e9rente car au d\u00e9clenchement aucun miroir ne cache la sc\u00e8ne, ce qui permet d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent en perma- nence; c\u2019est un appareil beaucoup moins agressif que ceux d\u2019autres marques qui ressemblent \u00e0 des bazookas. Avant le Leica, je faisais plaisir aux autres, et maintenant je me fais plaisir depuis que j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert ce qui me pla\u00eet dans la photo. Je travaille dans trois directions: la photo de rue, pour capter l\u2019\u00e2me d\u2019un lieu ou d\u2019un ville comme la pol- lution d\u2019Ath\u00e8nes ou la grisaille de Bruxelles; la photo de voyage et le portrait, pour lequel soit on fait appel \u00e0 moi, soit je demande \u00e0 des amis ou des connaissances dont les visages m\u2019int\u00e9ressent de poser pour moi. Parlez-nous de votre genre photographique pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9... J\u2019aime particuli\u00e8rement le portrait et je travaille soit en lumi\u00e8re naturelle soit en studio. Au d\u00e9but d\u2019une s\u00e9ance, il y a toujours une incer- titude; en tant que photographe, il faut que je par- vienne \u00e0 calmer la personne, \u00e0 la convaincre de donner le meilleur d\u2019elle-m\u00eame et que je la laisse, elle, prendre l\u2019initiative si elle le peut afin que, moi, je ne sois l\u00e0 que pour capturer ce qu\u2019elle va me donner. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable massage psychologique et c\u2019est cet aspect qui m\u2019int\u00e9resse \u00e9norm\u00e9ment dans le portrait. Pour moi, la grosse difficult\u00e9 est de ne rien montrer au mod\u00e8le de mes propres doutes de photo- graphe et de lui faire baisser ses d\u00e9fenses. En ce sens, les mod\u00e8les professionnels, et les enfants, sont les plus faciles \u00e0 travailler. En revanche, il arrive fr\u00e9quemment que les personnes \u00abbelles\u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire r\u00e9pondant aux canons actuels de la beaut\u00e9, soient des sujets particu- li\u00e8rement d\u00e9licats. Au d\u00e9but, je faisais des photos qui plaisaient au mod\u00e8le, mais maintenant je m\u2019impose plus et parfois le r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9range. Je pense par exemple \u00e0 l\u2019une de mes amies, toujours tr\u00e8s souriante et sociable. J\u2019ai fait d\u2019elle un portrait qui exprimait sa tristesse profonde; c\u2019est devenu son portrait pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 alors que tout son entourage le d\u00e9teste. Souvent, j\u2019ai mes mod\u00e8les \u00e0 l\u2019usure, plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la fin de la s\u00e9ance. (cid:2) Georgios Gavanas sur Flickr (cid:2) http://bit.ly/1QXtLM8 ",

        "34 DOSSIER TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN GETTING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICIES RIGHT by Antony Gravili, CEND Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, and Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility tell Commission en direct why economic and social policy are both important for growth and jobs. What has changed in a year since the European Commission relaunched the social dialogue? Valdis Dombrovskis: First, we want to involve social partners more in the reform process at national level. Reforms can only succeed if you have strong national ownership, for which you need to have social partners on board. They have to be involved in the design and implementation of reforms. I have made a point of meeting with national social partners on my European Semester visits throughout Europe, and so far I have had very fruitful exchanges of views with social partners in 23 Member States. Second, at EU level, we have developed a new approach, which is to consult the social partners on our main policy proposals beyond the traditional em- ployment and social matters, such as on the Invest- ment Plan, the Digital Single Market or the Energy Union. A conference in March 2015 marked a \u201cnew start of the social dialogue\u201d and at the highest political level the Tripartite Social Summit has been instrumental to reinforce the social dialogue. Last year you came with the proposal to make the European Semester more social. How does it work exactly? V.D.: Economic and social policies are two sides of the same coin, so both should be considered together. This idea has been integrated in the streamlined European Semester. First, the 2016 Annual Growth Survey, which is the strategic base for the European Semester and lays out the EU\u2019s political priorities, now pays more atten- tion to employment and social issues. Second, new employment indicators have been introduced in the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure allowing for a better understanding of the social consequences of im- balances. Third, our country-specific recommendations are now more focused, pointing out key reforms that could make a difference for growth, job creation and better welfare systems. These include labour market reforms but other reform areas are equally important to unlock the growth potential of our economies. The President has entrusted you to lead the work on completing Europe\u2019s Economic and Monetary Union. What are the social strands of that work? V.D.: President Juncker has said that Europe\u2019s ambition should be to earn a \u2018social triple-A\u2019. The employment and social situations vary widely across the Member States, partly as a result of the crisis but also because of underlying structural weaknesses in our economies pre- dating the crisis. Moreover, social policy competences remain in the hands of Member States. In March, the Commission launched a consulta- tion process on setting up a European Pillar of Social Rights (see page 39). We need to update our social ac- quis in light of the changing world of the 21st century and identify benchmarks and best practices, notably as concerns the flexicurity concept, to promote upward convergence in and between Member States. This is a complex task and a broad consultation process will guarantee that all views are taken into ac- count. The Pillar of Social Rights is part of our work to strengthen the Economic and Monetary Union and is focused on the euro area. However, we will make sure ",
        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 35 that non-euro area Member States are fully involved and can join the initiative if they wish to do so. This Commission announced it was going to be big on big things, small on small things. How big has it been on the social front? Marianne Thyssen: This Commission has made it a pri- ority to make sure that economic growth and social progress go hand in hand. The economic crisis caused massive layoffs and during the most difficult years fewer and fewer people were hired. From day one we have been working to deliver jobs, growth and investment. We have geared our efforts especially to helping those people who were hit hardest during those difficult years: millions of young people, and the long-term unemployed \u2013 whose number doubled during the cri- sis (see pages 42-45). Our efforts are starting to pay off. We have reached the highest employment rate since 2008. Unemployment is steadily decreasing. This is very encouraging, but there are still too many unemployed Europeans. We will not relax our efforts to help people into jobs. That is why the 10 priorities of this Juncker Commission have such a strong social dimension. What else can we expect the Commission to deliver in the field of employment and social affairs? M.T.: The 21st century workplace is changing before our very eyes. We are living in a new economy and society that is driven by globalisation, the digital revolution and new business models. This merits a thorough de- bate. Do our social policies support our citizens, protect them against risks and make it possible to fully partici- pate in society? We need to ask ourselves whether the European social model is still fit for purpose. We have to anticipate and influence these major changes in society so that economic growth and social progress continue to go hand in hand. The European Pillar of Social Rights will frame the social principles and social rights that we need to make the European social model future-proof for coming generations. At the same time we will con- tinue working for a more competitive Europe through a number of key proposals this year. Through a new legal framework for posted workers we want to facilitate labour mobility, but in a fair way (see page 41). And with our upcoming EU skills agenda we want to make sure that our workforce has the skills they need to keep pace with a fast-changing labour market (see page 40). How do EU funds complement our legislative and policy initiatives? M.T.: This Commission has made investing in Europe\u2019s people over the next seven years a priority. We are doing this through the \u20ac315 billion Investment Plan and with a \u20ac454 billion envelope for the European Structural and Investment funds. This also includes the European Social fund, worth \u20ac86 billion, which is used to sup- port job creation. It gives tens of millions of people, including young people but also many of the refugees the opportunities to get a new start in life.

        "38 After the crisis, green shoots of recovery are starting to appear. But not in the labour market \u2013 yet. DG EMPL Director-General Michel Servoz tells Commission en direct how he and his staff are working for a labour market accessible to all, with high levels of health and safety protection. DOSSIER Health and safety seems to be an increasingly important part of employment and social policy \u2013 why? This subject is not new. We have adopted 24 health and safety Directives over 30 years. But these now need to be streamlined and updated to take account of new developments in the world of work. This is exactly what we are doing, starting with an update of the exposure limit values for carcinogens (see page 47). Later this year we will propose a reform of the overall legislative framework for health and safety. This is not a deregu- lation exercise. It is not lowering standards for workers. This is about making the rules simpler, to secure better implementation by employers, and ensure the same or better level of protection for workers. You have advocated greater social analysis and more data for better policy work. What\u2019s the thinking behind this? When we propose legislation we create obligations on Member States and rights for people, so we have to be very careful about the implications. Hence the need for very deep analyses, using economic simulations of the impact on wages, public budgets, etc. At the end of the day, we have to defend our proposals in the Council and European Parliament. That is much easier when we can show it is not just politically motivated, but also backed by a strong, rational analysis of the real economic situation. You often speak of the importance of labour markets, but what about poverty and social exclusion? There has been some economic recovery, but unem- ployment levels are still bad because of the time lag between economic recovery and jobs recovery. Millions of jobs were destroyed by the crisis and they are not coming back. So we must ensure that the unemployed have the new skills they need to get a job in today\u2019s labour market (see page 40). Also, the nature of work is changing, with the emergence of a collaborative econ- omy. The border between employment contracts and self-employment is blurring. At the same time, there are new issues, like the influx of refugees, who need to be integrated very quickly in labour markets. But focusing on jobs does not mean forgetting about social inclusion or poverty. We don\u2019t want a poverty trap where people are left in the margins of society.

        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 39 DOSSIER THE EUROPEAN PILLAR OF SOCIAL RIGHTS A NEW CHAPTER IN EU SOCIAL POLICY by Francis Whyte, DG EMPL A new chapter in EU social policy opened in March, when the Commission launched a consultation on an outline of the future European Pillar of Social Rights. The purpose of this initiative is to establish a number of key social principles common to the euro area and covering the world of work, social protection and skills development. T he overall aim is to foster upward social con- vergence and increase the resilience of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) to economic shocks, and thereby achieve a \u2018Social Triple-A\u2019 rating. In this way, the Pillar will serve as a compass for re- newed convergence within the euro area. The process leading to the Pillar should contribute to modernising, broadening and deepening existing social rights at work and in society, by questioning their take-up in practice and taking better account of the multiple opportunities and challenges arising from diverse employment and social situations. It will build on, and complement, the \u201cacquis\u201d in order to guide policies in a number of fields essential for well-functioning and fair labour markets and wel- fare systems. Structure around three main headings The Pillar will be structured around three main head- ings: \u2022 equal opportunities and access to the labour market, including skills development and life-long learning, \u2022 fair working conditions, setting an adequate and reli- able balance of rights and obligations between work- ers and employers, as well as between flexibility and security elements, to encourage job creation, take-up and transitions over time, \u2022 adequate and sustainable social protection and ac- cess to high quality essential services, including health- care and long-term care, to ensure dignified living and protection against risks, and to enable individuals to participate fully in employment and more generally in society. The social partners are expected to play a central role in the shaping of the Pillar, after the European social dialogue was re-launched by the Juncker Commission in 2015. The Commission\u2019s public consultation will gather feedback on the outline of the European Pillar of Social Rights itself. It should serve to discuss its role, scope and content, to reflect on the particular needs of the euro area, to discuss the specificity of the principles proposed, and to explore the related challenges linked to these. The consultation should also help Member States outside the euro area to determine whether to opt in. The feedback received will also serve as a contribution to the work on the White Paper on the future of Eu- rope\u2019s Economic and Monetary Union, expected in spring 2017. The consultation process should be concluded by December 2016, and provide the basis for the Com- mission to put forward a final proposal for the Pillar early in 2017.

        "40 The EU needs to turn the present fragile economic recovery into a more robust and sustainable one. It must become crisis resistant and maintain its social model in the face of demographic ageing and global competition. Investing in people \u2019 s employability is crucial in this respect \u2013 but also for the sake of social inclusion, active citizenship, a greener economy and a better work-life balance. DOSSIER O n 25 May, the Commission is due to adopt a Skills Agenda Package to invest in people\u2019s em- ployability. It was prepared by the many DGs active in the area of skills and vocational education and training. It will consist of a Communication announcing several actions to make better use of existing skills, improve them and make them more relevant to the labour mar- ket; to improve also the transparency and comparability of skills and qualifications and the way we forecast and anticipate skills: what are the right skills and where? This will be accompanied by a revision of two major instruments, the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) for lifelong learning and Europass (see links be- low), as well as by an initiative to support adults with low basic skills. Connecting two worlds Skills development and training offer a new, positive and pragmatic angle from which to address sensitive policy issues. They entail connecting two worlds that are too far apart: education and work. Fundamentally, the Skills Package aims to develop a common vision between Member States, social partners, business and education, and training providers of the need to invest in people and modernise our economies. It also seeks to foster cooperation between business and edu- cation/training providers, make people\u2019s skills and experi- ences more visible and understandable across the EU and support individuals, employers and employment services thanks to simpler and more efficient EU tools. Migrants and refugees And in the present international situation, it also means supporting migrants and refugees who have made it to the EU, by making their skills more transpar- ent so that they can use them on the labour market or acquire the learning and training needed. Sharing specific information on recognition proce- dures and information on best practice when it comes to assessment of skills and qualifications of refugees and migrants and upgrading skills will be crucial in this respect.

Ils demeurent alors employ\u00e9s par l\u2019entreprise qui les d\u00e9tache. D epuis 1996, une directive europ\u00e9enne pr\u00e9cise les droits applicables aux travailleurs d\u00e9tach\u00e9s par leur entreprise dans un autre Etat membre de l\u2019UE.

Une nouvelle directive entrera en vigueur en juin 2016; elle renforcera les dispositions de mise en \u0153uvre et de con- tr\u00f4le, et permettra de mieux lutter contre la fraude. Le d\u00e9tachement a connu un fort d\u00e9veloppement au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, attestant d\u2019une grande vitalit\u00e9 du march\u00e9 int\u00e9rieur. Mais dans certaines situa- tions, la directive de 1996 ne garantit pas des conditions \u00e9quitables de concurrence. En particulier, la question du niveau de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est un sujet de pr\u00e9occupation dans les pays accueillant un grand nombre de travail- leurs d\u00e9tach\u00e9s. La r\u00e9vision cibl\u00e9e de la directive, propos\u00e9e en mars par la Commission, vise \u00e0 corriger certains effets tout en pr\u00e9servant les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, notamment la libre prestation des services sur une base non discriminatoire. La r\u00e9vision permettra en particulier de clarifier les r\u00e8- gles de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qui s\u2019appliquent aux travailleurs d\u00e9tach\u00e9s, en supprimant la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la notion de minimum pour la fixation des salaires et en permettant aux conventions collectives de s\u2019appliquer aux travail- leurs d\u00e9tach\u00e9s dans l\u2019ensemble des secteurs. Cette r\u00e9vision est \u00e9galement l\u2019occasion d\u2019une mise en coh\u00e9rence avec des lois europ\u00e9ennes plus r\u00e9centes, sur la coordination des syst\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale et les agences de travail temporaire.

        "42 A pathway back to work: that, in a nutshell, is what a Recommendation proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Council earlier this year sets out as a way of integrating the long-term unemployed back into the labour market. THE LONG(cid:7)TERM UNEMPLOYED BACK ON THE PATH TO WORK by Francis Whyte, DG EMPL DOSSIER T he Recommendation (see link below) calls for all jobseekers who have been jobless for more than 12 months to receive an individual assessment and a Job Integration Agreement \u2013 a specific and personalised plan back to work. Much like the Youth Guarantee, it provides a European framework which leaves plenty of flexibility for Member States, while encouraging them to bring together and mobilise all the services and stakeholders concerned, with the support of EU structural and investment funds. Rebuilding trust The first aim of the Recommendation is to fight dis- couragement and rebuild trust on the part of the long- term unemployed, so that they are motivated to regis- ter with an employment service again. Between 12 and 18 months of unemployment, they should benefit from an in-depth individual assessment which, in turn, should lead to counselling and guidance based on the person\u2019s job-search history and evolving employment barriers. Such counselling would lead to a Job Integration Agree- ment, made up of three components: \u2022 an individual service offer in terms of job search as- sistance, training, work experience, mentoring, debt counselling, rehabilitation, child care services, hous- ing and transport, \u2022 a written agreement detailing the offer in terms of the respective rights and responsibilities between the unemployed person and the employment service, \u2022 a single point of contact ensuring that the support offered by the different agencies involved (public employment services, social services, municipalities, health services, etc.) is provided in a continuous, co- ordinated and consistent way. The underlying philosophy of the Recommendation is to simplify procedures for long-term unemployed people and reduce the number of those who fall into in- activity and poverty, due to discouragement in the face of bureaucratic hurdles. It aims to encourage employer involvement, as opposed to dead-end, one-size-fits-all public work schemes. But it is not just about the long-term unemployed. A crucial aspect of the \u201cpathway\u201d approach is to de- velop comprehensive services towards employers, such as post-placement support in the form of mentoring or workplace training. This could include helping small and medium-size entrepreneurs to define the kind of people they need to recruit, write vacancy notices, pre-select candidates and provide a training offer. By involving employers in this way, it will also help them to overcome the prejudice and discrimination they sometimes show towards long-term unemployed people, particularly when they have a choice of many CVs. Creating bridges In practice, this approach is about creating bridges be- tween employment services, social services, health ser- vices and municipalities. On average in the EU, unem- ployment benefits are delivered for 14 months \u2013 in many countries, for less than a year. After that, unemployed people are sent to other services where they have to start from scratch and look for other forms of support, often with other conditions attached. In such circumstances, information on the person concerned can sometimes get lost as they are passed from service to service. Sadly, all too often, that means those who need the most help become discouraged and give up their job search. The Job Integration Agreement should provide conti- nuity and, in exchange for the quality and consistency of the services provided, the unemployed person commits to a set of rights and duties. In this way, conditionality re- lated to job search requirements or participation in active ",

Facts and fi gures The fi nancial and economic crisis has doubled the number of people who have been unemployed for more than a year (10.5 million people at the end of 2015, 63% of whom had been out of work for more than two years). 44% of the unemployed population in the EU are long-term unemployed.

At least 10% of the people supported by the European Social Fund (ESF) during the 2014-20 programming period are expected to be long-term unemployed and at least 25% of the allocations supported by the ESF for unemployed people in general, will be for the long-term unemployed. On average across the EU, long-term unemployment accounts for approximately one-third of total youth unemployment, while short-term unemployment makes up approximately two-thirds (but the situation varies greatly from one EU country to another). measures becomes part of a deal which includes an invest- ment, a high degree of consideration thanks to a person- alised approach, as well as some obligations. For many EU countries, this will entail refocusing priorities and efforts towards direct contact and a cli- ent-oriented approach towards long-term unemployed people. However, this evolution is already underway. What the Recommendation does is to encourage this modernisation process by providing a framework and some guidance, as well as encourage more use of existing funding under the European Investment and Structural Funds (ESIFs) \u2013 in particular the European Social Fund (ESF) which supports not only training activities but also the reinforcement of administrative capacities. Now that the Recommendation has been adopted by the Council and implementation will start at the level of each Member State, the focus will be on building an ef- fective monitoring mechanism that will demonstrate the impact of this initiative on the ground. The Commission will in turn support dedicated seminars \u2013 a first national seminar took place in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 11 March \u2013 and events in view of bringing the necessary stakeholders together, in particular public employment services and social services, and exchanging good practices.

        "44 I n October this year, the European Commission will hold them to their promise. It will report in detail to the European Council on how the Youth Guarantee has been implemented so far. On a year-to-year basis, it already offers an assessment on Member States\u2019 pro- gress, and the overall youth employment challenges, as part of the European Semester process of economic governance. In the meantime, the country reports published in this context show that the Youth Guarantee, now in its third year of implementation, is bearing fruit. Youth un- employment rates are decreasing. EU countries are making substantial efforts to implement the Guarantee, but pro- gress is also uneven from one country to another. The non-registered The Youth Guarantee has spurred on EU Member States to strengthen the capacity of their public employment services, better tailor active labour market instruments for young people and improve their vocational educa- tion and training systems. However, more needs to be done to engage with the young people furthest away from the labour mar- ket. In 2015, Bulgaria, Portugal, and Romania in par- ticular were asked to reach out more to non-registered young people who are not in employment, education or training, while recommendations to Spain and It- aly pointed to the need for further action on youth unemployment. Regular data collection started in June 2015, and a second round is currently being rolled out. An In- dicator Framework for monitoring the Guarantee has Three years ago, the EU Member States committed themselves through a Council Recommendation to ensuring that all young people under 25 receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. They gave this commitment a name: the Youth Guarantee (see link below).

        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 45 Pilot projects In the meantime, the European Commission, mandated by the European Parliament, has funded 18 pilot pro- jects. These projects \u2013 in Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Po- land, Romania, Spain and the UK \u2013 collect experiences that could provide EU countries with practical recom- mendations for improving national Youth Guarantee schemes. They were carried out for one year on a small scale, mostly at municipality level. They focused on creating partnerships between youth, employment and education organisations, employers and social partners, and testing these partnerships with a group of young people on the ground. One of the main lessons learnt is that it takes more than a year to put such partnerships on a sustainable footing, building upon a shared vision, more dialogue and a clear description of each partner\u2019s role. The pro- jects also showed a Youth Guarantee measure is not a one-off reform or a quick fix \u2013 instead, setting up Youth Guarantee schemes should be seen as a process to review and continuously improve the way in which employment and youth services are delivered. Awareness-raising As an experiment in reaching out to, and engaging with, young people not yet aware of the Youth Guarantee, the European Commission worked with national au- thorities, mostly employment ministries, in Finland, Latvia, Portugal and Romania. For example, in the case of Finland (which served as a model for the original Youth Guarantee Recommendation), the difficulty of reaching out to the most vulnerable young people was clear, as was the need, therefore, to focus more on the social workers. A common Youth Guarantee visual was developed which has expanded into a tool-kit for all EU countries, with posters, roll-outs, leaflets, radio spots and social media applications. Now the EU is financing more awareness-raising activities, expanding to Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania and Slovenia. The Youth Employment Initiative In 2013, the EU heads of state and government also agreed to a Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) which would focus \u20ac6 billion of EU co-funding on regions experiencing youth unemployment rates above 25%, and on young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs). During the 2014-20 EU budgetary period, the European Social Fund (ESF) and the YEI will directly co-fund at least \u20ac12.7 billion for youth labour market integration measures. In addition, the total ESF allocation by EU country to education measures, including higher education, amounts to over \u20ac26 billion. In 2015, \u20ac1 billion of YEI funding was made immediately available by increasing the EU pre-fi nancing rate from 1-1.5% to up to 30%. This made it possible to reach out to up to 650,000 NEETs, as opposed to 22,000 under normal pre-fi nancing rules. Despite some initial delays, YEI implementation progress has started to pick up, with \u20ac3.4 billion already reported by the Member States as having been selected to support over 34,000 YEI-relevant operations. Structural reform What is clear at this stage is that the Council Recom- mendation is giving greater visibility and means to the fight against youth unemployment and inactivity (see box). Beyond the countries singled out by the European Semester recommendations, all Member States have en- gaged in a structural reform process \u2013 starting by break- ing down walls between ministries, administrations, social partners and non-governmental organisations. The Commission will carry on getting the stake- holders to talk to each other and increase their efforts \u2013 so that once young people find out about the Youth Guarantee, they know exactly where to go and what to expect.

But without accessibility, they can make life more difficult for people with disabilities. EUROPEAN ACCESSIBILITY ACT IMPROVING ACCESS FOR ALL by Francis Whyte, DG EMPL \u00a9 F o t o l i a E nsuring better functioning of the Internal Mar- ket for accessible products and services will by definition improve access for people with disabilities to products and services throughout the EU. This is the aim of the proposal for a European Accessibility Act, which the European Commission put forward in December 2015. The improvements resulting from the European Accessibility Act would also lead to a greater offer of products and services, at more competitive prices \u2013 not just for disabled people but for everybody. For example, have you ever struggled to hear travel information in a noisy train station? Or tried to get money from ATMs on a bright, sunny day? Or thought about enlarging documents to avoid eye strain? The proposed Directive indicates a set of common functional accessibility requirements (see link below). After a transitional period of six years, the products and services concerned would have to comply with these requirements, which would also apply in the areas of public procurement and in projects co-fund- ed by EU Structural and Investment Funds. But to avoid stifling innovation, it does not impose detailed technical solutions. In addition, it contains safeguard clauses which would protect, in particular, small, medi- um-sized and micro enterprises from disproportionate burdens. The proposed legislation is in line with the EU\u2019s obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The EU and 25 of the Mem- ber States are already party to this convention, while the remaining three are finalising the ratification pro- cess. But the proposed Accessibility Act is just a small part of the Commission\u2019s work to support people with dis- abilities. It is currently preparing a report on the progress achieved by the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, an important document which provides a framework for action at EU level (see link below). Recently, the city of Milan, Italy, was awarded the Access City Award 2016. One of the key actions of the strategy, this award encourages cities with at least 50,000 inhabitants to share their experience and improve accessibility for the benefit of all. More than 250 cities have participated in this award since it was launched in 2010. Since last year, disability policies are coordinated by a DG EMPL unit in charge of disability and social in- clusion. The unit is also in charge of dialogue with civil society and the fight against discrimination in access to employment. As disability itself is a cross-cutting hu- man rights issue, other DGs also mainstream disability matters in the policies they are responsible for.

        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 47 There are more than 217 million workers in the EU. To better protect them from work-related accidents and diseases, the EU has spent more than 25 years building up a comprehensive set of rules covering all occupational risks. This establishes a minimum level of protection for all EU workers, and is part of the EU\u2019s efforts for a \u2018social triple-A\u2019 for Europe, with economic and social progress going hand in hand. TAKING NO RISKS ENSURING HEALTH & SAFETY AT WORK by Jan-Willem Ebeling, DG EMPL U nder the web of EU health and safety rules, employers must assess all risks at the work- place and on that basis decide on the best measures to protect workers, and apply them. But the world of work is changing rapidly. There are new forms of employment and work organisation, atypical contracts and work patterns, technological de- velopments, and an ageing workforce. To ensure that the EU framework in this area re- mains \u201cfit for purpose\u201d and reflects new scientific and technical knowledge, new technologies and modern ways of working, the Commission is carrying out a broad evaluation. The aim is to ensure better imple- mentation on the ground to further reduce accidents and work-related illness. This will need action in areas such as more efficient enforcement, clarifying and sim- plifying the legal framework, reducing administrative barriers at all levels and improving guidance. New tools to help employers and workers The Commission and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) are providing practi- cal support for implementation of safety and health measures \u2013 in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). There are practical guides explain- ing EU rules on a wide range of subjects such as con- struction, vibrations, working at a height, explosive atmospheres, noise, etc. In addition, the on-line interactive risk assessment tool (OiRA) developed by EU-OSHA (see link below) makes a major contribution in helping SMEs\u2019 to comply with Occupational Safety and Health requirements. This is a free and easy-to-use sectorial risk assessment tool for SMEs (see link below). Currently there are both EU and national OiRA tools for around 40 sectorial and occupational activities, and many more under devel- opment.

Cancer is the number one cause of work-related deaths in the EU, and accounts for 53% of the total. Occupational cancer causes between 48,000 and 96,000 deaths per year in the EU. At the time of going to press, the Commission was due to adopt in May a proposal to set further exposure limit values for 13 carcinogens. This should save around 100,000 lives and at the same time increase predictability for business. Without clear exposure limits it can be very difficult for employers, particularly in SMEs, to comply with the obligation to minimise exposure. \u00a9 A l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d ",
        "48 AU QUOTIDIEN Last October, Vice-President Georgieva presented new guidelines on staff volunteering to the College. Janette Sinclair, recently appointed Corporate Social Responsibility Adviser in DG HR, explains what the initiative means for staff. VOLUNTEER FOR A CHANGE by Matteo Manzonetto , CEND How did these guidelines come about? Like many of us, Vice-President Georgieva was deeply concerned by the refugee crisis which was unfolding before our eyes last autumn. This led her to sponsor the in-house Refugee Crisis Appeal, which raised an amazing \u20ac150,000 for Belgian and International Red Cross emergency humanitarian work. At the same time, it became clear that we needed a better frame- work for the many spontaneous demonstrations of support from staff volunteering to help in refugee centres and organising collections. Finally, the Vice- President wanted to promote the value of community involvement through volunteering, to help keep our largely ex-pat community connected with what is go- ing on around us. What\u2019s in the guidelines? The guidelines acknowledge the long tradition of individual and collective volunteering in the Com- mission and clarify the existing framework for staff volunteering. The new element is the commitment to employer-sponsored volunteering, though greater use of volunteering for team building, and the provision of up to one day a year of special leave for approved volunteering activities. How does this fit with the current pressures on staffing? It could seem contradictory to be promoting volun- teering during work time and through special leave when we are facing serious pressures on staffing, and it is clear that individual DGs must retain the flexibil- ity to decide how best to support staff volunteering at any given time. The benefits are compelling, however. Volunteering exposes staff to different situations and perspectives in ways that can only improve our policy- making capacity. It offers many opportunities for skills development, enhances people\u2019s sense of value and connectedness, and increases workplace engagement when it is supported by the employer. You mentioned team building. Could you elaborate? The original formula where a team spends a day to- gether on a volunteer activity was developed under the 2011 European Year of Volunteering. We have updated the guidelines on team events (see link below) with more advice on how to make the most of the activity for learning and development and to promote staff engage- ment. We are also proposing alternative approaches such as the \u2018silo-breaking\u2019 cross-unit model, piloted \u00a9 A l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d \u00a9 A l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d (cid:2) In Ispra, Italy, the JRC\u2019s Recruitment and Training Unit organised a unit team building event around an environmental project to clean up a stretch of the local lake shore.

        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 49 in DG HR\u2019s Resources Directorate last autumn. Small groups of volunteers from the Directorate\u2019s four units each spent a half-day working together on refugee pro- jects. There were various benefits: the volunteers were pleased to be doing something useful to help others in need, the support from their management created a positive team spirit, participating with random col- leagues from other units improved cross-Directorate working relations, and the model was less disruptive than a whole unit event. How will the special leave for volunteering work? This new special leave entitlement is for volunteer- ing activities endorsed by the DG concerned. We are encouraging each DG to identify projects relating to their areas of competence. Staff volunteering in these projects can request one day or two half-days of special leave using a new \u2018Volunteering\u2019 tab in the Special Leave section of Sysper. Each applicant must specify the type of activity, the organisation involved and the name of three (or more) other staff members also volunteering in the same activity. A proof of participation will be required. This is quite a new approach, so we will be keeping a close eye on take-up. Why can\u2019t staff use the leave for a volunteering activity of their own choice? Individual volunteering is an unpaid private initiative, done on your own time, and according to your own interests. As long as it does not impinge on your work and is consistent with Commission rules (in particu- lar ethics rules related to outside activities) then it is largely a matter for the individual. Employer-sponsored volunteering, on the other hand, refers to volunteer- ing activities organised or authorised by the employer in line with specific organisation values and business objectives. Can you give some examples of how DGs can identify suitable projects? There are many ways in which volunteering activities can be aligned with a DG\u2019s interests. Just to give an idea of the range of possibilities, in DG MARE, a group of staff have taken the initiative to participate in a beach cleaning exercise on the Belgian coast. Colleagues work- ing on education and training might support children with poor literacy skills in schools. Another approach is to focus on the local community. The JRC\u2019s Recruitment and Training Unit in Ispra organised a unit team build- ing event for 40 colleagues around an environmental project to clean up, together with the local community, a stretch of the local lake shore. DG SANTE colleagues in Grange, Ireland, recognising the benefits for them- selves and their families of better community links in their location, got together over a weekend with local community volunteers to organise a sports open day on site for local children. Where can people find more information? A new website providing information on the volun- teering initiative has launched (see link below), and HR colleagues have been briefed on the new leave ar- rangements. There is a link from the website to a web platform allowing staff to post and exchange informa- tion on volunteering experiences, and there will be a series of info sessions on volunteering in the run up to the summer. This is just the start \u2013 we are working with many partners in the DGs, Trade Unions and staff chari- ties to develop our volunteering framework further.

Ensuite on transmettait la co- pie scann\u00e9e par e-mail. Puis l\u2019original partait par valise diplomatique.

Pour mener \u00e0 bien ce projet, 5 services ont uni leurs efforts et leurs expertises: le SG, en tant que responsable de la politique e-Domec (politique de gestion docu- mentaire), la DIGIT pour le support technique, le SEAE comme chef de file de la famille des relations ext\u00e9rieures ainsi que DEVCO et NEAR en tant que DG de tutelles des sections coop\u00e9rations en d\u00e9l\u00e9gation.

L\u2019appropriation d\u2019ARES par le personnel fut bien le d\u00e9fi majeur de la migration des d\u00e9l\u00e9gations. Si vous demandez \u00e0 un coll\u00e8gue s\u2019il classe convena- blement les documents qu\u2019il produit et g\u00e8re, la r\u00e9ponse sera syst\u00e9matiquement affirmative. Nous avons tous, en effet, envie de pouvoir retrouver rapidement l\u2019infor- mation dont nous avons besoin. Par contre, si vous analysez o\u00f9 et comment les documents sont conserv\u00e9s, vous constaterez rapidement qu\u2019il y a autant de sys- t\u00e8mes de classement que d\u2019\u00eatres humains, et cela pose \u00e9videmment probl\u00e8me \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle d\u2019une organisation internationale. La migration des d\u00e9l\u00e9gations vers ARES, cela a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de convaincre plus de 5 000 personnes d\u2019abandonner leurs propres syst\u00e8mes de classement (drives partag\u00e9s, dossiers papier, dossiers personnels dans Outlook...) au profit d\u2019une application commune permettant de construire ensemble la m\u00e9moire vivante de nos institutions. Pour ce faire, il a fallu mettre en avant les nom- breuses am\u00e9liorations apport\u00e9es par ARES telles que la transmission instantan\u00e9e des documents aux destinataires internes, la validation \u00e9lectronique de documents officiels ou encore la facilit\u00e9 de partage de l\u2019information et des dossiers entre sections, d\u00e9l\u00e9- gations et institutions. 6 \u00e9tapes pour entrer dans le cyber\u00e2ge Pour accompagner ce changement, nous avons veill\u00e9 \u00e0 impliquer tout le personnel des d\u00e9l\u00e9gations: secr\u00e9- taires, gestionnaires de projets, chefs de sections et chefs de d\u00e9l\u00e9gations. Nous avons ainsi d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un plan d\u2019actions en 6 \u00e9tapes: \u2022 nomination dans chaque d\u00e9l\u00e9gation d\u2019une \u00e9quipe DMO (Document Management Officer), \u2022 r\u00e9unions de lancement par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence avec le management de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation, \u2022 formation des DMO \u00e0 ARES et NomCom lors de s\u00e9mi- naires r\u00e9gionaux regroupant chaque fois une dizaine de d\u00e9l\u00e9gations, \u2022 formations \u00e0 ARES par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence destin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble du personnel, \u2022 sensibilisation du management de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation \u00e0 l\u2019importance de la gestion documentaire, \u2022 campagnes de communication pour faire de chaque migration un \u00e9v\u00e8nement.

En route vers le futur Maintenant que l\u2019ensemble des d\u00e9l\u00e9gations utilisent ARES, il est temps de tirer un premier bilan. Avons-nous r\u00e9ussi le pari de moderniser et d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la gestion des documents en d\u00e9l\u00e9gation? En guise de r\u00e9ponse voici quelques chiffres: \u2022 5 075 personnes utilisent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ARES en d\u00e9l\u00e9gation, \u2022 les d\u00e9l\u00e9gations ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 enregistr\u00e9 756 827 documents officiels dans ARES, \u2022 en moyenne, 84% des documents enregistr\u00e9s par les d\u00e9l\u00e9gations sont class\u00e9s dans ARES ce qui garantit leur pr\u00e9servation et accessibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme. Cette r\u00e9ussite est attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019excellente collaboration interservices (EEAS, DEVCO, NEAR, DIGIT, SG), \u00e0 la stabilit\u00e9 d\u2019ARES mais surtout \u00e0 l\u2019engagement et au pro- fessionnalisme du personnel travaillant en d\u00e9l\u00e9gation.

Maintenant que la Commission, les Agences ex\u00e9cutives, le SEAE et les d\u00e9l\u00e9gations utilisent le m\u00eame outil de ges- tion documentaire, il est temps de passer \u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape, celle de la simplification et de l\u2019harmonisation des pratiques.

        "52 AU QUOTIDIEN A hackathon \u2013 also known as a hack day \u2013 is an event which brings together developers, designers, and other people involved in software development, to collaborate intensively on ideas related to a specific theme and produce a prototype of a software solution in just a day. HACKATHON@DIGIT INNOVATION IN PRACTICE by Denislava Simeonova , DG DIGIT T he idea of a hackathon in the Commission was inspired by the ICT 2014: Digital Now! conference organised by DG DIGIT in 2014. The pilot Hackathon@DIGIT was a first test of the idea before preparing for a bigger hackathon. The goal was to explore the hackathon as a new way for finding innovative solutions to existing problems, developing knowledge sharing and testing new tools, collaborating across units and directorates in both an efficient and creative way, and increasing engagement of software developers. Hackathon@DIGIT was endorsed by DG DIGIT management. A transparent process of suggesting and voting for the projects was set up and implemented by the teams on the hackathon day and a dedicated Wiki page kept a track record of all steps \u2013 starting from the development of the idea (rules, organisation of the event, and prizes), the selection and voting for the projects, the creation of the teams, and the projects\u2019 development. The theme chosen was \u2018Mobile\u2019 \u2013 that is, develop- ing an app that would work on mobile platforms. Par- ticipants spent eight hours together one Saturday and came up with four app prototypes: one to easily locate Commission buildings, another to know about free park- ing spots in our garages in real time, a third to check the canteen menus and how busy they are, and a last one dedicated to newcomers. These mobile apps were presented to DGs who might be interested in investing further in their development. In particular, the parking app will probably be tested by DG DIGIT when it moves to a new open space building later this year. The event was a success and paved the way for a wider hackathon taking place in June 2016, this time supported by more EU Institutions. (cid:2) What did you like most about the Hackathon event? Nikolaos Kyriazopoulos-Panagiotopoulos Participating in the Hackathon was one of those \u2018we can do it!\u2019 moments. It was where the personal and professional spaces met, where fun and sharing led to a change in the way we work together. Christine Dell\u2019Osso The Hackathon was a great experience to work with colleagues with different backgrounds. Everybody was very concentrated in finalising the project within the day, and the enthusiasm went way beyond the hackathon day.

A place with answers to basic questions, like \u2018What does this regulation do?\u2019 and \u2018From when does the regulation apply?\u2019 It\u2019s called \u2018Summaries of EU leg- islation\u2019 (see link below) and it\u2019s published on EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law. The summaries are written for a general, non-spe- cialised audience, and the guidelines are clear: the texts must be easy to read, simple and concise, and stay away from EU and legal jargon. The summaries cover 32 topics corresponding to the activities of the European Union. There are chapters like \u2018Environment and climate change\u2019, \u2018Food safety\u2019 or \u2018Budget\u2019. The main page gives an overview of the recent- ly published summaries, and permits users to launch a quick or advanced search based on keywords, dates or topics, for instance. Another possibility is searching through the glossary of more than 230 terms \u2013 if you look for \u2018Joint undertakings\u2018 or \u2018Unanimity\u2019, for exam- ple, you will easily find them in the glossary. You can also look for summaries on the EUR-Lex website right next to the legal acts (if a summary exists for this act, the page will contain a special tab called \u2018Summary of legislation\u2019). At present there are over 2,500 summaries (plus about 1,600 archived ones), and each month around 40 summaries are added or revised. They are available in 24 official EU languages. The collection of the sum- maries is disseminated only online. The summaries are also promoted on the social media platforms of the Publications Office (see links below). A joint effort The aim is not simply to promote the summaries, but also to receive feedback and engage with the audience. Users may comment on the summaries and propose changes to a specific summary or the entire collection. Publishing \u2018Summaries of EU legislation\u2019 is an inter- institutional project. It\u2019s co-financed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and managed by the Publications Office. All the EU Institu- tions contribute to the project by verifying that the con- tent is complete, legally correct and up to date. So, if you want to better understand a legal act \u2013 or help someone to understand it \u2013 start by exploring the summaries and let them become your compass to EU law.

SERVICE AUDIOVISUEL SOUVENIRS D\u2019UNE NAISSANCE par Dominique Labourdette , CEND GENERATIONS Comment a d\u00e9but\u00e9 votre carri\u00e8re au Service audiovisuel? En octobre 1965, lorsque j\u2019ai rejoint le Service audio- visuel, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un service technique au sein d\u2019un service administratif de la Commission. Les monteurs qui acceptaient de travailler pour les Communaut\u00e9s pr\u00e9f\u00e9- raient utiliser leur propre mat\u00e9riel alors que la Commis- sion disposaient des installations n\u00e9cessaires. De mon c\u00f4t\u00e9, j\u2019\u00e9tais d\u00e9j\u00e0 monteuse \u00e0 la RTB et, comme je ne poss\u00e9dais aucun \u00e9quipement, travailler sur le mat\u00e9riel de la Commission revenait pour moi au m\u00eame. En 1965, j\u2019ai donc d\u00e9but\u00e9 comme monteuse free lance, puis je suis devenue fonctionnaire en 1975 et j\u2019ai fait toute ma carri\u00e8re dans ce m\u00eame service que j\u2019ai quitt\u00e9 en 1989. Parlez-nous de la toute premi\u00e8re \u00e9quipe... C\u2019\u00e9tait une toute petite \u00e9quipe. Nous \u00e9tions install\u00e9s \u00e0 la Joyeuse Entr\u00e9e et monsieur Monnom, un Fran- \u00e7ais qui venait de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision luxembourgeoise, avait \u00abconstruit\u00bb les studios radio et t\u00e9l\u00e9. Il y avait aussi le cam\u00e9raman Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Daffix. Les deux constituaient le noyau dur de l\u2019\u00e9quipe en 1965. Un technicien de prise de son s\u2019occupait de la r\u00e9gie sonore pour la radio et la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, lui aussi venait de la RTB. Il y avait aussi Jean-Paul Lieffrig, arriv\u00e9 deux mois avant moi, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 pour l\u2019exploitation de la production. La pre- mi\u00e8re fois que je l\u2019ai vu, il \u00e9tait assis dans son bureau o\u00f9 il y avait une \u00e9tag\u00e8re avec quelques bo\u00eetes de film et c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e7a la base des archives. Au total, nous \u00e9tions moins de dix et l\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t francophone. Ru- dolf Dumont du Voitel \u00e9tait alors chef de cette division \u00abRadio, t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, cin\u00e9ma\u00bb. A l\u2019\u00e9poque, le Berlaymont \u00e9tait en construction et la salle de r\u00e9union du coll\u00e8ge et les bureaux des commis- saires \u2013 seulement six \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u2013 \u00e9taient \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de notre service. Parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 mon activit\u00e9 de monteuse, j\u2019\u00e9tais maquilleuse. J\u2019avais fait un stage \u00e0 la RTB pour ap- prendre le maquillage car nous avions des personnes originaires d\u2019Asie, d\u2019Afrique et d\u2019Europe. Il fallait aussi savoir corriger les d\u00e9fauts des personnalit\u00e9s que l\u2019on fil- mait: certains transpiraient beaucoup, d\u2019autres avaient toujours le col couvert de pellicules... Outre les studios, nous avions aussi une salle de projection en 16 et 35 mm qui accueillait des \u00e9coliers, des \u00e9tudiants, des universitaires, ou des groupes de visiteurs qui assistaient \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences organis\u00e9es par le bureau de Bruxelles. Quels types de productions audiovisuelles avez-vous mont\u00e9es?

        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 57 Et pour les \u00e9v\u00e8nements? J\u2019ai beaucoup de souvenirs... Je me rappelle en parti- culier de l\u2019adh\u00e9sion de la Gr\u00e8ce en 1981. Nous avons tourn\u00e9 10 000 m\u00e8tres de pellicule en Gr\u00e8ce. Nous avons d\u00fb tirer de cet immense m\u00e9trage un sujet de seulement 20 mn, des images sans commentaires qui permettaient \u00e0 toutes les t\u00e9l\u00e9visions d\u2019avoir un mat\u00e9riel pour parler de ce nouvel Etat membre. Les m\u00e8tres de pellicule non utilis\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 archiv\u00e9s pour d\u2019autres manifestations et le sujet de 20 mn a \u00e9t\u00e9 principalement utilis\u00e9 le jour de l\u2019entr\u00e9e de la Gr\u00e8ce. Comment avez-vous v\u00e9cu certains moments importants de l\u2019histoire europ\u00e9enne? En 1972, au moment de l\u2019adh\u00e9sion de la Grande-Bre- tagne, Alan Watson \u00e9tait chef de l\u2019unit\u00e9 1 \u00abAudio-vi- suel\u00bb de la DG X \u00abInformation\u00bb. Il nous a r\u00e9unis pour nous donner des recommandations: nous devions por- ter une petite robe noire, \u00eatre pr\u00e9sentable, bien se tenir... Tout le monde \u00e9tait l\u00e0, membres de service audiovisuel, journalistes, personnalit\u00e9s... il y avait m\u00eame un joueur de cornemuse. Mais tout le monde \u2013 aussi bien la hi\u00e9- rarchie que les coll\u00e8gues \u2013 avait oubli\u00e9 une chose... A minuit tapantes, heure de l\u2019entr\u00e9e de la Grande-Bre- tagne, personne n\u2019avait ni mang\u00e9 ni bu quoi que ce soit depuis 24 heures car la cuisine \u00e9tait dans un autre b\u00e2timent que le n\u00f4tre. Je me souviens aussi d\u2019un jour de 1976. Patrick Hil- lery, qui \u00e9tait le premier commissaire irlandais, \u00e9tait en visionnage dans ma salle de montage, avec son chef de cabinet. Le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone sonne, on arr\u00eate la projection, je d\u00e9croche et quelqu\u2019un demande \u00e0 parler \u00e0 M. Hillery. Il prend la communication, \u00e9coute, raccroche et se ras- soit, tout cela en silence. On lui dit : \u00abVous avez appris une mauvaise nouvelle, M. Hillery ? \u2013 Non, r\u00e9pond-il, je viens d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9lu pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Irlande\u00bb. Pour le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Jean Monnet, en 1979, j\u2019\u00e9tais ma- lade mais je me suis dit qu\u2019il fallait absolument aller travailler. Il a fallu pr\u00e9parer des montages pour deux Eurovision, le plus grand format \u2013 15 mn de film avec la shotlist \u2013 pour treize heures; le second format de 10 mn pour quinze heures. J\u2019\u00e9tais tellement mal en point que mon coll\u00e8gue M. Haudebeau a pass\u00e9 son temps \u00e0 faire des aller-retours avec des bobines entre la salle de montage et le local d\u2019archives qui se trouvait en face. Comment a \u00e9volu\u00e9 votre travail au fil de presque trente ans de carri\u00e8re? J\u2019ai vu l\u2019arriv\u00e9e du montage num\u00e9rique mais, pour ma part, je n\u2019y suis jamais pass\u00e9. J\u2019\u00e9tais tellement sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans le film que je suis rest\u00e9e sur le travail sur pellicule. Je travaillais avec des gants de cotton notamment pour les films que je montais en n\u00e9gatif. C\u2019est un travail tr\u00e8s tactile et il faut avoir un sens artistique pour le montage. Jean-Paul Lieffrig, dont je vous ai parl\u00e9 en d\u00e9but d\u2019entretien, pr\u00e9sentait nos films dans diff\u00e9rentes mani- festations et, dans les ann\u00e9es 1970, nous avons re\u00e7u un prix Femina Belge du cin\u00e9ma pour un film sur les femmes et la traduction. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une vingtaine de minutes d\u2019entretiens avec le service de traduction de l\u2019\u00e9poque qui pr\u00e9sentait les modes de recrutement du personnel traducteur.

        "# A v r i l - M a i 2 0 1 6 59 The last edition of Commission en direct took a look at one of this year\u2019s European Capitals of Culture, Donostia/San Sebasti\u00e1n. This time, the spotlight turns to the other: the Polish city of Wroc\u0142aw. WROC\u0141AW (cid:2) EUROPEAN CAPITAL OF CULTURE 2016 A MEETING PLACE FOR CULTURAL EXCHANGE by Nilde Marchitto, CEND W roc\u0142aw is located in the Lower Silesia region, at the heart of Europe. Also known as \u2018the Venice of Poland\u2019, it is located on the Oder River as well as on 12 little islands, connected by 112 bridges. The city has historically been one of the major cross- roads of our continent. After the destruction and loss caused by the Second World War, it took almost 70 years to rebuild it from the ruins and create an open city, at ease with its German, Jewish and Polish heritage. Now Wroc\u0142aw is ready to share this historic and cultural heritage through a rich cultural programme \u2013 Wroc\u0142aw 2016, European Capital of Culture . Experiencing beauty \u2013 architecture and visual arts Around 400 cultural projects and more than 1,000 events will transform the city of Wroc\u0142aw into a dynamic cul- tural centre and a meeting place for both its residents and visitors from all over Europe. The events cover eight different areas \u2013 architecture, film, literature, music, opera, visual arts, theatre, and performance. Among other things, numerous initiatives will value the beauty of the city. From December 2016, the exhibition \u201820th Century Wroc\u0142aw Architecture\u2019 will explore Wroc\u0142aw\u2019s architectural development without making distinctions between German and Polish heritage. \u2018Big A_Spaces for Beauty: Nature \u2013 Community \u2013 Architecture\u2019, a series of lectures and workshops held by European architects and urbanists all year long, will suggest ways to experi- ence beauty in Wroc\u0142aw during everyday life. Artistic visual interventions will also turn the city\u2019s architectural structures and public spaces into tourist attractions. For instance, murals by Stanis\u0142aw Dr\u00f3 \u017cd\u017c will adorn selected buildings as well as bus or tram stop areas in the centre of Wroc\u0142aw. Visual arts projects will also address the promotion of social inclusion. For example, till October 2016, the Kilo of Culture Foundation will involve people with mental disabilities, drug addicts, and homeless people in the photographic project \u2018I\u2019m myself\u2019. Then, an exhibition will focus public attention on the emotions, feelings and living conditions of those less fortunate. On stage \u2013 music, opera, theatre and performances Wroc\u0142aw will invite people from the four corners of Europe through a rich music programme. In April, a series of concerts by the Sound Factory Orchestra, in collaboration with groups from Iceland, Norway, Portu- gal and Spain, will resonate during \u2018The North and The South \u2013 Wroc\u0142aw the Meeting Place!\u2019 events. In June, a concert by David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and the Polish jazz pianist and music composer Leszek Mo \u017c d \u017c er will take place in Plac Wolno \u015b ci. Wroc\u0142aw theatres will also reach a wide public. While throughout the year the \u2018More than Theatre\u2019 projects will pay particular attention to people with disabilities through a series of plays, conferences and workshops, in May the \u2018International Meetings of Pup- petry Schools\u2019 will entertain numerous schools and their pupils with new and more technological puppetry spectacles. Classical opera masterpieces will also be on stage. In June, a \u2018Spanish night with Carmen \u2013 Zarzuela Show\u2019, ",
        "60 directed by the Chief Director of the Wroc\u0142aw Opera, will be held at the Wroc\u0142aw Stadium before an audience of 30,000. The show will see the collaboration among Polish and Spanish artists such as the Polish director Waldemar Zawodzi \u0144 ski and his Spanish colleague Ig- nacio Garc\u00eda, specialized in zarzuela productions \u2013 a type of Spanish musical theatre. Within the framework of the project \u2018Bridges\u2019, 27 Wroc\u0142aw bridges and footbridges will be turned into stages for numerous music and artistic performances, connecting the residents of Wroc\u0142aw and Lower Sile- sia. In June \u2018Coal Odyssey\u2019 \u2013 a sound and dance spec- tacle \u2013 will take place along the Osobowicki Bridge, on the R\u00f3 \u017c anka sluice, to recount the life of miners from different parts of Lower Silesia and their barges of coal. A story to tell \u2013 film and literature The complex history of the city and its region will also be represented through images and words. While the project \u2018Frames of Wroc\u0142aw\u2019 will show documentaries on Wroc\u0142aw and Lower Silesia since 1945, with records and photos coming from Polish, German, and Russian archives, the project \u2018Masters of European Cinema\u2019 will show the history and variety of cinematographic art in Europe through classic and more recent masterpieces. In April 2017, Wroc\u0142aw will also gain the title of World Capital of Books from UNESCO. The project \u2018Bib- liopolis. City as a Library\u2019 will transform the city into a huge library, engaging cultural institutions as well as citizens and visitors in reading activities. While bus and cars tagged with fragments of poetry will create a mov- ing poem across the city, different small and large-scale initiatives will introduce children and adults to books and reading. For instance, the project \u2018Wroc\u0142aw. World Book Capital City in the Eyes of Children\u2019 will invite children to share their experiences and stories while creating a book together, in the form of a blog. Attention will also be given to visually impaired readers. During \u2018Reading in the Dark\u2019 actors will read in complete darkness, so as to reach the widest audi- ence possible. In April, the \u2018Book Aid. World Book Anthem\u2019 project will start. A poem by the Polish poet Tadeusz R\u00f3 \u017c ewicz will be used as a lyric and source of inspiration for a book anthem arranged by musicians and compos- ers from Wroc\u0142aw, Lower Silesia and the rest of Eu- rope. Celebrations of culture in all its forms will reach their peak during the \u2018Sky Web\u2019 closing ceremony, the biggest artistic event, where the history of Wroc\u0142aw will be presented from the perspective of a modern Europe.
