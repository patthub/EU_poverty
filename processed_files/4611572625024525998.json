        "COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION of 9 July 2013 on the National Reform Programme 2013 of Italy and delivering a Council opinion on the Stability Programme of Italy, 2012-2017 (2013/C 217/11) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 121(2) and 148(4) thereof, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies ( 1 ), and in particular Article 5(2) thereof, Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances ( 2 ) and in particular Article 6(1) thereof, Having regard to the recommendation of the European Commission, Having regard to the conclusions of the European Council, Having regard to the opinion of the Employment Committee, Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee, Having regard to the opinion of the Social Protection Committee, Having regard to the opinion of the Economic Policy Committee, Whereas: (1) On 26 March 2010, the European Council agreed to the Commission\u2019s proposal to launch a new strategy for jobs and growth, Europe 2020, based on enhanced coor\u00ad dination of economic policies, which focuses on the key areas where action is needed to boost Europe\u2019s potential for sustainable growth and competitiveness. (2) On 13 July 2010, the Council adopted a recommen\u00ad dation on the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and the Union (2010 to 2014) and, on 21 October 2010, it adopted a decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States ( 3 ), which together form the \u2018integrated guidelines\u2019. Member States were invited to take the integrated guidelines into account in their national economic and employment policies. (3) On 29 June 2012, the Member States\u2019 Heads of State or Government decided on a Compact for Growth and Jobs, providing a coherent framework for action at national, EU and euro area levels using all possible levers, instruments and policies. They decided on action to be taken at the level of the Member States, in particular expressing full commitment to achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and to implementing the country-specific recommendations. (4) On 10 July 2012, the Council adopted a recommen\u00ad dation ( 4 ) on Italy\u2019s National Reform Programme for 2012 and delivered its opinion on Italy\u2019s Stability Programme for 2012-2015. (5) On 28 November 2012, the Commission adopted the Annual Growth Survey, marking the start of the 2013 European Semester of economic policy coordination. Also on 28 November 2012, the Commission, on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011, adopted the Alert Mechanism Report, in which it identified Italy as one of the Member States for which an in-depth review would be carried out. (6) The European Parliament has been duly involved in the European Semester, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1466/97, and, on 7 February 2013, adopted a resolution on employment and social aspects in the Annual Growth Survey 2013 and a resolution on the contribution to the Annual Growth Survey 2013. (7) On 14 March 2013, the European Council endorsed the priorities for ensuring financial stability, fiscal consoli\u00ad dation and action to foster growth. It underscored the need to pursue differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, to restore normal lending conditions to the economy, to promote growth and competitiveness, to tackle unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis, and to modernise public administration.

        "(8) On 10 April 2013, the Commission published the results of its in-depth review for Italy, under Article 5 of Regu\u00ad lation (EU) No 1176/2011. The Commission\u2019s analysis leads it to conclude that Italy is experiencing macro\u00ad economic imbalances, which require determined policy action. In particular, the loss of external competitiveness as well as high public indebtedness in an environment of protracted subdued growth continue to be identified as Italy\u2019s main macroeconomic imbalances. (9) On 11 April 2013, Italy submitted its 2013 National Reform Programme and its Stability Programme for the period 2012-2017. Following this submission, the new Government appointed on 28 April indicated the intention to strengthen the structural reform agenda, while confirming the budgetary targets put forward in the Stability Programme. On 17 May, a decree law was adopted containing new provisions on real estate taxation and the extension of the wage supplementation scheme for under-employed workers. In order to take account of their interlinkages, the two Programmes and the new measures taken by the Government have been assessed at the same time. (10) Based on the assessment of the Stability Programme pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1466/97, the Council is of the opinion that the macroeconomic scenario underpinning the budgetary projections in the Programme is optimistic for 2014, when compared with the Commission services 2013 spring forecast. That scenario is plausible as of 2015. However, this is under the assumption of the full implementation of the adopted structural reforms, which remains challenging. The budgetary strategy outlined in the Stability Programme was confirmed by the new Government and endorsed by Parliament. It aims at maintaining the deficit below the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value throughout the Programme period, reaching the medium-term objective (MTO) in 2013 and putting the debt to GDP ratio on a declining path as from 2014. The Stability Programme confirms the MTO of a balanced budgetary position in structural terms, which is in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. The deficit was brought to the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value in 2012 and, according to the Commission services 2013 spring forecast, it is expected to remain below the Treaty reference value in 2013-14. The provisions adopted by the Italian government on 17 May are assessed as having no significant impact on the deficit, if consistently imple\u00ad mented. As described in the Decision abrogating the excessive deficit procedure adopted by the Council on 21 June 2013, two safeguard clauses have been enacted in legislation to ensure the achievement of the budgetary targets. After improving by 2,7 percentage points of GDP in cumulative terms between 2009 and 2012, and assuming no further policy changes, the structural balance as a share of GDP is forecast to improve by a further percentage point in 2013, to -0,5 %, and then deteriorate marginally in 2014. The structural primary balance would reach nearly 5 % of GDP in 2014. The forecast structural adjustment for 2013 is appropriate, also based on an analysis of expen\u00ad diture net of discretionary revenue measures, while for 2014, on the basis of the Commission services 2013 spring forecast, it shows a deviation from the adjustment path towards the MTO. The Stability Programme projects the government debt ratio to peak in 2013 and to start declining thereafter, also thanks to foreseen privatisation proceeds amounting to 1 percentage point of GDP per year. In the forecast however, the debt to GDP ratio continues increasing to 132,2 % of GDP by 2014 on a no-policy change assumption, also due to the settlement of commercial debt, which adds around 2,5 percentage points over 2013-2014, while no privatisation proceeds are included as the details have not yet been specified. As of 2013, Italy is in a three-year transitional period regarding compliance with the debt criterion and the debt trajectory in the Stability Programme ensures sufficient progress towards compliance with it. However, the deficit and debt projections in the Stability Programme are predicated upon full implemen\u00ad tation of the budgetary measures and adoption of structural reforms, which are essential to anchor market confidence and boost growth and jobs. (11) While important reforms have been adopted to foster fiscal sustainability and to spur growth, their full imple\u00ad mentation remains a challenge and there is scope for further action. A number of key proposed measures have not yet been approved or still require enacting legis\u00ad lation and there are risks that their concrete application is not consistently followed up through all levels of government. Despite the action undertaken, public administration efficiency in terms of the regulatory and procedural framework, quality of governance and admin\u00ad istrative capacity, continue to suffer from weaknesses that affect the implementation of reforms and the business environment. (12) Completing the civil justice reform by swiftly imple\u00ad menting the revision of the courts\u2019 organisation and reducing the excessive duration of case-handling, court backlogs and the high level of litigation is necessary to improve the business environment. Following a Consti\u00ad tutional Court ruling on mediation in October 2012, action is needed to promote the use of out-of-court dispute-settlement mechanisms. Corruption represents a serious concern implying costs estimated at 4 % of GDP, which severely hinders the potential for economic recovery. The Anti-Corruption Law of November 2012 requires follow-up action, and the effectiveness of the repression of corruption could be further improved, in particular with regard to the statute of limitations currently characterised by short prescription terms. EN 30.7.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 217/43 ",
        "(13) The ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy enacted so far has been accompanied by the introduction of a balanced budget rule in the Constitution in April 2012 and action to improve the efficiency and quality of public expen\u00ad diture. However, gaps in implementation have hampered the full effectiveness of the action taken. Political stalemate has blocked the necessary reduction of the number of provinces. The Cohesion Action Plan made it possible to speed up the absorption of structural funds accounting for about EUR 11,9 billion in three consecutive phases. Nevertheless, the improvement of the overall management of funds continues to lack ambition especially in the South of Italy raising serious concerns in view of the 2014-2020 programming period. This leaves ample scope for enhancing the effi\u00ad ciency of public expenditure. (14) Banks traditionally play a decisive role in supporting Italian economic activity, notably through lending to small firms, but their ability to take on this role has been weakened due to the prolonged economic recession. Increased credit risk, with a large and rising stock of non- performing loans, has contributed to a contraction in lending and exacerbates the banks\u2019 low profitability. In response, the Bank of Italy is assessing the adequacy of provisioning for impaired loans with on-site inspections. Specific corporate governance features of some Italian banks may limit the effectiveness of their financial inter\u00ad mediation. Measures were adopted to encourage the use of non-bank financing channels, in particular equity financing and corporate bond financing, and to foster innovation capacity, but their scope remains limited and they have not yet been fully implemented. The trans\u00ad position of Directive 2000/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on combating late payment in commercial transactions ( 1 ) and the planned settlement of the accumulated stock of commercial debt will contribute to improving the liquidity of firms. (15) A wide-ranging labour-market reform was adopted in June 2012, addressing the rigidities and segmentation of the labour market. The reform needs to be completed by adopting pending implementing legislation and its concrete operationalisation on the ground, carefully monitored. Moreover, public employment services have yet to be integrated with the unemployment benefit administration to support the implementation of efficient activation strategies. A new wage-setting framework was defined by social partners in successive agreements over 2011-2013. It is supported by tax incentives to foster better alignment of wages with productivity and with local labour-market conditions. This framework should be effectively implemented and progressively adjusted on the basis of the monitoring of results. (16) Youth unemployment and the proportion of young people not in employment, education or training continued to increase, reaching 37 % and 21,1 % respectively by the end of 2012. Both the tertiary education attainment and the employment rate for young tertiary graduates are the lowest in the Union, which shows that the skills of young graduates are not properly aligned to job market requirements. Although moderately declining, early school leaving remains high. This raises concerns as regards the performance of the education system. One of the key elements in this regard is the teaching profession, which is currently char\u00ad acterised by a single career pathway and offers limited prospects in terms of professional development. The participation of women in the labour market remains weak and the employment gender gap is one of the highest in the Union. The risk of poverty and social exclusion, and in particular severe material deprivation, are markedly on the rise, while the social protection system has increasing difficulties coping with social needs since it is dominated by pension expenditure. (17) The structure of the tax system remains complex and weighs heavily on labour and capital. After the effort undertaken in 2010-2011, additional measures adopted to shift the tax burden from the productive factors onto consumption, property and the environment have been more limited. Action is still needed to simplify the tax system, streamline tax expenditures, align the property tax base with market values, enhance compliance and discourage evasion. Pending a revision of cadastral values, the envisaged reform of real estate taxation will aim at improving its fairness, within the constraints of the budgetary strategy laid out in the Stability Programme. Reducing the shadow economy and unde\u00ad clared work can benefit public finances and have positive implications for equity. The review of VAT exemptions or reduced rates and of direct tax expenditures may require some adjustment in social transfers to minimise its distributional impact. (18) Notable efforts have been made towards liberalisation in the services sector. However, the reform of regulated professions should be taken further to address remaining restrictions, and its key principles should be safeguarded against possible setbacks, particularly stemming from the reform of the legal profession. Following the ruling of the Constitutional Court in July 2012, action to open local public services to competition is also important. Following up on proposals from the Italian Competition Authority as foreseen by the Italian legislation will help address these issues. EN C 217/44 Official Journal of the European Union 30.7.2013 ( 1 ) OJ L 200, 8.8.2000, p. 35. ",
        "(19) The reform of the network industries is ongoing in terms of opening market access and improving infrastructure capacity but important challenges remain. The unbundling in the gas sector is nearly completed and the March 2013 National Strategy for Energy needs to be further pursued. Opening telecommunications to competition is a further potential field of action. The new transport authority responsible for highways, airports, ports and railways has not yet been set up. It should be independent, supplied with the resources it needs to function and have powers to sanction. There is also a serious problem of internal and cross-border shortcomings in infrastructure, with North-South dispar\u00ad ities, contributing to high energy prices, low broadband penetration and transport bottlenecks. (20) In the context of the European Semester, the Commission has carried out a comprehensive analysis of Italy\u2019s economic policy. It has assessed the National Reform Programme and Stability Programme and presented an in-depth review. It has taken into account not only their relevance for sustainable fiscal and socioe\u00ad conomic policy in Italy, but also their compliance with EU rules and guidance, given the need to reinforce the overall economic governance of the Union by providing EU-level input into future national decisions. Its recom\u00ad mendations under the European Semester are reflected in recommendations (1) to (6) below. (21) In the light of this assessment, the Council has examined the Stability Programme, and its opinion ( 1 ) is reflected in particular in recommendation (1) below. (22) In the light of the Commission\u2019s in-depth review and this assessment, the Council has examined the National Reform Programme and the Stability Programme. Its recommendations under Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 are reflected in recommendations (1) to (6) below. (23) In the context of the European Semester the Commission has also carried out an analysis of the economic policy of the euro area as a whole. On this basis, the Council has issued specific recommendations addressed to the Member States whose currency is the euro ( 2 ). As a country whose currency is the euro, Italy should also ensure the full and timely implementation of those recommendations, HEREBY RECOMMENDS that Italy take action within the period 2013-2014 to: 1. Ensure that the deficit remains below the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value in 2013, by fully implementing the adopted measures. Pursue the structural adjustment at an appropriate pace and through growth-friendly fiscal consolidation so as to achieve and maintain the MTO as from 2014. Achieve the planned structural primary surpluses in order to put the very high debt-to-GDP ratio on a steadily declining path. Continue pursuing a durable improvement of the efficiency and quality of public expenditure by fully implementing the measures adopted in 2012 and taking the effort forward through regular in depth spending reviews at all levels of government. 2. Ensure timely implementation of on-going reforms by swiftly adopting the necessary enacting legislation, following it up with concrete delivery at all levels of government and with all relevant stakeholders, and moni\u00ad toring their impact. Reinforce the efficiency of public admin\u00ad istration and improve coordination between layers of government. Simplify the administrative and regulatory framework for citizens and business and reduce the duration of case-handling and the high levels of litigation in civil justice, including by fostering out-of-court settlement procedures. Strengthen the legal framework for the repression of corruption, including by revising the rules governing limitation periods. Adopt structural measures to improve the management of EU funds in the southern regions with regard to the 2014-2020 programming period. 3. Extend good corporate governance practices to the whole banking sector conducive to higher efficiency and profit\u00ad ability to support the flow of credit to productive activities. Take forward the ongoing work as regards asset-quality screening across the banking sector and facilitate the resolution of non-performing loans on banks\u2019 balance sheets. Promote further the development of capital markets to diversify and enhance firms\u2019 access to finance, especially into equity, and in turn foster their innovation capacity and growth. 4. Ensure the effective implementation of the labour-market and wage-setting reforms to allow better alignment of wages to productivity. Take further action to foster labour- market participation, especially of women and young people, for example through a Youth Guarantee. Strengthen voca\u00ad tional education and training, ensure more efficient public employment services and improve career and counselling services for tertiary students. Reduce financial disincentives for second earners to work and improve the provision of care, especially child- and long-term care, and out-of-school services. Step up efforts to prevent early school leaving. Improve school quality and outcomes, also by enhancing teachers\u2019 professional development and diversifying career development. Ensure the effectiveness of social transfers, notably through better targeting of benefits, especially for low-income households with children.

        "5. Shift the tax burden from labour and capital to consumption, property and the environment in a budgetary neutral manner. To this purpose, review the scope of VAT exemptions and reduced rates and of direct tax expenditures, and reform the cadastral system to align the tax base of recurrent immovable property to market values. Pursue the fight against tax evasion, improve tax compliance and take decisive steps against the shadow economy and undeclared work. 6. Ensure the proper implementation of the measures aimed at market opening in the services sector. Remove remaining restrictions in professional services and foster market access, for instance, in the provision of local public services where the use of public procurement should be advanced, instead of direct concessions. Pursue the deployment of measures taken to improve market access conditions in network industries, in particular by setting up the Transport Authority as a priority. Upgrade infra\u00ad structure capacity with a focus on energy interconnections, intermodal transport and high-speed broadband in telecom\u00ad munications, also with a view to tackling the North-South disparities.
