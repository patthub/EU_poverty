        "1 INTRODUCTION Cohesion policy will be delivered through 12 operational programmes, including \uf0b7 4 thematic OPs: 'Competitiveness & Internationalization' (co-financed by ERDF, ESF and Cohesion Fund); 'Human Capital' and 'Social Inclusion & Employment' (co-financed by ESF); Sustainable Development & Efficient Use of Natural Resources (co-financed by the Cohesion Fund); \uf0b7 5 Regional OPs : Norte; Centro; Alentejo; Lisboa; and Algarve (co-financed by - financed by ERDF and ESF); \uf0b7 1 technical assistance OP (co-financed by ERDF). \uf0b7 3 Rural Development OPs: mainland Portugal; Azores; and Madeira - (co- financed by EAFRD) \uf0b7 1 OP for Fisheries and the Sea (co-financed by EMFF). In total \u20ac 25,632,715,983 is allocated to ESIF, of which \u20ac 7,543,112,269 available as ESF budget, including ESF allocations for the youth employment initiative and TA (without ESF share YEI and TA it is \u20ac 7.257.506.701). 1 The ESF contributions amount to app. 41%of total structural funds (ERDF+ESF, including YEI) and 29,4% of total ESIF. With this the country complies with the request that Member States that the share of the ESF as a percentage of total combined resources for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund at Union level in Member States is not less than 23,1 %. The aim of this report is to provide an overview of the ESF implementation approach in Portugal in the period 2014-2020. It analyses the strategic orientation (relationship between EU 2020 targets and country challenges), the strategic choices of the country in the ESIF framework (selection of thematic objectives/investment priorities), the financial allocation (concentration on TO and relative share of total Cohesion Policy spending) and the Intervention Logic and result definition (relationship between Investment Priorities, specific objectives, activities, and output and result indicators). The Country factsheets are drawn up based on information extracted from an online database that was developed for the purpose of this study. This database stores quantitative and qualitative information from the 28 Partnership Agreements (PA) and all 184 ESF (mono and multi-fund) Operational Programmes (OP) 2 across the 28 Member States (excluding three Technical Assistance Operational Programmes in France, Greece and Spain). Quantitative information mostly refers to financial allocation to OPs and Investment Priorities (always considering EU funding), target and baseline values of indicators; while qualitative/descriptive information refers to text entries (either extracted directly from the OP such as for the description of specific objectives, actions and target groups , or in the form of justification of assessment scores). All qualitative information in the database was standardised according common categories, called \u201cID categories\u201d , allowing aggregation of data at the country and EU 28 level. Information was collected (and also categorised according pre-defined ID categories) on the following features of each PA and OP: \uf0b7 Issues/challenges as expressed in the CSR and CPP (qualitative information; 17 standard categories); 1 These figures are reported in the Partnership Agreement. 2 Latest OP version available on SFC2014 by September 2015 ",

In order to ensure a homogeneous and transparent assessment across different MS and OPs, ordinal (likert) scales have been developed for categorising and \u201cranking\u201d various types of assessments of the intervention logic of the OP (from \u201cnot at all\u201d, \u201clittle\u201d, \u201csomewhat\u201d, to \u201cvery\u201d coherent). Every assessment score made by the expert was accompanied by a descriptive entry justifying the attributed score, allowing consistency checks across all assessments made. All the above categories and definitions are presented in Annex 1. The database was completed by Country experts on the basis of a note providing step by step guidance on the data to be collected (including reference to specific sections/tables of the OPs, and categories of information). Country experts received ad hoc support by the Core Team during the data entering phase (including answers to Frequently Asked Questions). Database entries were further quality checked by the Core Team on the basis of the justifications provided by Country experts and following an iterative process of fine-tuning and standardisation of information. In the Annex to this report a methodological note is included providing information on how data for this report have been gathered and allocated to common categories and the criteria upon which assessments have been made on the external and internal coherence of the Operational Programmes. 3 regardless of its allocation to one or more Priority Axes within the same OP ",
        "3 1. SUMMARY \uf0b7 Challenges: According to the Country Specific `Recommendation in 2013 Portugal faces enormous challenges with high unemployment rates, and especially for the long term unemployed and young people. With regards to young people, the main challenges include weak outreach to non-registered young people, and a need to better align education and training with labour market needs. Furthermore, there is a need to tackle labour market segmentation and improve the responsiveness of wages to the economic conditions. Another challenge is the reduction of person living at risk of poverty. In 2010, one out of four Portuguese citizens lived at risk of poverty. The current economic and social crisis, lack of economic growth, rising unemployment and austerity measures taken in the context of the fiscal adjustment process, create higher risk of poverty and social exclusion. With regard the education sector, Portugal is facing a high rate of early school leavers and drop outs. Moreover, the working population, still face a low percentage of persons having tertiary education and there is a low participation in lifelong learning activities hampering the employability and adaptability of adult workers. Furthermore, a mismatch between education/training systems and labour market demand is reported. At last, some of the envisaged reform measures regarding the rationalisation and modernisation of public administration still need to be completed and transparency should be improved \uf0b7 External coherence of the ESF related OPS: IPs across OPs mostly address the challenge of access to employment for job seekers and inactive people, including long term unemployed and people far from the labour market and labour mobility. Another challenges that is often addressed by IPs is improving access to quality education and training (ECEC, primary, secondary and tertiary education). Challenges that are addressed by a limited number of IPs are those related to improving lifelong learning (adult learning) for all age groups by providing flexible learning pathways, guidance and APL; labour market situation of women, social economy and social services, access to employment of young people, and self-employment and entrepreneurship. Strikingly is that a limited number of IP address youth unemployment, despite of the emphasize given to youth unemployment in the CSR. This limited number of IP related to this challenge is explained by the fact that the YEI is part of the national thematic programme: Social Inclusion and Employment programme. Most IPs clearly address one of the specific needs as identified in the CSR. Only a small number of IP is not specifically addressing a challenge. This concerns the IP that address gender inequality and community led development (gender equality is not specifically addressed by the strategic documents, just like community led local development). \uf0b7 Allocation and concentration of budget: Portugal has a total of \u20ac 7,418,278,870 available as ESF budget, including ESF allocations for the youth employment initiative (without YEI it is \u20ac7.257.506.701). Analysing the distribution and concentration of budget between IP on national level and OP level one see that the national OP on Human Capital and Social Inclusion and Employment are the largest ESF programmes, and to a lesser extent the OP for Competitiveness and Internationalization. The regional OP receives between the 94 (Algarve Region) and 583 million Euro (North Region).Most budget is invested in IP 10iv (1.38 billion euros), mainly in the national Human Capital programme. A second largest expenditure targets IP 10ii (1.15 billion Euro). IP 9i and 8v follow with 875 million and 832 million). Less budget is allocated to IP 8iii, 8IV, 8Vii, 9iii, 9v, 9vi, and 11ii. Looking in more detail in the division of budget across the IP within an OP, one see differences between the different OPs. In total 1,639,790,000 is allocated to the IP related to social inclusion (TO9). On national level this is 21.5% of the total ESF budget (with ESF contribution to YEI), a few percentages above the requested 20% in ESF regulation. Up to 67,3 % of the ESF budget on national level is allocated to the ",
        "4 five largest investment priorities (total 4,989,000,000 Euro). Looking on the concentration of ESF allocation per OP one see that one average 84,6% of ESF budget is allocated to the five largest IP (with a maximum of 100% for the OP for Competitiveness and Internationalisation and the OP Human Capital; and a minimum of 71,3% for the OP for the Algarve region). \uf0b7 Intervention logic and internal coherence : A large part of the thematic objectives effectively narrows down the scope of the OP of the IP and fully / partly captures the (direction of the) change which the MS seeks to achieve, and is almost specific enough to quantitatively evaluated. At the same time, for a relative large share of SO it was indicated that the specific objective is not very specific, but captures the direction of the change is almost specific enough to quantitatively evaluate. A number of actions are frequently selected across OPs like the training of vocational skills of participants and basic skills training. Also work experience places (traineeships) for individuals are often selected. Still a large group of other types of actions are selected by many OPs. With regards actions related to entities, IPs mostly address actions related to skills and competences development of institutions, operators and stakeholders and to a lesser extent actions to develop new programmes, tools and instruments. Moreover, awareness raising programmes is also an often mentioned action. IPs belonging to TO 8, 9 and 10 most of the time address more actions related to individuals, while IPs related to TO11 are mostly addressing entities. Generally, the actions proposed link very well to the specific objectives. Overall, the majority of output indicators and result indicators show a clear alignment with the actions and specific objectives selected. Limited alignment is reported only in the few cases where indicators only measure a part of the SO, or those indicators that do not specify the target group, those indicators that are too generic, or indicators that are not possible to measure at all (like whether person kept their job due to participation), or indicators that are based on self-assessment of participants. \uf0b7 Programme performance: ESF is targeting a large group of employed people, including the self-employed (around 1,706,574 persons) and the unemployed, including the long term unemployed (around 1,350,466 persons). Also a large group of disadvantaged people are reached (around 907,394 persons). The OPs in Portugal focus on a limited number of type of result indicators, namely participants gaining a qualification upon leaving; Participants in employment, including self-employment, six months after leaving; and result indicator related to improved capacity/competence of Institutions/Organisations. Almost all result indicators are measured in percentages. \uf0b7 Special themes: All the special themes are addressed in the challenges identified and are reflected in the PA. The themes are all addressed by the OPs (only young people in just a few OPs, including one national OP on social inclusion and employment financed by the YEI). ",

        "10 3. COHERENCE BETWEEN CHALLENGES AND SELECTED ESF PRIORITIES IN PORTUGAL 3.1 Challenges for Portugal As the table below shows, Portugal is far away of achieving the Europe 2020 and national targets. Although Portugal is getting close to the employment rate of 70%, it is lagging behind on the indicators on early school leaving and the percentage of 30- 34 years old completing tertiary or equivalent education. There is also still a big gap between the current reduction of people in or at risk of poverty and the target number. Table 2 Performance in Europe 2020 targets Europe 2020 ESF headline targets Baseline value Europe 2020 indicators (as indicated in the PA, chapter 1.1 National 2020 target in the NRP 75% of the population aged 20-64 should be employed 65,6% 70% Reducing early school leaving to less than 10% 19,2% 10% At least 40% of 30-34 years old completing tertiary or equivalent education 29,2% 40% Reducing the number of people in or at risk of poverty or exclusion by at least 20 million 92000 200000 The Country Specific Recommendations address challenges that are relevant for all Thematic Objectives. Below an overview is provided on the main challenges identified, clustered by thematic objective. Regarding TO8: \uf0b7 Portugal phase enormous challenges with high unemployment, and especially for long term unemployed and young people \uf0b7 High and still growing youth unemployment. The main challenges include weak outreach to non-registered young people, and a need to better align education and training with labour market needs \uf0b7 Need to tackle labour market segmentation and improve the responsiveness of wages to the economic conditions Regarding TO10: \uf0b7 Reduce skills mismatches, including by increasing the quality and attractiveness of vocational education and training and to effectively implement career guidance and counselling services for secondary and tertiary students in line with labour market needs and skills anticipation, and strengthen links with the business sector. Regarding TO11: \uf0b7 Some of the envisaged reform measures regarding the rationalisation and modernisation of public administration still need to be completed and transparency should be improved (CSR). ",
        "11 The PA is describing the challenge and there is a basic operation information on how the challenges are addressed (in term of challenges and actions described). Only the challenges addressing the high youth unemployment is described in more detail in terms of actions, target groups and implementation frameworks. Although the challenges identified between the CSR and the Commission Position Paper on Portugal are aligned there are some inconsistencies between the two documents. While for TO8 both strategic document clearly address the challenges of overcoming high unemployment and especially youth unemployment. The PA addresses high unemployment as one of the main constraints in domain \"social inclusion and employment\" and provides extensive information regarding it. With regards to youth unemployment the PA also provides extensive information regarding the challenge. Specific relevance is attributed within the scope of the YEI within the domain \"social inclusion and employment\". TO 9 is not directly addressed by the CSR while the CPP clearly address the issues that one out of four Portuguese citizens lived at risk of poverty and the rising unemployment and austerity measures taken in the context of the fiscal adjustment process, create higher risk of poverty and social exclusion. Also slight differences are noted between the CSR and the CPP for TO10, where the CPP focus on the high rate of early school leavers and drop outs, the low percentage of the working population having a higher education diploma, low participation on lifelong learning, as well as the mismatch between education/ training systems and the labour market, exactly the topics that are addressed by the PA as well. The CSR, however, narrows the focus on improving the link between VET, as well as secondary and tertiary education, and the labour market, reducing skills mismatches. Only the CSR is specifically addressing TO11. Also the PA addresses the continued commitment to administrative modernization and training of public administration. 3.2 Coherence of ESF programme to challenges Below, the table provides an overview on how the challenges are addressed by the Operational programmes (by which type of IP and how many IPs address these challenges per OP).

Another challenges that is often addressed by IPs is improving access to quality education and training (ECEC, primary, secondary and tertiary education). Also a reasonable share IP focus on support of good governance in the broader sense (including capacity building, organisational adequacy, accountability and transparency). Challenges that are addressed by a limited number of IP are those related to improving lifelong learning (adult learning) for all age groups by providing flexible learning pathways, guidance and APL; labour market situation of women, social economy and social services, access to employment of young people, active ageing, and self-employment and entrepreneurship. Strikingly is that a limited number of IP address youth unemployment, despite of the emphasize given to Youth unemployment in the CSR. This limited number of IP related to this challenges is explained by the fact that the YEI is part of the national thematic programme: Social Inclusion and Employment programme. The other challenges reported are increasing educational attainment in HE, diversifying the educational offer between regions, improve capacity of cooperation and networking, and enforce regional institutions with competences, support professional mobility of workers, raise the awareness of institutions on multiculturalism, equality and gender based violence, improve innovation capacity of companies, by improving the companies\u2019 strategy and management skills, fostering processes of change and innovation. Most IP clearly address one of the specific needs as identified in the CSR. A small group of IP address a specific aspect of the challenges identified. ",

        "16 As shown in the table above, Portugal has a total of \u20ac 7,418,278,870 available as ESF budget, including ESF allocations for the youth employment initiative (without YEI it is \u20ac 7.257.506.701). Analysing the distribution and concentration of budget between IP on national level and OP level the following can be concluded: \uf0b7 Focus of ESF: The national OP on Human Capital and Social Inclusion and Employment are the largest ESF programmes with a budget around 3 and 2 billion Euro, while the OP for Competitiveness and Internationalisation receive around half a billion Euro. The regional OP receives between the 94 (Algarve Region) and 583 million Euro (North Region). The table also shows that most budget is invested in IP 10iv (1.38 billion euros), mainly in the national Human Capital programme. A second largest expenditure targets IP 10ii (1.15 billion Euro). IP 9i and 8v follow with 875 million and 832 million). Less budget is allocated to IP 8iii, 8IV, 8Vii, 9iii, 9v, 9vi, and 11ii.Looking in more detail in the division of budget across the IP within an OP, one see differences between the different OPs. While the national OP on Social Inclusion and Employment focus the largest share of their budget on TO8 and 9 related IPs, is the Human Capital focusing all budget on TO10. The OP for competitiveness focus its budget mostly on TO8 and partly on TO11. The regional OPs have a similar focus spread around all TO, with most budget allocated to TO10 (minimum 31 % and maximum 48%), followed by TO8 (minimum 24% and maximum 35%) and TO 9 (minimum 17% and maximum 34%). Less budget is allocated to TO11. \uf0b7 Social inclusion: In total 1,639,790,000 is allocated to the IP related to social inclusion (TO9). On national level this is 22.0% of the total ESF budget (including ESF share YEI), a few percentages above the requested 20% in ESF regulation. The investment in social Inclusion differ per OP, having OP spending a relative large share of their budget on Social Inclusion like the National OP on Social Inclusion and Employment (56.9%), the OP for the Lisbon Region (34%), the OP for the Algarve Region (33%). No or hardly budget is allocated to SI for the National OP on Human Capital and the national OP for Competitiveness and Internationalisation. \uf0b7 Concentration principle: Up to 67,3 % of the ESF budget on national level is allocated to the five largest investment priorities (total 4,989,000,000 Euro). Looking on the concentration of ESF allocation per OP one see that one average 84,6% of ESF budget is allocated to the five largest IP (with a maximum of 100% for the OP for Competitiveness and Internationalisation and the OP Human Capital; and a minimum of 71,3% for the OP for the Algarve region). ",
        "17 5. INTERVENTION LOGIC AND INTERNAL COHERENCE 5.1 Relationship between Specific objectives and Investment priorities Within Portugal in total number of 97 IPs are activated. \uf0b7 To 8: For the IPs related to TO8, most of thematic objectives relate to the specific aim to increase the employment situation, while a limited number of SO relate to increasing (social) entrepreneurship. Also a significant number of SO relate to the improvement of the skills and competences of the labour force; and promote access to employment of individuals furthest from LM (incl LTU); and to a lesser extent promoting equal opportunities. Also a high number of SO are placed under the category other, not possible to be placed under one of the other categories, indicating a diversity of SO linked to the IP falling under TO 8. \uf0b7 TO 9: Within the IP related to TO9, most SO relate to poverty reduction and promoting social innovation. Also here a high number of SO could not be placed under the fixed categories of SO, pointing on a wide diversity of SO falling under TO9. \uf0b7 TO 10: Looking in more detail into the IP falling under TO10, one see that here also most SO are falling outside the standard categorisation of SO, indicating a wide diversity of SO. Finally the SO selected for the IP falling under TO11, most of SO refer to increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector and the related stakeholders at the individual level (e.g. knowledge, skills, competences) an increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector and the related stakeholders at the organisational level (e.g. knowledge management, management procedures, organisational structure, human resource development). In theory the specific objective of an IP should effectively narrows down the scope of the IP and fully captures the (direction of the) change which the Member State seeks to achieve with EU support. Moreover, the specific objectives should be specific enough to be quantitatively evaluated. All SO across the different OPs were carefully assessed on this aspect. A large part of the thematic objectives effectively narrows down the scope of the OP of the IP and fully / partly captures the (direction of the) change which the MS seeks to achieve, and is almost specific enough to quantitatively evaluated. At the same time, for a relative large share of IP it was indicated that the specific objective is not very specific, but captures the direction of the change is almost specific enough to quantitatively evaluated. Only for a limited number of specific objective. It was indicated that it is too broad\u2019s and reflects to a limited extent the direction of the change to be achieved with EU support and is not specific enough to be evaluated. 5.2 Relationship between actions and Investment Priorities Actions should contribute to the achievement of the specific objectives. The table on the following page provides an overview of the types of actions that have been selected per IP. Per IP, a maximum of four actions are selected, based on the description in the Operational programme, as identified in the columns of the table, while the rows reflect the IP across all ESF programme in the country.

Also work experience places (traineeships) for individuals are often selected. Still a large group of other types of actions are selected by many OP. With regards actions related to entities, IPs mostly address action related to skills and competences development for institutions, operators and stakeholders and to a lesser extent actions to develop new programmes, tools and instruments. Moreover, awareness raising programmes is also an often mentioned action. IP belonging to TO 8, 9 and 10 most of the time address more action related to individuals, while IP related to TO11 are mostly addressing entities. Finally, actions should contribute to the achievement of the specific objectives. In order to assess whether this is the case we assessed all actions falling under an IP. The actions link very well to the specific objectives, indicating that with all IP the action selected are sufficiently appropriate and can contribute to the achievement of the specific objective. ",
        "19 5.3 Specific objectives and target groups addressed The table below provides an overview on the target groups addressed by IPs on country level. Each of the target groups identified first has been divided in four broad categories, in which the more detailed category is highlighted for each investment priority.

Not surprisingly the unemployed is most often addressed by an IP, young people in education, the disadvantaged, and employees. Also civil society organisations are regularly addressed, just like local regional public organisations, and enterprises. A large number of other target groups are mentioned that does not fit one of the categories. An assessment was also made on the coherence between the target groups and actions on IP level, indicating whether the defined target groups fully match the specific objectives falling under that IP. The assessment shows that in all the IPs the defined target groups matched the actions. ",
        "20 5.4 Relationship between output and result indicators and specific objectives / actions Coherence between result indicators and specific objectives While developing result indicators it is important that these indicators completely represent the specific objectives and the changes foreseen. For each result indicator an assessment was made whether this was the case. The majority of result indicators are assessed as fully representative for the specific objective and scope of the challenges foreseen. Only a few indicator was assessed to be somewhat representative. In the last cases this mainly concerns indicators that only measure a part of the SO, does not specify the target group in the indicator or is too generic, or indicators that are no possible to measure at all (like whether person kept their job due to participation), or indicators that are based on self-assessment of participants. Coherence between output indicators and actions Just as for the result indicators, output indicators should reflect the scope of activities implemented by ESF. The majority of output indicators are fully / to a large extent measuring the cope of activities. A small group of output indicators were assessed that they represents to a limited extent the scope of the activities implemented. In these cases, most of the time the output indicator does not represent the type of action, only for small part or sometimes measures something broader than the action. In some cases this is also caused by the fact that actions are very generally described making it difficult to select an appropriate indicator. ",
        "21 6. PROGRAMME PERFORMANCE One of the key elements introduced by the Regulations is that programme should provide clear, transparent, measurable aims and targets for accountability and results. Countries and regions are requested to clearly state the objectives they intend to achieve with available resources and indicate how progress towards these goals will be measured (Performance Framework). This will allow regular monitoring and debate on how financial resources are used. 6.1 Outputs of ESF on country level The actions undertaken by the different programmes lead to outputs. Output indicators are measured in physical (or monetary) units. In the context of the intervention logic of the programmes under cohesion policy output indicators should be logically linked to and reflect the types of actions planned. The outputs should also contribute towards the achievement of results and the targets set for the output indicators should be consistent with the financial allocation envisaged. Total aggregation of target values of output indicators on national level The OP in Portugal have selected in total 179 output indicators, of which 166 could be labelled under a common category (while 13 fall under the other namely category). In the table below an overview is provided on the aggregation of target values of all common output indicators on country level. The OP in Portugal does not provide a specification of the target values for men, women and total 4 . 4 The indicators that are closely linked to the indicators as presented in Annex 1 and 2 of the ESF regulation have similar definitions and levels of measurement. These indicators were allocated to one of the common output indicators, and target values were aggregated for these groups of indicators. ",

        "23 The table on the previous page clearly shows that ESF is targeting a large group of employed people, including the self-employed) (around 1,76,574 persons) and the unemployed, including the long term unemployed (around 1,35,466 persons). Also a large group of disadvantage people are reached (around 97,394 persons). Most participants are reached within IP 8iv and IP 9i. Establishment of the performance framework Countries and regions are requested to clearly state the objectives they intend to achieve with available resources and indicate how progress towards these goals will be measured (Performance Framework). A selection of common output indicators are used for the performance framework to measure the progress made of the programme by 31 December 218 and to be assessed in 219. Of all output indicators 44% is included in the performance framework. Most of these indicators relate to the number of employed participants, unemployed participants, and young people. Also a large groups are participants are women, adults, students and teachers. The performance framework also include indicators related to entities, like the number of organisations supported. This is in line with the major challenges the CSR are addressing, namely addressing the high unemployment, youth unemployment and NEETS, and modernisation public administrations. Assessing the financial indicators in the performance framework (see table 8) one see that in the end of 218 between on average 47% of the budget has been spent, while the lowest percentage is 22% (applicable for one of the PA in the Regional Operational Programme for Madeira) and the highest percentage of 64 % as reported for 3 PA in the Regional Operational Programme for Lisboa. Of course the YEI intends to spend all the budget before the end of 218.

Therefore target values are defined as well. Total aggregation of target values of result indicators on national level In the table below, an overview is provided on the aggregation of target values of all common result indicators per IP on country level 12 . In total 158 result indicators were identified across the 1 Spanish OP financed by ESF, of which 16 are allocated to the category other 13 . Of the remaining 142 result indicators, the majority can be classified as participants gaining a qualification upon leaving (total 58 indicators), Participants in employment, including self-employment, six months after leaving (total 54 indicators), participants with an improved labour market situation six months after leaving (total 16 indicators). Other indicators like disadvantaged participants engaged in job searching education/training, gaining a qualification, in employment, including self- employment upon leaving, improved capacity/competence of Enterprises/Economic operators, participants in employment, including self-employment, upon leaving, and participants in education/training upon leaving, are only selected in a few cases. As for the output indicators, no specific targets were specified for men and women. Almost all result indicators are measured in percentages (total 151 indicators out of 158). Despite of the fact that the OPs don\u2019t specify the common output indicator that is used as reference for target setting, all result indicators measured in percentage can be recalculated to absolute values, searching for the reference output indicator manually14. As a result the table below presents only the calculated absolute values per type of common indicator and IP. 12 The indicators that are closely linked to the indicators as presented in Annex 1 and 2 of the ESF regulation have similar definitions and levels of measurement. These indicators were allocated to one of the common result indicators, and target values were aggregated for these groups of indicators. 13 These other indicators are: Actual responses regarding the number of warnings; workers assessing themselves as more prepared for innovation and management after the completion of training; projects of diversification of the offer of social and health services and increase of the quality of health and social answers concluded; elderly and dependent people covered by supported projects; children and/or young people reintegrated into families involved in positive family interaction projects; enrolment rate of children in pre-schooling, associated to development contracts (% of pupils); innovative solutions developed within the scope of innovation projects and social experimentation and supported CLDS 14 In some cases it was not possible to calculate the absolute values since the output indicator has a different level of measurement than the result indicator. An example in this respect is the OP for the Mandeira Region, having an output indicator for IP 8vii measuring the number of Job Clubs and UNIVAS ",

These indicators at the same show the highest aggregated target values, such as 1,869,721 participants gaining a qualification upon leaving, 638,78 disadvantaged participants engaged in job searching, education/training, gaining a qualification, in employment, including self-employment upon leaving, 68,573 participants in employment, including self-employment, six months after leaving, and 183,968 participants in education and training upon leaving. The achievements are corresponding the IPs that receives largest budget shares, like 1iv, IP1iii, IP9i and 8v. Having a closer look on the YEI result indicators in the table below one see that in total 12,684unemployed, 116,27 long term unemployed, and 15,7 inactive participants will complete the YEI supported intervention. In total 63,42 participants are foreseen in education & training after six months, wile 95,13 participants are in employment after six months, and 21,14 in self-employment after six months.

        "28 7. FURTHER EXPLORATION OF A NUMBER OF SELECTED THEMES This report devotes a specific attention to a number of selected themes, namely youth employment policies, the strengthening of institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration, and the investment in Active Labour Market Policies (ALMPs). These themes are operationalised in terms or Investment Priorities that are related to these themes. The table below provides an overview how these themes are addressed in the ESF OPs in the country. Table 1 Attention to specific themes Theme Identified in challenges? How Is the theme addressed? Target group Actions How much budget is allocated to each theme Youth employment policies (IP 8.ii) Yes, The analysis of the challenges in the CSR shows that that Portugal still faces with high early school leaving rates. Portugal phase enormous challenges with high unemployment, and especially for long term unemployed and young people (CSR). The main challenges include weak outreach to non-registered young people, and a need to better align education and training with labour market needs (CSR).With regards to youth unemployment the PA provides extensive information regarding the challenge. Specific relevance is attributed within the scope of the YEI within the domain \"social inclusion and employment\". The main objectives, related actions and expected results are described for the selected IPs. However, in most cases, the focus is on the objectives and not on measurable expected results. The PA include a description of the National Plan for the Implementation of the YEI. The relevant IP 8.ii is selected only in two OP. Nevertheless young people are indirectly addressed by most of the OPs. The YEI is erected in the national OP on Social Inclusion and Employment. Work experience places (traineeships) for individuals Employment incentives for employers to hire staff / provide workplaces Career Support/Guidance for individuals Training for basic skills for individuals In total \u20ac 515,412, is allocated to IP8.ii (including \u20ac 321,544,338 for the YEI f which \u20ac16,772,169 ESF share). Youth employment policies (IP 8.ii) ",
        "29 Theme Identified in challenges? How Is the theme addressed? Target group Actions How much budget is allocated to each theme Enhancing institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration (IP 11.i) Yes, the CSR refer to the envisaged reform measures regarding the rationalisation and modernisation of public administration still need to be completed and transparency should be improved (CSR). The Partnership Agreement also addresses the continued commitment to administrative modernization and training of public administration. It was indicated that investments should be made in two areas. First of all administrative modernisation (by benefiting from the potential of ICT, strengthening the accessibility and quality of services to citizens and enterprises, introduce new models of service delivery, more effective interaction with decentralised states and enterprises, introduce need centred approaches. Secondly, in order to make the model of governance more efficient and results-oriented, still requires the promotion of training activities such as the dissemination and sharing of best practices, strengthening the implementation of reporting models aimed at the transparency, integrity and accountability, in particular at the level of strategic planning and management based on quality, and capacity building, monitoring evaluation and audit , including benchmarking exercises to inter- service and international level. In total 12 IP (across 8 out of 1 Ops) are addressing the challenge labelled as good governance, providing support the good governance in the broader sense (including capacity building, organisational adequacy, accountability and transparency). Skills and competences development for institutions, operators and stakeholders Actions to develop new programmes, tools, instrument Actions for knowledge base improvement and documentation (studies / labour market intelligence) Actions for introducing and managing Change for companies/organisatio ns, institutions, operators and stakeholders Integrated approaches (combined training, personal support, hiring subsidies etc.) / companies/organisatio ns In total \u20ac 199,91, is allocated to IP11i across all 1 Ops. enhancing institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration (IP 11.i) ",
        "30 Theme Identified in challenges? How Is the theme addressed? Target group Actions How much budget is allocated to each theme Investment in Active Labour Market Policy (8i, 8ii, 8v and partly 8iii) Investment in Active Labour Policy is well addressed in the strategic document. It was indicated that Portugal faces enormous challenges with high unemployment, and especially for long term unemployed and young people. Also reference was made to the high and still growing youth unemployment. The main challenges include weak outreach to non-registered young people, and a need to better align education and training with labour market needs (CSR). It was also mentioned that Portugal needed to tackle labour market segmentation and improve the responsiveness of wages to the economic conditions (CSR). The importance to invest in active labour market participation is emphasized again in the PA. Investment in the acces to employment of job seekers and inactive, and more specifically young people, is very well addressed by all OP. Attention for self-employment and business creation is only addressed in three OPs specifically. Employment incentives for employers to hire staff / provide workplaces Work experience places (traineeships) for individuals Training for vocational skills for individuals Skills and competences development for institutions, operators and stakeholders Start-up incentives (financial support, guidance, training) Other, for individuals Actions to develop new programmes, tools, instrument Actions for introducing and managing Change for companies/organisatio ns, institutions, operators and stakeholders Training for basic skills for individuals Social innovation (developing, testing mainstreaming new methods) Integrated approaches (combined training, personal support, hiring subsidies etc.) / companies/organisatio ns Career Support/Guidance for individuals Awareness raising In total \u20ac 194,882, is allocated to IP 8i and \u20ac 515,412, to IP 8.ii. IP8iii receives \u20ac 186,68,, while IP8.v receives \u20ac 832,354,. All together this 19% of total ESF budget. Investment in Active Labour Market Policy (8i, 8ii, 8v and partly 8iii) ",
