        "SUBTITLING FILMS IN 24 EU LANGUAGES ",
        "Culture lies at the very heart of a space that is shared by individuals. In the European Union, this space can be seen as a place of balance between the diversity of cultures and traditions at national, regional and local level and the enrichment of a shared cultural heritage. Politically speaking, in the light of recent identity-related tensions, the main challenge for culture is to preserve this balance. Culture is not only of great intrinsic value, but is also a key economic resource. The EU has a signifi cant cultural and creative industry, which accounts for 5 % of its GDP (nearly EUR 800 billion) and generates some 14 million jobs. This means that the cinema industry\u2019s economic weight is proportional to the evocative power of fi lm. As Wim Wenders says, \u2018cinema is the soul of Europe\u2019. Yet there are still structural obstacles to the free movement of European fi lms within the EU, as the latter is fragmented both geographically and linguistically. The impact on the European fi lm industry is twofold: the plurality of national cinema has been fading in favour of American cinema, and the emergence of global players in the EU\u2019s domestic market is likely to undermine the principle of media chronology and thus the European fi lm industry as a whole. In 2007 the European Parliament decided to support fi lm distribution by subtitling some of the most signifi cant European co-productions. The establishment of the LUX FILM PRIZE anticipated the requirements of a developing European fi lm market and has proved to be a successful initiative. The need for it has been confi rmed by the new action - endorsed by the Creative Europe programme - aimed at supporting the subtitling of European works. Distribution and fi lm catalogues have become key to an industry that is undergoing profound change. The heritage and economic value of the fi lm catalogue built up by the LUX FILM PRIZE increases every year. The catalogue now contains 100 masterpieces which refl ect not only the richness of 28 European cinematic traditions but also the EU\u2019s legislative agenda and its decisions on societal issues of the utmost importance. Let us draw on the full potential of cinema in our day-to-day work, thereby helping to open a window onto our own culture and that of others.

        "LUX FILM PRIZE THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TEAMS UP WITH THE EUROPEAN FILM INDUSTRY \u2026 \u2026 AND ENGAGES YOUNG PEOPLE 28 TIMES CINEMA The LUX FILM PRIZE, established in 2007, is awarded each year by the European Parliament. The European Parliament is actively committed to promoting cultural and linguistic diversity, as stated in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights 1 . In addition, its legislative powers make it a crucial player in shaping EU policies that aff ect the everyday lives of 500 million Europeans. Its remit covers key issues such as immigration, integration, poverty, freedom of expression and women\u2019s rights. Against this backdrop, the LUX FILM PRIZE pursues two main objectives: enhancing the circulation of European fi lms across Europe, and sparking Europe-wide debate and discussion on major societal issues. The LUX FILM PRIZE promotes the distribution of its three fi nalist fi lms by subtitling each of them in the EU\u2019s 24 offi cial languages and by producing a digital cinema package per fi lm for each country. It has also given rise to the LUX FILM DAYS, which off er an indelible cultural experience. This year, the LUX FILM PRIZE celebrates its 10th anniversary: a decade of bringing Europe\u2019s cinematic soul closer to Europeans. The European Parliament\u00b4s LUX FILM PRIZE will continue shedding light on stories and fi lms that do more than merely entertain. Films that portray our quest for answers, our search for identity and consolation in times of hardship, that make us aware of our own and others\u2019 realities. The LUX FILM PRIZE is a partner of numerous fi lm festivals in Europe, including the Berlinale, the Directors\u2019 Fortnight (Cannes), Karlovy Vary, Venice Days, Sofi a, Stockholm, Thessaloniki, the Viennale, Tallinn Black Nights, Cork, Bratislava and Seville. Cinema helps us understand the lives of our neighbours. It is a common language that speaks to our emotions, and an invitation to question our identities. As such, cinema is a powerful educational tool. Accordingly, the LUX FILM PRIZE provides education packs on the competing fi lms, in collaboration with cultural associations and fi lm institutes. These packs often serve to support the debates that follow the screenings, and can be of great use to teachers. Since 2010 the \u201828 Times Cinema\u2019 project has been promoted by the LUX FILM PRIZE in cooperation with Venice Days and Europa Cinemas, and with the support of Cineuropa. This initiative brings together 28 young fi lm lovers from across Europe to attend an 11-day intensive training course in Venice. The 28 fi lm enthusiasts, aged 18 to 25, attend screenings and participate in debates on European cinema. \u201828 Times Cinema\u2019 involves directors, authors, fi lm professionals and Members of the European Parliament. This year, for the third time, these young fi lm enthusiasts will sit on the jury for the Venice Days Award and will present the prize. The \u201828 Times Cinema\u2019 agenda also includes the screening of the three fi lms competing for the LUX FILM PRIZE.

        "In 2012 the European Parliament\u2019s LUX FILM PRIZE gave rise to the LUX FILM DAYS. Every year from October to December, the LUX FILM DAYS transcend geographical and linguistic borders to create a European public sphere: cinema lovers across the 28 EU countries can watch and share three remarkable fi lms in the EU\u2019s 24 offi cial languages. The screenings, organised by the European Parliament\u2019s information offi ces, take place as part of fi lm festivals or at art house or other cinemas, and often serve as national preview showings. The LUX FILM DAYS give Europeans a chance to share the diversity and richness of European cinema and to debate the issues raised by the fi lms competing for the LUX FILM PRIZE - both in live debates and on social media. Members of the audience are also invited to share their views and to vote for their favourite fi lm on the LUX FILM PRIZE website (www.luxprize.eu) or Facebook page. The winning fi lm will be awarded the LUX FILM PRIZE Audience Mention, to be announced at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. This symbolically closes the previous year\u2019s LUX FILM PRIZE; at the same time, the curtain is lifted on the current edition with the announcement of the 10 fi lms in the Offi cial Selection. The European Parliament is pleased to present the three fi lms competing for the 2016 LUX FILM PRIZE: \u00c0 PEINE J\u2019OUVRE LES YEUX (As I open my eyes) by Leyla Bouzid France, Tunisia, Belgium, United Arab Emirates MA VIE DE COURGETTE (My life as a Courgette) by Claude Barras Switzerland, France TONI ERDMANN by Maren Ade Germany, Austria, Romania These multi-faceted stories, which are the result of the great dedication and creativity of talented young fi lm directors, will be screened during the fi fth edition of the LUX FILM DAYS. The three fi lms allow us to experience stories in a touching way, through the eyes of a young generation shaping their identities in very diverse contexts \u2013 be it on the eve of the Arab Spring, in an orphanage or in the corporate world.

        "Set a few months before the Arab Spring, Leyla Bouzid\u2019s impressive debut fi lm \u00c0 peine j\u2019ouvre les yeux follows the life of a young girl in the summer of 2010. \u2018Sharply yet subtly capturing the atmosphere of fear fostered by the dictatorship of President Ben Ali, this skilfully made drama is especially attuned to the myriad forms of surveillance, from the prurient to the political.\u2019 \u2013 Variety. With music from Iraqi musician Khyam Allami, \u00c0 peine j\u2019ouvre les yeux can be considered the \u2018best fi ctional fi lm yet about the Arab Spring.\u2019 \u2013 Indiewire SYNOPSIS \u2013 As Ben Ali\u2019s government nears its end, headstrong 18-year-old Farah joins \u2018Joujma\u2019, a politically engaged rock band, against the will of her parents, who see her future as a doctor. While discovering the pleasures of night-time Tunis, she also encounters the dangers of a regime that watches and infi ltrates her daily life. \u00c0 PEINE J\u2019OUVRE LES YEUX As I open my eyes Leyla Bouzid France, Tunisia, Belgium, United Arab Emirates ",
        "Based on a novel by Gilles Paris, Ma vie de Courgette is the fi rst stop- motion animated feature from Claude Barras, adapted for the screen by C\u00e9line Sciamma ( Tomboy, Bande de fi lles ). The animation deals with the harsh reality of the orphan experience. While falling \u2018into that zone of animation that is mature enough for adults to appreciate, it deals frankly with the facts of life in a way that neither condescends to nor scars younger audiences.\u2019 \u2013 Variety. Throughout the fi lm, we can see Sciamma\u2019s \u2018delicately observant touch, from the gawky humour so typical of juvenility to the way in which children on the brink of adulthood learn in fi ts and starts, as if early adolescence were a testing ground for adult behaviour.\u2019 \u2013 The Hollywood Reporter SYNOPSIS \u2013 Centred on a valiant young boy nicknamed Courgette, who is taken to live in an orphanage following the death of his alcoholic mother, the fi lm recounts his experience in his new environment, where he is surrounded by children who, just like him, have been scarred by life. MA VIE DE COURGETTE My life as a Courgette Claude Barras Switzerland, France ",
        "Maren Ade\u2019s third feature fi lm, Toni Erdmann , explores contemporary corporate culture through the complex relationship of a semi-retired, practical-joker father and his workaholic daughter. This \u2018unique study of an estranged but mutually depressive father and daughter is a humane, hilarious triumph\u2019, through which \u2018Ade addresses a far broader spread of contemporary manners and mores\u2019 \u2013 Variety SYNOPSIS \u2013 Without warning, a father comes from Germany to visit his daughter in Romania, where she is working as a management consultant on an assignment in Bucharest. Troubled by the seeming lack of joy in her life, he takes on the character of Toni Erdmann, a self-styled \u2018consultant and coach\u2019, who starts to make unwelcome appearances in his daughter\u2019s life.
