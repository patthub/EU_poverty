        "The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived I Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation 3 Reducing poverty in Europe Europe wants to reduce poverty. The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) is one way of accomplishing this goal. It was launched in March 2014 with the main aim of breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation. It does so by providing non-financial assistance to some of the most vulnerable persons in the EU. Who benefits and what kind of help do they receive? The Fund offers assistance to individuals, families, households or groups of people in the EU Member States. The assistance may take the form of food, clothing and other essentials, accompanied by advice, counselling or other help to re-integrate into society. The FEAD may also finance stand-alone social inclusion activities for the most deprived per- sons, which are designed to strengthen people\u2019s skills and capacities so that they can overcome dif- ficulties or discrimination they face in everyday life. What are the FEAD\u2019s goals? The FEAD aims to contribute to alleviating the worst forms of poverty in the EU. In this way the Fund will play a part in reaching the EU 2020 target of reducing the number of people in pov- erty or at risk of poverty by at least 20 million. By helping groups in society that are struggling the most, the Fund also pursues the broader goal of strengthening social cohesion. The FEAD at a glance Objectives : y Contribute to alleviating the worst forms of poverty y Promote and enhance social cohesion y Help achieve the EU2020 poverty reduction target Scope of action: y Support national schemes through which material assistance is distributed to the most deprived persons y Support the collection and distribution of food donations in order to reduce food waste y Finance activities that contribute to the social inclusion of the most deprived persons Types of material assistance : y Food packages or meals y Clothing and footwear y School supplies y Other essentials (soap, shampoo, etc.) Geographic coverage: y In all 28 EU Member States ",
        "4 The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived I Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation A new approach The EU has provided food aid to those who are most in need for over a quarter of a century. This began in 1987 with the Food Distribution pro- gramme for the Most Deprived Persons of the Community (MDP). The MDP channelled food through organisations in direct contact with those experiencing material deprivation, and Member States participated on a voluntary basis. This suc- cessful programme benefitted 18.9 million peo- ple in 2011 in the 20 beneficiary Member States. More than just food The FEAD brings a new approach to helping the most deprived persons in the EU. It gives Member States greater flexibility in terms of obtaining food for distribution. Moreover, FEAD funds can also be used to supply clothing and other essential goods such as shoes, soap and shampoo. In other words, the Fund can be used to meet other material needs of those in poverty, not just their nutritional needs. Promoting social integration The most distinguishing feature of the FEAD is that it mandates that support for basic needs be complemented by advice and guidance in order to promote social integration. The Fund provides immediate relief to deprived persons to help them improve their life circumstances. \u201cThe Fund can be used to meet other material needs of those in poverty, not just their nutritional needs.\u201d Main FEAD Principles The FEAD is based on these main principles: y Non-discrimination: enhancing and maintaining equality between men and women; respect and dignity for all y Environment: considering the possible impact of the earth\u2019s climate when purchasing food, and making an effort to reduce food waste y Promotion of a balanced diet: contribut- ing to the balanced diet of the most deprived y Partnership: forming partnerships between Member States, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) y Effectiveness and efficiency: imple- menting sound financial management and reducing administrative burdens ",
        "The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived I Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation 5 Poverty in Europe: the reality Despite Europe\u2019s economic advancement, poverty and deprivation are still a significant issue here. In 2013 nearly one in five Europeans \u2013 or nearly 100 million persons \u2013 was materially deprived, while 9.6% of EU citizens lived in conditions of severe material deprivation. Moreover, nearly one in four Europeans, or 122.9 million people, lived in households at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Children were at greater risk of poverty or social exclusion than the rest of the population in 20 out of 28 EU Member States. (1) According to an expert estimate for the year 2009, there could be as many as 410 000 home- less people on any given night in the EU. This could imply that about 4.1 million people in the EU are without shelter each year for a shorter or longer period (2) . Studies by the European Federa- tion of National Organisations working with the homeless show that homelessness continues to rise in most Member States.

        "The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived I Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation 7 Who benefits from FEAD? Deprivation doesn\u2019t affect all equally Across the EU there is an increasing divergence in terms of deprivation within and between Mem- ber States. Given this diversity, Member States clearly need to adopt tailor-made solutions that fit their national circumstances. The FEAD allows them the flexibility to do so by identifying the specific groups of people that the Fund will support. FEAD target groups The persons who will benefit from FEAD are deter- mined at the national level. While national approaches differ and may address specific needs or challenges facing a particular region, some of the groups targeted for food and/or basic material assistance or social inclusion measures are: y People experiencing poverty y Homeless people y Children y Seniors y People with disabilities y People living in remote areas y Immigrant families Stories from the field: Real people receiving real help The following are examples of families that have been helped by FEAD co-financed assistance. Helping a family with unemployed parents to stabilise their situation This family consists of six people: unemployed parents and their four children, aged 8-17 years. The parents have no right to any social benefits; they subsist on temporary jobs. A charitable organisation provides this family with food aid financed by the FEAD, as well as support for social inclusion. The family also receives fruits and vegetables from a programme with local fruit growers designed to prevent food waste. Thanks to their constant contact with the supporting organisation, the family can combat their poverty and avoid social exclusion. As a result of the support, the family members enjoy balanced regular meals and can manage the household budget. Ensuring that a single mother can provide her three children with a balanced diet This single mother has struggled to raise her three children: aged 16, 13 and 4 years. The mother lives with her children in a home for unwed mothers with children run by a local charity. The family\u2019s only income is the family benefit allowance and the allowance for raising children as a single mother. During the spring and summer, the mother takes on work offered through the charity. The family participates in the programme \u2018exit of homelessness\u2019. The family is supported by food aid under the FEAD programme, implemented by the charity in cooperation with a local food bank. The family also receives fruits, vegetables and bread from another charity to help to meet its everyday need for a balanced diet. The assortment of food received helps the family to decrease the costs of grocery shopping. ",

        "The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived I Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation 9 What kind of assistance is offered? Each EU country has adapted the assistance it provides. The country may, for instance, focus on food aid or on basic consumer goods for the most deprived people. Or the country may provide social inclusion activities in order to best meet local needs. Here are some examples of the kinds of assis- tance that may be offered: Food support, e.g.: y food packages y meals y collection and distribution of donated food Material assistance, e.g.: y Basic hygiene items y Clothing/sleeping bags y School supplies Assistance in the form of accompanying measures, e.g.: y Information about available social services y Information about temporary shelter y Financial literacy and debt mediation y Information about maintaining a balanced diet y Access to health and education services y Psychological support and empowerment E x a m p l e s o f t y p i c a l a s s i s t a n c e p a c k a g e s . \u00a9 M i n i s t r y o f W e l f a r e - R e p u b l i c o f L a t v i a .

        "12 The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived I Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation Ho w does FEAD material assistance reach people? 1. Plan and customise : Member States planned their programmes on the basis of their national situations and needs. They can mix the assistance to be provided: food only, goods only, or both. 2. Choose preferred implementation model: each national authority then decided how to organise the provision of FEAD assis- tance nationally. 3. Approve programmes : the European Com- mission approved the operational pro- grammes of all Member States which will run over the period 2014-2020. 4. Select partner organisations : partner organisations (public or non-profit) are selected by Member States to manage the FEAD support. The Fund seeks to avoid plac- ing a high administrative burden on these partners, especially local NGOs that rely on volunteers. 5. Purchase and transport assistance : assistance first has to be purchased by a national authority or a partner organisation. It then has to be transported to all partner organisations, which are in charge of distribution. 6. Deliver assistance : partner organisations distribute the assistance to the most deprived. Distribution of material assistance must be combined with complementary non-material measures such as guidance and support (except when distributed in childcare facilities). Partner organisations: FEAD\u2019s \u2018feet on the street\u2019 Partner organisations are mandatory for all FEAD programmes and may be national, regional, or local public bodies or NGOs. They are charged with the actual distribution of assistance, and/or the provision of social inclusion measures to the most deprived. They are expected to have relevant expertise that would make them best placed to reach FEAD target groups, which can sometimes be hard to find. The exchange of information and best practices between partner organisations is a key part of the FEAD platform and a way to develop synergies within Europe. ",
        "The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived I Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation 13 How big is the budget? The FEAD\u2019s total budget is approximately EUR 4.5 billion in real-terms for the years 2014- 2020. The bulk of it \u2013 EUR 3.8 billion \u2013 comes from the EU budget, while Member States will top this up by EUR 674 million as national co-financing. How is use of the budget monitored? The EU wants to measure the performance of FEAD programmes. For this reason, the new fund contains provisions for monitoring, reporting and evaluation. The main provisions are: y Annual meetings between each Member State and the Commission to discuss the progress achieved during the year. y Submission of implementation reports every year to keep track of progress achieved y Report on progress using indicators, common for all Member States y Presentation of a summary of the implementa- tion reports by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council at the end of each year. y Presentation of a FEAD mid-term evaluation by the end of 2018. How does FEAD complement other EU support measures? The FEAD plugs a gap in EU cohesion policy, by helping the most vulnerable people with tangible aid. It is complementary to and works alongside other EU funding instruments and in particular the European Social Fund (ESF). The ESF is mainly geared to improving people\u2019s employment oppor- tunities, while the FEAD does not finance active labour market measures. The FEAD\u2019s focus is on helping people to take the first steps out of poverty and social exclusion by addressing their most basic needs and by taking the first steps toward re-integration into society. The ESF can then step in to support their labour market integration. The FEAD Platform: sharing knowledge, finding synergies The FEAD is more than just a source of funding, it is also a network. Partner organisations participating in the implementation of national programmes, the managing authorities and organisations at the European, national, regional or local level involved in monitoring the actions or in the fight against poverty and social exclusion may participate in the FEAD network. Exchange, learning and capacity building will cover topics such as addressing severe material deprivation, child poverty, and homelessness; supporting the social inclusion of the most deprived; and technical aspects of the FEAD implementation. Interaction between members of the FEAD network can take a range of forms including direct exchanges on specific initiatives, the organisation of thematic seminars, peer review meetings, and discussion groups. Online exchange tools, including social media, will also be used intensively. ",

        "The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived I Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation 15 FEAD support is implemented in different ways in different countries and even within a single country. The examples presented here are not necessarily representative of FEAD support in the entire country, but do give an idea of how support is provided and by whom, as well as how effective the support is. Poland The Food Bank in Olsztyn acquires food from manufacturers and distributors of food and passes it on to organisations involved in support- ing people at risk of social exclusion. Food is dis- tributed to charity organisations; to educational institutions; to social welfare centres; and to centres for homeless people, the disabled, single mothers or children. These partner organisations provide food boxes or meals. Apart from distributing food, the Food Bank also collects food donations, provides education on food waste and proper nutrition for people of all ages, and provides social activities that stimulate local partners to work together to improve the situation of people at risk of social exclusion. The Food Bank has received support from the MDP and the FEAD since 2004. In 2014, the Food Bank worked with 284 organisations that pro- vided food aid to 83 011 people. Thanks to receiving food, beneficiaries of FEAD financed support are able to re-allocate funds for the pur- chase of other needed products, such as educa- tional materials for their children, cleaning agents and medicines. Products from the Food Bank also help people to maintain a balanced diet. Latvia The Samaritan Association of Latvia is a volun- tary, politically and religiously independent, action-oriented public benefit organisation whose motto is \u2018Helping to live\u2019. The Association is one of the largest NGOs in Latvia. It provides home care, specialised transport, social care centres, crisis centres for victims of violence, first aid courses and charity projects to support poor peo- ple. In addition, food packages, hygiene kits, school supplies and school bags, are combined when applicable with accompanying measures supported by the FEAD. The Association provides FEAD assistance in cooperation with four regional partners, NGOs in seven districts of Latvia, via nine distribution points. For persons with impaired mobility, the Association delivers packages to the per- son\u2019s home. FEAD support has enabled the Association to provide approximately 17 395 food packages, 5 170 hygienic packages and 795 school material packages in the most recent year. The assistance helps children from beneficiary families to main- tain proper standards of hygiene and to attend school. The FEAD in action ",
        "16 The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived I Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and deprivation France The French Federation of Food Banks coordinates a network of 79 food banks throughout France and three overseas territories. The food banks collect, manage and distribute free food to help people \u2018get back on their feet\u2019. The food banks do not distribute food directly, how- ever. Instead, they rely on a network of 5 300 associations. Each year, these partners assist over 1.8 million people who are living under the poverty line. People in need are directed to food aid after their situation is reviewed by social workers. Food aid may take various forms including: y Provision of food baskets y Preparation of meals y Distribution of food in the street to the homeless y Offering breakfast The food aid has two functions: on the one hand it helps people to better deal with shortage of food by supplementing their meals, while on the other hand it is the first step in a journey to social inclusion \u2013 it works by ending the isolation of those receiving assistance and by offering them guided accompaniment. \u201cThe FEAD is more than just a source of funding, it is also a network\u2026\u201d ",
