        "4 1. I NTRODUCTION The purpose of Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 6 for the year 2017 is to update both the expenditure and the revenue sides of the budget to take account of the latest developments: \u2013 on the expenditure side, \u2013 after taking into account the redeployments proposed in the so-called \"global transfer\" (DEC 20/2017), to decrease the level of payment appropriations of budget lines mainly for headings 1b 'Economic, social and territorial cohesion' , 2 'Sustainable growth \u2013 natural resources' , 3 'Security and Citizenship' as well as for 4 'Global Europe' ; \u2013 to release commitment appropriations of budget lines for heading 2 'Sustainable growth \u2013 natural resources' ; \u2013 to release commitment and payment appropriations relating to the payment of advances for the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) which will no longer be needed in 2017; \u2013 on the revenue side, \u2013 to revise the forecast of Traditional Own Resources (i.e. customs duties and sugar sector levies), value-added tax (VAT) and gross national income (GNI) bases, and to budget the relevant UK corrections and their financing, which all affect the distribution of own resources contributions from Member States to the EU budget; \u2013 to enter into the EU budget the fines decided by the Commission, for which all legal remedies were exhausted and which therefore became definitive in the course of 2017, reducing accordingly the own resources contributions from Member States to the EU budget. 2. D ECREASE OF PAYMENT AND COMMITMENT APPROPRIATIONS The Commission proposes to adjust the level of payment appropriations for certain budget lines in order to align them more closely to the latest estimates of needs and working on the assumption that the rebalancing of payment appropriations between budget lines requested separately by the Commission in the so-called \"global transfer\" (DEC 20/2017) will be accepted by the European Parliament and the Council. The overall reduction (EUR 7 719,7 million) in the level of payment appropriations requested in this DAB mainly concerns heading 1b and to a lesser extent headings 2, 3, 4 and the European Union Solidarity Fund (\"EUSF\"). 2.1 Heading 1b \u2013 Economic, social and territorial cohesion The Commission proposes a decrease of EUR 5,9 billion 8 in payment appropriations for the European Structural and Investment funds (ESIF) under heading 1b. This reduction results from updated forecasts indicating payment needs lower than those originally planned in the 2017 budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. 8 EUR 5 890,7 million is included in this DAB and another EUR 14,3 million were used in the global transfer as a balancing item. ",
        "5 All operational programmes for this period were adopted before the end of 2015. However, the overall level of interim payments in 2017 for these programmes will be lower than initially budgeted, as confirmed by the latest Member States forecasts (July 2017) which have decreased by around EUR 6 billion (-16 %) relative to the forecasts of January 2017. The Commission's analysis of forecasts provided by Member States also includes adjustments in view of recurrent historical over-estimation. These adjustments were made with a prudent approach and taking account of the persistent error rate of the Member States' forecast observed in recent years. Furthermore, additional elements have been considered such as the lack of regulatory incentives to accelerate the claim submission due to the more relaxed automatic decommitment rules ( low 'N+3' pressure) and the recurrence of a \"normal\" backlog of payment applications arriving too late to be paid within the year. Implementation delays continue to be observed in relation to the 2014-2020 operational programmes. They are mainly attributed to the lengthy designation process of national authorities (designation for 62 operational programmes, or 11 % of all programmes, still needs to be notified to the Commission), which has translated into slower-than-expected implementation in terms of interim payment claims received despite the reported progress in project selection on the ground. The reduction in payment appropriations is proposed for the following budget articles and items. Budget line Name Payment appropriations 04 02 60 European Social Fund \u2014 Less developed regions \u2014 Investment for growth and jobs goal -667 462 307 04 02 61 European Social Fund \u2014 Transition regions \u2014 Investment for growth and jobs goal -148 720 085 04 02 62 European Social Fund \u2014 More developed regions \u2014 Investment for growth and jobs goal -333 817 608 13 03 60 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) \u2014 Less developed regions \u2014 Investment for growth and jobs goal -3 441 410 203 13 03 61 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) \u2014 Transition regions \u2014 Investment for growth and jobs goal -491 788 711 13 03 62 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) \u2014 More developed regions \u2014 Investment for growth and jobs goal -510 253 467 13 03 64 01 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) \u2014 European territorial cooperation -257 368 301 13 05 03 01 Completion of cross-border cooperation (CBC) \u2014 Contribution from Subheading 1b -15 422 489 13 05 63 01 Cross-border cooperation (CBC) \u2014 Contribution from Heading 1b -21 988 054 22 04 52 Cross-border cooperation (CBC) \u2014 Contribution from Heading 1b (Regional policy) -2 512 986 Total -5 890 744 211 The Commission has recurrently highlighted this issue and expressed its readiness to provide assistance to Member States to ensure that implementation accelerates. In July, letters co-signed by four Commissioners 9 were sent to Member States, alerting them to the worryingly low level of implementation and urging them to remove the bottlenecks without further delay. 2.2 Heading 2 \u2013 Sustainable Growth: Natural resources 2.2.1 European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) The payment appropriations available on budget item 05 04 05 01 were initially intended for the closure payments of the EAFRD 2007-2013 programmes. However, most of these programmes were closed and paid at the end of 2016 as additional payment appropriations were made available for this purpose in 2016 from the end-of-the year transfer and from the EAFRD 2014-2020 budget 9 Commissioners Oettinger, Cretu, Thyssen and Vella. ",
        "6 line. As a result, the needs for closure payments in 2017 are lower and an amount of EUR 780 million may be released. Further to the cancellation of certain actions, a EUR 1,5 million reduction of the commitment appropriations on budget item 05 04 60 02 is also proposed.

Furthermore, EUR 0,2 million, in both commitment and payment appropriations, may be released from the compulsory contributions to international bodies active in the field of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (budget article 11 03 02).

As a result, the contribution from the EU budget may be reduced accordingly, in both commitment and payment appropriations. Budget line Name Commitment appropriations Payment appropriations 17 04 07 European Chemicals Agency \u2014 Activities in the field of biocides legislation -560 000 -560 000 Total -560 000 -560 000 ",
        "7 2.3 Heading 3 \u2013 Security and Citizenship As already signalled in DAB 5/2017 10 and in the transfer DEC 18/2017, some delays have occurred in the start-up of the national programmes for the Asylum and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund (ISF), due to the late adoption of the legal bases and the designation of national authorities. However, progress is being made with the implementation of the programmes on the ground: the lower than expected declaration of payments by the Member States does not necessarily reflect the expenditure incurred by the beneficiaries. In addition, both for AMIF and ISF the Commission was able to make important closure payments related to the 2007-2013 predecessor programmes at the end of 2016. This reduced the outstanding balances to be paid in 2017, and the related payment approprations can be reduced accordingly. 2.3.1 Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) Further to the reasons above, the proposed reduction in payments takes into account the slower than originally planned implementation of the two relocation schemes under AMIF leading to a lower declaration of expenditures in the annual accounts of the Member States. Budget line Name Payment appropriations 18 03 01 01 Strengthening and developing the common European asylum system and enhancing solidarity and responsibility-sharing between the Member States -118 000 000 18 03 01 02 Supporting legal migration to the Union and promoting the effective integration of third-country nationals and enhancing fair and effective return strategies -8 000 000 18 03 51 Completion of operations and programmes in the field of return, refugees and migration flows -31 500 000 Total -157 500 000 2.3.2 Internal Security Fund (ISF) The reduction in the payments for the ISF stems from the delay in the implementation of the national programmes (as explained above) and also from the delayed adoption of the new Entry- Exit System. The Regulation establishing the Entry-Exit System is expected to enter into force in November 2017, following the political agreement reached in July. Consequently, the Commission intends to carry forward the commitment appropriations (amounting to EUR 40 million) which are currently in reserve, in accordance with Article 13 2(b) of the Financial Regulation. The related payment appropriations are proposed to be released.

",
        "8 2.4 Heading 4 \u2013 Global Europe 2.4.1 Instrument for Pre-accession assistance (IPA II) It is proposed to reduce a total amount of EUR 268,1 million in payment appropriations identified on several IPA budget lines. Some EUR 113 million results from lower payment needs under the Facility for Refugees in Turkey due to the complex negotiations on some large infrastructure projects and the resulting contractual delays. The remaining surplus in title 22 is due to delays in contracting or in implementation of contracts in the Western Balkans and Turkey. Payment appropriations also exceed the revised needs in cross-border cooperation actions in title 13, mainly due to a sharp decrease in the updated forecast submitted by the countries concerned compared to the forecast underlying the 2017 budget.

Some EUR 300 million is explained by delays in the disbursement of several budget support tranches to Egypt, Morocco, Moldova, Armenia and Azerbaijan because the agreed criteria for their disbursement have not been fulfilled according to schedule. The remaining amount of payment appropriations which can be released relates to postponements due to difficulties encountered in the implementation of projects. For example legal issues as well as the current political context in Gaza have been affecting the smooth implementation of several contracts under line 22 04 01 04. In addition, several payments have been postponed due to delays in the conclusion of the agreements between the government of Egypt and the International Financing Institutions in the framework of blending operations. Finally, under several contracts payments have been postponed due to delays in receiving the payment requests from the contractors or additional supporting documents linked to specific payment requests.

        "9 2.5 European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) There has been no request in 2017 for pre-financing under the EUSF and the full amount of EUR 50 million entered in the 2017 budget for this purpose at the time of its adoption is still available. At this stage the Commission proposes to keep EUR 4 million on budget article 13 06 01 to face any unexpected request. Consequently, EUR 46 million, in both commitment and payment appropriations, may be released.

U PDATE OF REVENUE 3.1 Overall impact of DAB 6/2017 on the distribution of total own resources payments between Member States As the present DAB decreases the payment appropriations of the 2017 budget, it will therefore have an impact on the total amount payable by Member States towards this budget. However there are also three adjustments on the revenue side of the budget which need to be taken into account. The first of these adjustments is an update of the estimates for Traditional Own Resources (TOR), as well as the Value Added Tax (VAT) and Gross National Income (GNI) resources, which are updated to take account of more recent economic forecasts. The second and third adjustments on the revenue side concern the update of the UK correction and the level of competition fines that has become definitive at the end of September 2017. These three adjustments are presented in sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, below. The overall impact of both the expenditure and the revenue adjustments of this DAB is shown in the summary table below. This table also shows the distribution of total own resources payments between Member States: as budgeted in the 2017 budget, as amended in Amending Budget (AB) 2/2017 11 , and finally in the present DAB.

The revision concerns the forecast of Traditional Own Resources to be paid to the budget in 2017 as well as the forecast of the 2017 VAT and GNI bases. The forecast in the 2017 budget was established at the 166 th ACOR meeting on 18 May 2016. The revised forecast taken into account in the present DAB was agreed at the 169 th ACOR meeting on 19 May 2017. The use of an updated forecast of own resources improves the accuracy of the revenue forecasts and hence of the payments that Member States are asked to make during the budgetary year. As compared to the forecast agreed in May 2016, the forecast agreed in May 2017 has been revised as follows 12 : \u2013 Total 2017 net TOR are now forecast at EUR 20 507,3 million (after deduction of 20 % in collection costs), which represents a decrease of -4,47 % relative to the forecast of EUR 21 467,0 million included in the 2017 budget. The Commission compared the results of the traditional ACOR forecasting methodology (based on the spring 2017 macroeconomic forecast) with the results of the extrapolation based on the latest outturn data for collected customs duties (January \u2013 April 2017). Since the difference between the two methods was relatively significant (EUR 1 220 billion) the traditional ACOR updated TOR forecast is fully adjusted to the extrapolation method forecast. \u2013 The total 2017 EU uncapped VAT base is now forecast at EUR 6 487 607,8 million, which represents an increase of +0,16 % compared to the May 2016 forecast of EUR 6 477 447,9 million. The total 2017 EU capped VAT base 13 is forecast at EUR 6 468 770,4 million, which represents an increase of +0,15 % compared to the May 2016 forecast of EUR 6 459 187,15 million. \u2013 The total 2017 EU GNI base is forecast at EUR 15 177 843,6 million, which is a decrease (- 1,51 %) compared to the May 2016 forecast of EUR 15 410 553,3 million. 12 The total forecast of 2017 net sugar sector levies remains at the same level, however due to the change in the collection costs the amount is different (EUR 133,3 million, after deduction of 20 % in collection costs). 13 In accordance with Council Decision 2014/335, if the VAT base of a Member State exceeds 50 % of its GNI, then it is capped at this 50 %. For DAB 6/2017, six Member States will have their VAT base capped at 50 % of GNI: Estonia, Croatia, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta and Portugal. ",
        "11 The exchange rates of 30 December 2016 have been used for converting the forecast VAT and GNI bases in national currency into euro (for the nine Member States that are not members of the euro area). This avoids distortions since it is this rate that is used to convert budgeted own resources payments from euro into national currency when the amounts are called in (as stipulated in Article 10a(1) of Council Regulation No 609/2014). The revised forecasts of TOR, uncapped VAT bases and GNI bases for 2017, as adopted at the 169 th ACOR meeting on 19 May 2017, are set out in the following table: Revised forecasts of TOR, VAT and GNI bases for 2017 (in million EUR) Sugar levies (80 %) Customs duties (80 %) Uncapped VAT bases GNI bases Capped VAT bases 14 BE 7,0 2 180,8 181 702,0 430 857,3 181 702,0 BG 0,4 74,3 23 169,3 48 254,9 23 169,3 CZ 3,6 253,9 69 591,7 170 821,6 69 591,7 DK 3,6 333,1 109 543,6 294 073,0 109 543,6 DE 28,1 4 214,7 1 344 582,5 3 292 895,8 1 344 582,5 EE 0,0 29,1 11 013,6 21 710,8 10 855,4 IE 0,0 277,1 82 328,0 231 429,7 82 328,0 EL 1,5 156,9 72 702,4 181 726,6 72 702,4 ES 5,0 1 521,4 511 216,1 1 157 887,3 511 216,1 FR 33,0 1 599,0 1 016 719,6 2 324 154,3 1 016 719,6 HR 1,9 45,8 28 337,3 46 300,3 23 150,2 IT 5,0 1 910,7 649 635,8 1 705 264,7 649 635,8 CY 0,0 20,3 12 082,5 17 909,5 8 954,8 LV 0,0 40,7 10 662,9 26 452,1 10 662,9 LT 0,9 77,0 16 556,7 39 240,8 16 556,7 LU 0,0 19,5 26 940,4 37 268,3 18 634,2 HU 2,2 140,1 48 357,0 116 824,7 48 357,0 MT 0,0 11,9 6 757,1 9 843,1 4 921,6 NL 7,7 2 433,2 304 311,3 712 882,7 304 311,3 AT 3,4 204,1 168 078,0 360 646,5 168 078,0 PL 13,7 608,6 179 446,7 422 847,6 179 446,7 PT 0,2 138,3 93 756,3 187 067,6 93 533,8 RO 1,0 148,0 63 769,3 174 951,6 63 769,3 SI 0,0 67,6 19 185,3 40 910,3 19 185,3 SK 1,4 95,7 28 850,4 82 304,9 28 850,4 FI 0,8 140,5 94 101,7 220 743,3 94 101,7 SE 2,8 497,4 208 548,1 488 888,5 208 548,1 UK 10,10 3 134,5 1 105 662,2 2 333 685,8 1 105 662,2 EU-28 133,3 20 374,0 6 487 607,8 15 177 843,6 6 468 770,4 3.3 2016 and 2013 UK correction 3.3.1 Introduction The correction of budgetary imbalances in favour of the United Kingdom (UK correction), to be budgeted in the present DAB, concerns two years: 2013 and 2016. The 2013 UK correction is subject to the rules of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the European Communities' own resources 15 and its accompanying working document, 14 The amounts highlighted in grey result from the capped VAT bases, as explained in footnote [11] above. 15 OJ L 163, 23.6.2007, p. 17.

Pursuant to the rules of this Decision, the net TOR \u201cwindfall gains\u201d of the UK resulting from the increase since 2001 in the percentage of TOR retained by Member States as a compensation for their collection costs are neutralised and the allocated expenditure is adjusted by the total allocated expenditure in Member States that have acceded to the EU after 30 April 2004, except for agricultural direct payments and market-related expenditure as well as that part of the rural development expenditure originating from the EAGGF, Guarantee section. The 2016 UK correction is subject to the rules of Council Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom on the system of own resources 17 of the European Union and its accompanying working document, the 2014 Calculation Method 18 . Pursuant to the rules of this Decision, the net TOR \u201cwindfall gains\u201d of the UK resulting from the increase since 2001 in the percentage of TOR retained by Member States as a compensation for their collection costs are neutralised (taking into account the collection cost of 20%) and the allocated expenditure is adjusted by the total allocated expenditure in Member States that have acceded to the EU after 30 April 2004, except for agricultural direct payments and market-related expenditure as well as that part of the rural development expenditure originating from the EAGGF, Guarantee section. Furthermore, the share of Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden in the financing of the UK correction is reduced to one fourth of their normal share for both, 2013 and 2016 corrections. The reduction is financed by the other Member States, excluding the UK. The difference between the definitive amount of the 2013 UK correction and the amount previously budgeted (the 2 nd update entered in AB 5/2016) is entered in chapter 35 of the present DAB. The difference between the 1st update amount of the 2016 UK correction and the amount previously budgeted (the provisional amount entered in Budget 2017) is entered in chapter 15 of the present DAB. 3.3.2 Calculation of the corrections In the present DAB, the calculation and financing of the 1 st update of the 2016 UK correction and the definitive amount of the 2013 UK correction are entered. The update of the corrections for 2013 and 2016 stems mainly from the update of the VAT and GNI bases as communicated by Member States in autumn 2016. In addition the update of the correction for 2016 also takes into account the allocated expenditure of 2016. 3.3.2.1 2016 UK correction The following table summarises the changes between the provisional amount of the 2016 UK correction entered in Budget 2017 and the 1 st update of the 2016 UK correction to be entered in the present DAB. 2016 UK correction 2016 UK correction PROVISIONAL Budget 2017 2016 UK correction 1st UPDATE DAB 6/2017 Difference 16 Commission working document of 23 May 2007 \"Calculation, financing, payment and entry in the budget of the correction of budgetary imbalances in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of Council Decision [2007/436/EC, Euratom] on the system of the European Communities' own resources\u201d available on: http://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/documents/financing/calc_own_res_2007_en.pdf. 17 OJ L 168, 7.6.2014, p. 105-111. 18 Commission working document of 14 May 2014 \"Calculation, financing, payment and entry in the budget of the correction of budgetary imbalances in favour of the United Kingdom (\"the correction\") in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of Council Decision [2014/335/EC, Euratom] on the system of own resources of the European Union\u201d available on: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52014DC0271&rid=8.
