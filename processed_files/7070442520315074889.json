        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand v | P a g e ABSTRACT This report examines the potential economic, social, human rights and environmental impact of the EU-New Zealand FTA. We employ a multi-pronged methodological approach, combining the economic modelling results provided by DG Trade with qualitative analysis based on literature review, discussions with experts and extensive consultations with key stakeholders. The EU-New Zealand trade and investment relationship is characterised by relatively low tariff and non-tariff barriers on average, but with peaks for certain products and regulations. The analysis of the potential economic impacts shows overall positive macro-economic effects for the EU and New Zealand, based on an analysis also incorporating an FTA between the EU and Australia. In the EU, bilateral exports in 2030 are expected to be 31.7 percent higher compared to a situation without the FTA, and real GDP to increase marginally (all in the ambitious scenario). For New Zealand, bilateral exports are expected to expand by 23.4 percent, welfare by \u20ac 567 million, and real GDP by 0.5 percent. There is, however, sectoral variation with beverages and tobacco, vegetables & fruits and dairy gaining most in New Zealand and motor vehicles and machinery in the EU. SMEs in the EU and New Zealand as well as consumers in both countries are also expected to benefit. The trade diversion effect for third countries will be very limited, while value chain analysis shows that connected third country economies could benefit. Wages are expected to remain equal (for the EU) or increase (for New Zealand) for both unskilled and skilled workers. The human rights effects are expected to be marginal, except for some potential effects in sectors that are negatively impacted. Environmental effects are expected to be marginally negative. ",

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 1 | P a g e 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Objectives and key features of SIAs 1.1.1. Objectives The European Commission, DG Trade, under Multiple Framework Contract TRADE2017/A5/01 issued a Request for Services TRADE 2018/C2/C07 to provide \u201cSustainability Impact Assessments (SIA) in support of the free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations between the European Union and New Zealand, and between the European Union and Australia\u201d. This study concerns the SIA for the EU-New Zealand FTA (EU-NZ FTA). SIAs consist of two equally important and complementary components: \uf0b7 A robust analysis of the potential economic, social, human rights and environmental impacts that the trade agreement under negotiation could have, in the EU, in the partner country(ies) and in other relevant countries; \uf0b7 A continuous and wide-ranging consultation process, which ensures a high degree of transparency and the engagement of all relevant stakeholders in the conduct of the SIA inside and outside the EU. Three relevant framework sources for doing a SIA are the Handbook for Trade Sustainability Impact Assessments (2nd Edition), the Better Regulation Package, and the Guidelines on the analysis of Human Rights impacts in impact assessments for trade- related policy initiatives. All three sources are used as frameworks in this study. 1.1.2. Key features In line with the Handbook for Trade Sustainability Impact Assessments, the key features of this study are: \uf0b7 An integrated approach to assessing the impact of the EU-NZ FTA based on the four sustainability pillars: economic, social, human rights and environmental; \uf0b7 Engagement in the EU and New Zealand with key stakeholders, including civil society, providing important inputs into the study; \uf0b7 A multi-pronged approach \u2013 combining quantitative analysis, gravity regression work, with qualitative approaches like literature reviews, expert and stakeholder interviews, and survey work; \uf0b7 Apart from an overall analysis, providing deep sectoral dives (of five prioritised sectors) and in-depth analyses in the form of case studies; \uf0b7 Develop useful policy recommendations, including flanking measures, for the negotiations and potential EU-NZ FTA. 1.2. List of key issues for the SIA supporting the negotiations of an EU-New Zealand FTA Based on outreach to stakeholders and based on work on baselines for the sustainability pillars, we present the following non-exhaustive list of important issues: \uf0b7 From an economic perspective the analysis of the sectors of ruminant meats and dairy are interesting to focus on because according to the quantitative analysis the impact of the FTA on them is relatively high. \uf0b7 The social baseline analysis suggests that despite progress, gender gaps remain on the labour market in both the EU and New Zealand, in terms of employment rate, pay, occupied positions, and the number of hours worked. Moreover, men and women tend to have different sectoral preferences in choosing jobs and setting up enterprises, which means that the EU-NZ FTA may affect them differently in their roles of workers and entrepreneurs. Accordingly, the analysis will pay attention to the impact of the FTA on women and gender equality. Preliminary findings also ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 2 | P a g e suggested that job quality is an issue in some sectors which are likely to be affected by the EU-NZ FTA, including ruminant meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, and utilities, including construction. These rank high as regards the number of accidents at work and are characterised by low to medium wages, low presence of trade unions (notably in agriculture) and identified cases of exploitation of migrant workers and work in conditions akin to modern slavery. \uf0b7 Based on the human rights baseline analysis , the FTA\u2019s impact on the rights of indigenous populations (in particular land and property rights that refer to the compliance with the principle of free prior and informed consent) needs to be studied, also in the context of the topic of business and human rights as this matter may be directly related to companies\u2019 activities on the territories owned or traditionally used by indigenous populations. \uf0b7 Initial findings on the possible impact of the EU-NZ FTA on environment suggested that right to clean environment, right to water and right to health may potentially be affected and should therefore be analysed in more detail. Methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous- oxide (N 2 O) emissions contribute significantly to New Zealand\u2019s overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (43 percent and 12 percent of all GHG emissions in New Zealand respectively). The sectors that are majorly responsible for these emissions (mainly agriculture) are likely to be strongly affected by the FTA (based on the ex- ante study) and therefore warrant a closer analysis. Changes in the pressure on biodiversity, particularly on endemic species present in New Zealand should be investigated in a post EU-NZ FTA world, amongst others via the changes expected in land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). 1.3. Structure of the report This report is structured as follows, as also shown in Figure 1.1. In the introductory Chapter 1, we provide the objectives, key features and structure of the project as well as overviews of the EU-NZ trade relationship at the moment and a summary of the impact assesment research work done on a potential EU-NZ FTA to date. Chapter 2 presents a summary of the methodological approach for each of the components of the study: our overall methodology and the consultations approach. The more extensive methodological approach can be found in Annex II. Chapter 3 covers the overall analysis. Starting from economic, social, human rights and environmental baselines we look at the expected impact of the EU-NZ FTA on each of these four pillars overall. Particular attention is paid to the effect of the FTA on women and SMEs (separate sections). In Chapter 4 we turn to the sectoral effects. For five selected sectors we cover a baseline analysis, followed by expected sustainability effects (economic, social, human rights, environmental) stemming from the EU-NZ FTA. We also look at the sectoral effects on SMEs, women, and for third countries. Finally we analyse for each sector how the EU-NZ FTA affects (relative) competitiveness. Chapter 5 summarises the consultation approach and findings. Throughout the report (i.e. in Chapters 3 and 4) we illustrate and underpin findings with inputs from key stakeholders, but the core findings and approach are presented in this Chapter. Core results and outcomes of the consultation process are covered in particular. Finally, Chapter 6 presents the policy recommendations and flanking measures we propose. These measures are intended to be suggestions on how to shape elements of the FTA in order to enhance the positive effects and mitigate the potential negative effects. ",

The EU-New Zealand trade and investment relationship In this section, we present a concise overview of the EU-New Zealand trade and investment relationship. A more detailed description for each section can be found in Annex III to this report. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 4 | P a g e 1.4.1.Merchandise trade According to European Commission data, total EU-NZ trade in goods amounted to nearly \u20ac 9.2 billion in 2018, making the EU New Zealand\u2019s third largest trading partner after China and Australia. 1 EU imports from New Zealand ( \u20ac 3.5 billion in total) are largely dominated by agricultural products while EU exports to New Zealand ( \u20ac 5.7 billion in total) mainly comprise manufactured goods. Primary products account for almost three quarters (74.8 percent) of EU imports from New Zealand, followed by manufactures (23.4 percent) and relatively few other products (1.9 percent); meat and fruit represent by far the most important sub-categories, followed by beverages, spirits and vinegar. EU exports to New Zealand mainly comprise manufactured goods (85.8 percent), followed by primary products (11.6 percent). More than half of the EU\u2019s exports to New Zealand are machinery and transport equipment (56.4 percent), with chemical products, scientific instruments and plastics representing other significant product categories. 1.4.2.Agricultural products Trade in agricultural products is important in the EU-NZ trading relationship. Agricultural products comprised 10.8 percent of the EU\u2019s total exports to New Zealand in 2018 ( \u20ac 616 million) and 70.0 percent of the EU\u2019s total imports from New Zealand ( \u20ac 2.43 billion). The EU in particular imported meat, edible fruits, beverages, spirits and vinegar from New Zealand in 2018. The EU\u2019s large trade deficit with New Zealand in agricultural products comes despite the relatively high EU import tariffs in this sector. While EU-NZ agricultural trade faces relatively high tariffs on many products, and some key exports of New Zealand are subject to WTO tariff rate quotas (TRQs), NTMs are often even more important (as elaborated in Annex III.1 and in the detailed sector studies below). These include human and animal health protection measures, lack of GI protection, biodiversity and biosecurity measures, and strict and lengthy import certification procedures on both sides. 1.4.3.Services trade Total EU-New Zealand services trade in 2017 amounted to \u20ac 4.7 billion. The EU is the third largest export destination for New Zealand\u2019s services (after Australia and the US) and the second largest source of New Zealand\u2019s services imports (after Australia). The EU\u2019s largest services imports from New Zealand in 2017 were travel services, which accounted for 58.5 percent of the EU\u2019s total services imports from New Zealand. The EU\u2019s largest service export sectors to New Zealand in 2017 were transport and travel services which together accounted for nearly three-fourths of EU service exports to New Zealand. 1.4.4.Investment The EU is the second largest source of FDI in New Zealand (after Australia) and it is also New Zealand\u2019s third largest destination for direct investment abroad (after Australia and the US). The stock of EU inward FDI in New Zealand amounted to \u20ac 6.6 billion in 2017, while the stock of New Zealand's investment in the EU was \u20ac 1.9 billion. The sectoral composition of FDI suggests that the bulk of the flows are concentrated in the finance and wholesale and retail trade sectors. New Zealand has no bilateral investment treaties (BITs) concluded with EU Member States. Consequently, EU investors face several restrictive or less favourable investment measures compared to other countries, in particular CPTPP members. 1.4.5.Tariffs and Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) According to UNCTAD TRAINS data, New Zealand has the highest bound tariffs on textiles and clothing (23 percent), agricultural products (6.2 percent on average), and machinery and transport equipment (16.3 percent). Its applied MFN tariffs are, however, much lower, the highest ones being in textile and clothing, which are close to 10 percent. The EU\u2019s highest tariffs on imports from New Zealand are on agricultural products (7.7 percent on 1 In this report, unless noted otherwise, historical data for the EU refer to the EU28, whereas projections refer to the EU27 following the withdrawal of the UK. See Box 2.2 in section 2.1.1 for more detail. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 5 | P a g e average) and textiles and clothing (9 percent). See Table III.1.3 in Annex III.1 for further details. With respect to NTMs, it is important to note that the EU and New Zealand have a bilateral agreement for mutual recognition of certain technical certificates, covering medicinal products and devices, telecommunication equipment, low voltage equipment, machinery and pressure equipment. They also concluded a veterinary agreement in 2003 (and updated it in 2015) to simplify trade in live animals and animal products. According to the World Bank\u2019s Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI, 2017), on average, the EU is slightly more restrictive in its services trade policy than New Zealand, with an average overall STRI of 0.22 relative to 0.21 for New Zealand. The EU's services trade policy is particularly restrictive in air transport and legal services, while New Zealand is most restrictive in air transport services. Regarding investments, EU investors face several restrictive or less favourable investment measures compared to investors from Australia and other countries with which New Zealand has concluded FTAs and Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs), in particular most recently compared to CPTPP member states. 2 New Zealand has a pre-investment screening mechanism (Overseas Investment Act 2005) 3 in place, which enables it to screen foreign investments in certain areas, namely, acquisition of sensitive land, 25 percent or more shareholding in businesses and fisheries and since recently also residential land. 4 New Zealand also imposes high tariffs on agricultural products, dairy and cars (see above), which affects investments in those sectors. 1.5. Literature review This section provides an overview of previous impact studies conducted that are relevant for the EU-NZ FTA context. The literature review looks first at a range of studies that analyse the effects of current and anticipated FTAs of New Zealand and the EU. Second, as New Zealand and the EU are both active in promoting closer trade relations in the Asia- Pacific region, we also present some of the findings of the most important impact assessment studies that are relevant for New Zealand and the EU respectively in the Asian region. The analysis is summarised in Table 1.1. 1.5.1. Impact assessment literature review of a potential EU-NZ FTA In 2009, Ecorys (2009) conducted a study on the impact of FTAs in the OECD, specifically focussing on an EU-NZ and EU-AUS FTA, an EU-US FTA, and an EU-Japan FTA. The results of a possible EU-NZ FTA showed that it would entail an estimated increase of 4.3 percent in exports for New Zealand and an increase of 0.2 percent in exports for the EU. According to the study, the welfare effects would be positive for both parties, with increases of \u20ac 1.6 billion and \u20ac 3.5 billion respectively. LSE Enterprise Ltd. (2017) extended the analysis on the EU-NZ and EU-AUS FTAs and found that an EU-NZ FTA would entail positive results for both parties: The GDP of the EU and NZ would increase by 0.02 percent and 0.5 percent respectively, and exports of both the EU and NZ would increase by 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. 2 Commission Staff Working Document Impact Assessment - Accompanying the document Recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the opening of negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with New Zealand {COM(2017) 469 final} {SWD(2017) 290 final} Brussels, 13.9.2017, p. 7, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017SC0289&from=EN 3 http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2005/0082/latest/DLM356881.html?search=ts_act_overseas+ investment&sr=1 4 See for details the website of the Overseas Investment Office (OIO): https://oio.linz.govt.nz/ ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 6 | P a g e 1.5.2.Impact assessment literature review of relevant NZ FTAs One of the most important FTAs for NZ is the AUS-NZ Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA). As it came into effect in 1983, the impact of the comprehensive agreement can be easily observed. The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia (2006) states under a qualitative report that through ANZCERTA, both New Zealand and Australia experienced an annual bilateral trade increase of 9 percent and a GDP increase of 3.1 percent and 3.8 percent respectively. Petri and Plummer (2016) focus on the Trans- Pacific Partnership (TPP) and expect increases of 2.2 percent and 0.2 percent in NZ\u2019s and EU\u2019s GDP respectively. Exports of NZ and the EU are also expected to increase by 10.2 percent and 0.5 percent respectively. Kawasaki (2014) and Lee and Itakura (2014) also estimate annual GDP increases for all TPP members. Walmsley et al. (2018) extend the analysis and explore the impact of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the successor to the TPP after US withdrawal in early 2017, on NZ\u2019s and other CPTPP member countries\u2019 economies. They estimate a maximum GDP increase of 1.0 percent and a maximum export increase of 3.2 percent for NZ, whilst the maximum average increase in GDP for the other CPTPP members is approximately 0.4 percent. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) (2009) analysed the economic impact of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). Even if the EU is not the focus of this analysis, the findings are relevant for the present study as the agreement would have significant economic implications for NZ, the EU and the rest of world. The results imply that NZ\u2019s and EU\u2019s GDP would increase by 6.4 percent and 0.2 percent respectively. APEC also estimates trade growth of 10.4 percent for NZ, whereas the EU\u2019s exports would decrease by 0.3 percent. Kim et al. (2013) estimate that NZ\u2019s GDP would increase by 0.2 percent to 1.8 percent, whilst the EU\u2019s GDP could decrease by up to 0.1 percent. The New Zealand Government (2009) conducted a qualitative impact analysis of the economic, social, cultural and environmental implications under the ASEAN Australia New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA). The study states strongly that the AANZFTA is in the national interest as it entails large potential for all signatories. Ando and Urata (2006) analyse different frameworks for ASEAN FTAs and project that NZ\u2019s economic activity would increase under these arrangements. Further studies focus on the effects of exclusive FTAs in Asia and the ASEAN region. New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (2004) conducted a study on the economic effects of an FTA with China and estimates an overall increase in GDP, welfare, and trade for both countries. NZ and China are likely to face modest increases in GDP of 0.3 percent and 0.1 percent respectively. Tan and Cai (2009) predict similar outcomes under their first scenario. The NZ Institute for Economic Research (2007) researched the Korea-NZ FTA and estimates GDP increases of 0.1 percent for Korea and 0.3 percent for NZ. A 2004 joint study report by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New Zealand 5 suggested 0.07, 0.17 and 0.07 percent increases in China\u2019s real GDP, real consumption and total output, respectively, ten years into the FTA, while New Zealand\u2019s real GDP, real consumption and total output level were estimated to increase by 0.25, 0.55 and 0.25 percent respectively. Over a 20\u2013year period from 2007 to 2027, New Zealand exports to China were expected to be between US$180\u2013280 million higher per year (20 to 39 percent above baseline), while Chinese exports to New Zealand were expected to increase by an annual average of between US$40\u201370 million per year (5 to 11 percent above baseline). Most gains accrue from removal of tariff and unnecessary NTMs and were expected across all sectors for both China and New Zealand. 5 https://www.mfat.govt.nz/assets/FTAs-agreements-in-force/China-FTA/NZ-China-FTA-chinanzftastudy- November-2004.pdf ",

Petri and Plummer (2018) 8 examine the gains from continued Asia-Pacific trade integration. Their CGE results suggest that as a result of RCEP, in 2030, income in New Zealand will increase by 0.6 percent and exports will see a 3.1 percent rise. 1.5.3.Impact assessment literature review of relevant EU FTAs As the EU has completed negotiations and entered into a few FTA negotiations in Asia, one is able to find a vast amount of studies assessing the impact of these FTAs. LSE Enterprise Ltd. (2015) conducted an impact assessment of the EU-Japan FTA and estimated a GDP increase of 0.8 percent for the EU and 0.3 percent for Japan. Bilateral trade flows were also expected to increase by 34 percent and 29 percent respectively. The ASEAN Prosperity Initiative (API) (2018) studied the economic effects of an EU-ASEAN FTA and highlighted the long-run expected potential gains for all members. The agreement would cause a 0.2 percent increase in EU\u2019s GDP, whilst largely increasing the GDPs of the ASEAN countries, e.g. Indonesia (3.4 percent), Vietnam (14 percent), and Singapore (12.3 percent). In addition, a few studies focus on the effects of exclusive FTAs with ASEAN members. Grumiller et al. (2018) analyse the economic and social effects of the EU- Vietnam FTA and expect a marginal real GDP increase for the EU and an increase of 0.5 percent for Vietnam. The DG for External Policies (2018) analysed the FTA between the EU and Singapore and projected a 10 percent increase in bilateral trade volumes, entailed by a 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent increase in GDP for the EU and Singapore, respectively. For the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), Ecorys (2017) estimates that GDP will increase between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent for the EU and between 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent for the US. EU and US exports are also expected to increase by 4.6 percent and 7.2 percent respectively. 6 https://www.interest.co.nz/business/102423/prime-minister-announces-upgraded-nz-china-fta-expected- be-signed-early-2020-says 7 https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ASEP_a_00218 8 https://minerals.org.au/sites/default/files/180905%20Australia%20will%20gain%20from%20continued %20Asia-Pacific%20trade%20integration.pdf ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 8 | P a g e Using a CGE model based on the GTAP database, Francois et al (2007) 9 evaluate two scenarios for a possible EU-Korea FTA, comparing it to the maximum potential of a full FTA. Their \u201crealistic\u201d FTA scenario yields a total gain for the two economies of 26 percent of the potential in a full FTA. In their more ambitious scenario entailing liberalization of services trade, total gains increase to 46 percent of the total potential from a full EU-Korea FTA. Their results suggest that both partners gain economically from all analyzed levels of trade liberalization, but the gains are unevenly distributed, with two-thirds of the total gains in all scenarios accruing to Korea, emanating from the higher initial protection levels of the Korean economy. CGE simulations in the CEPII/ATLASS (2010) 10 study show positive effects of the EU-Korea FTA on GDP for both the EU (0.08%) and Korea (up to 0.84%). Welfare gains are also found to be positive and significant for Korea (up to 1.12%) and are much larger than those for the EU (+0.02%). The higher welfare gains expected for Korea are essentially due to its initial higher level of protection as well as to its smaller economic size relative to the EU. Both partners show positive and significant effects on bilateral trade \u2013 Korea\u2019s exports to the EU increase by 38.4%, while EU bilateral exports to Korea increase even more (up to 82.6%). In the CGE analysis of Kirkpatrick et al (2011) 11 , the CETA is expected to lead to overall gains in welfare, real GDP, total exports, balance of trade and real wages in both Canada and the EU over the long-term. Their estimates suggest increases in real GDP for the EU of 0.02% to 0.03% over the long-term, and from 0.18% to 0.36% for Canada. Total exports are also expected to increase over the long-term from 0.05% to 0.07% in the EU and from 0.54% to 1.56% in Canada. Canada is likely to gain most from the removal of tariffs and the EU from the removal of barriers to trade in services. The CETA is expected to generate minor degrees of welfare loss for excluded countries, though the overall impact on these countries is insignificant. The services sector is expected to gain the most from liberalization, while the liberalization of sensitive agricultural products is estimated to have pronounced impacts on output and trade over the long-term. In EC (2017) 12 , DG Trade carried out an economic impact analysis of the EU-Canada CETA, using the CGE model. The simulation results suggest gains emanating from tariff elimination, and FDI liberalization for goods and services bindings, leading to an annual increase in bilateral trade of at least 8 percent. This amounts to approximately \u20ac 12 billion per year additional two-way trade by 2030, split roughly evenly between the two parties. EU sectors with the largest gains in exports to Canada include dairy (+ \u20ac 300mln), automotive products (+ \u20ac 880mln), chemicals (+ \u20ac 451mln), textiles, apparel and leather products (+ \u20ac 812mln) and business services (+ \u20ac 644mln). The agreement is expected to add between \u20ac 1.7-2.1 billion to EU GDP on an annual basis. CETA also includes an ambitious procurement chapter opening new business opportunities for EU companies interested in bidding for public contracts in Canada at all levels (including procurement at the provincial level). This is estimated to offer new legal guarantees for open, non- discriminatory access to an additional \u20ac 32 billion per year of the Canadian public procurement market. It is also estimated that EU companies could gain nearly \u20ac 540 million annually in new contracts. 9 http://www.i4ide.org/content/wpaper/dp20070301.pdf 10 http://www2.cepii.fr/PDF_PUB/rr/rr2010_02.pdf 11 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/28812/1/MPRA_paper_28812.pdf 12 https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/september/tradoc_156043.pdf ",

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 11 | P a g e 2. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH 2.1. Overall methodological approach 2.1.1. Economic approach The economic approach is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessment techniques. The economic modelling (Box 2.1) as a starting point, the Global Simulation Model for case studies, and gravity analyses for FDI and public procurement constitute the quantitative techniques we employ, while the qualitative techniques involve statistical analysis, literature and desk research, and interpretation of survey results with key stakeholders that have engaged in our survey work. We end the economic analysis by providing policy recommendations and flanking measures. Box 2.1: Brief summary of the economic model used The starting point for the SIA analysis are the simulations of the FTA\u2019s economic effects undertaken by the European Commission DG Trade using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The model, which is based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database and model, simulates the combined effects of the EU-AUS FTA and the EU-NZ FTA for 32 economic sectors 13 and 15 regions in the world. The simulations are done for two theoretically possible negotiation outcomes with different degrees of liberalisation: \uf0b7 Conservative scenario: Here, tariffs only on non-agricultural products are assumed to be reduced to zero, while for agricultural products they are not reduced. Also the tariff equivalents of barriers to services trade are reduced by 3%; \uf0b7 Increased liberalisation (or ambitious scenario): In this scenario, in addition to the liberalisation in the conservative scenario, agricultural tariffs and rate quotas (TRQs) and the EU\u2019s entry price system for fruits and vegetables are abolished, and NTBs on non-agricultural goods in Australia and New Zealand (but not the EU) are reduced (assuming a 10% drop in their tariff equivalent). It should be noted that the scenarios were defined in a way to estimate the theoretically possible range of effects which the FTA could have, not as a prediction of actual negotiation outcomes. The modelling results as reported compare the situation that would result in the year 2030 with the FTAs in place (in the two scenarios) and the situation in the same year that would prevail without the FTA in place. The results reported do not show changes compared to the situation today. Source: European Commission (2017g) and authors\u2019 explanations We consistently report the impact of the EU-NZ FTA on the EU as modelled by DG Trade in March 2019, which treats the EU27 (without the UK) and the UK separately (see Box 2.2). We look at the following economic variables in the analysis in a quantitative way: trade flows (bilateral exports and imports; exports and imports to the rest of the world); investment; output; prices; welfare and GDP; as well as fiscal revenues. In addition, we cover FDI and government procurement effects quantitatively as well as conduct a Global Value Chain (GVC) analysis. Qualitatively, we look at main non-tariff measures (NTMs) of relevance to the EU-NZ FTA, as well as rules of origin. We also do a literature review on earlier relevant impact assessment work. The analysis also includes a discussion on the limitations of the CGE results. We pay special attention to SMEs in a separate section, in particular to the \u2018SME test\u2019 (the \u2018think small first\u2019 principle) and how the FTA could ease NTMs for SMEs and increase legal certainty. Geographically, we not only look at the effects of the EU-NZ FTA on the EU and New Zealand, but also \u2013 separately \u2013 at Turkey, the EU\u2019s Outermost Regions, Overseas Countries and Territories, and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). 13 The 32 sectors distinguished in the model were determined by the Commission by aggregating the 57 GTAP sectors. As is common for CGE models, due to data availability constraints, services sectors are more aggregated that goods sectors. Thus, the Commission\u2019s model distinguishes only six non-goods sectors, some of which comprise fairly heterogeneous sectors; for example, business services are combined with communication services. For more detail, see European Commission (2017d). ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 12 | P a g e Box 2.2: Treatment of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU in this study The UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU on 31 January 2020 raises obvious issues for the datasets used in this study. At the time of preparing the ex-ante study (LSE 2017) and the Impact Assessment (European Commission 2017), the economic modelling estimated the FTA effects on the EU28. Considering the impending withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Commission re-simulated the FTA effects for the EU27 (i.e. the EU without the UK) in early 2019, and these new simulations constitute the basis for the present SIA. Specifically, the anticipated impacts reported in this study on the European side refer to the EU27. However, in reporting the current state of play or current situation, we refer to the EU28 because the current situations are by definition about the then28 EU Member States. For methodological reasons \u2013 i.e. to isolate the effects of the EU-NZ FTA 14 \u2013 the EU27 simulation assumes no change in the UK\u2019s trade policy after withdrawal from the EU. 15 Accordingly, the differences between the two CGE simulations are marginal in relative terms (percentage changes), as the table below illustrates for bilateral trade at the sector level. In absolute terms (i.e. changes in euros), the EU27 values are smaller than the EU28 ones because the UK is no longer calculated as part of the EU.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 13 | P a g e 2.1.2. Social approach The social analysis seeks to respond to the question of how a reduction of tariffs and NTMs between the Parties via signing the EU-NZ FTA may affect a range of social aspects in the EU and New Zealand. We also seek to determine potential direct and indirect social impacts of other provisions of the future FTA, e.g. on Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD). For each of the following social aspects we analyse first the current situation, then analyse the expected impacts and conclude by suggesting policy recommendations and flanking measures related to: employment levels, women (as workers, entrepreneurs, traders and consumers), consumer welfare (including inequality and vulnerable groups), job quality, rights at work, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and public policies (e.g. social protection, healthcare). Gender equality issues will be presented in a separate section. 2.1.3. Human rights approach The human rights approach looks at how the EU-NZ FTA could affect the enjoyment of and state\u2019s responsibilities regarding human rights. Conceptually, we use an approach that is based on De Schutter (2011) and the European Commission Guidelines for the analysis of human rights impacts in impact assessments for trade-related policy initiatives (European Commission, 2015). First, we provide a concise overview of the human rights legal framework . Second, we carry out a screening and scoping exercise to identify specific key human rights/issues that are most likely affected. Third, we focus on a limited number of selected human rights/issues and carry out a detailed assessment (quantitative and qualitative) of these rights, substantiating on the extent to which particular measures foreseen in the proposed Agreement may affect the enjoyment of the relevant rights. Finally, we propose policy recommendations and relevant flanking measures. 2.1.4. Environmental approach In the environmental impact assessment, we assess the most significant potential environmental impacts resulting from the EU-NZ FTA on both the EU and New Zealand. The environmental analysis results in a clear and concisely written report detailing, both in a quantitative and qualitative manner, which environmental impacts are likely to occur. We start by looking at the different FTA elements that could have environmental impact, followed by an analysis of the impact channels (i.e. the mechanisms through which the FTA elements can result in environmental impacts). This helps us to define the different specific environmental areas which can be affected by the FTA elements, the so-called impact areas (e.g. air quality, biodiversity). For each of these impact areas, we carry out a quantitative and qualitative impact assessment and draw policy recommendations and propose flanking measures if necessary. 2.1.5. Sector and case study selection and methodology Sector selection and methodology We use four criteria to prioritise a maximum of five sectors (CGE based) to look at in more detail. First, importance of the sector for the economy (sector\u2019s size in employment, output/value added). Second, the magnitude of the FTA\u2019s expected economic impact on a sector (based on economic impact). Third, magnitude of FTAs expected social, human rights and/or environmental impact. Fourth, importance of a sector as indicated by key stakeholders and issues of relevance for the negotiations. We also factor in a gender equality and SME perspective and we also aim for broad economic coverage (by trying to include at least one agricultural, one industrial and one service sector). Based on these criteria, we selected ruminant meats, dairy, machinery, motor vehicles and transport equipment, and communication and business services . For each of these sectors we first look at the current situation, then cover the economic expected effects followed by the three sustainability pillar effects (social, human rights, environmental). In addition, we look at the effects for SMEs and third countries as well as how competitiveness of a sector is affected, as well as draft policy recommendations and flanking measures. ",

These allow us to go beyond the modelling results and delve into specific relevant issues important for stakeholders. The selection of case studies was based on four selection criteria to prioritise: First, key stakeholder suggestions for case study topics. Second, relevance for one/more sustainability pillars. Third, specific/narrow economic effects. Fourth, relevance for the negotiations.

Economic impact analysis 3.1.1.Overall macro-economic effects The economic analysis suggests that the EU-NZ FTA is likely to have positive impacts on both the EU (which is defined as EU27, excluding the UK) and New Zealand economies (see Table 3.1) in both the ambitious and conservative scenarios. By 2030, compared to the baseline, real GDP is not expected to change in the EU in relative terms in either scenario, though still sizeable in euros, by \u20ac 1.8 billion in the conservative scenario and \u20ac 3.9 billion in the ambitious one. For New Zealand real GDP is expected to increase by \u20ac 1.3 billion in the ambitious and \u20ac 0.7 billion in the conservative scenario. The absolute gains are larger for the EU compared to New Zealand given the comparative sizes of the two economies. The effects of the EU-NZ FTA on welfare (i.e. on producers, consumers, government) in the EU and New Zealand are \u20ac 2.2 billion for the EU and to \u20ac 381 million for New Zealand in the conservative scenario and \u20ac 4.1 billion and \u20ac 567 million respectively in the ambitious scenario. The economic gains are driven mainly by EU exports to New Zealand, though changes in New Zealand\u2019s exports to the EU also are expected to be positive. EU bilateral exports to New Zealand increase by 13.5 percent while New Zealand exports to the EU rise by 10.2 percent in the conservative scenario and by 31.7 and 23.4 percent respectively in the ambitious scenario. EU total exports do not change in the conservative scenario and rise marginally by 0.1 percent in the ambitious one. New Zealand\u2019s export gains are relatively larger, with 0.7 and 0.4 percent increases in the ambitious and conservative scenarios respectively.

Real wages are almost unchanged in the EU (see footnote 6), 16 We round off the expected economic effects to one decimal behind the comma because presenting more detailed results would give a false sense of accuracy due to the error margins of the model. In case the rounded off effects are 0.0, we do add a \u201c+\u201d or \u201c\u2013\u201d to show if the rounded off effect was marginally positive or negative. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 16 | P a g e and in New Zealand real wages are expected to increase by 0.7 percent for unskilled workers and 0.5 percent for skilled workers in the ambitious scenario (and 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent for the two skill categories in the conservative scenario). This shows the economic benefit of the EU-NZ FTA. 3.1.2.Sectoral effects In this section, we look at the overall sectoral effect expected to result from an EU-NZ FTA by 2030. As always, the CGE simulation results quantify the effect of the FTA in comparison to a situation without the FTA being in place (the \u201cbaseline\u201d), not a comparison with the situation today. We focus our reporting on exports from EU to New Zealand and from New Zealand to the EU as well as changes in output at sectoral level for the most impacted sectors in the EU and New Zealand. Table 3.2 reports this sectoral impact, and Table 3.3 ranks the top 15 sectors by the expected changes in bilateral export value. We believe this is the right measure to use because a very large relative change is meaningless if the base export values to which that relative change related is almost zero. For example, the 2,612 percent increase in gas exports from the EU to New Zealand may look impressive, but currently EU gas exports to New Zealand are \u20ac 3,375 \u2013 essentially zero \u2013 so an increase in 2,612 percent means EU gas exports to New Zealand increase from \u20ac 3,375 to \u20ac 88,165. This is 0.007 percent of the increase in machinery exports from the EU to New Zealand and thus essentially zero. Sectoral export effects The top sectors for the EU likely to be impacted in terms of increase in export values to New Zealand are machinery ( \u20ac 1.3bn in the ambitious scenario), motor vehicles and transport equipment, chemicals, metal product, electronic equipment, and textiles. The industrial sector gains are mainly driven by the reduction of NTMs facing goods trade with New Zealand. The gains are nearly twice as large in the ambitious scenario, reflecting the assumption that NTM reductions are more ambitious than in the conservative scenario, coupled with knock-on effects from services liberalisation which drives additional income gains. The leading services sector effects are in communication and other services. It is important to note, however, that services sector liberalisation has an impact beyond the services sectors, because there is a significant service component in each of the manufacturing final products that are exported. The reason some sectors (e.g. several service sectors) appear to see lower export growth in the ambitious scenario than in the conservative one has to do with the pull for resources from those (agricultural/ manufacturing) sectors that draw capital away from service sectors in line with stronger comparative advantages being revealed. In the ambitious scenario, the largest gains for New Zealand\u2019s exports to the EU are seen in agriculture (dairy - \u20ac 466 million, beef and sheep meat - \u20ac 356 million, vegetables, fruits & nuts and other food) followed by industrial products (chemicals; textiles; and metal products) and services (other services, transport services and communication services). The potential gains for dairy and beef and sheep meat do not feature in the top-15 most impacted sectors in the conservative scenario (see Table 3.3) because in the conservative scenario these two sectors are not part of the liberalisation scenario. In addition, the beef and sheep meat potential gains are likely to be overestimated because of New Zealand\u2019s current less than full quota fill rates under the existing TRQ system. Sectoral output effects The FTA impact on production at the sectoral level reflects the combined effects of changes in bilateral exports, changes in bilateral imports (which take up some market share in the domestic economy), the effects of trade diversion, inter-sectoral demand impacts through input/output relationships, and the impact of overall income changes due to the FTA. The expected changes in sectoral output for the EU and New Zealand from the EU-NZ FTA are also reported in Table 3.2. ",

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 19 | P a g e The EU experiences losses in sectoral output in several of the 32 sectors in both the conservative and ambitious scenarios, although the output effects are very small. The production declines are relatively larger in beef and sheep meat (0.2 percent and -1.4 percent in the two respective scenarios) and fruits and vegetables (-0.2 percent). In contrast, motor equipment registers a 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent rise in sectoral output in the conservative and ambitious scenarios. New Zealand experiences losses in sectoral output in 13 sectors each in the conservative and ambitious scenarios, respectively, especially in motor equipment (-1.3 percent and -2.7 percent), cereals (-0.9 percent and -1.7 percent), machinery (-0.6 percent and -2.8 percent) and other meat (-0.4 percent and -1.1 percent). At the same time, gains in sectoral output occur in all remaining sectors, and these are especially large in the case of fruits and vegetables (2.6 percent and 2.2 percent), beef and sheep meat (-0.1 percent and 4.6 percent), and beverages and tobacco (0.7 percent and 0.7 percent). Services sectors in New Zealand benefit across the board, ranging from a 0.2 percent increase in output in transport services and 0.7 percent in utilities in the conservative scenario to 1.7 percent in utilities in the ambitious scenario. EU gains in services are much smaller in relative terms (due to the larger sizes of these sectors when compared to New Zealand). The gains for New Zealand also reflect the greater liberalisation of New Zealand\u2019s services imports, especially in the ambitious scenario, which puts a downward pressure on prices in these sectors, increasing the competitiveness of these sectors resulting in output increases. Case Study 3.1: Vegetables, fruits and nuts (VFN) Introduction The importance of the horticultural sector is particularly high for New Zealand (Figure CS3.1-1). Figure CS3.1-1: Bilateral trade EU and New Zealand in VFN (2013-2018) VFN are the second largest sector in terms of EU imports from New Zealand, after ruminant meat and followed by beverages and tobacco. New Zealand\u2019s major fruit and vegetable commodities exported to the EU are apples, pears and quinces, including kiwi fruits, the most important export ( \u20ac 188 million), onions, shallots & garlic ( \u20ac 41.2 million) and other fresh fruit products ( \u20ac 296 million). EU exports of fruits and vegetable products are comparatively small and mainly comprise of coffee ( \u20ac 3.4 million), other fruit products ( \u20ac 1.9 million) and vegetables ( \u20ac 1.5 million). Current situation While New Zealand\u2019s tariffs are zero for most VFN categories, the EU imposes relatively high tariffs on VFN products imported from New Zealand. The EU applied tariffs are 9.6 percent for onions, 12.3 percent for dried vegetables, 7.2 percent for apples, pears and quinces, and 8 percent for other fresh fruit products. In addition, products such as kiwi fruit are subject to seasonal tariffs. According to Horticulture New Zealand , duties on kiwifruit make up 80 percent of the duties applied by the EU in this sector. For New Zealand, the relatively high EU tariffs on horticultural exports are a challenge because many third country competitors benefit from substantially lower tariffs 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 V a l u e ( \u20ac m l n ) Export Import ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 20 | P a g e due to FTAs they have with the EU. Tariff differences become even more significant when the EU grants zero duties to third countries with comparable harvesting cycles. For example, the EU applies a 9.6 percent tariff for New Zealand onions, while competitors from Chile, Peru and South Africa now enjoy a 0 percent tariff. At the same time, the New Zealand Horticulture Export Authority (NZHEA) appreciates the \u201cspecial status for apples, pears and kiwifruit whereby conformity checking against the EU marketing standards are performed in New Zealand and thereby negating the need for compliance inspection on arrival\u201d (NZHEA, 2016). With respect to the EU\u2019s Entry Price System , its present impact on New Zealand\u2019s effective market access is difficult to evaluate. In New Zealand, the Government introduced a commodity levy for onions in 2013, supplemented by a voluntary exporter levy , with a participation rate of 90 percent of production. These levies seem to be effective. The EU does not have trade defence actions such as safeguards or anti-dumping / anti-subsidy measures in place against New Zealand. Nonetheless, New Zealand still applies anti-dumping measures against canned peaches from Greece (with foreseen expiry date of 14.7.2020). In terms of private production and shipping standards , NZHEA notes that \u201cNew Zealand is the only country in the world with a 100 percent GLOBAL G.A.P. certification rate for apples and kiwifruit, and for post-harvest the BRC Global Standards.\u201d The absence of binding, multilateral phytosanitary standards for plant health, including biosecurity surveillance, may complicate the adoption of a bilateral Mutual Recognition Agreement \u2013 especially where Parties have undertaken commitments in other agreements (e.g. CPTPP, CETA, ASEAN-AUS-NZ FTA). Horticulture provides 60,000 jobs in New Zealand. It is estimated that tasks related to harvest and pruning require around 30,000 workers, 17 one third of whom come to New Zealand under the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme, which enables recruitment of seasonal workers mainly from Pacific islands, with an increasing annual cap, currently at 12,850 persons, set in 2018. 18 The sector hires also other groups of short-term migrant workers, including students with right to work. In 2018, sector representatives welcomed the Government\u2019s intention to review the immigration policy, including rules related to temporary work visas to provide more certainty for migrant workers and farmers and to help attract skilled migrant workers to regions where New Zealand\u2019s residents with the right skills set are not available. 19 Stringer (2016) revealed examples of exploitation of short-term migrant workers, including in the sector of horticulture, relating to working excessive hours and severe underpayment. To address the problem of exploitation of migrant workers, the Government has taken diverse measures, including preparation of information materials for migrant workers about their rights 20 and introducing regulations banning employers breaching employment standards from hiring migrant workers (US Department of State, 2018). 21 The Government agency WorkSafe has published a guide on health and safety at work in horticulture. 22 There are also private sector initiatives aiming at improved working conditions. The New Zealand\u2019s Health and Safety at Work Strategy 2018-2028 is also meant to improve workers\u2019 protection. It assumes focus on areas with the potential of the greatest impact of action, i.e. groups of workers being most in need, including migrant and seasonal workers, and enterprises needing support (MBIE, 2018c). 17 Horticulture NZ, Increase in Pacific worker numbers good for horticulture: http://www.hortnz.co.nz/news- events-and-media/media-releases/increase-in-pacific-worker-numbers-good-for-horticulture/ 18 New Zealand Immigration, Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme: https://www.immigration.govt.nz/ about-us/research-and-statistics/research-reports/recognised-seasonal-employer-rse-scheme 19 NZ Herald: Farmers, growers welcome immigration proposals (of 18 December 2018): https://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&objectid=12178976 [accessed on 15 May 2019] and Horticulture NZ, Proposed temporary visa changes welcomed by horticulture: http://www.hortnz.co.nz/news-events-and-media/media-releases/proposed-temporary-visa-changes- welcomed-by-horticulture/ 20 Information materials for migrant workers explaining their rights have been prepared and published in Chinese, Korean, Hindi, Vietnamese and other languages spoken by the largest groups of migrants: https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/policy-and-law/integrity-of-the-immigration-system/migrant- exploitation [accessed on 3 June 2019] 21 Labour inspection in New Zealand publishes lists with the names of employers (companies) who have breached employment standards with regard to migrant workers and have been banned from recruiting migrant workers.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 21 | P a g e In the EU, the VFN sector provided 9 percent of all full-time equivalent jobs in agriculture in 2016 with high shares of seasonal workers and non-family members (compared to other sub-sectors in agriculture) due to the labour-intensive nature of work in the sector. In 2013, seasonal and non- family workers (including domestic workers, citizens of other EU Member States and third country citizens) in horticulture represented one third of all workers of this category employed in EU agriculture (with higher shares for the Netherlands, Spain and Poland, among others) 23 (European Parliament, 2019). There have been reports about tough working conditions and cases of exploitation of seasonal migrant workers in the sector in some EU Member States. This included long working hours, low pay, exposure to chemicals and inadequate accommodation in cases when workers lived on or close to farms. 24 Despite the importance of fruits and vegetables in New Zealand\u2019s exports, fruit and vegetable growing constitutes a minor share of total agricultural land use in New Zealand. A comparison of all environmental impacts of different agricultural commodities also revealed that fruits and vegetables have one of the lowest environmental impacts across various impact categories 25 . Still, a meta-review of LCA studies in the fruits and vegetables sectors globally 26 finds that material inputs used such as fertilizers, pesticides, fuel (for machinery) and electricity are the dominant contributors to most of the environmental impact created by the sector. Emissions of ammonia, methane, nitrous oxide and embodied CO 2 emissions in the fertilizers are found to create particular impact on climate change, water quality (through eutrophication) and acidification of soils and waters (leading to loss of biodiversity). Next to these, impacts due to irrigation were also reported to be substantial, driven by the need to extract water and operating pumps based on fossil fuels for it. The type of production (open-field or greenhouse) can give rise to differences in overall environmental impact (greenhouses typically worse for climate change, but better for impact on soil and water and vice versa). In New Zealand, the predominant production mode is open field. A study in Britain also found that environmental impacts associated with transport can make a significant difference for its overall climate change footprint, with locally produced apples to be found 87% less harmful in terms of GHG emissions compared with imported apples 27 . A life-cycle assessment around the production of apples in New Zealand (its second largest export product after kiwifruit) 28 , finds that the environmental impact of apple production locally is dominated by the impact it creates on soil, which in turn is fully explained by the use of pesticides for pest control, which can in turn affect biodiversity depending on soil. Secondly, the negative impact of fertilizer use on water quality is found most significant, since excess fertilizer run-off can create eutrophication and acidification of water bodies. It should also be mentioned though that the extent of environmental impacts differed strongly from site to site depending on their agricultural management practices. Impact assessment Table CS3.1-1 shows the economic modelling results for the VFN sector. EU production decreases by 0.2 percent while production of VFN in New Zealand grows between 2.2 percent and 2.6 percent, compared to the baseline. EU exports do not change while New Zealand\u2019s exports to the EU increase significantly.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 22 | P a g e New Zealand, the estimated percentage changes in aggregate consumer prices are below the perception threshold for both liberalisation scenarios. These results suggest that the EU-NZ FTA may bring about increases in employment in the VFN sector in New Zealand by 2.9 percent for skilled and unskilled workers under the conservative scenario and by 2.4 percent for unskilled workers and 2.5 percent for skilled ones under the ambitious scenario, and it is expected to positively impact the right to work and right to an adequate standard of living , especially because overall wages in New Zealand also go up. This effect is related to the expected increase in New Zealand\u2019s exports to the EU. In the EU, we expect a limited employment reduction of -0.2 percent for both, skilled and unskilled workers and under both scenarios, marginally negatively impacting the right to work in the VFN sector. However, because real wages go up marginally, this is mainly due to other sectors pulling workers away from VFN in the EU. In New Zealand, as outlined in the preceding section, there are initiatives aiming at ensuring safe working environment in the sector, which could help avoid increase in the number of accidents at work related to employment growth in the sector. The EU-NZ FTA may also contribute to an increased demand for seasonal workers in New Zealand, incl. short-term migrants, given the expected growth in output and exports. In this context, the right to just and favourable conditions of work needs to be monitored to ensure that working conditions for these workers are decent and meet established standards, and that cases of workers\u2019 exploitation are prevented and when they happen, are investigated and addressed.

The overall impact of the FTA on climate change is still expected be negative due to the increase in exports of fruits and vegetables between New Zealand and the EU and the impact of transportation on the climate footprint of a typical product in the sector (90% as explained above). There will be some substitution of imports from other third countries in favour of New Zealand, but since New Zealand in terms of distance is likely to be further than the average distance of imports of VFN in the EU currently, the emissions effect related to imports of VFN into the EU is expected to be positive. Impact on air quality in either the EU or New Zealand of the FTA will be negligible due to the absence of significant emissions of other than GHG air pollutants. Other local environmental impacts related to VFN production will similarly increase in New Zealand and decrease in the EU. Particularly emissions of ammonia, methane and nitrous oxide from the use of fertilizers can create negative impacts on water quality (through eutrophication) and acidification of soils and waters if not adequately managed. However, due to the overall scale of these impacts in the sector (modest compared to other produce) and the relatively limited increase in output expected (between 1.9% and 1.4% in New Zealand), the overall environmental impacts are expected to be limited. Policy recommendations Of mutual benefit for both parties would be a binding commitment to a process that resolves technical trade issues within agreed timeframes. This commitment could also allow for the recognition, based on the equivalence of the phytosanitary status in each party, of export consignments based on approved operators and independent third-party verification agencies. While the EU\u2019s phytosanitary system imposes few restrictions on the importation of horticultural products from New Zealand, import approval procedures for each of the EU member states are considered as additional trade barriers, unnecessary in view of the Single Market common ",

Given that the EU-NZ FTA is likely to trigger an increase in demand for seasonal and migrant workers in the VFN sector in New Zealand, it will be important to ensure that working conditions for these groups are decent, protecting their right to work . While this will be a primary obligation of employers, the situation should be monitored by trade unions and labour inspection and cases of breaching the standards identified and addressed. In this context, New Zealand should continue applying measures helping to prevent exploitation of migrant workers, e.g. promotion of information materials in their own languages, and publication of names of employers banned from employing migrant workers for breaches in their rights. Value chain dimension Global value chains (GVCs) play a much greater role in global trade in the 21st Century than they did in the previous one. The fragmentation of production of goods and services across entities and borders is a new phase in the evolution of the global economy. According to Kowalski (2015), FTAs \u201chave a higher impact on trade flows of intermediate goods in manufacturing sectors than on aggregate trade flows. [\u2026] the impact is greater when the agreement is regional in character\u201d. In addition, the WTO (2011) has provided evidence suggesting that FTAs increase trade in parts and components by 35 percent among the parties and each additional legally enforceable provision increases trade in parts and components by almost 2 percentage points. For both Australia and New Zealand, it is important to keep in mind that their geographical location relatively far away from main global trade routes, has an impact on their baseline GVC engagement. In this sub-section we focus on the goods and services sectors that are important from the perspective of value-added trade between the EU and New Zealand. Essentially, these are the sectors in which the EU imports significant intermediate inputs from New Zealand, which are then used in domestic production in the EU that caters to both domestic consumption in the EU and EU exports, both within the EU and the rest of the world, including New Zealand. Any tariffs and/or NTMs on the products in these sectors thus lead to a two-fold escalation of costs between the partners \u2013 once when the products are imported as intermediate inputs and then when they are exported as final products. The data for these sectors, converted to Euro million, are sourced from the WTO-OECD TiVA (\u201cTrade in Value Added\u201d) database and are reported for the year 2015. Table 3.4 reports New Zealand\u2019s value added in EU final demand for the year 2015, according to the WTO-OECD TiVA\u2019s sectoral classification. New Zealand\u2019s value added embodied in EU final demand captures the value added that New Zealand\u2019s industries export both directly, through exports of final goods or services and, indirectly via exports of intermediates that reach EU final consumers. The measure reflects how domestic industries (upstream in a value-chain) are connected to consumers in other countries, even where no direct trade relationship exists. The indicator illustrates therefore the full upstream impact of final demand in foreign markets to domestic output. It can be interpreted as 'exports of value added'. These data suggest that the EU\u2019s final demand has driven New Zealand\u2019s value added the most in wholesale and retail trade; agriculture, forestry and fishing; and food products, beverages and tobacco. Wholesale and retail trade alone contributed 16.1 percent of New Zealand\u2019s value added in EU final demand in 2015.

It can be interpreted as 'imports of value-added'.

Results from the economic analysis suggest that the EU-NZ FTA is not expected to have an effect on LDCs (Table 3.8). By 2030, compared to the baseline, real GDP is not expected to change.

In total, they are home to 4.8 million citizens. Despite the thousands of kilometres separating them from the European continent, these regions are an integral part of the EU. Therefore, EU law and the rights and duties associated with EU membership apply to the ORs. These EU ORs are primarily active in traditional sectors, as agriculture, fishing and livestock farming. Typical ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 27 | P a g e products produced in these regions include exotic fruits and vegetables (e.g. bananas, melons, sugar cane, tomatoes and potatoes), fish through fishing or fish farming, and meat through livestock farming. The Azores for example produce approximately 30 percent of Portugal\u2019s total milk production (European Commission, 2017). Several ORs, such as Canary Islands, Martinique and French Guiana, have diversified their economies towards small industries in the construction and public works sector, the wood sector, and the mining industry. The majority of these regions also largely depend on their hospitality, tourism and cruise sectors. Similar to the ORs, the EU\u2019s Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) remain largely active in the agriculture, fishing and livestock farming sectors. There are a few exceptions in the EU\u2019s OCTs, such as Cura\u00e7ao and Aruba, which have developed into petroleum and bunkering hubs (CIA, 2019). For the majority of OCTs, as for the ORs, tourism plays a vital role in their economies. Potential impact of the EU-NZ FTA Overall, the trade volumes between the ORs/OCTs and the EU/New Zealand are relatively small. Table 3.10 depicts the trade values between the specified regions, the EU and New Zealand. Overall, the imports of ORs from the EU are much larger than the exports to the EU. The largest trade volume with the EU is Canary Islands with a total of \u20ac 246.2 million in exports and \u20ac 2.3 billion in imports, which is followed by R\u00e9union and French Guiana. Trade between the EU\u2019s ORs and New Zealand is negligible, with exports amounting to less than \u20ac 1.0 million and somewhat larger imports worth approximately \u20ac 16.1 million.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 29 | P a g e As mentioned above, the ORs are active exporters in a specific set of industries. Table 3.11 shows the major trading sectors between the ORs and the EU and New Zealand. Through matching these identified top sectors with the modelling results of the ambitious scenario of the EU-NZ FTA, we are able to identify the potential shocks and changes in the respective sectors. Several export sectors of the ORs are projected to face some negative competitive shocks. These sectors include the various vegetables and fruits sectors, the dairy sector, the beverages and tobacco sector, the fishing sector, the chemicals sector, the metal products sector. The exports from New Zealand to the EU in these sectors will increase by 36.6 percent, 133.3 percent, 14.5 percent, 19.3 percent, 28.7 percent and 15.9 percent respectively. Furthermore, the export of sugar from New Zealand to Europe is projected to increase by up to 418.5 percent in the ambitious scenario (albeit from a low initial export value). As all of these industries play an important role in the economies and export structure of the ORs, especially in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, R\u00e9union, Canary Islands, the Azores and Madeira, which export primarily these goods to the EU, the increase in New Zealand\u2019s exports in these respective sectors could imply negative effects for the ORs. However, to which extent these potential negative effects will actually result in a serious deterioration of the economic situation in these regions is not quite clear, as specific exports from New Zealand might not be direct competitors of OR exports. A further analysis of some important product groups shows that: \uf0b7 In the beverages sector, both New Zealand and Madeira are major wine exporters. However, as the wine types that are exported differ largely, wine imports originating from New Zealand might not affect the wine exports of Madeira, as the demand for that specific wine type will remain after the introduction of the EU-NZ FTA. \uf0b7 Similarly, direct competition is not expected in the sugar sector, which according to the model simulations is expected to see sizeable increase of exports from New Zealand to the EU, and which is an important commodity for the economies of the French ORs. The impact of the FTA on the ORs in this industry is nevertheless expected to be negligible, firstly because New Zealand is not a producer of the speciality sugars produced by the ORs, and secondly because even after the increase in exports to the EU the absolute volume of exports will continue to be small. \uf0b7 In the dairy sector, exports from New Zealand to the EU are calculated to increase by 133 percent under the ambitious scenario, indicating the maximum impact that the FTA could have in the \u2013 purely theoretical \u2013 case of full liberalisation in the agricultural sector. The sector is also important for the Azores, which is a large producer of dairy products, the large majority of which (83% in value terms) 29 are exported to Portugal. As in the previous cases, however, direct competition between New Zealand\u2019s exports and the Azores\u2019 products is expected to be limited, and the effect of the FTA on the Azores is therefore also expected to be small. First, in volume terms liquid milk is the major export of the Azores to Portugal (about 100,000 tonnes per year), which is not a major export item of New Zealand to the EU. In addition, Portugal has not imported any dairy products from New Zealand, which indicates that market competition between New Zealand and the Azores is and will remain limited. Nevertheless, taking into account that the ORs\u2019 economies depend heavily on the sectors in question, during the negotiations the EU and New Zealand should endeavour to agree on specific measures, such as safeguard clauses or quotas, to ensure that the ORs are not negatively affected. These findings can be applied to the EU\u2019s OCTs as well, as both regions are similar in level of economic development and trade structures. 29 Statistical data in this paragraph are taken from Servi\u00e7o Regional de Estat\u00edstica dos A\u00e7ores (2000).

According to the New Zealand Institute for Economic Research (NZIER), top sources of FDI inflows into NZ include Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Cayman Islands as well as the US, with investments centring on the service sector and manufacturing. The stock of inward FDI in New Zealand was estimated at \u20ac 67.6 billion in 2017 by UNCTAD in its 2018 WIR, more than half of which comes from Australia, followed by the US, Hong Kong, UK, Singapore, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands and China 30 . Finance and insurance; manufacturing; agriculture, forestry and fishing; distribution services and utilities were the top recipients of FDI stock as can be seen from Figure 3.1. The EU is the second largest source of FDI in New Zealand (after Australia) and it is also New Zealand\u2019s third largest destination for direct investment abroad (after Australia and the US). The stock of EU inward FDI in New Zealand amounted to \u20ac 6.6 billion in 2017, while the stock of New Zealand's investment in the EU was \u20ac 1.9 billion.

Similarly, New Zealand investors could benefit from such FTA if it establishes one harmonized level playing field for EU and New Zealand investors. Besides, the non-application of the pre-screening mechanism for EU investments (what New Zealand currently still does vis-\u00e0-vis European investors) would likely to result in equal treatment of EU investments with investments coming from countries with which New Zealand has already concluded FTAs. This should result in significantly more EU FDI into New Zealand. To quantify the FDI impact, we use the approach outlined in Annex II. The estimates are reported in Table 3.12 and suggest that preferential investment liberalisation is associated with a 87.2 percent increase in inward FDI flows (from the FTA partner) and a 20.8 percent rise in inward FDI stock (from the FTA partner). This number is the average effect of the gains from investment liberalisation based on all investment agreements of the 36 countries in the analysis (see Annex II for methodological details). As such this effect is also applicable in the case of the EU-NZ FTA. On average this would translate into average EU-NZ FDI flows in 2017 increasing from \u20ac 3.9 million to \u20ac 7.2 million and average EU-NZ FDI stock in the same year rising from \u20ac 303.7 million to \u20ac 366.9 million.

Procurement We provide estimates of bilateral EU-NZ procurement using the OECD\u2019s Inter Country Input Output (ICIO) database for the year 2015. These data suggest that the total value of New Zealand Gross Government Final Consumption (GGFC) from EU28 was \u20ac 445.2 million compared to the total value of EU28 GGFC from New Zealand of \u20ac 101.45 million. We call the GGFC \u2018public imports\u2019 as they relate to imports of public procurement from the respective countries. The share of New Zealand in total EU28 public imports in 2015 was 0.2 percent while the EU\u2019s share in total New Zealand public imports was a much higher 40.5 percent. Table 3.13 presents a disaggregated analysis of EU public imports from New Zealand and vice-versa, using OECD ICIO data for the year 2015. These data suggest that the EU\u2019s GGFC from New Zealand was concentrated in food products, beverages and tobacco (24 percent), wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles (21.9 percent), transportation and storage (21.8 percent) and chemicals and pharmaceutical products (10.6 percent). The bulk of New Zealand\u2019s GGFC from the EU was in chemicals and pharmaceutical products (40 percent), transportation and storage (20 percent), wholesale and retail trade (12 percent), other transport equipment (6 percent) and motor vehicles, trailers and semi- 31 Commission Staff Working Document: Impact Assessment regarding the Recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the opening of negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with Australia, {COM(2017) 472} {SWD(2017) 292}, Brussels, 13.9.2017 SWD(2017) 293 final, p. 7, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/ legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017SC0293&from=EN ",

The results of the gravity work (with approach outlined in Annex II) are reported in Table 3.14 and suggest that preferential procurement liberalisation is associated with a 50.4 percent increase in public imports. This is the average effect of preferential procurement liberalisation for the sample countries covered in the analysis. Since these effects are average effects, they are also expected to be applicable to the EU-NZ FTA, given that New Zealand is also an OECD economy like most EU Member States. On average, the estimated effects would translate into average EU-NZ public imports in 2015 increasing from \u20ac 273.3 million to \u20ac 410 million.

EU negotiators should ask for the removal of thresholds for investments in New Zealand, so that no investments (or only very large ones) will be pre-screened. The EU should ask New Zealand at the minimum for EU investors to be treated similar to other foreign investors with which New Zealand has an FTA (e.g. CPTPP). \uf0b7 We recommend that EU and New Zealand negotiators aim at reaching a comprehensive and ambitious agreement on bilateral opening of public procurement markets. Because the EU accounts for more than 40 percent of New Zealand public procurement, a comprehensive coverage of government procurement would have 2-way positive economic effects which could be stimulated by the EU-NZ FTA. 3.2. SME impact analysis 3.2.1. Current situation regarding SMEs in the EU and New Zealand The EC defines SMEs as follows: \u201cThe category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million\u201d (EC, 2016). An SME is thus categorised based on three factors: level of employment, level of turnover, and size of the balance sheet. The official size class definition of SMEs in the EU differs from that applied in New Zealand. In New Zealand, there is no official definition of a SME business. However, New Zealand has traditionally used the following definition for statistical purposes: SMEs are generally defined as businesses with 50 or fewer employees. 32 SMEs are the backbone of the EU economy. Based on the definition, there were 24.5 million SMEs active in the non-financial business sector across in 2017, which represents 99.8 percent of all non-financial businesses. SMEs employ approximately 66.4 percent of the total EU-28 workforce, which amounts to up to 95 million employees (European Commission, 2018). SMEs also create 56.8 percent of the value added generated by the non-financial sector. In contrast, large enterprises in the EU-28 accounted for 46,547 enterprises, 47.9 million employees and 43.2 percent of the value added. SMEs can be divided into five main business sectors: accommodation and food services, business services, construction, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade. The majority of SMEs are working in retail (26.3 percent) or the service sectors (27.2 percent). About 8.8 percent are working in manufacturing, with a slightly larger proportion in the industry sector (14.3 percent) (EC, 2018). In 2017, SMEs continued to grow at a moderate rate. SMEs generated an average increase of 3.5 percent in the value added and an average increase of 2.0 percent in employment. In contrast, in 2016 these figures were at 1.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. For 2019, SMEs are forecasted to continue to grow. The SMEs value added is estimated to increase by 4.3 percent. SME-induced employment in is also expected to grow by 1.3 percent in 2019. On the member country basis, all Member States expect their SME value added and employment to grow. SMEs are also the backbone of New Zealand\u2019s economy. Based on the national definition there were 522,654 SMEs in 2018, which represents approximately 97 percent of all businesses. SMEs employ approximately 29 percent of the total workforce, which amounts 32 https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/30e852cf56/small-business-factsheet-2017.pdf https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/2d8f65ee1f/small-business-survey-results.pdf ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 34 | P a g e to 631,200 employees, and SMEs generate 28 percent of New Zealand\u2019s GDP (Government of New Zealand, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, 2018). 97 percent of the businesses in New Zealand have less than 20 employees. This large number of small SMEs can be explained by the fact that many SMEs \u2013 firms with 1\u201319 employees \u2013 were established in the last 5 years. Additionally, SMEs in New Zealand have a survival rate of approximately 51.4 percent. The majority of SMEs are active in the following business sectors: construction (12.8 percent), accommodation and food services (11.7 percent), primary industries (10.8 percent), and retail trade (9.9 percent). The number of SMEs in the non-financial sector increased by 5.5 percent per year on average in the period 2012- 2015. 3.2.2. EU-NZ FTA impact for SMEs in the EU and New Zealand Results of the economic analysis suggest that the EU-NZ FTA is likely to have positive impacts on SMEs. The EU-NZ FTA would improve the ability of SMEs to enter new markets through trade and investment liberalisation, global supply chains, and the overall reduction of administrative costs via lower entry and operating expenses. By 2030, compared to the baseline, the main business sectors of SMEs in the EU and New Zealand are expected to increase as a result of the FTA. Under the EU-NZ FTA, SMEs in the EU will see rather high increases in bilateral sectoral exports but overall rather small sectoral output changes under both the conservative and ambitious scenarios. Under the conservative scenario, motor equipment, beef and sheep meat and dairy sector output is expected to grow by 0.2 percent, 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent respectively. Under the ambitious scenario, the sectors to benefit the strongest include motor equipment and gas (0.3 percent), whilst the largest losers are beef and sheep meat (1.4 percent), vegetables and fruits (0.2 percent), and sugar (0.2 percent). Significant bilateral sectoral export increases can be expected under the EU-NZ FTA in various sectors in which SMEs in the EU represent major exporters. Under the conservative scenario, EU SMEs active in textiles (47.3 percent increase in EU exports to New Zealand), other meat (29.4 percent), dairy (27.2 percent), motor equipment (22.2 percent), and metal products (21.2 percent) will benefit most. Similar as in the conservative simulation, the largest winners under the ambitious scenario include SMEs active in the manufacturing, construction, and energy sectors. For example, manufacturing and industry exports from the EU to New Zealand are projected to increase by around 50 to 60 percent. The reduction of tariffs and regulatory differences among the EU and New Zealand will increase the exports and competitiveness of SMEs. Thus, as the majority of SMEs in the EU are active in the retail, manufacturing and industry sector, these companies are likely to benefit from the FTA and increase their exports as a result of the agreement. Similar to SMEs in the EU, SMEs in New Zealand are expected to see rather high increases in bilateral sectoral exports and higher sectoral outputs under the EU-NZ FTA. Under the conservative scenario, the vegetables and fruit, other animal meat, textile and utility sector output is expected to grow by 2.6 percent, 1.0 percent, 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. Under the ambitious scenario, the sectors to benefit the strongest include beef and sheep meat (4.1 percent), vegetables and fruits (2.2 percent), and utility (1.7 percent). Conversely, the industry and manufacturing sector reduces its output by 1 to 3 percent under both scenarios. Significant bilateral sectoral export increases can be expected under the EU-NZ FTA in the majority of sectors in which SMEs in New Zealand represent major exporters. Under the conservative scenario, SMEs active in the food sector will benefit from increased exports (vegetables and fruits 37.9 percent, oil seeds 21 percent, and fishing 19.2 percent), as well as SMEs active in the manufacturing and chemicals industry (chemicals 29.5 percent, metal products 16.5 percent and motor equipment 12.3 percent). Similar as in the conservative scenario, the largest winners under the ambitious scenario include SMEs active in the food, manufacturing and chemicals sectors. Sugar exports are expected to increase by 418.5 percent and dairy exports are also projected to grow by 133.3 percent. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 35 | P a g e Exports of the manufacturing and chemicals industry do not change much under the ambitious scenario. The reduction of tariffs and regulatory differences among the EU and New Zealand will increase the exports and competitiveness of SMEs. Thus, as the majority of SMEs in New Zealand are active in the food sector, construction and manufacturing, these companies are likely to benefit largely from the FTA and increase their exports as a result of the agreement. 3.2.3.Policy recommendations and flanking measures The overall recommendations derived from the economic impact analysis (section 3.1.7) also will benefit SMEs. In addition, we recommend: \uf0b7 Establish a one-stop-shop on EU-New Zealand trade for SMEs in the EU Member States and New Zealand as a flanking measure to the FTA, to ensure that SMEs have an easily accessible source of information regarding the EU-NZ FTA and how to make use of it. Much of the feedback received from SMEs points to the fact that the EU-NZ FTA is seen as very abstract and distant from their every-day concerns, and SMEs do not have the resources to investigate deeply. \uf0b7 We propose for the EU and New Zealand to establish a public-private cooperation \u2018SME task force\u2019 in both Parties, linking the Chambers of Commerce and SME representatives up with the relevant ministry departments to develop and execute a 3-year action plan to explain to SMEs the potential of the EU-NZ FTA and to work with SMEs to reap benefits and become themselves ambassadors to other SMEs. This is a flanking measure for the FTA as awareness raising is a responsibility of the EU Member States and business organisations. 3.3. Social impact analysis 3.3.1. Social state of play A detailed review of the current situation in the EU and New Zealand regarding social aspects is provided in Annex III. Below, we outline only the core elements of the current situations in the EU and New Zealand from a social perspective. Employment Levels: In the EU in 2018 the employment rate increased to 73.2 percent. The unemployment rate decreased to 6.9 percent. In 2017, around 3.2 million jobs were created, mostly in services (2.8 million). Across skills groups, highly qualified workers enjoy the highest employment rate (85.3 percent), while the rate for middle skilled is of 75.7 percent and for low-skilled, 55.6 percent. (European Commission, 2017; 2018a). In New Zealand in 2018, employment increased to 68.3 percent and unemployment declined to 3.8 percent. The Pacific People and M\u0101ori faced an unemployment rate of 6.2-8.5 percent and an employment rate of 61.1-63.3 percent (MBIE, 2018 and 2018a). In 2018, job creation was driven mainly by health care and social assistance, retail trade and accommodation. In 2015, highly skilled workers enjoyed employment rate of 87.5 percent, middle-skilled: 81.3 percent, and low-skilled: 69.1 percent (OECD, 2017b). Consumers, welfare, levels of inequality and impacts on vulnerable groups : In the EU, favourable economic conditions, minimum wage increase, and social benefit reforms contributed to increase in disposable household income. The share of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion decreased in 2017 to 113 million people, i.e. 22.5 percent. Groups most exposed to this risk include young people, children, unemployed, unskilled, third country nationals, elderly people and people with disabilities (European Commission, 2017, 2018a). In 2016, in New Zealand, 15 percent of the population lived in poverty 33 33 While there is no official definition of the poverty line in New Zealand, often it is understood as income level below 60% of median household disposable income after housing costs. In 2016, the poverty line after deducting housing costs for a household with two adults and two children lied at NZ$600 per week or NZ$31,200 annually. For a sole parent with one child it was NZ$385 per week or NZ$20,200 annually. (according to the New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services) ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 36 | P a g e (40 percent of Pacific People and 32 percent of M\u0101ori). The groups being at risk of poverty included beneficiaries of social security payments, children, and single parents\u2019 households (Council of Christian Social Services, 2017). In 2018, wages in New Zealand continued to increase (Trading Economics, 2019 and 2019a). Job quality, rights at work : Regarding non-discrimination at work, the EU adopted a Strategy on Disability (2010-2020) outlining actions to support people with disabilities, including in access to the labour market. In 2011, the employment rate of people with basic difficulty in activity was 47.3 percent (Eurostat, 2014). Regarding social dialogue and defence of workers\u2019 rights, EU Member States developed different models of social partners\u2019 engagement in the design and implementation of relevant policies. They have been involved in the reform of wage setting mechanisms, vocational education and training reforms, assistance for long-term unemployed, and labour law reform (European Commission, 2017). In 2015-2016, rates of trade union membership varied in the EU from 8 percent in France to 66.8 percent in Sweden. 34 Regarding job quality and working conditions, notably health and safety at work, construction, transport and storage, manufacturing, and agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors together accounted for 67.2 percent of all fatal accidents at work and 44.9 percent of all non-fatal accidents in 2014 (Eurostat, 2016). Regarding non-discrimination at work, New Zealand adopted the Disability Strategy 2016- 2026 (Office for Disability Issues, 2016). In 2018, the employment rate of disabled men was 23.5 percent (21.3 percent for women) (Stats NZ, 2018a). According to the OECD, immigration (notably long-term) contributes to rising level of skills in New Zealand. On the other end of the scale, there are short-term migrant workers who often take low-skill jobs (OECD, 2017b). A study carried out in 2016 revealed cases of migrant worker exploitation in construction, the dairy sector, horticulture, hospitality, cosmetic and massage services (Stringer, 2016 and University of Auckland, 2016). Regarding rights at work and the ILO fundamental conventions, New Zealand is among only 16 ILO members (out of 187) that have not yet ratified the Minimum Age Convention No. 138. Regarding social dialogue, in 2016, the rate of trade union membership in New Zealand was 17.7 percent. 35 The country has ratified the ILO fundamental Convention on Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining No. 98. Ratification of Convention No. 87 is pending. Regarding job quality and health and safety at work, the highest numbers of fatal accidents at work have been recorded in agriculture, construction and forestry (WorkSafe NZ, 2019a). The highest number of non-fatal accidents occurs in construction, followed by manufacturing and transport, with lower numbers in agriculture and mining (WorkSafe NZ, 2019a). 3.3.2. Overall sectoral effects Employment effects This part of the analysis is guided by the results of economic modelling which demonstrate how the reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers in trade between the EU and New Zealand may influence trade flows between the Parties and what impact this is likely to have on operation (output) of individual sectors and employment, i.e. job creation and job reduction across sectors. The model shows outcomes which may be expected in a longer-term (in 2030) compared to a situation in the same year without the trade agreement in place. The use of an economic model in the social analysis implies making certain assumptions and simplifications compared to the real-life situation, e.g. about fixed total employment in the economy, which means that unemployment does not exist, and workers move flexibly from declining sectors to growing ones. In reality, limitations in people\u2019s mobility (e.g. between regions of a country), mismatches between skills offered by workers and those sought by employers, time needed for training (e.g. upskilling) and other factors may prolong transition between jobs and contribute to short- or long-term unemployment. 34 https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD 35 https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 37 | P a g e Table 3.15 outlines the estimated percentage changes in employment across sectors in the EU and New Zealand under the two liberalisation scenarios (ambitious and conservative), and for two groups of workers: unskilled and skilled ones. Accordingly, for most of the sectors in the EU there will be no noticeable changes or limited ones, in the region of 0.1 percent. Slightly higher job reductions (up to 0.2 percent for both groups of workers under the ambitious scenario) may be expected in sectors covering rice, sugar, vegetables, fruits and nuts and \u2013 outside agriculture \u2013 in the coal sector. A more pronounced job reduction (up to 1.5 percent for both groups of workers under the ambitious scenario) is estimated for the ruminant meat sector. While these changes at the EU level are likely to be relatively limited, there will be a need to monitor situation in some Member States or regions which, due to a higher share of non-dairy cattle farming in economic activity and employment (e.g. in Ireland, where it has a 2.7 percent share in total employment), may potentially be more affected (in particular if effects of a few FTAs, including - for example \u2013 with Australia and Mercosur, cumulate).

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 38 | P a g e Sectors in the EU recording job creation going beyond 0.1 percent include motor vehicles and transport equipment and gas (up to 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, for both groups of workers under the ambitious scenario). While these changes are limited, locally they may bring about some relief against expected job reductions to be caused by technological changes, e.g. automation. However, new jobs may require new skills, which in turn may create a need for provision of training for existing and new workers. Positive changes may become more pronounced if similar effects of several FTAs cumulate and if ambitious scenario is followed, which may not be beneficial for other sectors (see above comments regarding ruminant meat sector). Changes estimated for New Zealand are expected to be larger and affect, both positively and negatively, more sectors. The most significant job reduction is likely to take place in the machinery sector (3.4 percent for unskilled workers and 3.1 percent for skilled ones under the ambitious scenario), motor vehicles and transport equipment (3.2 percent and 3.0 percent respectively), coal (3.0 percent and 2.2 percent), cereals (1.8 percent and 1.7 percent), metal products (1.8 percent and 1.5 percent), other meats (1.5 percent and 1.3 percent), sugar (1.5 percent and 1.2 percent), with a few more sectors likely to record job reductions in the region of 0.4-1.0 percent. In this context, it should be noted that a trend of job loss has been observed in New Zealand\u2019s machinery sector until 2017. If it continues, the estimated job reductions resulting from the EU-NZ FTA may add to it, strengthening the negative effect on the workforce. Job reductions in both the machinery and motor vehicles sectors in New Zealand may be related to increased imports from the EU. In the case of motor vehicles, imports from the EU will rise by 22.2 percent under the conservative scenario and by 43.0 percent under the ambitious one, while in the machinery sector by respectively 19.5 percent and 62.4 percent. In motor vehicles, more pronounced job reductions compared to the decline in output resulting from the EU-NZ FTA may also be related with technological changes in the sector, e.g. automation, and shift from low-skilled jobs to the more advanced ones. The biggest job creation in New Zealand is expected in the ruminant meat sector (up 4.1 percent for unskilled workers and 4.2 for skilled ones under the ambitious scenario) followed by vegetables, fruits and nuts (2.8 percent for both groups of workers under the conservative scenario), other animal products (1.1 percent for both under the conservative scenario), utility, including water supply and construction (0.9 percent for unskilled workers and 1.2 percent for skilled ones under the ambitious scenario), minerals (0.7 percent for both groups of workers under the ambitious scenario), textiles, apparel and leather (0.6 percent for both groups of workers under the conservative scenario), and dairy products (0.5 and 0.6 percent, whereas under the conservative scenario the same sector may experience job reduction of 0.8 percent for both groups of workers). In cases where job creation or reduction in a given sector is expected to differ for the groups of workers, in general slightly more favourable estimations are made for skilled workers, with the expected more pronounced job growth and more limited job reductions. The EU-NZ FTA (under the ambitious scenario) may also contribute to an increase in employment opportunities for migrant workers in New Zealand, if recently identified staff shortages in the ruminant meat and dairy sectors are not met by local workers and if immigration and visa policy facilitate recruitment overseas. Otherwise, the potential for new jobs and increased sectoral output related to the EU-NZ FTA may not materialise. On the other hand, it is difficult to predict the impact of the EU-NZ FTA on the situation of migrant workers in sectors such as machinery or manufacturing more generally, where due to skills shortages among local workers overseas recruitment increased over the last few years. Job reduction which is likely to result from the EU-NZ FTA under both scenarios, may affect them or not depending on the importance of their skills for a sector\u2019s competitiveness. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 39 | P a g e Consumers, welfare, levels of inequality and impacts on vulnerable groups According to the literature, consumers may benefit from global trade and preferential trade agreements thanks to lower prices of purchased goods and services (resulting from reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers), a wider variety and higher quality of traded goods and services and the related satisfaction of diversified needs and preferences. Concurrently, the agreement may have an impact on the accessibility of goods and services available on the market to local consumers through its effects on the purchasing power, i.e. the relation between changes in price and income levels triggered by the agreement. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) and the Consumer New Zealand have outlined in their position paper elements of a future EU-New Zealand trade agreement important from the consumer rights point of view. Accordingly, consumer protection should become one of the FTA objectives and the right to regulate in public interest should be included into exception clauses in order not to be considered as a violation of other FTA provisions. Moreover, Parties should consider negotiation of a dedicated chapter focusing on consumers\u2019 protection and benefits in the context of an FTA. The Parties could also agree to monitor impacts of tariff reduction on consumer prices (Cernat et al., 2018) and reduce barriers related to telecom services, e.g. roaming fees, geo-blocking (leading to a possibility to purchase and download content from companies located abroad, inform consumers about their rights and provide online dispute settlement related to online purchases). BEUC and Consumer New Zealand advocate upholding high levels of consumer protection, including food, product, health and safety standards, and provisions related e.g. to cosmetics, financial services or access to medicines. The EU should also be able to maintain and apply the precautionary principle, as well as hazard-based approach (the latter related to e.g. to cosmetics and chemicals). Moreover, in BEUC\u2019s view, provisions related to data flow and data protection should follow the EU and not the CPTPP approach. Regarding investment, BEUC considers that ISDS should be excluded from the FTA. A dialogue between regulators from the EU and New Zealand is also suggested, provided it does not impede work of any Party on preparing and adopting regulations. Finally, transparency of the negotiation process should be warranted (BEUC, Consumer NZ 2018). The future FTA is expected to have a limited positive impact on real wages in New Zealand (increase of 0.3 percent for unskilled workers and 0.2 percent for skilled ones under the conservative scenario and 0.7 percent and 0.5 percent respectively under the ambitious one) (see Figure 3.2). Even if wages for unskilled workers may rise minimally more than for skilled ones under both scenarios, the estimated differences are too small to bring about a reduction in inequality. Figure 3.2: Changes in real wages in the EU and New Zealand, long-term (%) Source: Authors\u2019 calculations based on CGE results provided by DG Trade (2019) Changes in wage levels estimated for the EU are marginally positive. 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.2 0.7 0.5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Unskilled Skilled Unskilled Skilled R e a l w a g e s ( % c h a n g e ) EU New Zealand Conservative scenario Ambitious scenario ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 40 | P a g e Changes in price levels in the EU under the conservative scenario are likely to be negligible, with two exceptions: they may increase for ruminant meat by 0.1 percent and decline for fruits, nuts and vegetables by 0.1 percent. Under the ambitious scenario, prices in the EU may rise by 0.1 percent for electricity, gas, utilities (incl. water supply), communication and business services, financial services, other services, and wood and paper products, and decline for fruits, nuts and vegetables by 0.1 percent, as well as ruminant meat by 0.2 percent. The overall price increase is estimated to be marginal and expected to occur in the long- term only. Changes in wage levels are reported in real terms (so corrected for price changes) and because they are marginally positive, the EU-NZ FTA has a marginally positive effect, which is important especially in the context of different expenditure baskets for different groups of the population in the society (for more details on those groups and wages in the EU, see Annex III.2). Under the conservative scenario, prices in New Zealand, including food products, are likely to record a limited increase, e.g. rice (0.1 percent), vegetables, fruits and nuts (0.7 percent), beef and sheep meat (0.1 percent), and fish products (0.6 percent). There will be a few products and services with a likely price decline, including motor vehicles (-0.7 percent), machinery (-0.3 percent), transport (-0.3 percent), other meat products (-0.4 percent), and textiles (-0.2 percent) indicating improved accessibility of products imported from the EU. In this context, while wages in New Zealand are predicted to increase in the coming years (for reasons other than FTA with the EU), the recipients of social benefits may continue to struggle due to rising housing costs and loss of certain allowances (St John, 2018). In such cases, the price increase (even if very limited) caused by an FTA and concentrated in categories, such as food products, which are an important element of expenditure basket of less affluent groups in the society, may contribute to the cumulative effect and further reduce their purchasing power (for details on those groups, see Annex III.2). Under the ambitious scenario, prices of food products will grow even further, e.g. rice (by 0.4 percent), cereals (0.2 percent), vegetables, fruits and nuts (1.0 percent), beef and sheep meat (0.5 percent), and fish products (0.5 percent). A price decline is expected for only a few groups of products and services, including motor vehicles (-1.3 percent) and machinery (-0.9 percent), as well as textiles (-0.5 percent), chemicals (-0.3 percent) and transport (-0.2 percent). Prices for other services are likely to increase by 0.1 percent (electricity and utilities, including water supply) or 0.2 percent (financial and other services). Given the predicted wage increase for both groups of workers in New Zealand (slightly higher than under the conservative scenario), this means that impacts on the accessibility of goods and services to wage-earning consumers will be similar as under the conservative scenario or slightly improve, with a limited improvement of accessibility (due to lower prices) of imported goods, e.g. motor vehicles. For other consumers, including less affluent recipients of social security benefits, the accessibility of basic goods may slightly decrease (compared to the conservative scenario and the current situation) if there are no changes in the amounts of benefits they receive. (see also comments in the preceding paragraph) Overall, it is estimated that the EU-New Zealand FTA will have a positive impact on welfare in the EU (increase by \u20ac 2.2 billion under the conservative scenario and \u20ac 4.1 billion under the ambitious one). For New Zealand, the estimated increase in welfare is likely to reach \u20ac 0.4 billion under the conservative scenario and \u20ac 0.6 billion under the ambitious one, in both cases the results are for the long-term, i.e. by 2030. Job quality The starting point for the analysis of job quality impacts is provided by the results of the economic modelling which indicates the scale of expected social (employment and wages) impacts across sectors, as discussed in the sections above. In the next step, evidence ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 41 | P a g e related to job quality indicators, their changes over time and factors influencing them in a selection of sectors, including the most affected ones, is discussed in the sectoral part of the analysis (Chapter 4 of this report). Based on these elements, this section provides conclusions concerning the scale and direction of the estimated impacts on job quality. Given that social impacts of the new Agreement for the EU are expected to be very limited to negligible (the only exception being the ruminant meat sector), it is likely that impacts on job quality indicators at the EU level will also be negligible. Job quality in the EU will probably continue to be shaped by global and technological trends (e.g. related to digital economy and increasing role of services, including new organisation of work and demand for new skills), domestic legislation, its implementation and enforcement, and trade and investment relations with main partners \u2013 more than by the EU-NZ FTA. Indeed, this observation has been confirmed by the sectoral part of the analysis e.g. in relation to motor vehicles sector, where the EU and employers have taken steps to address demand for new skills and a need to offer quality jobs and working environment to attract and retain skilled workers (for details, see Chapter 4 of this report). In New Zealand, the expected job creation in some agricultural sectors (e.g. ruminant meat or dairy) should not contribute to an increase in the number of accidents at work. Statistical data from the last decade suggests that there is no visible correlation between employment levels in agriculture in New Zealand and the number of accidents at work (e.g. peaks in the number of fatal accidents in 2012-2013 were accompanied by low employment levels and the increasing employment in the following years witnessed a continuous decline in the number of non-fatal accidents) (WorkSafe NZ, 2019 and 2019a). Moreover, in the last few years, there have been a number of initiatives taken by farmer associations e.g. Beef and Lamb New Zealand, Dairy NZ and Federated Farmers, as well as representatives of the meat processing industry aiming at improved levels of health and safety at work in the meat and dairy sectors (for details, see Chapter 4 of this report). If these initiatives are continued, then the expected employment growth resulting from the EU-NZ FTA should not contribute to a higher number of accidents at work in agriculture. It will also be important that all new workers, whether skilled migrants or short-term local workers, get an appropriate training in health and safety at work at the beginning of their contract. It can also be expected that implementation of the new Health and Safety at Work Strategy 2018-2028 will contribute to improved levels of workers\u2019 protection (for details, see Annex III.2). Furthermore, if agreed in negotiations, the EU-NZ FTA provisions on health and safety at work under the TSD chapter may encourage the Parties to take further unilateral actions and pursue bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this area improving working conditions and supporting increased protection of workers. In this context, it would be important that the TSD chapter provides a space for workshops, joint projects and other opportunities for exchange of information and best practice or search for solutions to address common challenges, and that these activities can engage sector representatives from both Parties. Regarding other job quality indicators, such as types of contracts, it is fair to assume that impacts of the EU-NZ FTA will probably be too limited, both in the EU and in New Zealand, to be able to influence types of contracts (e.g. increase pressure on sectors and encourage a move towards temporary contracts on the expense of permanent ones) even in the affected sectors. However, it may contribute to increase in the number of temporary (seasonal, casual or day-hire) contracts in sectors where these types have a relatively high share in the total employment and where the EU-NZ FTA is likely to trigger job creation (e.g. in the ruminant meat and fruits, vegetables and nuts sectors). In this context, it will be important to ensure that working conditions for these groups of workers are decent and meet the established standards, and that cases of workers\u2019 exploitation documented in some studies (e.g. regarding migrant workers) are prevented and, when they happen, are investigated and addressed (for details regarding casual and migrant workers in New ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 42 | P a g e Zealand, cases of their exploitation and recent initiatives to address shortcomings in working conditions see Chapter 4 and Annex III.2). Rights at work Non-discrimination at work Given that the situation of women on the labour market has been discussed separately, this section focuses on other groups of workers which may face challenges or discrimination on the labour market. These include e.g. disabled persons and migrant workers. In this context, effects of the future FTA are analysed mainly through its impacts on sectors of the economy employing large groups of disabled persons or migrant workers respectively, and the prospects they may have for getting, maintaining or losing a job. Moreover, in both, general and sectoral part of the analysis, we seek to determine if there are other factors, which may either improve or worsen their current situation and future employability. Given the very limited overall impacts for the EU and lack of more detailed data at the EU level regarding sectoral shares in employment of disabled persons and migrants, it is not possible to estimate precisely impacts of the future FTA on migrant workers or disabled persons in the EU, though they will probably be very limited. In New Zealand, in 2018, the highest share of disabled people worked in services sectors 36 followed by manufacturing (10.5 percent), agriculture, forestry and fishing (9.9 percent), construction (8.1 percent), and education and training (7.6 percent). Other sectors had shares ranging from 2.5 percent to 5.4 percent (Stats NZ, 2018a; for further details, see Annex III.2). Estimating impacts of the future FTA on people with disabilities for each services sector separately is not possible because services sectors employing a large part of them are not modelled separately but are included into aggregated sectors (business and communication services and other services). Services sectors employing disabled persons are expected to record job reductions ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 percent, with larger losses (from, 0.3 to 0.4 percent) estimated for unskilled workers under the ambitious scenario. In manufacturing, most of the sectors are likely to experience job losses for both groups of workers and under both scenarios, with the most significant ones expected in motor vehicles and machinery (being of around 3.0 percent under the ambitious scenario). Manufacturing sectors estimated to increase employment (under the conservative scenario) are beverages and tobacco, textiles, leather and apparel, and chemicals, rubber and plastics. The utilities sector, including construction, is expected to create jobs while the results for agriculture are mixed across sub-sectors, with significant job gains (up to around 4.0 percent for ruminant meat) and losses (close to 2.0 percent for cereals). Therefore, one can conclude that effects of the EU-NZ FTA on disabled workers are likely to be mixed, depending on sectors and sub-sectors where they will work in the period up to 2030. While over 40 percent of them (i.e. those employed in services sectors) are likely not to experience noticeable changes (the exception being unskilled workers under the ambitious scenario), a large part of 20 percent of working disabled (i.e. employed in manufacturing and agriculture) may face job reductions of a different scale and at least 8 percent (construction) may work in sectors creating jobs. However, lack of more detailed data concerning dispersion (or employment shares) of disabled workers across sub-sectors (in manufacturing and agriculture) and skills groups makes it impossible to draw more precise conclusions. According to OECD data, the majority of foreign-born migrants being of working age and living in New Zealand worked in services sectors, while 4.1 percent were employed in agriculture and fishing, and 14.4 percent in manufacturing (for details, see Annex III.2). As indicated in the preceding paragraph, while in services sectors both groups of workers under the conservative scenario and skilled ones under both scenarios may expect very 36 Health care and social assistance (13 percent), professional, scientific, technical, administrative and support services (11.8 percent), retail trade and accommodation and food services (10.9 percent). ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 43 | P a g e limited job reductions of up to 0.1 to 0.2 percent, unskilled workers are likely to face more pronounced job reductions under the ambitious scenario (0.3 to 0.4 percent). In manufacturing, most of the sectors are likely to experience job losses for both groups of workers under both scenarios, while results in agriculture and fishing will be mixed, and in the utilities sector jobs may be created. However, more precise conclusions related to the approximate number of migrant workers likely to face job reduction or benefit from job creation may be provided only if more detailed data concerning their employment shares across skills groups and sub-sectors (in manufacturing and agriculture) is available. In this context, some data has been provided in the sectoral part of the analysis in Chapter 4 and in Annex III.2. Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining As already indicated in the social description of the current situation in New Zealand (see Annex III.2), in 2016, the rate of trade union membership in the country was at 17.7 percent 37 with variations across the sectors ranging from over 40 percent of workers in health care and social assistance, education and training being a trade union member, to around 3 percent in agriculture, forestry and fishing (Stats NZ, 2016). Since 1985, the overall number of trade union members decreased by half, with the largest loss being recorded by the sector of agriculture, forestry and fishing. Factors contributing to it included legislative changes, rise in short-term and casual jobs, as well as economic restructuring of sectors traditionally having high rates of trade union membership (Parliament of New Zealand, 2000). The future FTA may add to this trend given the estimated job reductions in the majority of manufacturing sectors. These are not likely to be balanced by job creation in utilities (due to its limited scale) or agriculture (due to a very low trade union membership rate in the sector). On the other hand, New Zealand has not yet ratified the ILO fundamental convention No. 87 (freedom of association and protection of the right to organise). According to the available information, the Government of New Zealand is of the view (shared by Business NZ) that domestic legislation provides for a more limited right to strike than the interpretation of the ILO Committee of Experts. Therefore, New Zealand would be potentially in breach of the convention if it moves to ratify it. At the same time, the Government takes a position that domestic policies, legislation and practice need to be aligned with the convention before the latter is ratified. 38 Following the 2017/2018 debate on implementation of TSD chapters and commitments to improve it, the European Commission highlighted to New Zealand a need to ratify that convention. 39 Hence, the EU-NZ FTA may facilitate process leading to ratification of the convention No. 87 by New Zealand and thus contribute to a better protection of trade unions\u2019 rights (European Commission, 2019). This would provide a response to the request of New Zealand\u2019s and international trade unions calling upon the Government to ratify this convention. Moreover, negotiation of a trade agreement has the potential to encourage activity of New Zealand\u2019s trade unions, e.g. New Zealand Council of Trade Unions in a position on the New Zealand-Korea FTA (submitted to the Parliament) expressed disappointment that the agreement does not refer to the ILO fundamental conventions, has no mechanism to submit complaints in case of violation of labour rights and does not 37 See: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD 38 New Zealand (2000-2017), Country baseline under the ILO Declaration Annual Review. Freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining: https://www.ilo.org/ wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_629822.pdf 39 The issue has been mentioned in the Commission\u2019s presentation to civil society regarding implementation of the 15-point Action Plan, as well as in the reports from negotiation rounds with New Zealand. See e.g. the report from the fourth round (May 2019): https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2019/ june/tradoc_157918.pdf and Civil Society Dialogue on Trade and Sustainable Development (April 2019): https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2019/may/tradoc_157881.pdf ",

Moreover, social partners should play a role in a monitoring mechanism and have a right to submit complaints. The NZ CTU has also supported an idea of ETUC to refer to investor\u2019s responsibilities, as enshrined in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Regarding EU, the EU-NZ FTA (due to its limited social impacts) is not expected to affect the conditions for trade union operation nor the number of the affiliated members. Subject to the outcome of the negotiations, the EU-NZ FTA may provide a framework for a dialogue between Parties and civil society on any matter covered by the agreement, including freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. As the experience in implementing TSD Chapters in EU FTAs demonstrates, workers\u2019 rights are of particular interest for civil society representatives (from the EU and partner countries). They are discussed at annual meetings, also with the European Commission and Government representatives, and may become subject of cooperation activities, e.g. joint projects or seminars. Moreover, in the 2017/2018 EU debate about implementation of TSD Chapters, participants emphasised a need of taking steps, in cooperation with the partner country, to ensure alignment of the law and practice with the ILO fundamental conventions (European Commission 2017e, 2018). This has been reiterated by European employers 42 and trade unions 43 requesting also an effective enforcement mechanism for labour provisions. Implementation of future trade and labour provisions may also provide an opportunity to consider lessons learned from practical application of approaches adopted by New Zealand in its FTAs (labour-related provisions have been included e.g. into an MoU with Philippines accompanying an FTA, as well as FTAs with the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, China; Taiwan, Province of China; Malaysia, Thailand, China and CPTPP with a different scope and enforcement mechanisms). For example, the New Zealand-Korea FTA includes a labour chapter reaffirming the Parties\u2019 obligations arising from their ILO membership and the ILO 1998 Declaration, preserves the Parties\u2019 right to regulate and expresses their commitment not to fail to enforce labour legislation and not to lower labour standards to attract trade. The Parties also commit to cooperate on labour-related matters. The agreement sets up an intergovernmental Labour Committee and envisages that each Party, as well as the Committee may consult relevant stakeholders on matters related to the chapter. It excludes the chapter from the general dispute settlement mechanism. It sets up instead a dedicated mechanism based on Government consultations and a report with recommendations to be prepared by the Committee. 44 At least under four New Zealand\u2019s FTAs, the Parties undertook labour-related cooperation activities, including workshops/ seminars, capability building projects, dialogues and studies (UN ESCAP, 2017). 40 New Zealand Council of Trade Unions (2015), Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Korea: https://www.union.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/150424-NZ-Korea-FTA.pdf [accessed on 12 May 2019] 41 See: https://www.mfat.govt.nz/assets/FTAs-in-negotiations/EU-FTA/21.-NZ-Council-of-Trade-Unions.pdf 42 BusinessEurope (position paper), Trade and Sustainable Development chapters in EU FTAs: https://www.businesseurope.eu/sites/buseur/files/media/position_papers/rex/2017-11- 06_sustainability_and_ftas.pdf 43 \u201cETUC Resolution for an EU progressive trade and investment policy,\u201d ETUC, 16 June 2017, https://www.etuc.org/en/document/etuc-resolution-eu-progressive-trade-and-investment-policy [accessed 31 December 2018]. 44 New Zealand Korea FTA: https://www.mfat.govt.nz/assets/FTAs-agreed-not-signed/Korea-FTA/KNZFTA-CH- 15-Labour.pdf ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 45 | P a g e In a policy paper on its approach to trade and labour provisions in negotiations with the EU, New Zealand recognises that trade agreements should seek to protect and enhance working conditions and promote decent work, with a view to improving living standards. For New Zealand, decent work requires protection of minimum standards and generation of adequate income within an infrastructure ensuring social protection. New Zealand indicated its intention to explore in negotiations with the EU outcomes which support the ILO's objectives of promoting decent work in the global economy, including the recognition and reinforcement in each Party\u2019s domestic law the ILO\u2019s Fundamental Labour Principles and Rights at Work. Other provisions in a future TSD chapter could include: 1) the effective implementation of relevant international labour instruments that each Party has ratified; 2) the promotion of CSR / RBC by each Party in line with commitments made under instruments such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; 3) cooperation and dialogue mechanisms to enable the Party to pursue issues bilaterally as well as jointly in relevant international forums, and 4) mechanisms to promote transparency, dialogue and consultations over any issues arising. 45 Child labour New Zealand is among the 16 ILO members (out of 187) that have not yet ratified the fundamental ILO Minimum Age Convention No. 138. According to available information, the New Zealand\u2019s Government takes a position that domestic policies, legislation and practice need to be aligned with the convention before the latter is ratified. Given that in the country, there is no formal minimum age of admission to work for people below 16 years of age, the Government assumes, this would put New Zealand in breach of the Convention No. 138. Hence, domestic legislation would need to be amended beforehand and legislative steps would need to be preceded by analysis of existing legislation and data related to child labour in the country. However, the Government maintains also that the existing legislation provides enough protection for youth under 16 years of age through provisions on health and safety at work and working hours, among others. On the other hand, some (e.g. Business NZ) argue that there is a general social approval for work of older children and teenagers as a way to gain experience. 46 Trade unions have called for ratification of the Convention No. 138, as well as additional protections for working youth, such as definition of light work and setting of minimum wage. 47 In this context, it is to note that, following the 2017/2018 debate on implementation of TSD chapters and commitments to improve it, the European Commission highlighted to New Zealand a need to ratify that Convention. 48 Hence, negotiation and implementation of the EU-NZ FTA may facilitate the process leading to ratification of Convention No. 138 by New Zealand and contribute to a better protection of children\u2019s rights in that country (European Commission, 2019). According to a study commissioned in 2010 by New Zealand\u2019s Department of Labour, the main motivation (for 76 percent) for children and teenagers to engage into a paid activity was to earn money to cover their own expenditures (for other motivations see case study 3.2 box below). It was also determined that youth from socio-economic high deprivation areas are slightly less likely to work than their peers from more affluent groups (35 percent compared with 40 percent of the group), while youth from urban and rural areas had comparable shares of those engaged in part-time paid work (Department of Labour, 2010; 45 New Zealand and EU approaches to trade and sustainable development: https://www.mfat.govt.nz/assets/FTAs-in-negotiations/EU-FTA/Information-package/New-Zealand-and-EU- approaches-to-trade-and-sustainable-development.pdf 46 New Zealand (2000-2017), Country baseline under the ILO Declaration Annual Review.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 46 | P a g e for further details regarding engagement of children and teenagers into paid work, see Annex III.2). Given types of working activities and motivations, it is rather unlikely that the EU-NZ FTA has a direct impact on the number of jobs available to young persons or shares of working youth. It may have, however, an indirect impact on their economic welfare through impacts on jobs available to their parents or other household\u2019s members. In this context, it will be important that rules related to work of young persons are observed, i.e. prohibition of hazardous work for people under 18 years of age, restrictions in work at night, as well as restrictions in the number of working hours to ensure that work does not have a negative impact on education, rest and physical and mental development and wellbeing of working youth. The Convention No. 138 sets out framework conditions for work of young persons and requires that domestic legislation and practice are aligned with them. Therefore, its ratification and alignment of national legislation and practice with its provisions would ensure necessary protection of working young persons. 49 Moreover, employers 50 will need to respect health and safety at work standards and e.g. provide appropriate training for young employees (this question may be, at least partly, be addressed by the new Health and Safety at Work Strategy 2018-2028, which focuses on vulnerable groups of workers, including youth). Case Study 3.2: Children\u2019s rights and poverty Current situation In the EU, the share of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion 51 continues to decrease and in 2017 dropped to 113 million people, i.e. 22.5 percent (5 million below the pre-crisis level and 11 million less than at the peak in 2012). Groups of the population most exposed to this risk include young people (aged 18-24), children (notably children of low-skilled parents, non-EU born parents and those brought up by single parents), the unemployed, unskilled persons with at most the lower secondary education, third country nationals, elderly people and people with disabilities. The number of people living in absolute poverty decreased in 2016 to 7.5 percent (37.8 million) (European Commission, 2017 and 2018a). EU Member States are modernising their education and training systems, whereas the focus needs to be on continued learning and skills upgrading, a better alignment of education programmes and obtained skills with the labour market needs, coordination between business and education providers, and the use of apprenticeships (European Commission, 2017). In 2016, in New Zealand, 682,500 persons (15 percent of the population) lived in poverty, including 220,000 children. In 2018, poverty rate among children was between 16 percent and 23 percent, i.e. between 183,000 and 254,000 depending on whether it was measured before or after 49 The convention No. 138 sets as the minimum age of admission to work the age which ends compulsory schooling in the respective country (as a general rule, not less than 15 years and in specific circumstances 14 years of age) to enable children and youth to complete education before taking on work (no one under the minimum age should be admitted to work). It allows limited work (including the so-called light work) for youth from 13 years of age and certain limited work from 15 years of age, provided this is done in limited hours and does not jeopardise access to education. It also states that types of work permitted for young persons should be adequate to their physical and mental development and establishes (jointly with the Convention No. 182) that hazardous types of work which may have a negative impact on health, safety or morals of young persons should be prohibited for persons under the age of 18 years (and in certain circumstances they may be permitted for persons between 16 and 18 years of age, provided their full protection has been ensured). 50 According to the report of the ILO Committee of Experts, only 50 percent of employers employing children or teenagers in New Zealand provided information about health and safety at work (CEACR 2018). 51 Definition provided in the European Commission and EU Council Draft Joint Employment Report 2019: \u201cPeople at risk of poverty or social exclusion are people who are at risk of poverty and/or experiencing severe material deprivation and/or living in households with very low work intensity. People at risk of poverty are people living in a household whose equivalised disposable income is below 60% of the national equivalised median income (this indicator is therefore an income poverty indicator). People are severely materially deprived if they live in a household unable to afford at least four of the following items: 1) pay rent/mortgage/ utility bills on time; 2) keep home adequately warm; 3) meet unexpected expenses; 4) eat meat, fish or a protein equivalent every second day; 5) one week annual holiday away from home; 6) have access to a car for private use; 7) have a washing machine; 8) have a colour TV; and 9) have a telephone. People living in households with very low work intensity (i.e. (quasi-)jobless households) are people aged 0-59 living in a household where working-age adults (18-59) worked less than 20 percent of their total work potential during the past year.\u201d ",

Over the last decade, groups being at risk of poverty included beneficiaries of social security payments, children, Pasifika People, M\u0101ori, single parent households and single adults (Council of Christian Social Services, 2017). While relevant child poverty-related indicators are dropping, concerns remain about persistently high levels of child poverty. Recent data show that 27 percent of all children and young people in the country live in households with low incomes, and 7 percent of children live in severe poverty, in households with incomes below the relative income poverty line (Duncanson et al., 2018). M\u0101ori and Pasifika children, as well as children with disabilities, are reported to be disproportionately affected by child poverty and severe housing deprivation. Regular challenges in access to safe drinking water increase the risk at water- borne disease outbreaks (United Nations, 2018b). Children with disabilities are overrepresented in statistics on child poverty and are more likely to be living in one-parent households (United Nations, 2014; 2016b). Some children with disabilities, especially M\u0101ori children, have difficulty in accessing government services, including health and education services (United Nations, 2014). The 2018 UNICEF report states that the well-being of children in New Zealand is 34 th out of 41 developed countries. The report notes that specific measures are necessary on such goals as reducing child poverty, inequality and improving education and health for children due to the high rates of teen pregnancy, neonatal mortality, and high teen suicide rate (UNICEF, 2017; 2018). According to the Ministry of Health\u2019s 2017/2018 Health Survey, around 101,000 (i.e. 12.4 percent) were obese (an increase from 8.4 percent in 2006/2007). Children from socio-economically deprived areas were 2.1 times more likely to be obese than their peers from other backgrounds. 53 Around 3.0 percent of children (down from 6.6 percent in 2011/2012) did not collect a prescription for a medicine due to related cost. Pacific People\u2019s children and M\u0101ori children are twice as likely not to collect the prescription. In 2013 (the latest available data), 15.9 percent of children in New Zealand lived in crowded houses (i.e. in families needing additionally one or more bedrooms) and 5.2 percent in severely crowded households (i.e. in families needing in addition two or more bedrooms). In the same year, 43 percent of Pacific People\u2019s children and 25 percent of M\u0101ori children lived in crowded houses. 54 The 2018 OECD report suggests policy responses to reduce child poverty. These include support for parents\u2019 access or return to the labour market, training and skills development for low-skilled adults, availability of childcare facilities, and social transfers (OCED, 2018c). The New Zealand\u2019s Government supports incomes of poor families by increasing Accommodation Supplement or minimum wage. However, these have been balanced or outweighed in some cases by rent increase combined with loss of hardship payments or in the case of families with both parents earning minimum wage, by reaching income threshold beyond which social security benefits are reduced (St John, 2018). New Zealand has set up dedicated institutions, such as Office of Children\u2019s Commissioner for whom poverty reduction among children and better ways of addressing their needs remain a priority. The Office cooperates with partner organisations in project delivery, e.g. it has developed a set of ideas (giving2kids) meant to inspire business, charities, individuals and other partners on how to address basic needs of poor children to support their development and improve prospects for the future. It has also developed annual Child Poverty Monitor with data covering access to education, health care, housing and food insecurity 55 . There are also expert groups 56 , charities and other organisations collecting evidence, providing advice and working on projects related to children\u2019s rights and poverty. In 2018, New Zealand adopted the Child Poverty Reduction Act and the Children\u2019s Amendment Act. The former sets targets to reduce, in two steps (over three-year and ten-year period), the number of children living in families experiencing low income poverty and material hardship. It also commits the Government to report annually about the progress achieved.

However, because poverty is mostly measured before deducting housing costs (the latter grew on average by 5.2 percent in 2018), this deduction leaves a large group of the population with a disposable income below the poverty line). 57 The Children\u2019s Amendment Act requests the Government to design and implement a wellbeing strategy for children and young people. 58 The strategy will be published later in 2019 and its development includes broad consultations with social workers, local government, NGOs, young people, children and indigenous communities. The initial outline covers 16 areas and includes e.g. physical and emotional safety, quality housing, poverty reduction, healthy lifestyle, non-discrimination, cultural diversity, improved opportunities for disabled children and young people, mental wellbeing and the right to comprehensive development in early childhood and in access to education. 59 Regarding child labour, New Zealand is among the 16 ILO members (out of 187) who have not ratified yet the fundamental Minimum Age Convention No. 138. According to a study commissioned in 2010 by the Department of Labour, the main types of work carried out by children and teenagers in New Zealand included babysitting (23 percent), work in a shop, petrol station or supermarket (22 percent), outdoor work, e.g. in a garden (21 percent), cleaning (17 percent) and work in a restaurant or takeaway food outlet (16 percent). The majority of surveyed young persons worked either after or before school, with their main motivation (for 76 percent) for work being to earn money to cover their own expenditures. 5 percent worked to save money for studying and 1.5 percent to support their family. The survey also indicates that around half of 13-14-year olds were engaged in any form of paid activity and this share was increasing with the age. It was also determined that youth from socio-economic high deprivation areas are slightly less likely to work than their peers from more affluent groups (35 percent compared to 40 percent of the group), while youth from urban and rural areas had comparable shares of those engaged in part-time paid work (Department of Labour, 2010). In the 2018 report, the ILO Committee of Experts noted information provided by the New Zealand\u2019s Government about intended reform of legislation related to health and safety at work and work of young persons to increase the age from which the hazardous types of work are permitted and to ensure adequate protection for working youth. The reform would bring the New Zealand\u2019s legislation in line with the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation 1999 setting minimum age for work in hazardous conditions and necessary protection (CEACR, 2018). Indeed, young workers belong to focus groups of the Health and Safety at Work Strategy 2018-2028 (MBIE, 2018c). Regarding education, it has been noticed that the socio-economic background of students in New Zealand has a large impact on their performance (more than the OECD average). In response, the New Zealand\u2019s Government developed support programmes (education strategies) to help improve the performance of students from indigenous communities (Pacific People and M\u0101ori), and has taken measures to reduce the rates of early school dropouts (OECD, 2013a). In 2017, public expenditures for education in New Zealand equalled NZD13.3 billion (around 5 percent of GDP) and were projected to grow up to NZD14.4 billion by 2021. 60 The minimum age for criminal responsibility in New Zealand is set at 10 years (cf. recommendation of the Human Rights Committee is 12 years). Next to that, overcrowded juvenile justice facilities lead to children being held in police custody cells which is not in line with international standards (Human Rights Foundation, 2019). Child abuse is reported to be disproportionately affecting vulnerable children. There still exist traditional harmful practices (forced marriage and genital mutilation) that negatively affect the well-being of the children. Indigenous children are reported to be more likely to be put into childcare than non-indigenous children (United Nations, 2016b). 57 Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand\u2019s dismal record on child poverty and the government\u2019s challenge to turn it around: https://www.victoria.ac.nz/news/2019/05/new-zealands-dismal-record-on- child-poverty-and-the-governments-challenge-to-turn-it-around 58 Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: Child poverty reduction and wellbeing legislation: https://dpmc.govt.nz/our-programmes/reducing-child-poverty/child-poverty-reduction-and-wellbeing- legislation 59 Child Wellbeing Strategy, proposed outcomes framework: https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018- 11/appendix-b-proposed-outcomes-framework.pdf 60 Stuff: \u201cNZ government spending on education continues to grow\u201d (January 2018): https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/100991279/nz-government-spending-on-education-continues- to-grow [accessed on 4 June 2019] ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 49 | P a g e Potential FTA effects The EU-NZ FTA is expected to have a mixed impact on employment in New Zealand across sectors and a limited positive impact on real wages (increase of 0.3 percent for unskilled workers and 0.2 percent for skilled ones under the conservative scenario and 0.7 percent and 0.5 percent respectively under the ambitious one). This means a limited positive effect for income of those households who live on wages. It is to note, however, that even if wages for unskilled workers may rise minimally more than for skilled ones under both scenarios, the estimated differences are too small to bring about a reduction in inequality. Prices in New Zealand are expected to rise to a similar extend as wages, however, prices of imported products, such as cars are likely to decline. In this context, it is to note that while wages in New Zealand (also for reasons other than FTA with the EU) are predicted to increase in the coming years, the recipients of social benefits may continue to struggle due to rising housing costs and loss of certain allowances (St John, 2018), which may be only partly balanced by Families Package. In such cases, price increase (even if very limited) caused by an FTA and concentrated in categories, such as food products, which are an important element of expenditure basket of less affluent groups in the society, may contribute to the cumulative effect and further reduce their purchasing power. Regarding ratification by New Zealand of the fundamental ILO Minimum Age Convention No. 138, it is to note that the European Commission following results of the 2017/2018 debate on implementation of TSD chapters and commitments to improve it, highlighted to New Zealand a need to ratify that convention. Hence, negotiation and implementation of the EU-NZ FTA may facilitate the process leading to ratification of Convention No. 138 by New Zealand and contribute to a better protection of children\u2019s rights in that country (European Commission, 2019). Concerning types of working activities and motivations of working youth, outlined above, it is rather unlikely that the EU-NZ FTA has a direct impact on the number of jobs available to young persons or shares of working youth. It may have, however, an indirect impact on their economic welfare through impacts on jobs available to their parents or other households\u2019 members. In this context, it will be important that rules related to work of young persons are observed, i.e. prohibition of hazardous work for people under 18 years of age, restrictions in work at night, as well as restrictions in the number of working hours to ensure that work doesn\u2019t have a negative impact on education, rest and physical and mental development and wellbeing of working youth. The Convention No. 138 sets out framework conditions for work of young persons and requires that domestic legislation and practice are aligned with them. Therefore, its ratification and alignment of national legislation and practice with its provisions would ensure the necessary protection of working young persons 61 . Moreover, employers 62 will need to respect health and safety at work standards and e.g. provide appropriate training for young employees. Revenue foregone due to a possible tariff reduction will be quite limited compared to New Zealand\u2019s expenditures for health care, social protection or education, therefore liberalisation of trade in this aspect should not have noticeable (negative) impacts on the ability of the state to provide public policies and public services in these areas. Economic modelling suggests an increase in production and exports of ruminant meat from New Zealand to the EU. In case practices from the past continue, it may happen that cheaper and fatty parts of meat (such as mutton flaps) either remain on New Zealand\u2019s market or are exported to Pacific islands, in both cases contributing to increasing obesity among less affluent groups of people, including children. 61 The convention No. 138 sets as the minimum age of admission to work the age which ends compulsory schooling in the respective country (as a general rule, not less than 15 years and in specific circumstances 14 years of age) to enable children and youth to complete education before taking on work (no one under the minimum age should be admitted to work).

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 50 | P a g e Policy recommendations \uf0b7 We recommend that the EU and New Zealand continue during FTA negotiations dialogue regarding ILO Convention No. 138, including agreed steps to take by New Zealand to ratify this convention. This will help to strengthen legislative framework and enforcement guaranteeing respect for children's rights. \uf0b7 Given that the ambitious negotiation scenario may bring about job gains, but also job loses across several sectors in New Zealand affecting welfare of workers and their families, the EU and New Zealand should consider if they wish to pursue that scenario. Forced labour As outlined in a description of the current situation (see Annex III.2 under job quality, non- discrimination at work and forced labour), both in the EU and New Zealand there are cases of people living in conditions of slavery, and cases of migrant workers\u2019 exploitation. In New Zealand, the latter occurred in the construction, agriculture, dairy sector, viticulture, food and hospitality services, domestic work, and aboard foreign-flagged vessels fishing in New Zealand waters (Stringer, 2016 and The University of Auckland, 2016, US Department of State, 2018). Every year, cases are reported in the media and investigated by Immigration NZ and labour inspection. Since 2017, 366 businesses were banned from employing migrant workers for breaching employment laws, and in 2018, over half of 676 labour inspection\u2019s investigations involved cases of migrant worker exploitation. 63 In this context, FIRST Union, a trade union representing migrant workers across several sectors, called for granting migrant workers the same protections as other workers in New Zealand. 64 In the EU, the latest report of the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) provided evidence of migrant workers\u2019 exploitation (regarding EU nationals working in another EU Member State, and third country nationals) including excessive working hours, low pay (or lack of pay), bad accommodation conditions, lack of respect for health and safety at work rules, and \u2013 in extreme cases \u2013 excessive control, including limited social contacts and threats of reporting workers with irregular status to authorities. 65 While considering the potential impacts of the EU-NZ FTA on the incidence of worker exploitation in New Zealand, in particular in such sectors as agriculture, dairy products or construction, where the demand for labour is likely to increase, it shall be noted that both the Government and the sector representatives have taken steps to address the problem of trafficking in persons and exploitation. These, in addition to training for enforcement agencies\u2019 staff, assistance to victims and information materials for migrant workers, includes a review of the situation with a commissioned independent research with expected recommendations, and setting up a group representing business, trade unions, migrant workers and students who will evaluate proposed recommendations. 66 In March 2019, the Government launched public consultations inquiring whether New Zealand should ratify the 2014 Protocol to the ILO Forced Labour Convention No 29 67 and in May 2019, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety recommended to the Cabinet ratification of the Protocol, subject to outcomes of the parliamentary treaty examination procedure. 68 63 Stuff (June 2019), Shameful exploitation of vulnerable migrant workers: https://www.stuff.co.nz/ business/113639803/shameful-exploitation-of-vulnerable-migrant-workers [accessed on 15 July 2019] 64 The Spinoff (December 2018), The Bulletin: Migrant workers\u2019 exploitation cases pile up: https://thespinoff.co.nz/the-bulletin/18-12-2018/the-bulletin-migrant-worker-exploitation-cases-pile-up/ [accessed on 15 July 2019] 65 EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (2019), Protecting migrant workers from exploitation in the EU, workers\u2019 perspectives: https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2019-severe-labour-exploitation- workers-perspectives_en.pdf 66 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Temporary migrant worker exploitation review: https://www.mbie.govt.nz/immigration-and-tourism/immigration/temporary-migrant-worker-exploitation- review/ [accessed on 15 July 2019] 67 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Should New Zealand ratify the Forced Labour Protocol?: https://www.mbie.govt.nz/have-your-say/should-new-zealand-ratify-the-forced-labour-protocol/ [accessed on 15 July 2019] 68 Proposed ratification of the Forced labour Protocol, 2014: https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/5892- proposed-ratification-of-the-forced-labour-protocol-2014-proactiverelease-pdf ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 51 | P a g e Subsequently, New Zealand ratified the Protocol in December 2019 (for details, see also Chapter 4 and Annex III.2). While economic modelling suggests potential increase in employment (as a result of an FTA) in sectors where there have been cases of migrant worker exploitation (e.g. in construction, dairy products or fruits and vegetables), one cannot conclude that this will directly lead to increase in the number of such cases, nor can it be excluded that such cases will continue to take place. However, there is also an increasing number and a variety of mechanisms to reduce their occurrence and to address them if they happen, as well as an increasing awareness of this problem. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) / Responsible Business Conduct (RBC) As outlined in a description of the current situation provided in Annex III.2, in the EU and New Zealand, there are diverse frameworks and initiatives encouraging application of CSR/RBC practices in the everyday operation of enterprises. These include legislative acts, international instruments (e.g. OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises), national strategies and action plans on CSR and Business and Human Rights, reporting and quality standards (e.g. Global Reporting Initiative or ISO 26000), approaches taken by international customers and competitors, engagement with key stakeholders, and others, such as local (e.g. M\u0101ori) concepts of business assuming sustainability of people and the planet as a profit driver. 69 The EU-NZ FTA could support this trend. Through increased investment, it may open further opportunities for branches of EU companies to pursue their CSR/RBC activities in New Zealand (and vice versa), as it has already been the case. Moreover, the textual proposal tabled by the EU in negotiations provides a new framework for the Parties for the exchange of information, best practices and outreach initiatives, as well as their cooperation in this context with businesses and other relevant stakeholders. It also includes an element on Business and Human Rights, supporting the adherence to the UN Guiding Principles, their implementation, follow-up and dissemination which may be a good proposition for New Zealand\u2019s partners to further their practice. Furthermore, based on the experience in implementation of recent EU trade agreements with a TSD chapter, it is to note that business and civil society representatives from the EU and partner countries have very much appreciated an opportunity to exchange information and best practice on CSR/RBC practices in the framework provided by TSD chapters. Similar cooperation forms could be considered in the EU-NZ FTA. Public policies (education, health care and social protection) Effects of the EU-NZ FTA for the EU budget related to foregone revenue resulting from tariff reduction are estimated to be limited: \u20ac 100 million under the conservative scenario and \u20ac 208 million under the ambitious one (European Commission, 2017c). Given the structure of the EU budget and its separation from budgets of individual Member States, it is expected that the reduction of revenues from tariffs resulting from the EU-NZ FTA will have a limited indirect impact on Member States\u2019 budgets and their ability to finance public policies and services. For example, in a long-term perspective, Member States may need to increase contributions to the EU budget from other sources, if traditional own resources of its funding, including revenues from tariffs, decrease. Otherwise, the EU budget would have more limited space for funding, including for programmes and projects in areas related to research, health and education. In New Zealand, given the current level of tariffs imposed on products imported from the EU and the relatively limited amount of revenues from this source compared to the overall 69 Jackson, Stone and Partners: Who are the leaders in corporate social responsibility in NZ?: https://www.jacksonstone.co.nz/professional/who-are-the-leaders-in-corporate-social-responsibility-in-nz/ [accessed on 2 June 2019] ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 52 | P a g e spending on public policies (see Annex III.2), one can expect that tariffs reduction would mean only limited impacts for the budget and the ability to finance public policies. Outside budgetary considerations, the EU-NZ FTA may have positive effects on public policies, e.g. health care through specific provisions. For example, if the TBT Chapter or an Annex on medical devices include provisions reducing administrative burden and facilitating trade, then health-care providers may have an easier access to modern equipment supporting diagnostic and medical treatment. 3.3.3. Policy recommendations and flanking measures \uf0b7 While the expected employment reductions at the EU level in the ruminant meat sector are likely to be relatively limited, in case the ambitious scenario is followed, some EU Member States or regions having a higher share of non-dairy cattle farming in economic activity and employment (e.g. in Ireland), may potentially be more (negatively) affected (in particular if effects of several FTAs cumulate). Decisions to be taken either at the EU level of by individual EU Member States about the appropriate support measures should be based on a sound market analysis and trends in demand, supply and prices. Such analysis could be provided e.g. by the EU Meat Market Observatory, with a particular focus on changes following entry into force of new FTAs. Additional evidence related to effects of market changes on farmers and meat processors could be collected by their organisations, e.g. the Irish Farmers\u2019 Association, and reported at the national and EU level. Moreover, to avoid or mitigate potential negative effects, the governments of EU Member States and farmer associations in the EU should continue or step up efforts supporting competitiveness of the EU ruminant meat sector, including focus on high product quality, complemented by search for potential additional destination markets for products of this sector. \uf0b7 Trends in the motor vehicles sector, both in the EU and New Zealand suggest that new jobs may require new skills e.g. software and electronics engineering skills, advanced data analytics, and new types of jobs in cooperating sectors and enabling services, e.g. research on advanced materials and battery cell chemistry, renewables and alternative fuels or 5G network. Therefore, for the expected job growth (in the EU) to materialise, the EU institutions and Member States should work with industry and training providers to create training offers, which would equip workers with the right skills set and enable them to continue or to start working in the sector and to maintain or improve its competitiveness. One example of such an initiative is the DRIVES project with a budget of \u20ac 3.9 million over four years implemented through a network of partner organisations from 11 countries. Components of the project include monitoring of skills needed in the automotive sector, design of job profiles and a pilot certification and training offer 70 . \uf0b7 The situation in sectors of New Zealand\u2019s economy that are likely to be negatively affected by the EU-NZ FTA, e.g. motor vehicles and machinery, may require the New Zealand Government to take measures to support workers in transition to new jobs in case employment reductions occur in these sectors. Support measures may include training, career advice, support to set up own business, job fairs to facilitate matching workers with potential employers, as well as support for SMEs in the supply chains to diversify into other sectors. However, given potential negative employment consequences (in particular for New Zealand, but also for the EU in the ruminant meat sector) related to pursuing ambitious negotiation scenario, the Parties should reflect on its costs and benefits for both sides. \uf0b7 As indicated in the analysis, the future EU-NZ FTA is not likely to increase the number of accidents at work, provided the recent trends in sectors generating most accidents continue. For this to happen, initiatives taken for example by New Zealand\u2019s farmers associations and industry aiming at improved levels of health and safety at work in the meat and dairy sectors will need to be implemented and complemented by new ones, if needed. It can also be expected that implementation of the new Health and Safety at Work Strategy 2018-2028 will contribute to improved levels of workers\u2019 protection. 70 DRIVES: https://www.project-drives.eu/en/home ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 53 | P a g e \uf0b7 If agreed in negotiations, the EU-NZ FTA provisions on health and safety at work under the TSD chapter may encourage the Parties to take further unilateral actions and pursue bilateral cooperation and dialogue in the area of health and safety at work. In this context, it would be important that the TSD chapter provides space for workshops, joint projects and other opportunities for exchange of information and best practice, on the EU side based on Member States\u2019 experience and expertise developed by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. In the past, such cooperation with partner countries, e.g. Chile (under the Association Agreement) included study visits, also in the Agency, and discussion about legislative solutions and their practical application in risk-related sectors, such as mining. Dialogue involved also employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives. The EU and New Zealand would need to choose the most relevant set of sectors for their relations and ensure that cooperation activities engage sector representatives from both Parties. \uf0b7 Considering the predicted employment growth in some agricultural sectors in New Zealand, it seems likely that at least part of the additional jobs may be filled in by seasonal workers (e.g. short-term migrants) or casual workers. In this context, it will be for the labour inspection to monitor if employers ensure that working conditions for these groups of workers are decent and meet the established standards. It will be also for the labour inspection and other relevant institutions to ensure that cases of migrant workers\u2019 exploitation documented in some studies are prevented and, when they happen, are investigated and addressed. While observance of laws regarding working conditions will be the employers\u2019 obligation, labour inspection and Immigration NZ (supported by information from workers, trade unions, NGOs and others) should identify and address cases of workers\u2019 rights violations. Moreover, measures helping to prevent exploitation of workers, such as information for migrant workers about their rights and banning employers exploiting migrants from employing them should be continued. Having ratified the 2014 Protocol to the Forced Labour Convention No. 29 in December 2019, a positive step, the Government should also consider granting migrant workers the same or similar protection as enjoyed by other workers in New Zealand. \uf0b7 While quantitative impacts of the EU-NZ FTA on the respect of rights at work are likely to be limited (e.g. employment of disabled persons) or difficult to establish (e.g. regarding work of young persons or cases of exploitation of migrant workers), there may be a qualitative positive impact related to encouragement for New Zealand to ratify two outstanding ILO fundamental conventions No. 87 and 138, as explained above, including in Case Study 3.2. The Parties should continue their dialogue in this area during negotiations, with a view to identifying steps to take by New Zealand towards ratification and effective implementation of these conventions. \uf0b7 Given positive past examples of cooperation of CSR/RBC practices, New Zealand and the EU should agree to include into the future FTA provisions on trade and responsible supply chain management, including CSR/RBC practices. These should encourage the Parties to take further unilateral actions and pursue bilateral cooperation and dialogue in these areas, as well as contribution to multilateral initiatives. In this context, it would be important that future provisions on CSR/RBC (e.g. in the TSD chapter) provide space for workshops, joint projects and other opportunities for exchange of information and best practice or search for solutions to address common challenges and that these activities can engage also businesses and other relevant stakeholders from both Parties. \uf0b7 Cooperation and dialogue under the TSD chapter could also include seminars to be attended by representatives of National Contact Points (NCP) under OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to share information and best practice related to their operation and handling of specific instances. Such seminars and an opportunity for a discussion with NCP representatives were highly appreciated by civil society representatives from the EU and the Republic of Korea under the EU-Korea FTA. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 54 | P a g e 3.4. Gender impact analysis 3.4.1. Introduction In this section, the analysis focuses on effects which the EU-NZ FTA may have on women in their roles of workers, entrepreneurs, traders and consumers. It follows in three steps. In the first one, an overview of the current situation (see Annex III.2) describes how women in the EU and New Zealand are treated and act on the labour market as workers, and what are the areas of their economic activity as entrepreneurs and participation in international trade, across sectors. It compares data for men and women in these areas to determine patterns of their activity and the level of gender equality across a range of indicators. In the second step, based on results of the economic modelling, we estimate the likely changes in employment levels across sectors and how they will impact employment of women compared to men (given that each gender has its own pattern of shares in employment across sectors). In a similar way, we examine changes in output of individual sectors to be induced by the FTA and how this may influence operation of women-led enterprises active there. Finally, based on the estimated changes in trade performance of the individual sectors, we analyse what effects this may have on women as traders, knowing sectors in which they operate and types of traded products or services. In the final step, we provide recommendations with proposals supporting gender equality in trade and addressing challenges faced by women in their roles in the context of the EU- NZ FTA. 3.4.2.Gender effects Women as workers As outlined in the description of the current situation, women in the EU tend to work more frequently than men in services sectors, such as health care and social services, education, public administration, financial, professional and administrative services, wholesale and retail trade and food and accommodation services (Eurostat, 2018). The economic model does not envisage any changes in employment levels in the EU in these sectors, therefore for around 80 percent of female workers in the EU, there will be no effects related to the EU-NZ FTA. The only two sectors for which the model foresees slightly higher, but still limited employment increase in the EU are gas extraction sector (0.4 percent for skilled and unskilled workers under the ambitious scenario) and motor vehicles (0.3 percent respectively). Both have a higher share in employment of men than women (gas: 1.1 percent of total employment for men and 0.4 percent for women, and manufacturing covering motor vehicles, 23 percent for men and 11 percent for women), therefore it is to be expected that while workers of both genders employed or interested in work in these sectors may benefit from a potential job creation induced by the EU-NZ FTA, in general, given the job profiles and trends in both sectors (also presented in the sectoral part of the analysis), it may be men who will benefit more. Nevertheless, the situation may be more nuanced in the motor vehicles sector across Member States; e.g. in the manufacturing of motor vehicles, the share of women in the workforce in 2012 ranged from less than 20 percent, e.g. in Germany, to over 60 percent in Bulgaria (European Sector Skills Council 2013). In agriculture, the economic modelling envisages limited job reductions in the EU: ruminant meats (-1.4 percent for skilled and unskilled workers under the ambitious scenario), rice, sugar, vegetables, fruits and nuts (-0.2 percent) and cereals, vegetable oils and fats, plant and animal fibres and other crops (-0.1 percent). In these sectors men are also more represented than women (2.2 and 0.9 percent share respectively in total employment) (Eurostat, 2018), with shares of women in the total number of people working in agriculture ranging in 2016 from 45 percent in Austria to 12 percent in Ireland. 71 Hence, men may be more affected; however, there may be differences across Member States and sub-sectors, depending on shares in the total employment and job profiles of each gender. 71 \u201cMore than one third EU farmers are female\u201d, Eurostat, 18 December 2017 [accessed 30 August 2018], https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/WDN-20171218-1?inheritRedirect=true ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 55 | P a g e In New Zealand, the picture is much more diversified. However, in general, sectors having a higher share in employment of men than of women are likely to be more affected by the EU-NZ FTA, both positively and negatively. For example, utilities, including construction, is to generate new employment with a likely increase by 0.9 percent for unskilled workers and 1.2 percent for skilled ones under the ambitious scenario, whereas the sector has a 15.4 percent share in total employment for men and 2.7 percent for women (Stats NZ, 2018). On the other end of the scale, there are motor vehicles and machinery sectors, both likely to experience job reductions of around 3 percent for skilled and unskilled workers under the ambitious scenario. In 2015, in NZ motor vehicles sector, men constituted the vast majority of workers (86 percent in manufacturing and 92 percent in repair and maintenance) (MITO, 2016). The services sectors, which employ over 80 percent of women in New Zealand, are likely not to experience any or only very limited changes in employment under the conservative scenario and job reductions in the region of 0.3 to 0.4 percent for unskilled workers under the ambitious scenario. However, the services sector has been growing and generating employment in New Zealand over the last decade. Between 2007 and 2017, it created 156,000 new jobs, and public administration, health care and education provided jointly additional 80,000 jobs (MBIE, 2018d). This continued in 2018, with job creation driven mainly by health care and social assistance, retail trade and accommodation. The available forecast indicates some slowdown in the employment growth in 2019-2020, with the best results expected for health care and education, business services and utilities and construction. Jobs will be created mainly for high skilled workers, with lower numbers expected for middle-skilled and unskilled ones (MBIE, 2018a). If these generally positive trends are maintained in the coming years, then potential negative impacts of the EU-NZ FTA should be interpreted as more limited employment growth rather than a net job reduction. Regarding agriculture, impacts resulting from the EU-NZ FTA for New Zealand, will vary across sub-sectors, scenarios and between skilled and unskilled workers. Given the lack of existing or identified data concerning shares of women in the total employment in each sub-sector and among skilled and unskilled workers, it is not possible to quantify the expected changes in employment for women in agriculture more in detail. Women as entrepreneurs and traders As outlined in the description of the current situation 72 , in the EU, women-led enterprises have the highest shares in the total number of companies in the services sectors (the first seven sectors having shares from 65 percent for other services and 60 percent for health care and social services, to 33 percent for wholesale and retail trade). Agriculture ranks eighth, with women making 30 percent of EU farmers, whereas the share for manufacturing is of 20 percent (European Commission, 2014). The economic modelling suggests that there will be no noticeable changes in output of the EU companies in the services sectors under both the conservative and ambitious scenarios, which means no changes either for women-led enterprises. In agriculture, a limited decrease in output is predicted for the sector of fruits, vegetables and nuts (-0.2 percent), and oilseeds, vegetable oils and fats (-0.1 percent), and a growth of 0.2 percent for beef and sheep meat under the conservative scenario. Under the ambitious one, for most of sub-sectors, a limited decrease in output of -0.1 to -0.2 percent is forecasted, while for the ruminant meat sector it is -1.4 percent. Therefore, while the expected changes (positive or negative) will be limited, also for women-led enterprises, the expected drop in output in the ruminant meat sector may require more attention. In manufacturing, there will be no noticeable changes in output, with the exception of motor vehicles and machinery sectors. The former expects an increase in output of 0.2 percent under the conservative scenario and 0.3 under the ambitious one. The machinery sector is likely to grow by 0.1 percent under the ambitious scenario. This suggests that only those enterprises led by women which are active in these 72 It is to note that for the EU, the data has been provided based on a one-off study carried out for the European Commission in 2014. It seems that there is no regular collection of this type of data for the whole EU (previously, some data was collected in 2008). ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 56 | P a g e two sectors or cooperate with them, may record an increase in output as a result of the EU-NZ FTA. Regarding women\u2019s participation in trade, the latest European Commission\u2019s and International Trade Centre\u2019s (ITC) study 73 reveals that compared to the composition of surveyed EU enterprises, women-led companies producing goods are well represented in exports of clothing, fresh and processed food and agro-based products, and electronic components. Their top export destinations include the US, China, Russian Federation, and Switzerland, while imports originate from China, the US and Japan 74 . Outcomes of the economic modelling suggest increase in EU exports to New Zealand under the conservative scenario for textiles (by 47.3 percent), most of the food and agro-based products (ranging from 0.2 percent for cereals to 27.2 percent for dairy products and 29.4 percent for other meat) and electronic equipment by 11.9 percent, i.e. the main product groups engaging female exporters. Exports increase is also expected in other sectors, e.g. wood products, transport equipment and machinery where women-led companies operate while being less numerous. Under the ambitious scenario, these sectors will also benefit from increase in exports to New Zealand and for some of them the growth is expected to be higher, e.g. by 101 percent for textiles, by 53 percent for electronic equipment, and by 29 percent for dairy products. This suggests that while there may be differences in the extent to which certain types of companies will benefit from additional export opportunities (e.g. large companies compared to SMEs), women-led enterprises in the EU are also likely to increase their export activity to New Zealand under the future EU-NZ FTA. However, it is noted that women-led exporting enterprises face also a number of challenges which relate to sector of their operation, size of companies and other factors, e.g. those in in clothing, electronic components, and fresh and processed food and agro-based products, and metal manufacturing, face frequent NTMs related to strict labelling requirements, rules of origin and product certification. Due to small size, only 4 percent of those participating in a survey engaged in public procurement activities (compared to 9 percent of men-led companies) and 19 percent were required to comply with private standards for goods (81 percent of men-led companies did so). These findings suggest that EU and New Zealand should consider in ongoing negotiations how provisions related e.g. to technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, public procurement or rules of origin may affect (positively or negatively) small enterprises as these will be likely to have an effect for women-led businesses. In 2018 in New Zealand, women constituted 33 percent of all entrepreneurs (Mastercard, 2018). Regarding sectors of their operation, the only data identified so far, is quite old and based on one study. According to this study, over the last decade, women-led enterprises have been operating in sectors including property and business services, retail trade, and personal and other services (Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, 2008). The economic modelling suggests for these sectors an increase in output of 0.2 percent under the conservative scenario and 0.3 to 0.5 percent under the ambitious one, which means that women-led enterprises will also have an opportunity to benefit from it. Exports under both conservative and ambitious scenarios are likely to increase by 8 percent in the services sectors, which may also create an opportunity for women entrepreneurs to start or expand their activities in international trade. In this context, the Government of New Zealand is going to present in 2019 proposals within the Trade for All agenda, including support for women in the context of trade policy and trade agreements. Women as consumers 73 European Commission, International Trade Centre (2019), From Europe to the world.

",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 57 | P a g e As outlined in the overall economic analysis, the EU-NZ FTA is likely to have a negligible effect for EU consumers in terms of changes in wage and price levels (i.e. their purchasing power), as well as limited effects for workers. However, it should bring about a positive impact as far as availability of goods and services and the overall welfare are concerned. In New Zealand, it may have a limited, but positive impact on consumers by increasing the range of available goods and services (with a reduction of prices for imported goods) and contributing to a limited welfare and wage growth. It is also likely to bring about a price increase, but a very limited one, and one being below the wage growth. The same findings will be true for women as consumers, notably those for whom wages constitute the source of income. However, there are groups in the New Zealand\u2019s population, including single adults, sole parent households, Pacific People, M\u0101ori and beneficiaries of social security payments, who are more exposed to the risk of poverty and may potentially benefit less from a trade agreement than other groups (e.g. if social benefits being a source of income do not rise to the same extent as wages). These groups include women, which suggests that impacts on women as consumers in New Zealand may vary depending on the source of income and sector of employment or economic activity, individual situation (e.g. composition of household), etc. 3.4.3. Policy recommendations and flanking measures \uf0b7 To enable estimation and monitoring of impacts of the EU-NZ FTA on women, the Parties should further collect and analyse data disaggregated by gender. This applies in particular to the EU level data related to women entrepreneurs and traders (e.g. sectors of their economic activity, as well as internationally traded services, given that the recent European Commission\u2019s study with ITC provides insights for women\u2019s entrepreneurial activity as international traders in goods), and to women entrepreneurs and traders in New Zealand, as well as challenges faced by female traders and entrepreneurs, e.g. regarding NTMs, participation in e-commerce, access to public procurement contracts, etc. Exchange of best practice related to methods of data collection and analysis could follow in the regular dialogue under the TSD chapter of the EU-NZ FTA or other relevant chapters, e.g. on SMEs, TBT, public procurement, and within other bilateral or multilateral initiatives, e.g. follow-up to the Buenos Aires Declaration on Trade and Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment as well as seminars organised within the WTO Public Forum. \uf0b7 The Parties should consider launch and/or continuation of tools and initiatives (discussed in detail in Annex III.2 to this Report) supporting women\u2019s economic activity, i.e. setting up and operation of enterprises, with access to funding, advisory services, training and networks, and engagement in international trade, including under the EU-NZ FTA. \uf0b7 Given that certain measures or approaches included into provisions of a trade agreement may have a different impact on men and women in the context of trade, the Parties should consider analysis of such impacts at the time of design and implementation of FTA provisions in core trade disciplines, including in the EU-NZ FTA, e.g. trade in services (given the large share of women employed as workers and operating as entrepreneurs in the services sectors), public procurement (with possibilities to further unlock opportunities for SMEs, including those led by women), investment or policy on SMEs. A similar step has been recommended by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) within its Gender Responsive Standards Initiative (and the recommendation adopted in November 2018) promoting greater involvement of women in standard setting. 75 75 UNECE: Thematic Areas \u2013 Gender Initiative: http://www.unece.org/tradewelcome/steering-committee-on- trade-capacity-and-standards/tradewp6/thematic-areas/gender-initiative.html [accessed 28 November 2018].

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 58 | P a g e 3.5. Human rights impact analysis 3.5.1. Introduction This chapter first provides an overview of the current human rights situation in New Zealand and in the EU (for more detailed information, we refer to Annex III.3). Existing issues of vulnerabilities are then taken into account when assessing the potential impact of the EU-NZ FTA on human rights in both Parties, followed by a screening and scoping exercise and then a more detailed impact assessment for selected human rights. 3.5.2. Human rights state of play In this section, we outline the core elements of the current situations in the EU and New Zealand from a human rights perspective. European Union Human rights are guaranteed at the EU level by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR) adopted in 2000 and having a binding nature on all EU Member States following the Lisbon Treaty of 2009. The Charter is consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) ratified by all the Member States. The European Union\u2019s trade relations are guided by its commitment to support and promote democracy and human rights as it is established in the Lisbon Treaty (Art. 3(5), Art. 21(1) (3) TEU and Art. 207(1) TFEU). Moreover, Article 6(1) TEU gives the Charter the binding legal value equal to that of the Treaties by mandating that the EU legal order \u2018recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights\u2019. Since EU Member States have not followed homogeneous development paths before becoming members of the EU, some states have more human rights issues than others. Despite a decrease in migration flows to Europe, rights of migrants and asylum seekers continue to be compromised by some EU Member States (HRW, 2019), and issues remain with respect to discrimination against women, Roma people and LGBTI persons. HRW also praised the European Union for remaining a leading actor in promoting human rights globally and welcomed the commitment of the EU institutions in their action to address attacks on democratic institutions and rule of law in Hungary and Poland in 2018 (HRW, 2019). Many of these issues are of domestic character and are not likely to be directly related to trade relations with New Zealand. However, the current situation and specific provisions in the proposed EU-NZ FTA could be important in order to assess human rights impacts, particularly the degree of the impact, while considering existing sensitivities and issues of vulnerability. New Zealand Currently, the human rights relationship between the EU and New Zealand is governed by the EU-New Zealand Partnership Agreement for Relations and Cooperation (PARC) that includes cooperation on human rights and gender issues (EEAS, 2018; New Zealand Government, 2016). New Zealand is a party to seven out of nine core international human rights treaties and six out of eight core ILO Conventions and has human rights obligations established in these instruments. New Zealand is also a signatory to the UN Agenda 2030 for sustainable development that came into effect in January 2016. Every time the New Zealand government signs a new significant international treaty, a National Interest Analysis (NIA) is produced by the lead government agency. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand notes that in negotiating trade agreements, New Zealand seeks to include provisions that include \u201ccommitments that labour and environmental laws, policies, regulations and practices will not be used for trade protectionist purposes, or be weakened to encourage trade or investment\u201d. 76 In New Zealand, human rights are recognised and protected under two main legal acts: the New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990 and the New Zealand Human Rights Act 1993. Next to that, New Zealand has an 76 Website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand, https://www.mfat.govt.nz/ en/trade/free-trade-agreements/about-free-trade-agreements/ [accessed 25 January 2019].

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 59 | P a g e institutional framework in place to promote and monitor protection of human rights. One of the founding documents of the system of government in New Zealand (though not formally a part of the national legislative framework) is the Treaty of Waitangi which was signed between the M\u0101ori chiefs and the British Crown in 1840 (United Nations, 2018a). It provides guarantees for the right of M\u0101ori to self-determination and includes the duty to consult the M\u0101ori in decisions that affect them. New Zealand is found to have a strong record on human rights. 77 However, there are also issues of concern. They relate to the rights of children, violence against women, and high rates of M\u0101ori incarceration. Some of the issues related to human rights have already been discussed in the ex-ante study: the right to health, rights of indigenous peoples, rights of migrants, and rights of refugees and asylum seekers. Overall, the EU and New Zealand have a strong human rights record. Although the human rights situation in both Parties can be characterised by several issues that need attention, at the same time, it demonstrates that there are constant developments to improve the human rights record and performance. There are various institutions in place that point out shortcomings and elaborate recommendations on constant improvement of human rights situations. 78 3.5.3. Screening and scoping of specific human rights The likely cause-effect relationships between the trade and trade-related measures in the EU-NZ FTA and human rights have been developed based on various sources, in particular, the experience of other FTAs, literature review of various studies, results of the modelling carried out by the European Commission, assessment of the ex-ante study, expert opinions, stakeholder consultations and results of the human rights survey. The LSE (2017) ex-ante study gives a first overview of how literature and EU and New Zealand stakeholders view the impact of the EU-NZ FTA on human rights. It points out a few impacts of the EU- NZ FTA on several human rights: the right to health, right to an adequate standard of living, freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, right to participate in the conduct of public affairs. The analysis concludes that all the selected rights are expected to be impacted in a minor way, except for the freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly and right to participate in public and political life (as related to transparency in the negotiations) which are expected to be impacted in a major way, generating either neutral or positive impact. 79 The outcomes of the economic modelling are used to see where \u2013 at sectoral level especially \u2013 human rights impacts can be expected from the EU-NZ FTA. For example, looking at the right to work in sectors that grow or decline; or how growth of water-intensive sectors affects rights of indigenous people; or how tariff revenue impacts affect availability of funds for public policies like education and/or healthcare, potentially affecting the right to education and right to health. Based on the above-mentioned sources, and in line with the EC Guidelines for human rights impacts assessments, Table 3.16 presents the outcomes of the screening and scoping exercises based on the trade and trade-related measures specified in the textual proposals for the EU-NZ FTA and contains the following information: \uf0b7 What trade measures/ provisions from the textual proposals are expected to cause the impact on human rights; \uf0b7 Reference in the textual proposal (if available); \uf0b7 Potentially affected human rights/issues and the normative framework; \uf0b7 Short explanation of the impact based on secondary materials: nature of the expected impact (both in the short and in the long run) and possible directions of the impact; \uf0b7 Whether the potentially affected right is an absolute human right or not (yes/no); 80 77 See website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand, https://www.mfat.govt.nz/ en/trade/free-trade-agreements/about-free-trade-agreements/ [accessed 25 January 2019]. 78 See Annex III.3 for a more detailed description of the state of play. 79 See Table 41 in LSE (2017). 80 In line with the Tool No.28 of the Better Regulation Toolbox, see European Commission (2017a).

For example, a direct effect is the effect of more jobs and higher wages brought about by the FTA on the right to work. An indirect effect is the effect of the FTA via a longer causal chain.

Next to that, liberalisation of tariffs contributes to GDP growth because it supports specialisation and thus increases in output. More revenues, with lower input costs also has a positive effect on company revenues, which in the long run increases tax revenues for the government making more funds available for public services, as well as more jobs for workers and uses for (international) capital positively affecting the right to an adequate standard of living, right to health, right to social security, right to education. The degree to which the most vulnerable groups of population also benefit, depend on support from the government and publicly funded programmes as well as the degree to which they are included. However, while tax revenues tend to increase, tariff revenues are reduced and in the short run depending on the choices made by the government, this may put some pressure on the rights of persons dependent on public funding (the elderly, children, women, persons with disabilities, migrants, persons with low income, and others) because funds decrease. In the case of the EU-NZ FTA, both the EU and NZ are high- income countries with developed social systems and security nets and with appropriate attention to human rights. So it is not likely that reduction of tariff liberalisation will be so significant as to have a major impact on government revenues in the short run and to negatively affect vulnerable groups dependent on publicly allocated funds. Positive impact from increased tax revenues is not likely to be significant in the short run either. In the long run, the expected impact will be proportional to the effects of the tariff liberalisation for the negotiated goods.

So, the right to an adequate standard of living is not likely to be affected for NZ citizens or only marginally in both directions. In case of the EU, liberalisation of tariffs is not expected to influence the right to an adequate standard of living neither in the short run, nor in the long run. As a result of tariff liberalisation some competitive sectors both in NZ and the EU are expected to grow while non- competitive ones are expected to decline, causing job creation and job losses respectively, creating a mixed impact on the right to work of employees of different sectors. The positive impact of more trade resulting from tariff liberalisation could already be felt in the short run as jobs will be created shortly after the FTA is in force. Impacts within the sectors may be positive or negative (affecting the right to an adequate standard of living and right to work in opposite directions and for various vulnerable groups, depending on the sector). Liberalisation of tariffs in agriculture, in particular, meat and dairy is expected to lead to increase in production and increase in GHG emissions in New Zealand, thereby affecting the right to a clean environment in New Zealand in a minor negative way (see detailed analysis in the Environmental Impact Chapter).

Easier access could potentially increase competitiveness among the energy providers and lead to cheaper prices for the consumers in New Zealand and the EU.

Given the size of economic effects, this FTA transmission channel is, however, not expected to be significant. From the economic analysis, we find that for the EU no large change is expected in terms of production (marginal decreases in oil and coal and a small increase for gas), but gas exports will increase considerably (+5.7%). For NZ, production of coal and oil go up marginally and gas production declines. In terms of trade, NZ exports decline for all three fossil fuels. Increased cooperation in such areas as sustainable and renewable energy could have an indirect positive impact on the right to a clean environment in the long run for both EU and New Zealand citizens, contributing to promotion and further research into renewable energy and developing new technologies based on combined research and cooperation activities, through exchange of best practices (Articles X.15, X.16, X.17 in the Textual Proposal). This measure is not expected to have any significant impact on the enjoyment of human rights by the EU population. From the perspective of the indigenous people\u2019s rights, if a consequence of the EU-NZ FTA is that the number of energy- related projects increases (e.g. hydraulic fracturing), this could put some pressure on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights.

New Zealand is working on its revised Privacy Act to protect privacy of its citizens and introduce improved data protection standards.

Alignment of TBT could lead to stronger focus on the quality of products. Both the EU and New Zealand have high TBT standards, and further alignment would not reduce them, but allow resources to be spent more efficiently: for regulators, and for companies. For regulators, inspections could become more efficient (and joint) while for companies regulatory costs would go down while technical quality would be maintained or even increased. Ultimately this could lead to cheaper products of high quality for EU and New Zealand consumers. Though the TBT Agreement would enshrine high standards, the quality of products would only marginally be impacted and thus also only marginally affect right to health. For job creation/reduction, the impact is expected to be developing in both directions: lower costs mean also more business opportunities and jobs but at the same time, more simplification of inspection may also affect existing jobs which will not be needed as a result of it. All these changes have the potential to affect the right to an adequate standard of living, right to work and right to health .

In the ambitious scenario a degree of SPS alignment is assumed to be able to capture potential gains in agriculture and processed foods. Neither side wants to lower SPS standards in the EU-NZ FTA, but via aligning further (reducing regulatory duplications, joining forces on risk-based checks, and other measures) food quality can be further emphasised while reducing costs \u2013 both for regulators and companies \u2013 which leads to a potentially positive impact on the right to food and right to health, right to an adequate standard of living . Impact on the right to work could be both positive and negative (in both cases minor), depending on the exact consequences for employment as a result of jointly performed checks and other related activities.

For competitive sectors, removal of TRQs would lead to positive effects on the right to work, right to a decent standard of living as wages would go up and jobs are created. For \u2018defensive\u2019 (i.e. relatively less competitive sectors) TRQs provide protection against (foreign) competition. So the removal or weakening of TRQs could lead to more competition and a decline in wages and job opportunities. However, since TRQs ensue in the agricultural sector mostly, job mobility in the long run would allow also workers in declining sectors to benefit (from higher salaries and new job opportunities), even though in the immediate aftermath of changing TRQs job frictions could temporarily affect the right to work negatively.

New Zealand had also committed to some regulatory data protection in the (original) TPP agreement: General patent-term extension for unreasonable delays in granting a patent and Patent-term extension for pharmaceuticals for humans with respect to the unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the marketing approval process per the Medicines Act 1981 89 (see more detailed analysis in the detailed assessment of the right to health). But it is not known at this stage whether these types of patent extensions are foreseen in the EU-NZ FTA. Extension of patent protection secures innovation for new medicines and their introduction which is necessary for the promotion of the right to health . It can also lead to lower health care costs in other parts of the health care system when new and better medicines become available to cure patients reducing the costs for the health care system. At the same time, however, extension of patent protection could put a strain on the government budget when new, innovative, but also expensive, products enter the New Zealand market, thereby potentially negatively impacting the right to health, in particular for most vulnerable groups of the population (the elderly, children, women, persons with disabilities and others).

Because extension of patent protection is in part dependent on the speed of regulatory approval processes, streamlining these processes by governments (e.g. via International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) standards implementation outside the EU-NZ FTA. The goal of the overall system should be to allow patients to get quicker access to the best possible medicines and not an overly commercial approach to innovation as stated by the United Nations OHCHR in 2005. At the moment of writing this report, the existing draft provisions do not specify the period for regulatory data protection, an important building block of the IP system. The potential impact of more extensive patent protection on the sustainability of health care systems should be properly assessed since while higher prices could reduce sustainability, new medicines also lead to lower costs for the health care system overall: lower hospital costs, less doctor visits, and less patients that need prolonged treatment and care. Expansion of the system of GIs as part of IPR protection could lead to positive impact on protecting the cultural heritage behind a brand for small and large EU and NZ producers, preserving the traditional quality of products, affecting positively the right to take part in cultural life , in particular for the NZ Maori population, and allowing farmers to brand their products, leading to a positive effect also on their right to work and right to an adequate standard of living. GIs could potentially lead to pressure on other farmers or agricultural product producers to have to adjust labelling and branding of existing products that have come to use an EU GI term.

It supports UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Paris Agreement on climate change (Art.5) as well as other relevant key international instruments with respect to labour rights and environment protection. Moreover, in its Article X.3(3), the Agreement aims to facilitate ratification of all ILO Conventions ratified by the parties (which would be relevant for New Zealand which did not yet ratify the ILO Minimum Age Convention (C138), Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (C087)). Overall, this trade-related measure is expected to have a direct positive impact on labour rights in both EU and NZ, as well as the right to clean environment and, as a consequence, right to health . It is not clear though how specific vulnerable groups (e.g. women, indigenous peoples) are protected under this Chapter which does not include provisions regarding vulnerable groups of the population in its current version. More in general, however, there is a commitment to respect the core labour standards regarding elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Another caveat is that under EU law the EU Member States have to enforce the agreement. This leaves the EU at EU level with a challenge on how to deal with enforcement if the TSD Chapter is not adhered to (even if it is legally binding on the EU).

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 73 | P a g e In line with the EC Guidelines (European Commission, 2015a), the analysis should focus on those human rights that are expected to be significantly impacted by the EU-NZ FTA. That is why, based on the findings of the screening and scoping exercise and stakeholder consultations, it has been identified that the following rights will be analysed in detail: right to work and right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and access to essential medicines. 3.5.4.Detailed analysis of scoped rights 3.5.4.1. The right to work The analysis of potential impacts of the EU-NZ FTA on labour rights focuses on their scope enshrined in the eight ILO fundamental conventions, all of which have been ratified by the EU Member States and most of which have been ratified by New Zealand. 91 In this section, we consider potential impacts which may result from the EU-NZ FTA on the right to work as it is defined in Article 6 of the ICESCR and its normative content explained in General Comment No. 18 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The impact of the proposed TSD Chapter and its labour provisions, and the operation of the civil society monitoring mechanism are analysed. Next to that, particular attention is paid to the right to work of various population groups in both the EU and New Zealand that are expected to be affected by the EU-NZ FTA as identified in the screening and scoping exercise. Impacts on specific labour rights (right to favourable and just working conditions, freedom of association and right to collective bargaining, freedom from forced labour, freedom from child labour, non-discrimination at work) are covered in section 3.4. Normative framework The right to work is recognised in various international human rights treaties. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises the right to work in its Article 23(1). In the ICESCR, the right to work is addressed in Article 6: \u201c(1) The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right . (2) The steps to be taken by a State Party to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include technical and vocational guidance and training programmes, policies and techniques to achieve steady economic, social and cultural development and full and productive employment under conditions safeguarding fundamental political and economic freedoms to the individual .\u201d (emphasis added) The scope of the right to work has been further defined by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No. 18. In the framework of the EU-NZ FTA, the analysis will further focus on the following relevant elements that are included in the right to work as stated in the General Comment No.18: \uf0b7 Every individual has the right to be able to work, allowing him/her to live in dignity. The right to work contributes at the same time to the survival of the individual and to that of his/her family (para.1). \uf0b7 Although, Article 6 of the ICESCR does not mean a guarantee of full employment, the right to work encompasses the right not to be unjustly deprived of work, requiring security against unfair dismissal (para. 4, 6); \uf0b7 States must take the requisite measures to reduce to the fullest degree possible the number of workers outside the formal economy to ensure their social protection (para.10); \uf0b7 States must have specialised services to assist and support individuals in order to enable them to identify and access available employment (para. 12(a)); 91 See Annex III.3 for a detailed overview. ",

We will look at the right to work in the framework of labour rights that are also mentioned in Articles 7 and 8 of the ICESCR and core ILO Conventions. Both EU Member States and New Zealand recognise their international obligations with respect to the right to work and other labour rights through ratification of the relevant international instruments. 92 Right to work in the EU The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights explicitly recognises the right to work under its Article 15. Chapter IV on Solidarity provides for a number of labour rights in Articles 27- 34 that reflect upon the international standards and cover among others, workers\u2019 right to information and consultation within the undertaking, right of collective bargaining and action, right of access to placement services, protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, fair and just working conditions). Next to that, the European Commission has adopted various policy instruments that are relevant for respecting, protecting and promoting right to work and rights at work. 93 The EU Member States have state obligations with respect to right to work and other labour rights under the international human rights treaties (ICESCR, CEDAW, CRPD, ILO Conventions). Individual EU countries must make sure that their national laws protect labour rights laid down by EU employment laws. Issues with respect to labour rights vary across Member States. Right to work in New Zealand New Zealand is a party of a number of international human rights treaties that contain provisions related to the right to work: ICESCR (Articles 6(1), 7, 8(1)(a)), ICCPR (Articles 8 and 22), CERD (Articles 5(e)(i) and (ii)), CEDAW (Articles 11 and 14(2)(e)), CRC (Article 32), CRPD (Article 27). These instruments also contain provisions regarding the right to work to specific population groups: women (CEDAW), children (CRC), persons with disability (CRPD). New Zealand is not a party to the ILO Conventions No. 169 on the protection of the rights of the indigenous population, No. 138 (Minimum Age Convention) and No. 087 (Freedom of Association and Protection of the Rights to Organise). The government stresses that this does not diminish in any way New Zealand\u2019s commitment to the objectives of these conventions and points out that the country\u2019s labour policy approach is underpinned by the principles of freedom of association and protecting children from harm in work. New Zealand\u2019s labour-related legislation is based on two sources: statutes and common law. There is a number of statutes that constitute the \u2018minimum code\u2019 for the entitlements of the New Zealand employees. The most prominent statute is the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the \u201cER Act\u201d), which contains key labour-related provisions. Other major sources of labour legislation in New Zealand are listed in Box 3.1. Current labour-related issues in New Zealand include high unemployment rates for M\u0101ori and Pacific People (approximately double the average rate), as well as for persons with disabilities; inequality in the labour market for the M\u0101ori, disadvantaged pension benefits for women that are caused by employment environment for them in the country (see Annex III.3 for a detailed analysis of the state of play with respect to the right to work in New Zealand). 92 For details, see the inception report. 93 Some of them include European Pillar of Social Rights, Communication \u201cSafer and Healthier Work for All\u201d, see more at: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId=82 ",

Potential impact of the EU-NZ FTA on the right to work Quantitative analysis Increased trade flows between the EU and New Zealand triggered by the EU-NZ FTA could promote economic activity and growth, as well as increase in employment overall (given the fact that the model indicates increases in wage levels at the overall level). At sectoral level, however, effects may not always be positive. While some of the sectors for both EU and New Zealand are expected to benefit in terms of increased employment, others are expected to decline, which negatively affects employment. The right to work is expected to be positively affected in the sectors that benefit, but could come under pressure in those sectors that decline if economic push factors are stronger than pull factors. 97 Moreover, in some sectors gains and losses also lead to a broader impact on human rights: e.g. rights of indigenous peoples could be affected in those sectors that actively employ M\u0101ori and Pacific People in New Zealand, especially if there exists a particular vulnerability with respect to their rights from the start (see also section 3.3). In the European Union , in line with modelling results on employment, some sectors are expected to lose out, though to a limited extent, while others are expected to gain from the EU-NZ FTA. In particular, such sectors as rice, sugar, vegetables, fruits and nuts, as well as coal are expected to face small job reduction (around 0.2 percent for both skilled and unskilled workers under the ambitious scenario). The most pronounced job reduction is expected in the ruminant meat sector (1.5 percent for both groups of workers under the 94 Available at: https://www.ilo.org/ifpdial/information-resources/national-labour-law-profiles/WCMS_ 158915/lang--en/index.htm 95 https://www.employment.govt.nz/about/employment-law/legislation/ 96 http://www.legislation.govt.nz 97 A pull factor is one where another sector grows and experiences wage rises \u2013 \u2018pulling\u2019 workers away from a sector that does not grow. The pull factor therefore does not lead to unemployment as workers are incentivised to change jobs (e.g. through higher salaries). The push factor is one where a sector declines without other opportunities in other sectors, which means that workers are made redundant involuntarily. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 76 | P a g e ambitious scenario). Job creation is expected in such sectors as motor vehicles and transport equipment and gas sector (0.3 \u2013 0.4 percent for both groups of workers under the ambitious scenario) \u2013 see Table 3.15 for a detailed overview. Therefore, the right to work could be impacted negatively for those sectors that face job reduction \u2013 less for workers in the rice, sugar, vegetables, fruits and nuts, as well as coal sectors and more for the workers employed in the ruminant sector. In practice, this reduction may be achieved by some farmers moving over time towards different types of farming (i.e. being pulled towards other types of farming that benefit from the FTA). But because the effects are caused \u2013 in the modelled scenario \u2013 by a reduction in tariffs and TRQs \u2013 which could happen instantly if agreed in the negotiations (unlike changes in SPS measures or other regulatory measures that would take much more time to align), there is a risk that the right to work (and the right to an adequate standard of living) is negatively affected if the adjustment occurs immediately. The impact matters further because a large share of the ruminant meat sector in the EU is concentrated in Ireland. A positive impact on the right to work is expected in the sectors where more jobs will be created (motor vehicles and transport, and gas). In New Zealand , the relative impact on the right to work is expected to be larger than in the EU and spread more broadly, affecting more sectors. Thus, the most significant negative impact on the right to work could result for workers in the machinery sector (3.4 percent for unskilled workers and 3.1 percent for skilled workers under the ambitious scenario), motor vehicles and transport equipment (3.2 percent and 2.0 percent respectively), coal sector (3.0 percent and 2.2 percent), cereals sector (1.8 percent and 1.7 percent), metal products (1.8 percent and 1.5 percent), other meats (1.5 percent and 1.3 percent) and sugar (1.5 percent and 1.2 percent). There is a more limited impact in some other sectors that ranges between 0.4 and 1.0 percent (see Table 3.15 in Social Analysis). Because the effects in many of these sectors (except sugar, other meats and cereals sectors) depend on regulatory alignment of technical barriers to trade, the rate of change for these sectors is expected to be much slower than for ruminant meat in the EU. But these impacts may still be more profound for the vulnerable population groups employed in these sectors (women, young workers, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, migrant workers) and specific measures may need to be taken to mitigate possible negative impacts. Tailor-made, specifically directed programmes or task forces may need to be created to assist these population groups in organising necessary trainings, helping them adjust to new employment positions, ensuring that their rights are not violated at any stage of the employment adjustment. In this respect, it is important to note that New Zealand has not ratified ILO Conventions No. 169, No. 138 and No. 087 (see analysis above) and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. Because of the reported existing sensitivities with respect to these vulnerable groups, stakeholders expressed concern that labour rights may not be adequately protected and impair implementation of the standards voiced in the textual proposal for the TSD Chapter of the EU-NZ FTA. A strong positive impact on the right to work in New Zealand is expected in such sectors as ruminant meat (with job creation of up to 4.1 percent for unskilled workers and 4.2 for unskilled workers under the ambitious scenario), vegetables, fruits and nuts sector (2.9 percent for both groups of workers under the conservative scenario), other animal products (1.1 percent for both groups of workers under the conservative scenario), minerals (0.7 percent for both groups of workers under the conservative scenario), utility, including water supply and construction (1.0 percent for unskilled workers and 1.2 percent for skilled ones under the ambitious scenario), minerals (0.7 percent for both groups of workers under the ambitious scenario), textiles, apparel and leather (0.6 percent for unskilled workers and 0.7 for skilled one under the conservative scenario), and dairy products (0.5 and 0.6 percent, whereas under the conservative scenario, this sector is estimated to experience a job reduction of 0.8 percent for both groups of workers). See Table 3.15 above for a detailed overview of employment changes. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 77 | P a g e Because the drivers of the effects in the agricultural sectors are tariffs and TRQs, these effects could materialise quickly when the trade measures are adjusted (unless a phase out over time is agreed that would spread out the potential positive effects over a longer time period). This means that workers in the sectors that benefit from the EU-NZ FTA, will be able to quickly feel the positive impact. It is difficult to predict the exact direction of the overall impact, as opportunities from the EU-NZ FTA will have to be accurately managed by the New Zealand authorities with the priority to assist most vulnerable groups of the population. For example, staff shortages in such sectors as ruminant meat and dairy could be met by migrant workers, persons with disabilities or other population groups already employed in agricultural sectors and suffering from discrimination and unfair treatment (see state of the play analysis on human rights in Annex III.3 and Social Analysis). Other vulnerable groups, such as women, young workers, temporary workers, migrants, persons with disabilities, persons working in conditions of slavery also often work in agricultural sectors\u2013 e.g. fruits and vegetables, agriculture in general, meat processing. They could benefit from the EU-NZ FTA, if New Zealand authorities manage to spread the positive effects to these groups. The projected sectoral employment opportunities and overall wage increase suggest that these is also room in these sectors to use part of the newly earned opportunities for supporting workers in these sectors (farmers, workers on the farms, etc.). For declining sectors, adjustment mechanisms for workers to find new jobs in other sectors (i.e. the pull effect) generally work much less effective for vulnerable groups as these tend to have less education, less flexibility, and do not so easily \u2018switch\u2019 \u2013 and many not want to because they are afraid to do that. So they require special attention of New Zealand authorities at different levels. Qualitative analysis The TSD Chapter that is expected to be included in the EU-NZ FTA aims to promote and ensure effective implementation of the highest standards of labour, safety, environmental and consumer protection as well as enhance civil society inclusion in all areas of the Agreement. 98 The proposed TSD Chapter for the EU-NZ FTA is expected to include a set of provisions enshrined in ILO Conventions and promotes their effective implementation (Article X.3(2), (4), (5)). It suggests that it will include not only aspirational provisions but also binding obligations for the parties that are intended to be enforced by the TSD Sub-Committees (Article X.12) \u201cthrough dialogue, consultation, exchange of information and cooperation\u201d between the Parties (Article X.13), and stakeholder involvement via domestic civil society bodies (Article X.14). Binding dispute settlement mechanism coordinated by a Panel of Experts (Article X.15) is aimed to achieve joint compliance (enforcement in line with the so-called \u201dmanagerial model\u201d that \u201cadvocates a cooperative, problem solving approach to promoting compliance with international law\u201d as opposed to the \u201dsanctions model\u201d used by the US and Canada, for example (Kommerskollegium, 2016). The effectiveness of this compliance mechanism will have to be seen but is a step in the right direction from the more aspirational texts used by the EU in earlier FTAs. In particular, these provisions could be used to support the position of vulnerable groups in sectors that are negatively affected and monitor closely environmental developments as a consequence of the EU-NZ FTA. The draft specifies promotion of the Decent Work Agenda (Article X.3(7)) and, moreover, in Article X.3(3), aims to facilitate ratification of all the ILO Conventions by the Parties (recall that New Zealand has not yet ratified the ILO Minimum Age Convention No. 138 and ILO Convention No. 87 on freedom of association and protection of the rights to organise). 98 Council of the European Union, Negotiating directives for a Free Trade Agreement with Australia, 7663/18 Add 1 DCL 1, 25 June 2018, p.17, available at: http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-7663- 2018-ADD-1-DCL-1/en/pdf ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 78 | P a g e The textual proposal also contains provisions that address strengthened cooperation in labour (Article X.3(9)) and civil society involvement (Article X.14). Active civil society participation is encouraged in Articles X.11 and X.14 of the TSD Chapter, providing for regular consultations and communication action. In this connection, the TSD Chapter is viewed as a working incentive for the implementation of the existing legislation and fine- tuning the remaining issues in line with international standards and developing solutions that will ensure enjoyment of the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs and increase transparency. Next to that, the TSD Chapter aims to facilitate trade and responsible supply chain management through RBC/CSR practices (Art. X.9), having regard to internationally recognised instruments (such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, the UN Global Compact and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights). It plays an important role in significantly contributing to effective implementation of international labour standards and exercising pressure on companies to follow international rules of responsible business conduct. Overall, inclusion of the TSD Chapter is expected to have a direct positive impact on labour rights in both EU and New Zealand, although protection of specific vulnerable groups (e.g. women, indigenous peoples) seems not to be addressed in detail, there is a commitment in the TSD Chapter to respect the Core labour standard of elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Since human rights issues in general concern more specific vulnerable groups of the population rather than general population of the EU and New Zealand, both Parties could benefit from specific provisions concerning commitments and cooperation on protection of the rights of vulnerable groups. 3.5.4.2 The right to highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and access to essential medicines The right to health is recognised in various international human rights treaties. Article 25(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \u201cEveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services.\u201d Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) \u201cprovides the most comprehensive article on the right to health in international human rights law\u201d. 99 The right to health is an inclusive right, it includes a wide range of \u201cunderlying determinants of health.\u201d It includes safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, safe food, adequate nutrition and housing, healthy working and environmental conditions, health related education and information, gender equality. 100 Access to essential medicines is a part of the right to the highest attainable standard of health and includes essential medicines \u201cas defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Action Programme on Essential Drugs.\u201d 101 Other instruments referring to the right to health include CEDAW (Articles 10(h), 11(1)(f), 12 14(2)(b) and 16(1)(e)), CRC (Articles 24 and 25), CRPD (Articles 23(1)(c) and 25), CERD (Article 5(iv)) that cover such vulnerable groups as women, children, persons with disabilities. Obligations of the states with respect to right to health include the adoption of necessary measures for its progressive realisation based on the principle of non-retrospection, without discrimination, while respecting, protecting and fulfilling it, even through international cooperation and assistance. Also, in line with the AAAQ (availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality) framework outlined in the CESCR General Comment No. 14, states are obliged to provide a functional public health system, and facilitate access to essential health facilities, goods and services.

In August 2017, the WHO Regional Office for Europe developed a roadmap to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 103 building on Health 2020, the European policy for health and well-being (WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2017). While noting uneven improvements in health and well-being among the Member States, the Roadmap notes that according to several health indicators (outcome indicators), 104 the overall situation with respect to health has improved in the EU. For example, life expectancy at birth increased from 73.9 years in 2000 to 77.5 years in 2014, though years of life in good health still remains a concern. Also, global maternal mortality ratio has been reduced, but reproductive health disparities within and among member states remain. Mortality rates for children under 5 years old have also reduced but further investment in children and adolescent health is necessary. The tuberculosis incidence rate has been declining by 4.5% each year since 2015, even though 20% of tuberculosis cases are of a multidrug resistant variety. Finally, high coverage in vaccinations measles and rubella has been reached and maintained at the levels of 94% and 89% respectively, but have dropped recently. Most Member States offer universal or nearly universal health coverage (WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2017). Issues that remain a concern include: social inequalities affecting the right to health \u2013 families with lower income levels have poorer health; an increasing number of migrants pose health implications for the EU member states; the need to protect populations from environmental pollution remains; health damaging lifestyles (unbalanced diets, harmful use of alcohol and tobacco use) complicate health situation in Europe and antimicrobial resistance is considered a serious health threat (WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2017). Access to essential medicines In the EU, right to access to essential medicines is a Member State competence. However, EU institutions are constantly working on improving the access to medicines in the EU, through presenting a range of EU initiatives (e.g. the European Charter of Patients\u2019 Rights, based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union) and through raising awareness on prices, accessibility, acceptability, affordability and availability of medicines in the EU. EU institutions call on Member States to foster research and development with respect to patients\u2019 needs and promote open data in research on medicines where public funding is involved as well as ethical behaviour and transparency in the pharmaceutical sector in general. There are a number of Directives that are relevant for the right to health in general at the EU level (e.g. among others, Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross border healthcare and Paediatric Regulation comprising of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 on the medicinal products for paediatric use and Regulation (EC) No. 1902/2006).

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 81 | P a g e generally functions well. Public funds allocated for health care amount to the second largest area of expenditure. There are various strategies and policies designed in order to ensure provision of healthcare and the underlying determinants of the right to health (e.g. He Korowai Oranga: M\u0101ori Health Strategy, Primary Health Care Strategy, Cancer Control Strategy, New Zealand Disability Strategy, etc.). 109 Most of the funds come from taxation. The Ministry of Health oversees the health system and directly administers funds to such national services as disability support services for citizens under 65 years, public health services, Well Child Programme (support services for children from birth till 5 years) and midwife services. Most health funding is performed through twenty geographically distributed District Health Boards (DHBs), which are responsible for planning, delivering and funding services in their districts. Overall, New Zealanders live relatively long and healthy lives (life expectancy at birth is at 80 years for men and 83.4 years for women). 110 However, life expectancy for M\u0101ori and Pacific populations is lower by 7.3 years for men and 6.8 years for women. 111 Main risk factors for health are smoking (especially high rates are recorded for M\u0101ori), poor diet, lack of physical activity, and abuse of alcohol and drugs. The health system records poor performance in mental health, including high suicide rates, especially for young people and M\u0101ori. Equity remains an issue also as M\u0101ori, Pacific and lower income people have high rates of unfilled prescriptions due to cost and have poor access to dental care. 112 Access to essential medicines New Zealand has prices for medicines that are around 8 times cheaper than in Australia. New Zealand is able to achieve such savings because of a combination of programme budgeting, tough price negotiations and different procurement mechanisms, such as competitive tendering. 113 The downside of this policy is, however, that fewer medicines (including innovative medicines) are reimbursed in New Zealand, leading to a reduced access to essential medicines for patients. For example, between 2000 and 2009, only 43 percent of all medicines listed in Australia were available in New Zealand\u2019s Pharmaceutical Schedule. Also, these listings occurred, on average, 32.7 months after Australia, 114 and New Zealand was the country that reimbursed the fewest cancer indications of 13 countries or regions compared. 115 One reason for this is that New Zealand works with a capped budget meaning the health authorities in New Zealand must prioritise new drugs against other new and existing drugs (for budget). This leads to an inferior situation with respect to access to medicines in New Zealand, especially when Australia \u2013 in comparison \u2013 also considers cost-effectiveness of new drugs. Lack of access to new innovative medicines in New Zealand is negative for patients when looked at in isolation: patients want to and should have access to the latest available treatments and medicines as it strengthens their right to health. However, when the budget is not infinite, switching to other brands (if really equivalent) to keep costs under control, or to carry out a cost effectiveness analysis before reimbursing new drugs helps governments to maximise the usefulness of the overall medicines offer for patients \u2013 which may have the result of not reimbursing a new, innovative drug that is not considered cost- effective enough. For example, in New Zealand, insulin pumps are subsidised for all patients with Type 1 diabetes, which is \u2018better access\u2019 than in many other countries, 109 Available at: https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/9714/2388/0506/HRNZ_10_Right_to_health.pdf 110 OECD (2017) database, available at: https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/life-expectancy-at-birth.htm 111 Statistics New Zealand (2017), Life expectancy.

Also, the lower co-payments for prescriptions in New Zealand make them more accessible for the general population. While the New Zealand government continues to look into further solutions to the challenge of medicines availability, the EU experience could prove useful for New Zealand as well as some research on medicines shortages. 116 EAHP (2014) shows that two out of three hospital pharmacies report that shortages affect their work and in some cases the situations are even worse. According to Maynou and Cairns (2017), medicines shortages in some EU countries (e.g. Scotland, England, Belgium and Poland) are due to pricing and reimbursement decisions by the health technology assessment and national pricing bodies. Their decisions not to reimburse medicines has led to a share of medicines being restricted for use at all (e.g. 26 percent of medicines in Scotland, 31 percent in Poland and 29 percent in Belgium) while another share is looked at non-favourably. 117 Another reason for lack of access comes from formulary availability. An ESMO (2016) study shows that with respect to medicines for lung cancer, some medicines listing and availability on formularies in Poland mean that Gefitinib \u2013 for example, is not available. 118 Finally, IMS Health (2015) notes that in Europe parallel trade has caused shortages in countries like Bulgaria, Greece and Spain that were very severe. 119 Theses causes point to broader elements for the New Zealand government to investigate in order to ensure that essential medicines reach patients in need. In addition, in New Zealand there are particular concerns about equitable access for M\u0101ori and Pacific Island people \u2013 who, it seems, have a lack of access to some drugs. Also, financial considerations seem to outweigh other important criteria (e.g. usefulness or efficacy). 120 Moreover, the New Zealand population overall is ageing so the demand for medicines will only increase in the future, with patients expecting expensive medicines to be funded by the government. Though concerns have been expressed with CPTPP that access to affordable medicines may be negatively impacted, no such evidence has emerged to date. In any case, public consultations and patient inputs into healthcare debates should be encouraged. The entire healthcare system is about helping patients in the end: preventing people from becoming patients, but once they are, helping them with general and expert support and with generic and innovative treatments. In each of these elements patients should be central: value-based healthcare focuses on value for patients (outcomes) at the lowest possible cost over the full care cycle to achieve these outcomes (Porter, 2019). Potential impact of the EU-NZ FTA on the right to health The right to health is generally a domestic matter but, in some cases, it could potentially be affected by trade measures introduced as a result of a trade agreement. Because human rights are interdependent and intertwined by nature, some of the impacts on the right to health stem from other rights, especially since the impact on the right to health is related to those rights that are more directly linked to the potential economic impact of the EU-NZ FTA, like the right to a clean environment and the right to water. Because of this indirect link, most of the effects are expected to be minor in nature (see Table 3.16 above and section 3.6 on environmental analysis). Exact textual proposals are not known, but because 116 EAHP (2014), Medicines shortages in European Hospitals, available at: http://www.ordre.pharmacien.fr/ content/download/193899/1082308/version/2/file/EAHP+-+Rupture+d%27approvisionnement+dans+les+ h\u00f4pitaux+europeens+-+octobre+2014.pdf 117 Mainou L. & J.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 83 | P a g e this topic has been very sensitive for the stakeholders, it is approached here in more detail nonetheless. Because policies related to the right to health are often developed at national level \u2013 from healthcare to food safety and clean air and water policies \u2013 many effects do not depend on the EU-NZ FTA. There are, however, some elements that matter and that we look at for potential impacts \u2013 see also Table 3.16 above. In particular, we cover health and food, access to medicines, and biodiversity and the environment \u2013 because all three of these aspects directly affect the right to health for EU and New Zealand\u2019s citizens. We do this against the current state of play with respect to the economic, social, human rights and environmental situations in the EU and New Zealand that \u2013 though facing challenges as in any other country- are generally showing high levels of standards and regulatory systems. Health and food There is an ongoing debate on whether trade liberalisation causes more trade in, and cheaper prices for, foodstuffs that can have harmful effects on health, such as drinks with high amounts of sugar and other products (e.g. alcoholic beverages, tobacco). The beverages and tobacco sectors are expected to benefit from the FTA, which may be an indication that there could be challenges. However, the increase seems to come mostly from the wine sector. Moreover, the production in the EU does not change, while in New Zealand it increases by 0.7 percent. The growth in exports from the EU to New Zealand by 6.0 percent and from New Zealand to the EU by 14.5 percent comes in part from trade diversion elsewhere. Finally, in the SPS textual proposals it is made clear that both the EU and New Zealand have a clear right to regulate, and a potential increase in trade also does not automatically mean that consumer behaviour is changing. An increase in wine exports from New Zealand to the EU by 14.5 percent amounts to an increase of \u20ac 12.2 million, which is 0.003 percent of the total EU wine production. Access to medicines The healthcare sector is comprised of providers of diagnostic, preventive, remedial and therapeutic services (e.g. doctors, nurses, hospitals), as well as medical equipment and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Healthcare policies are developed at national levels, including pricing & reimbursement systems, policies regarding primary care, as well as health technology assessments for medicines, and competition policy and other related aspects. So, the main effects do not depend on the EU-NZ FTA. Moreover, due to the fact that the details of the legal text that are relevant for the analysis are not known at the moment of writing of this report (e.g. how long will regulatory data protection be provided for or what supplementary protection certificate provisions will be part of the EU-NZ FTA), it is not clear if the impact is going to be major or minor/ positive or negative. The negotiations are ongoing, in the April 2019 round of negotiations, the topic of intellectual property (IP) has been discussed. 121 The main question is what the effect of RDP and SPC provisions would mean for the access to medicines and for healthcare costs. EPHA (2018) notes that stronger IP provisions in FTAs could lead to reduced access to medicines and higher prices for longer periods of time, in the case of developing countries (e.g. if patent term extension is covered in the FTA) 122 . Conversely, an NDP Analytics study (2019) shows that stronger IP provisions in US FTAs (where IP provisions are much stronger than in EU FTAs) have not led to an increase in healthcare costs \u2013 rather the contrary. 123 Because SPCs are granted in cases where regulatory approvals take such a long time that effective patent protection is hollowed out, a focus on streamlining regulatory approvals in order to achieve faster patient access is a priority. Because New Zealand\u2019s systems to contain the 121 Update from 3rd round of negotiations in April 2019, available at: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/ 2019/april/tradoc_157864.pdf 122 European Health P (2017), Unhealthy Trades: The Side-effects of the European Union\u2019s Latin American trade Agreements, p.20, available at: https://epha.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Unhealthy-Trade- Mercosur.pdf 123 Pham D.N. & M.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 84 | P a g e costs for medicines lead to delays in drug approvals (a delay of 32.7 months compared to Australia is the result, in part due to New Zealand\u2019s unique regulatory environment), SPCs could be a necessary tool to keep the New Zealand market sufficiently focused on rewarding innovation. Regulatory streamlining would mean patients get faster access to medicines, societal health outcomes are more effectively improved, and the need for SPC protection is lower. We believe that access to medicines is rightfully a priority issue for the New Zealand government in general and patients in particular. Clean environment From the environmental detailed analysis, we can infer that the EU-NZ FTA could marginally increase the GHG emissions in New Zealand, while not much impacting the EU. This could have a very small effect on the right to health , in particular the right to a clean environment . Moreover, the growth in trade in general and agricultural production in particular (especially ruminant meat and fruits, vegetables & nuts) could have an impact on the right to a clean environment, because the former leads to more emissions and could pose extra challenges for New Zealand (an \u2018island-economy\u2019) to keep out invasive foreign species that could affect the delicate biodiversity balance, and the latter could lead to more emissions related to the beef and sheep meat sector as well as pressure on the environment via changes in land use. These mechanisms that could impact on the right to a clean environment need to be monitored carefully. 3.5.5. Policy recommendations and flanking measures \uf0b7 We recommend New Zealand to ratify the ILO Convention No. 87 concerning freedom of association and protection of the right to organise, the ILO Minimum Age Convention No. 138. In addition, the Parties should continue their dialogue on the protection of rights of vulnerable population groups potentially affected by the FTA. With this aim, the FTA should include commitments by the Parties to ratify the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention No. 169 and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families to strengthen protection of the rights of the respective vulnerable groups in line with the international standards. \uf0b7 We note that as of December 2019 New Zealand has ratified the 2014 Protocol to the ILO Forced Labour Convention No. 29 and recommend also those EU Member States who did not yet do so, to ratify it. \uf0b7 Because of the predicted shifts in employment triggered by the Agreement, both parties should consider allocation of special budget to provide for the training programmes and necessary social support of the workers that are expected to be negatively affected by the EU-NZ FTA, monitoring that the right to work of the workers from the affected sectors is not violated. \uf0b7 Based on the analysis of the impact (see above), we recommend removing the EU tariffs and TRQs in agriculture, as well as those in New Zealand \u2013 if agreed - gradually, with time adjustment paths, to allow the ruminant sector in the EU and the farmers to adjust slowly. Next to that, we recommend that the EU authorities carefully monitor labour rights of the workers from declining sectors ensuring that their rights are not violated and assist them in adjusting to the new situation. For the workers in the ruminant sector, given the potential negative employment consequences of the ambitious scenario, the EU may need to reflect on costs and benefits from the full liberalisation in this sector as opposed to partial liberalisation. \uf0b7 We recommend that New Zealand considers introduction of a special taskforce directed at monitoring that the labour rights of the workers from the declining sectors are protected and allocate financial resources in order to assist affected workers in adjusting to the new employment situation. Next to that, we recommend that New Zealand authorities establish a separate taskforce that works out a detailed plan on how to use benefits from the growing sectors and direct them to the needs of the vulnerable groups employed in the sector. \uf0b7 Complementing the TSD Chapter, which already includes binding obligations for the Parties that are intended to be enforced by the TSD Sub-Committees, the Parties should ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 85 | P a g e consider including provisions on FTA effects for specific vulnerable groups (indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, children, women, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers) that contain clear and measurable targets to strengthen their rights within the framework of the FTA. \uf0b7 In the framework of CSR/RBC, all relevant stakeholders (government, civil society, companies, interest groups, etc.) should work on promoting the human rights responsibilities of companies and monitoring their responsible business conduct \u2013 setting up public-private-partnerships is one way to proceed. \uf0b7 While the exact text of the EU-NZ FTA is not available at the time of writing of this report, access to essential medicines may be affected. Increased IP protection stimulates innovation and contributes to reducing medicines shortages, but it can also put certain pressure on the New Zealand government via budget pressures for healthcare (despite some of it being earned back further in the system) in case new innovative drugs hit the market and no economic benefit assessment is in place. The FTA should aim to contribute to availability of medicines for patients in New Zealand to reduce costs in the New Zealand healthcare system. \uf0b7 Finally, we recommend to include continued monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the EU-NZ FTA, not just once after five years, and to carry out a targeted assessment of the human rights impact of the EU-NZ FTA at regular intervals to ensure proper implementation of the parts of the Agreement relevant for human rights (e.g. TSD Chapter) but also to assess whether other parts of the Agreement identified as possibly affecting human rights had any impact and if so, its nature, direction and degree. 3.6. Environmental impact analysis 3.6.1.Introduction This section analyses the potential environmental impacts of the EU-NZ FTA. To do so, six environmental impact areas are analysed: climate change, air quality, land use & soil quality, ecosystems & biodiversity, water quality & quantity and waste & waste management. For each environmental impact area, we discuss the state of play and the impact of the EU-NZ FTA. The state of play contains a description of the governance framework (which is not shown here, but in Annex III.4) and the environmental performance. When relevant, New Zealand\u2019s state of play is compared to the EU. The state of play sections are kept brief on purpose in order to avoid overlap with the work done for the ex-ante study and other recent TSIAs. The reader is referred to the ex-ante study (LSE, 2017) in case more details on the state of play for certain impact categories are desired. 3.6.2.Climate change State of Play - New Zealand is on track to meet its 2020 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) which aims to reduce the net Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions to 5 percent below 1990 emission levels. Climate Action rates their 2020 NDC as \u201ccompatible with the 2 \u00b0C target\u201d (Climate Action, 2018). New Zealand furthermore committed to a 2030 reduction target of 30 percent below 2005 emission levels (which is, in contrast, rated as \u201cinsufficient to keep global warming below 2 \u00b0C\u201d). In comparison, the EU committed to a 40 percent reduction compared to 1990 levels, but also that ambition is judged too low to meet the Paris goal (Mathiesen & Sauer, 2018). The country\u2019s gross GHG emissions increased by 19.6 percent from 1990 to 2016, but 2016 emissions (roughly 79 Megaton CO 2 -equivalents) were lower than peak emissions, which occurred in 2006 (roughly 83 Mton CO 2 -eq). The transport and agriculture sectors (dairy in particular) have, over the years, contributed the most to the rise in gross emissions. New Zealand\u2019s net GHG emissions show an opposite trend resulting from their Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) policy. In 2017, for instance, New Zealand offset around 24 Mton CO 2 - eq with their LULUCF policy. Figure 3.3 shows the emissions (in CO 2 -eq) of the three major GHGs in New Zealand and Table 3.17 the responsible sectors in 2012. In contrast to most ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 86 | P a g e countries, New Zealand\u2019s most significant GHG is methane (CH 4 ) rather than carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) or nitrous oxide (N 2 0) - 43, 41 and 15 percent respectively 124 . Figure 3.3: Gross GHG emissions in Mton CO2-eq in 2012 in New Zealand and the EU27 Source: EDGAR The agricultural sector is responsible for the lion\u2019s share of both the CH 4 and the N 2 O emissions. In fact, more than 95 percent of the CH 4 and N 2 O emissions were caused by different activities in the agricultural sector (predominantly enteric fermentation and manure). Table 3.17: Sector shares in GHG emissions in 2012 in New Zealand and the EU27 Source: Trinomics based on EDGAR EU-NZ FTA impact on Climate Change Qualitative assessment According to the proposed TSD chapter published in May 2019, the EU and New Zealand would commit to effectively implement the Paris Agreement and their respective NDCs 125 . Both Parties will also facilitate the removal of obstacles to trade and investments of products that are particularly relevant for climate mitigation or adaptation. Should this be eventually agreed between the Parties, this could, theoretically, have a positive impact on the global climate. However, as no concrete measures are specified, we cannot comment on the effectiveness of this plan. On a global level, both Parties reconfirm their commitments to strengthening their cooperation on multilateral environmentally related agreements and fora, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the WTO, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the International Maritime Organisation. The proposed TSD chapter also foresees institutional mechanisms such as monitoring, committees and government consultations which add new processes to this framework and allow the Parties to raise their concerns on climate change at the bilateral level. The aim of these provisions would be to lock in the commitment to ensure effective implementation of Paris Agreement and right to regulate in the bilateral FTA context. Consequently, the aim would be to set out the framework for joint work on trade and climate issues in the implementation and thereby generate positive impacts. 124 CH \u2084 and N \u2082 O emissions contribute much more (25 and 298 times more than CO \u2082 , respectively) to global warming than CO \u2082 . When emissions are expressed in CO \u2082 -eq., CH \u2084 emissions are multiplied by 25 and N \u2082 O emissions by 298 to illustrate their impact on global warming 125 Available at: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2019/april/tradoc_157866.pdf 34 3,506 35 453 13 247 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% New Zealand EU27 CO\u2082 CH\u2084 N\u2082O NZL EU NZL EU NZL EU Road transportation 36% 22% Public electricity and heat production 19% 36% Manufacturing industries and construction 15% 11% Residential and other sectors 9% 17% Other Energy Industries 5% 4% Enteric fermentation 74% 30% Solid waste disposal on land 11% 19% Manure management 10% 9% Fugitive emissions from oil and gas 2% 13% Fugitive emissions from solid fuels 1% 13% Manure in pasture/range/paddock 64% 10% Direct soil emissions 17% 37% Indirect N2O from agriculture 14% 12% Production of chemicals unknown 14% Other 17% 9% 2% 18% 5% 27% CO\u2082 CH\u2084 N\u2082O Sector ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 87 | P a g e The FTA is expected to affect climate change mostly through its impact on volume of economic activity in the agricultural sector, specifically the meat and dairy sectors, because both contribute a large share in total GHG emissions in New Zealand. Therefore, we assessed the impact of the FTA on the most important GHGs which are emitted in these sectors: CH\u2084 and N\u2082O (see next section). Moreover, the meat and dairy sector are separately analysed in the sector studies (see Chapter 4). Aside from the agricultural sector, the transport sector (road, maritime and aviation) also contributes significantly to climate change in both New Zealand and the EU through CO 2 emissions. The FTA\u2019s impact on CO 2 emissions has, however, already been assessed in the ex-ante study (LSE, 2017). For this reason, we focus on other GHGs. It should be noted, though, that because of the large distance between the EU and New Zealand, increased trade between the EU and New Zealand will in most cases create additional GHG emissions from the transport sector. In contrast to trade between countries with relatively small distances between one another, increased trade between the EU and New Zealand does not only increase the GHG emissions from transport in the case of trade creation, but also in case of trade diversion (as trade between the EU and New Zealand will replace trade between two parties with smaller distances between one another in most cases). These effects are already incorporated in the CGE model, which includes the transport sector, at least with regard to CO 2 emissions. Quantitative assessment The impacts of the FTA on the environmental impact areas climate change and air pollution have been assessed quantitatively. In order to clearly show the dynamics and the drivers of the effects of the trade deal on climate change and air pollutants, three different effects are considered: \uf0b7 The scale effect : the impact resulting from the overall change in production due to the FTA; \uf0b7 The structural effect : the impact resulting from the change in production due to the FTA, taking into account the sectoral output changes and sectoral emissions of GHGs and air pollutants; and \uf0b7 The technology effect : the impact resulting from the exchange of technologies and production methods with (e.g.) different efficiencies resulting in a change of emissions per unit of production. The quantitative assessment combines data resulting from the quantitative model and environmental data on GHG emissions and air pollutants. The methodological note in Annex II provides more details about the calculations and assumptions taken for the analysis. In New Zealand, the overall rise in production resulting from the FTA ( scale effect ), is expected to lead to 0.077 to 0.196 Mton additional annual CH\u2084 emissions and 0.028 to 0.07 Mton additional annual N\u2082O emissions from 2030 onwards compared to the baseline 126 scenario (in CO\u2082-eq). In the EU, the scale effect is expected to create 0.059 to 0.09 Mton additional annual CH\u2084 emissions and 0.028 to 0.043 Mton additional annual N\u2082O emissions. In line with the increase in economic activity expected as a result of the FTA due to the reduction in costs of placing products and services on the market and the assumptions that overall aggregate demand will also slightly increase as a result of the FTA and emission intensities stay the same, GHG emissions are expected to increase concomitantly. Moreover, the predicted additional trade flows between the EU and New Zealand will result in an increase in GHG emissions from the transportation of goods. The FTA is likely to lead to additional trade flows that would not have taken place globally at all as well as some diversion of trade flows from existing trading partners. Of course for the effect on total emissions from transport it matters from where the trade flows would be diverted, but since the distance between the EU and New Zealand is likely to be larger than the average 126 The baseline emissions in have been estimated by correcting the EDGAR 2012 emission data using the projected change in non CO 2 GHG emissions between 2010 and 2030 from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 88 | P a g e distance with main trading partners between the EU and New Zealand, an overall increase in GHG emissions from increased transportation of goods is expected \u2013 as noted above, this effect is incorporated in the CGE simulations. Changes in output resulting from the FTA as well as current CH\u2084 and N\u2082O emissions differ substantially across sectors. As such, the scale effect alone does not accurately estimate the true impact of the FTA on GHG emissions in New Zealand and the EU. Figure 3.4 shows the annual impact of the FTA on CH\u2084 and N\u2082O emissions per sector 127 compared to the baseline 2030 scenario. This figure clearly demonstrates the importance of the combined effect of the FTA\u2019s impact on New Zealand\u2019s agricultural sector and the dominant role of this sector in CH\u2084 and N\u2082O emissions. In the conservative scenario, output in the meat and dairy sector decreases by 0.54 percent. As the large majority of CH\u2084 emissions is created by this sector, the overall CH\u2084 emissions in New Zealand decrease as well in this scenario. In the ambitious scenario (with increased trade liberalisation), however, output is expected to increase significantly in the meat and dairy sector (by 1.64 percent). The rise in CH\u2084 emissions from the meat and dairy sector is equal to 96 percent of the total rise in CH\u2084 emissions in the ambitious scenario. N\u2082O emissions are mainly created by activities in the wider agricultural sector (including horticulture). Since output is expected to rise significantly in the horticulture sector (+1.91 percent, mainly due to intensified production of fruits and vegetables), the sum of the N\u2082O emissions is positive in both scenarios. We note, however, that calculated emission increases from the beef and sheep meat sectors are likely to be overestimated in line with the likely overestimated output effects calculated in the model. Figure 3.4: CH 4 and N 2 O emissions per sector resulting from the FTA in New Zealand The composition effect (the sum of all sector effects) shows that a conservative FTA is estimated to decrease CH\u2084 emissions by 0.154 Mton in 2030 compared to the 2030 baseline scenario in New Zealand but to increase CH\u2084 emissions by 0.527 Mton in case of an ambitious FTA. N\u2082O emissions are expected to rise by 0.033 Mton (conservative) to 0.196 Mton (ambitious) in 2030 compared to the 2030 baseline (in CO\u2082-eq). In the EU (as shown in Figure 3.5), the opposite effects are expected: CH\u2084 emissions are expected to increase by 0.109 Mton in the conservative scenario, but to decrease by 0.409 Mton in the ambitious scenario (in CO\u2082-eq). N\u2082O emissions are expected to decrease by 0.048 (conservative) to 0.226 (ambitious) Mton (in CO\u2082-eq). In short, in the ambitious scenario, intensified agricultural activities in New Zealand increase CH\u2084 and N\u2082O emissions.

This would be captured by a potential technology effect of the FTA. However, it is unclear how this technology effect would influence the beef and sheep meat sector, and therefore no quantitative assessment of this potential effect is undertaken. The large majority of emissions is created by enteric fermentation of cattle and we expect no large differences between emissions from identical cattle in New Zealand and the EU. It is, however, possible that increased exchange of goods with better environmental performance can induce positive impacts on the global climate by replacing products with lower environmental performance. For the technology effect on CO\u2082 emissions we refer to the ex-ante study. 129 As GHG emissions have global impacts, it is the global effect on GHG emissions that matters. Table 3.18 shows the total effect of the FTA on CH\u2084 and N\u2082O emissions in the relevant countries, and at a global level. In New Zealand, CH\u2084 emissions are expected to decrease by 0.42 percent (0.154 Mton CO\u2082-eq) in the conservative scenario, but to increase by 1.44 percent (0.527 Mton CO\u2082-eq) in the ambitious scenario.

As a result of trade diversion, the expected increase in production in certain sectors in New Zealand and the EU is partially offset by a decrease in production in certain sectors in the rest of the world.

It is ranked 7 th globally in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, based on an assessment of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from household solid fuels, PM\u2082.\u2085 average exposure and PM\u2082.\u2085 exceedance. Together with PM\u2081\u2080, these pollutants make up the most common negative contributors to New Zealand\u2019s air quality (via wood & coal burning for home heating and vehicle emissions). The concentrations of particulate matter PM\u2081\u2080 were measured at 96 sites across the country between 1996 and 2017. They have decreased at many locations over the most-recent decade for which complete data is available (2007-2016), with decreases recorded especially in the spring and winter seasons. PM\u2082.\u2085 measurements are much more scarce, but of the sites with enough data to calculate trends in the monthly average from 2007-2016, 3 of 4 airsheds had a decreasing trend in winter. Over the most recent three years for which data on PM\u2081\u2080 is available (2014-2016), however, 30 of 51 airsheds still exceeded the National Emission Standards for Air Quality for 24-hour average limits (50 \u00b5g/m 3 ). Over the most recent three-year period (2014-2016) for which there is complete PM\u2082.\u2085 data, 4 of 11 monitored airsheds were also higher than the WHO annual average guideline (2018) 131 for long-term exposure (10 \u00b5g/m 3 ). Table 3.19 shows the sectors that emitted most of the air pollutants (in 2012). In 2016, 121 kton NO \u2093 was emitted in New Zealand, 46 kton PM\u2081\u2080and 34 kton PM\u2082.\u2085 (NZ Stats, 2018). 131 There is no National Emissions Standard for PM \u2082 . \u2085 . Therefore, the WHO guidelines are used as an adequate benchmark measurement. ",

As a result, the potential impact of the FTA on the efforts from both parties to strengthen their air quality policies are considered unlikely. Therefore we focus on the expected impact of the FTA on emissions of the most important air pollutants (NO \u2093 , SO\u2082, PM\u2082.\u2085 and PM\u2081\u2080) by analysing the effect of the FTA on production volumes. It should be noted that the quantitative assessment only analyses the absolute and relative changes in emissions of air pollutants (i.e. not the emission source). To ultimately assess the effect of air pollution on human health, the emission source is of crucial importance. Air pollution in very sparsely populated areas is less harmful than air pollution in more densely populated areas. Quantitative assessment The overall rise in production resulting from the FTA ( scale effect ) 132 is expected to create between 0.24 to 0.60 kton additional NO \u2093 , 0.08 to 0.20 kton additional SO\u2082, 0.02 to 0.04 kton additional PM\u2082.\u2085 and 0.05 to 0.13 kton additional PM\u2081\u2080 emissions annually from 2030 onwards in New Zealand. In the EU, the scale effect is expected to create between 1.03 to 1.58 kton additional NO \u2093 , 0.71 to 1.09 kton additional SO\u2082, 0.08 to 0.13 kton additional PM\u2082.\u2085 and 0.28 to 0.43 kton additional PM\u2081\u2080 emissions. Figure 3.6 and Figure 3.7 show the impact of the FTA on air pollutants per sector compared to the 2030 baseline scenario for New Zealand and the EU respectively. Figure 3.6 shows that the majority of the FTA\u2019s impact on air pollution is expected to be caused by output changes in the agricultural, transport and machinery, electronic equipment and other manufacture sector. The composition effect shows that the FTA is expected to create 0.13 kton additional NO \u2093 emissions in New Zealand in the conservative scenario, but also expected to lower NO \u2093 emissions by 0.08 kton in the ambitious scenario. This is mainly driven by the fact that output increases in the meat and dairy sector in the conservative scenario, but decreases in the ambitious scenario and because output in the machinery, electronic equipment and other manufacture sector decreases much sharper in the ambitious scenario than in the conservative scenario. SO\u2082 emissions are expected to decrease by 0.01 kton to 0.24 kton, PM\u2082.\u2085 emissions by less than 0.01 kton to 0.04 kton and PM\u2081\u2080 by less than 0.01 kton to 0.07 kton. In the EU, the composition effect shows that the FTA creates 0.16 to 0.36 kton additional NO \u2093 emissions, 0.13 to 0.88 kton additional SO\u2082 emissions, 0.01 to 0.02 kton additional PM\u2082.\u2085 emissions and a reduction in PM\u2081\u2080 emissions between 0.02 and 0.20 kton. 132 The definitions of the scale, composition and technique effects are discussed in the previous section NZL EU NZL EU NZL EU NZL EU Road transportation 29% 37% 2% 0% 19% 18% 6% 6% Manufacturing Industries and construction 24% 12% 35% 12% 31% 19% 21% 13% Public electricity and heat production 12% 26% 10% 60% 1% 8% 1% 7% Manure in pasture/range/paddock 9% 0% 0% 0% 1% 0% 0% 0% Direct soil emissions 7% 4% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Inland navigation 7% 5% 13% 5% 9% 7% 3% 2% Residential and other sectors 3% 8% 19% 11% 15% 19% 21% 36% Agricultural waste burning 2% 1% 1% 0% 0% 0% 30% 11% Production of pulp/paper/food/drink 1% 0% 13% 4% 11% 3% 9% 6% Other Energy Industries 1% 2% 1% 5% 0% 3% 0% 1% Production of metals 0% 0% 5% 0% 5% 3% 3% 2% Manure management 0% 1% 0% 0% 2% 6% 3% 9% Other 5% 3% 1% 2% 5% 11% 2% 7% PM10 Sector SO\u2082 NO \u2093 PM2.5 ",

The total effect of the FTA on the emissions of air pollutants is shown in Figure 3.8. In the EU, the effect of the FTA is expected to be negligible. In New Zealand, the expected effect of the FTA is very marginal. The emissions of all considered air pollutants are expected to decrease in both scenarios, except NO \u2093 emissions in the conservative scenario (which increase). The decrease in the emissions of air pollutants in New Zealand is driven by the composition effect. As the FTA is expected to result in output decreases in sectors that emit many air pollutants and output increases in sectors which do not emit many air pollutants, the overall effect is a marginal decrease in air pollution in New Zealand. 133 * Wood, paper, food beverages and tobacco products ** Machinery, electronic equipment and other manufacture. -0.9 -0.4 0.1 0.6 Composition effect Agriculture - meat, dairy Services Transport Utility Electricity Machinery* Non-metalic minerals Metal products Petroleum, coal products Chemicals, rubber, plastic Oil and gas Coal mining Wood, food** Agriculture - horticulture Agriculture - rice Kton NOx, SO2 emissions SO\u2082 Ambitious FTA SO\u2082 Conservative FTA NO \u2093 Ambitious FTA NO \u2093 Conservative FTA -0.15 -0.05 0.05 0.15Composition effect Agriculture - meat, dairy Services Transport Utility Electricity Machinery* Non-metalic minerals Metal products Petroleum, coal products Chemicals, rubber, plastic Oil and gas Coal mining Wood, food** Agriculture - horticulture Agriculture - rice Kton PM10, PM2.5 emissions PM10 Ambitious FTA PM10 Conservative FTA PM2.5 Ambitious FTA PM2.5 Conservative FTA -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 Composition effect Agriculture - meat, dairy Services Transport Utility Electricity Machinery* Non-metalic minerals Metal products Petroleum, coal products Chemicals, rubber, plastic Oil and gas Coal mining Wood, food** Agriculture - horticulture Agriculture - rice Kton NOx, SO2 emissions SO\u2082 Ambitious FTA SO\u2082 Conservative FTA NO \u2093 Ambitious FTA NO \u2093 Conservative FTA -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 Composition effect Agriculture - meat, dairy Services Transport Utility Electricity Machinery* Non-metalic minerals Metal products Petroleum, coal products Chemicals, rubber,\u2026 Oil and gas Coal mining Wood, food** Agriculture - horticulture Agriculture - rice Kton PM10, PM2.5 emissions PM10 Ambitious FTA PM10 Moderate FTA PM2.5 Ambitious FTA PM2.5 Moderate FTA ",

Ecosystems & biodiversity State of play \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s ecosystems and biodiversity were identified as a significant environmental impact area given the country\u2019s high levels of endemism 134 and the vulnerability of New Zealand\u2019s ecosystems to human-induced pressures. The FTA could potentially create an impact on biodiversity through two main pathways: 1) the potential increase in invasive species introductions as a result of rising import volumes and 2) possible impacts on native species and ecosystems via increases in agricultural production (and the resulting land use change). For this reason, a case study was conducted on the impact of the FTA on ecosystems and biodiversity in New Zealand Case study 3.3: Ecosystems and biodiversity and impact of EU-NZ FTA Current situation New Zealand has one of the largest protected area coverage in the world, with a third of the country\u2019s terrestrial area under legal protection and management for conservation purposes. The country also has a network of 34 marine protected areas, covering about 7 percent of New Zealand\u2019s territorial sea (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2012). Despite this, indigenous land cover continues to decline and the condition of some ecosystems is deteriorating, constituting an ongoing threat to native biodiversity (Ministry of the Environment, 2018). For example, between 2001 and 2016, 214 wetlands (nearly 1,250 hectares) were lost, while a further 746 wetlands declined in size (ibid.). Almost two-thirds (45) of New Zealand\u2019s 71 identified rare and naturally uncommon ecosystems are classified as \u2018threatened\u2019, of which 18 are \u2018critically endangered\u2019 (ibid.). More than three-quarters of New Zealand\u2019s rivers were in excellent or good ecological status in 2013-2017, as measured by the Macroinvertebrate Community Index (MCI). However, the indicator correlates with land use in the area; median MCI scores are 31 percent lower in urban areas and 15 percent lower in areas with pastoral farming, compared to areas with native land cover (Ministry for the Environment & Stats NZ, 2019). Based on the submerged plant index (SPI), 33 percent of monitored lakes were in excellent or high ecological condition between 2007 and 2016, while 31 percent were in moderate and 36 percent in poor ecological condition (ibid.). Of the species with assessed conservation status, almost 83 percent of native terrestrial vertebrates (birds, bats, reptiles and frogs) and 37 percent of plants are either \u2018threatened\u2019 or \u2018at risk of extinction\u2019 (Ministry of the Environment, 2018). In aquatic ecosystems, 76 percent of native freshwater fish, over 25 percent of native freshwater invertebrates, and nearly 33 percent of plant species that depend on fresh water are classified as threatened or at risk of extinction (Ministry for the Environment & Stats NZ, 2019). For native marine species, 90 percent of seabirds, 80 percent of shorebirds, and 26 percent of marine mammals are threatened or at risk of extinction (ibid.). The main pressures contributing to the decline of biodiversity in New Zealand are: competition by invasive alien species; predation and herbivory by introduced species; habitat modification (e.g. from land use change, fragmentation); and human activity (such as agriculture, fishing, pollution, 134 Species that can only be found in that country 0.12% -0.10% -0.03% -0.71% -0.03% -0.62% -0.03% -0.47% 0.00%0.01% 0.00%0.02% 0.00%0.00%0.00% -0.01% -1.2% -0.9% -0.6% -0.3% 0.0% 0.3% 0.6% C o n s .

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 94 | P a g e certain recreational activities) (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2014). Some of these pressures may be exacerbated through trade, as discussed in the following sections. EU-NZ impact on Ecosystems and Biodiversity The first potential impact pathway is through invasive alien species . These are plants, animals, pathogens and other organisms that are not native to an ecosystem, and which may cause economic or environmental harm or negatively affect human health (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2009). In particular, they negatively impact native species through competition, predation, or transmission of pathogens and disrupt local ecosystems and ecosystem functions (ibid.). In general, trade is a key pathway for the introduction of invasive alien species. In some cases, non-native species are themselves the object of trade (e.g. seeds), while in others they are unintentionally introduced (if undetected through biosecurity procedures), for example, on other imported commodities (e.g. insects on fresh fruit), packaging, ballast water, cargo and airfreight (Hulme, 2009). As such, almost any imported goods carry some risk of introducing non-native species; the risk depends on the type of commodity, its origin, and the effectiveness of biosecurity checks. In general, once introduced, only a small proportion of non-native species become established and subsequently invasive (i.e. causing damage to native biodiversity and the economy) (Lockwood et al., 2007), but this risk is higher in New Zealand compared to other countries given that native biodiversity developed in isolation for most of the country\u2019s history. Since invasive species pose a significant threat to New Zealand\u2019s unique habitats and important primary goods sectors, New Zealand places a strong focus on managing biosecurity risks before and at the border. Based on the economic modelling results, the overall volume of merchandise imports into New Zealand (from all regions, not only the EU) is expected to increase by about 2 percent in the ambitious scenario. This would increase the burden on New Zealand\u2019s biosecurity system, as more imports will have to undergo risk assessment and biosecurity screening. However, given New Zealand\u2019s stringent and precautionary biosecurity regime, often cited as particularly progressive compared to other countries (Simberloff, 2013), it is unlikely that this increase in the overall volume of imports will significantly increase the probability of invasive species introductions. In terms of imports from the EU, it is estimated that there will be an increase in imports of products of animal and plant origin. Such products can harbour unwanted organisms and pathogens. They are subject to import health standards, it would be important to see how to minimise any potential negative impacts, while still aiming for higher imports of animal and plant origin. At the same time, a recent study shows that the rates of exotic species interceptions by biosecurity inspectors in New Zealand are lower for imports originating from countries with high regulatory quality and political stability (Brenton-Rule et al., 2016). This suggests that imports from the EU may be safer, in terms of invasive species risk, than those from other countries with lower regulatory quality. Moreover, New Zealand is in the process of further strengthening its biosecurity system through the implementation of the \u2018Biosecurity 2025\u2019 programme, which should further alleviate the biosecurity risks associated with increased trade. Strengthening global biosecurity is one of four critical focus areas of the plan that receives particular attention in the coming five years. The second impact pathway is the change in the agricultural sector . Based on the economic modelling undertaken for this study, it is estimated that an ambitious trade deal between New Zealand and the EU would increase the output of the beef and sheep meat sector by more than 4 percent, of the dairy sector by 0.5 percent, and of the vegetable and fruit sector by 2.2 percent. Even though output in other agricultural sectors is expected to decrease, the overall output in the agricultural sector is expected to grow by around 1.5 percent in the ambitious scenario. Agriculture affects biodiversity through two main pathways: land use change, whereby natural habitats are converted to farmland, and pollution of aquatic ecosystems through agricultural run- off, which carries nitrogen, phosphorus, pathogens and sediments into water bodies (Ministry for the Environment & Stats NZ, 2019). Regarding land use, the quantitative analysis carried out in the impact assessment (European Commission, 2017) concluded that New Zealand would experience an increase in land use intensity, of 0.99 percent. As regards water pollution, the largest impacts from agriculture are associated with dairy farming (Ministry for the Environment & Stats NZ, 2019), yet this sector will experience only a relatively minor increase as a result of the FTA. Livestock farming for meat also contributes to water pollution, and the increase in output predicted by the model could translate into significant effects on aquatic ecosystems, if the increase corresponds to intensive farming and failure to shift towards farming practices that reduce pollution risk. In this respect, Beef + Lamb NZ and the NZ Meat Industry Association have provided ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 95 | P a g e information in the consultations undertaken for this study that such developments are unlikely. Beyond the FTA, domestic policy developments may improve the sustainability of farming in the future, potentially alleviating the negative impacts of increased agricultural output due to the FTA. For example, the Ministry of Environment is working with farmers to introduce more sustainable resource management practices. Moreover, according to an environmental organisation interviewed for this study, a new national policy statement under the Resource Management Act is being developed which will introduce requirements for a more sustainable use of land and other resources. The interviewee also noted that the FTA may increase demand for high-quality, environmentally sustainable products valued by EU consumers, and thus provide an incentive for New Zealand producers to improve their environmental performance rather than focusing on increasing production volumes. This, according to a submission provided by Beef + Lamb NZ and the NZ Meat Industry Association, has been the policy in these sectors for quite some time, including in response to declining land available for agricultural activities and the corresponding decrease in herds. Yet holding everything else equal, the FTA is still expected to put an increasing pressure on New Zealand\u2019s biodiversity. Through enhanced cooperation on sustainable development , the FTA could also generate positive impacts on biodiversity. The measures announced in the draft TSD chapter could help ensure that the negative impacts of trade on biodiversity are minimised and positive impacts are fostered through enhanced cooperation. For example, it commits the two Parties to \u201cwork together to strengthen their cooperation on trade-related aspects of biodiversity policies and measures bilaterally, regionally and in international fora\u201d, for example, in relation to: \u201cinitiatives and good practices concerning trade in natural resource-based products with the aim of conserving biological diversity\u201d, \u201ctrade and the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, the valuation of ecosystems and their services and related economic instruments\u201d, \u201ctackling illegal wildlife trade\u201d, and implementing the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and the sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation. The chapter however does not prescribe legally binding actions and thus the material impact of its provisions is uncertain. A recommendation to the negotiators is therefore to further specify the cooperation foreseen in the context of the ambitious Biosecurity 2025 programme (in particular the Strengthening Global Biosecurity work programme) and explore in which way the EU can cooperate in providing information or facilitating preventive biosecurity measures before goods are shipped from the EU to New Zealand. 3.6.5. Water Quality and Quantity State of Play - In New Zealand, a main threat to water quality is nitrogen leaching from agriculture (particularly livestock waste and fertiliser). The latest report on the state of New Zealand\u2019s freshwater resources \u2013 Our fresh water 2017 \u2013 shows that nitrate-nitrogen levels worsened at 55 percent of monitored river sites and improved at 28 percent of sites between 1994 and 2013 (Ministry of Environment, 2017). Nitrogen leaching from agricultural soils was estimated to have increased by 29 percent from 1990 to 2012. Phosphorus levels were found to have improved at 42 percent of monitored river sites and worsened at 25 percent of sites between 1994 and 2013. Lake water quality varies: 37 percent of the 65 monitoring sites between 2009 and 2013 had \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018very good\u2019 Trophic Level Index scores (a measure of lake health), while 26 percent had moderate scores, the rest being \u2018poor\u2019 or \u2018very poor\u2019 (ibid). With regard to groundwater quality, nitrate contamination is the primary concern. Over 60 percent of sites reviewed between 2004- 2013 exceeded nationally set water quality guidelines. Such elevated levels are primarily due to intensive agricultural practices (OECD, 2017d). As regards water quantity, New Zealand has relatively high fresh water per capita, but the supply is not uniform throughout the country. Climate change is predicted to affect rainfall patterns in New Zealand, which may increase pressures on freshwater quantity and flows in some parts of the country (Ministry of Environment, 2017). The main users of water resources are irrigation and hydroelectricity generation (ibid). EU-NZ FTA impact on Water Quality and Quantity Good quality water is best assessed from a perspective of the chemical quality of the water as well as the ecological status of the water - the ecological functions it delivers to aquatic ecosystems and the terrestrial ecosystems that directly depend on it (EU water framework Directive, 2000). A water\u2019s ecological status depends on its chemical composition as well as on its hydromorphological characteristics. Pressures from the FTA on the hydro ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 96 | P a g e morphology of waters (i.e. physical changes in water courses, construction of dams etc.) in the EU and New Zealand are unlikely given the outcomes of the economic modelling results (no significant expansions of hydropower expected for example or very significant changes to inland waterway transport that would put pressure on altering water courses). The largest source of potential impact of the FTA is through the impact of changes in economic activity in certain sectors that already create an impact on water quality through their production process and/or water quantity through releases of pollutants into water bodies. Thus, changes in the volume of output in those sectors due to the FTA can indirectly affect chemical status and thus also ecological status of freshwater bodies. Water quality has recently been polled in New Zealand as number one concern among citizens (January 2019), with 82 percent of respondents saying they were \u201cextremely concerned or very concerned about pollution of New Zealand\u2019s rivers and lakes\u201d, above issues such as living costs and the health system (Piddock, 2019). Pollution sources affecting water quality can stem from point sources (one concentrated output of pollutants, such as a wastewater treatment plant) or diffuse sources (small amounts of pollutant emissions dispersed across large areas, such as from fertilizer use in agriculture) or atmospheric deposition of substances such as mercury. The latest state of the environment report from New Zealand (April 2019) reports that average levels of nitrogen in waterways on pastoral land cover were almost 10 times higher, phosphorus levels more than 3 times higher and e.coli almost 15 times higher than pristine waters. 86 percent and 90 percent of waterways on pastoral land did not meet the required nitrogen and phosphorus levels respectively. Pastoral land concerns land on which diary, beef and sheep are farmed (Ministry for the Environment, 2019). The FTA is predicted to lead to an increase in economic activity in particularly those sectors in New Zealand, especially the beef and sheep meat sector (+4.1 percent output in the ambitious scenario). This additional increase exacerbates a trend that has been ongoing in New Zealand that cattle numbers have increased in the sector compared with sheep and an intensification of farming in New Zealand (Davies-Colley, 2013). Cows produce more urine with a higher nitrogen concentration than sheep and also due to the intensification of beef farming, soil compaction increases because of the livestock trampling, which in turn increases the run-off of the pollutants into streams. This increased run-off is seen often as major driver of reduced stream water quality (ibid.). Moreover, cattle are believed to be very damaging to soils, especially on steep slopes and riparian soils, and beef more so than sheep. Cattle\u2019s attraction to water also results in particular damage to streambanks and riparian areas, increasing the likelihood of sediment runoff into waterbodies. Additional sediments in waters increase cloudiness and affect the habitat and food supply of much aquatic life as well as the growth of plants, affecting biodiversity severely, but also the recreational value. Models have found that 44 percent of the soil that enters New Zealand rivers come from pastures (Ministry for the Environment, 2019). The potential aggravated impact from pasture farming on water quality is of particular concern for this FTA as the new New Zealand government has since taken power not taking many new actions to tackle the issue (WPR, 2018). The Land and Water Forum has also established that the implementation of the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management across New Zealand\u2019s regions is \u201cslow, variable and uncoordinated\u201d. The projected output increase in the vegetables and fruits sector in New Zealand (+2.2 percent) creates less impact both in scale (it is a smaller economic sector and occupying much less land space \u2013 see Figure 3.9) as well as environmentally per unit. Still, the use of farm chemicals to stimulate the growth of plants (fertilizers and pesticides) also leads to pollution and contamination of soil and water in the same way that it does via pasture farming. The FTA is likely to also exacerbate the impact on water abstraction ( water quantity ) in New Zealand through the predicted growth in the above two sectors, but due to the large amounts of freshwater and annual rainfall in New Zealand, the impact is expected to be ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 97 | P a g e less impactful than the impact on water quality. Irrigation is however the largest source of water abstraction. Just like Australia, though, New Zealand also has strict policies (limits and restrictions) on the amount of water abstraction managed by regional councils that provide individual consents to take water. The NZ government is currently considering additional regulation in the field of ecological flows and water levels (Ministry for the Environment, 2008). Those proposals go beyond the status quo by proposing interim limits on water levels where such limits have not been imposed yet by regional authorities. They also include proposals regarding the evaluation of the ecological component of water levels. The minor additional pressure on water levels through the FTA could thus be mitigated by intentions to adopt such proposals. Figure 3.9: Agricultural and horticultural land uses New Zealand, 2002-2016 Source: Stats NZ Tatauranga Aotearoa 3.6.6. Land Use & Soil Quality State of play - Indigenous land cover in New Zealand has been decreasing between 1996 and 2012 due to land clearance, conversion and development. This has accelerated land erosion, with losses now standing at 192 million tonnes lost per year. Even though land used for agricultural purposes decreased by 10 percent, a 10 percent increase in urban land use has led to the loss of some of the most fertile lands in the country. Pressures on soil quality have increased due to a heavy increase (42 percent) of land used for dairy farming, especially concerning phosphorus levels (51 percent of sites outside target range) and macro porosity (65 percent of sites outside the target range) (Ministry of Environment, 2018b). New Zealand soil is mainly under pressure due to intensification (irrigation & fertilisation), land use change, and legacy effects (past deforestation & climate change). However, surveys conducted by Stats NZ between 2014 and 2017 found that 83 percent or more of total assessed sites (all uses 135 ) were within target range for five of seven soil quality indicators. For the two remaining indicators, more than 48 percent of assessed sites (all uses) were outside target ranges. Individual performance of soil quality indicators in New Zealand is visualised in Figure 3.10. EU-NZ FTA impact on Land Use and Soil Quality Land use and soil quality are generally mostly impacted by agricultural practices. As explained above, this is also the case in New Zealand. We focus on the two main impact channels through which agricultural activities can affect soil quality. The first channel, grazing, can negatively affect soil quality as it can damage vegetation which in turn can lead to soil erosion. The second channel is fertilizer use. Intensive fertilizer use and manure production can harm fertile soils as it increases the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Increased concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus can be caused by both horticulture (fertilizer use) and by cattle farming (manure production). Even though soil quality as such may not be the most tangible environmental impact area, soil quality (and land use) indirectly affects many environmental impact areas. Soil quality degradation can indirectly harm water quality (as explained in the previous section), biodiversity and \u2013 135 Land uses included in this assessment are: forestry, cropping & horticulture, dairy, dry stock.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 98 | P a g e ultimately - human health since approximately 78 percent of the global average per capita calorie consumption comes from crops directly grown in soil (Brevik & Burgess, 2014). Figure 3.10: Proportion of sites within target range for soil quality indicators Source: Stats New Zealand Since the FTA is expected to increase output in the agricultural sector (in particular the beef and sheep meat sector +4.1 percent and the fruits and vegetables sector +2.2 percent in the ambitious scenario), the potential impacts on land use and soil quality could be significant. The effect through the first impact channel is expected to be minor; in contrast to other countries (e.g. Australia), cattle cover relatively small areas of land for grazing and the vegetation recovers relatively quickly as a result of the favourable weather conditions and fertile soils. For the same reason, the impact of the FTA on land use is also expected to be limited. The potential negative effect through the second impact channel is, however, likely to be more pressing in New Zealand. As shown in Figure 3.10 (above), excessive phosphorus concentrations are currently the most widespread pressure for soil quality in New Zealand. Activities in the beef and sheep meat sector (through manure) as well as in the fruits and vegetable sector (through fertilizer use) contribute significantly to high phosphorus concentrations in soils. The expected increase in production in the beef and sheep meat and vegetables and fruits sectors are expected to further increase phosphorus concentrations and as such harm soil quality. The expected degradation in soil quality can on its turn negatively affect water quality and biodiversity. 3.6.7. Waste & Waste Management State of play - Statistics on waste management and recycling rates in New Zealand are not widely available. This is, to a certain extent, explained by the fact waste management is decentralised. International organisations are critical about New Zealand\u2019s performance. According to the World Bank, for instance, New Zealand is the most wasteful nation in the developed world (Perrot & Subiantoro, 2018). In 2007, it was estimated that around 8.7 million tonnes of solid waste (from domestic, commercial, industrial, and institutional waste sources) was generated in New Zealand in 2006, of which 2.4 million tonnes was subsequently diverted from disposal to landfills. This means that approximately 6.3 million tonnes of waste was sent to landfill and cleanfill sites each year. When averaged across the total population, that represented 1,572 kg of solid waste per person per year for New Zealand (Ministry of Environment, 2017). EU-NZ FTA impact on Waste and Waste Management The expected increase in production as a result of the FTA will most likely lead to a rise in waste generation in both New Zealand and the EU. In New Zealand, the agricultural sector is expected to gain most from the FTA. The potential environmental impacts in the dairy and ruminant meat industry are therefore explored in the sector studies (see Chapter 4). The proposed TSD chapter does not include specific measures which are expected to affect the waste or waste management industry. Based on this, we do not foresee major impacts of the FTA on the waste or waste management industry other than in the sectors which will be analysed in the sector studies. In the EU, waste from mining and quarrying activities as well as waste from construction activities account for 64 percent of the total waste generation in the EU (European 98% 98% 95% 93% 83% 52% 49% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Mineralisable nitrogen Soil pH Total carbon Bulk density Total nitrogen Macro porosity Phosphorus ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 99 | P a g e Parliament, 2014). These sectors are not expected to be significantly affected by the FTA. For this reason and based on additional impact screening, potential impacts on waste and waste management in the EU are not prioritised in this report. Despite this, it should be noted that the small overall increase in production (as a result of the FTA) will most likely lead to an increase in the volume of waste. 3.6.8. Policy recommendations and flanking measures Based on the overall environmental analysis, we conclude that an ambitious FTA is expected to result in some small negative impacts on the environment globally as well as locally in New Zealand. Considering the scope of the environmental impacts and the potential effect of the FTA, we recommend negotiators to: \uf0b7 Explore ways to stimulate further climate action in the context of the FTA in order to \u2018offset\u2019 the slightly negative impact of the FTA by increased ambition \u2013 a provision in the TSD chapter could cover this. In terms of global effects, an ambitious FTA (full trade liberalisation) is expected to have a slightly negative impact on climate change, particularly from the foreseen trade liberalisation in the agricultural sector (i.e. CH\u2084 emissions from enteric fermentation and CO\u2082 emissions from land clearing). This effect is predominately driven by the expected increased output in the beef and sheep meat sector (although this is likely to be overestimated somewhat by the CGE simulations), mitigated to some extent as New Zealand is proceeding by putting emission reducing measures in place. Production in this sector creates significant amounts methane (CH 4 ) and, to a lesser extent, nitrous-dioxide (N 2 O) emissions (see section 4.1 for details). There is also a small increase expected in CO 2 emissions as a result of the FTA, in part due to the transportation needed for the increased trade flows between the two partners. In addition, both parties are signatories of the Paris Agreement and have committed to keep global warming well below 2 \u00b0C by the end of the century. However, New Zealand\u2019s GHG emission reduction target of -30 percent compared with 2005 levels is assessed to be insufficient to keep global warming below 2 \u00b0C. Also, the EU\u2019s targets of -40 percent of emissions compared with 1990 are likely insufficient for Paris. The FTA is expected to slow down progress towards these goals. \uf0b7 Find ways to alleviate the impacts of increased agricultural production on biodiversity. For instance, options to minimise land clearing could be explored in the light of the FTA. The FTA could exacerbate the pressures on biodiversity in New Zealand through the expected land clearing as a result of the predicted expansion of the agricultural sector (i.e. mostly the beef and sheep meat sector), in case of full trade liberalisation. A detailed case study on the issue as part of this SIA confirmed these potential threats for biodiversity. \uf0b7 Find ways to exchange information on effective policy making in the field of water quality between the EU and New Zealand in the context of the FTA. The EU\u2019s regulation in the field of water (Water Framework Directive) is viewed as comprehensive and ambitious, but also suffers from difficulties in implementation. Both are encouraged to share best practices and in the area of implementation and regulatory measures to stimulate strengthening of water policy in both regions to accommodate the additional pressure from the FTA in this area. \uf0b7 Explore possibilities to stimulate the implementation of New Zealand\u2019s Biosecurity Strategy in the context of the FTA.

SECTOR ANALYSES As part of the Trade SIA approach, we have selected five sectors for detailed analysis: ruminant meat, dairy, machinery, motor vehicles and transport equipment, and communication services. The selection procedure can be found in Annex V.1. For each of the selected sectors, we look at the current situation, and then the economic, social, human rights and environmental effects as well as an investigation into the impact for SMEs, third countries, and how competitiveness of the sector is affected. We conclude each sector analysis with short policy recommendations and flanking measures. 4.1. Ruminant meat sector 4.1.1. Current situation Economic aspects The relative importance of ruminant meat trade for New Zealand and for the EU is high but varies across the partners. In short: especially sheep meat trade matters much more to New Zealand than to the EU. In 2018, beef, sheep and goat meat products were New Zealand\u2019s second biggest export commodity group by weight and by value, as well as its biggest non-dairy export to the world (FAOSTAT). New Zealand exports more than 80 percent of its beef and over 90 percent of its sheep meat production. In 2018, red meat and associated co-products (including skins and hides and offal, but not counting wool) 136 went to the EU for over \u20ac 1 billion (43 percent of the industry\u2019s total exports). According to Beef & Lamb New Zealand, the EU28 currently takes nearly 50 percent of New Zealand\u2019s total global sheep meat exports, worth almost NZ$ 1.3 billion. 137 In contrast, only 5 percent of New Zealand\u2019s beef and 3 percent of its dairy exports go to the EU. By far the largest part of total EU imports from New Zealand ( \u20ac 2.4 billion in 2018) was comprised of ruminant meat (43 percent). However, according to Eurostat, in the year 2017 the EU was 85 percent self-sufficient in ruminant meat (and exported 7 percent of its production). Yet, as much as 94 percent of its imports came from New Zealand and Australia. For beef and veal, the EU had a self-sufficiency rate close to 102 percent, with a bovine herd of around 88 million heads and a total yearly production of about 7.8 million tonnes of beef. As for sheep meat and goat meat, with around 100 million heads (85 percent sheep and 14 percent goats) and a total annual production of about 1 million tonnes carcass weight, the EU is not self-sufficient for this sub-sector. This said, sheep and goats are often kept in economically vulnerable areas like mountain regions. The EU imports account for 20 percent of domestic consumption. About 80 percent of EU imports of sheep meat originate in New Zealand, followed by Australia and Mercosur countries. 138 Today, New Zealand is the world\u2019s 2 nd most important exporter of sheep meat and the 5 th most important one for beef. According to UN Comtrade data, the EU has consistently shown a deficit in its trade of ruminant meat with New Zealand over 2010-2018. The EU\u2019s bilateral exports of ruminant meat to New Zealand more than halved from \u20ac 5.6 mln in 2010 to \u20ac 2.4 mln in 2018 while its imports of ruminant meat from New Zealand remained stable from a value of \u20ac 1.0 bn in 2010 to \u20ac 1.05 bln in 2017 (see Figure 4.1). The share of the sector in the EU\u2019s total bilateral trade with New Zealand has been high: around 30 percent, primarily due to its imports. The share of bilateral trade in ruminant meat in the EU\u2019s total trade with the world is also high at around 7 percent, again primarily on the import side. During the last 10 years, about half of all New Zealand\u2019s ruminant meat exports to the EU28 went to the UK. 136 https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sites/agriculture/files/trade-analysis/statistics/outside-eu/countries/ agrifood-new-zealand_en.pdf 137 https://beeflambnz.com/your-levies-at-work/trade-policy-and-advocacy (last consulted on 22-5-2019). 138 European Commission, https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sheep-goats_en (last consulted on 22-5-2019).

Then we look at Non-Tariff Measures and SPS/TBT Agreements for effective market access. Tariffs and Tariff-Rate Quotas In respect of tariffs , EU market access for ruminant meat is characterised by two elements: relatively high tariffs and TRQs offering low tariff market access, but for limited quantities only. Moreover, access to such TRQs may be reserved to one country or \u201cshared\u201d between suppliers from different countries, within an FTA or otherwise agreed. In 2017, the average applied tariff on ruminant meat in the EU for imports from New Zealand was 39.3 percent, compared to 24.5 percent for imports from the rest of the world. In contrast, New Zealand has an applied tariff rate of only 0.3 percent on ruminant meat imports from the EU. According to the joint submission to MFAT by Beef & Lamb New Zealand and the Meat Industry Association (as of December 2015), New Zealand enjoys \u201c comparatively favourable conditions of access to the EU market \u201d for sheep meat, thanks mainly to a zero- duty country-specific quota (TRQ) of 228,254 tonnes carcass weight equivalent (c.w.e.) of sheep meat (and goat meat). For beef, according to the WTO tariff data base, EU TRQs for which New Zealand is eligible are open to all other WTO Members, namely a frozen beef quota of 53,000 tonnes with an in-quota tariff rate of 20 percent, and a processing beef quota of 63,703 tons with an in-quota rate of between 20 percent and 20 percent plus \u20ac 994.5/ton \u2013 \u20ac 2,138.4/ton, depending on the product. These quotas \u201ctend to be dominated by lower cost suppliers (for example from South America)\u201d. Another quota for hormone free and \u201cgrain-fed high-quality beef\u201d (HQB), established as a \u201ccollateral\u201d result of the WTO dispute on beef hormones, is also accessible to the US, Canada, Australia, Uruguay and Argentina. Within this HQB quota, New Zealand can supply a country-specific quota of 1,300 tonnes p.w. New Zealand (and Australia) supply 94 percent of the EU\u2019s sheep meat and goat meat imports, mostly through their preferential TRQs. However, they face relatively high, sometimes even prohibitive, tariffs for out-of-quota supplies. Total tariff costs for New Zealand\u2019s red meat and co-product exports were estimated by Beef + Lamb New Zealand (B&L NZ) and the Meat Industry Association (MIA) at NZ$69 million ( \u20ac 62.2 million) in 2014, allegedly making the EU \u201cthe second-best protected beef market after Japan\u201d.

Non-Tariff Measures A number of Non-Tariff Measures also apply to ruminant meat trade, affecting bilateral EU \u2013 New Zealand trade in both directions. In 2015, the EU and New Zealand updated the EU\u2013NZ Veterinary Agreement , which had been in place since 1996. Upon the adoption of a series of technical amendments on November 10, 2015, the European Commission said it should give a significant boost to bilateral trade in meat and dairy products. New Zealand called it an example of \u201c world- leading practice for trade in agricultural and food products \u201d (New Zealand Food Safety, 2004). The full benefits of this agreement became effective as of 2015, after national regulations implemented the above-mentioned treaty modifications. According to the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA), it was expected to save potential costs of up to NZD200 million ( \u20ac 180.2 million). The NZFSA also noted that this was one of the first agreements effectively applying the (WTO-enshrined) regionalisation principle by re- accepting EU meat products from specific EU Member States or regions . Respondents to the EU Commission Public Consultation confirmed that this agreement has led to specific results such as the rapidity of consignment clearance at port of entry and resultant cost reduction from fewer inspections, the ability to resolve minor issues in paperwork through improved communication and cooperation, increased EU pork sales to New Zealand, increased import of lamb from New Zealand, less complicated veterinary certification and the recognition of equivalence of sanitary measures between the two sides. New Zealand has trade-limiting measures in place, such as virtual trade prohibitions by way of SPS measures or technical standards and regulations. In their 2016 submission to the FTA negotiators, B&L NZ and MIA suggested \u201cgreater recognition of the equivalence of the New Zealand systems in meeting EU standards, particularly in relation to processing requirements, animal welfare and good manufacturing practices\u201d ( op.cit.supra ) B&L NZ also points out that they cooperate with European producers under the \u201cMeat Matters\u201d programme, whereby jointly-funded promotional activities include a website containing information on the nutritional value of meat consumption, the environmental impact of meat production and a range of recipes using meat. However, it would appear that the FTA negotiation might also benefit from the above-mentioned new trade agreements already concluded with other countries and regions, mainly for approval, tracing and monitoring procedures. New Zealand\u2019s animal welfare standards are very high. EU-New Zealand cooperation on animal welfare standards is recommended, especially regarding anti-microbial resistance, where a dialogue and sharing of best practices would be beneficial for both parties, strengthening the two parties\u2019 global leadership on animal welfare. Sanitary regulations and technical standards and requirements governing the animal sectors in New Zealand differ from the European requirements. The use of growth hormones and chemical decontamination of carcasses is allowed, but not for products bound for the EU. In addition, rules on individual traceability and journey duration for the transport of livestock are less strict than in Europe: while ovine animals are practically exempt from traceability regulations, those for bovines are limited to the first six months, and to the first movement of the cattle.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 104 | P a g e Box 4.1 Summary of EU-NZ market access conditions as per ABCIS (2018) 140 Together with Australia, New Zealand continuously negotiates trade agreements to develop and secure its meat and dairy exports. In 2018, New Zealand was party to 16 FTAs, and to two large RTAs not yet in force (namely the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the NZ-Gulf Cooperation Council FTA ). Besides the ongoing negotiation with the EU, and enlargement negotiations under the ASEAN and China FTAs, it was also engaged in negotiations for 4 new FTAs with 7 countries. Favourable weather and land conditions give New Zealand\u2019s ruminant farms the possibility to rely heavily on grazing and thus to have a high structural cost competitiveness compared to the French systems, allowing significantly lower producer prices. In return, it is more dependent on weather conditions (seasonality and climatic events). Production costs estimates for ruminant meat show New Zealand at 20-25% for beef production costs in France, and up to 50% for sheep meat \u2013 with marked seasonal and pedoclimatic variations especially for grass-fed cattle (e.g. a historic drought in 2008). New Zealand prohibits ritual slaughtering. Except for sheep meat, the main constraints for shipments of ruminant products from New Zealand to the EU are sometimes prohibitive tariffs, and quotas limited in volume or with dissuasive in- quota tariffs and management rules. New Zealand has significantly expanded its ruminant products shipments to Asia in the last 10 years: while China will remain its main customer, it aims to secure other markets with a significant benefit potential. In the sheep meat sector, even though it no longer fills its generous duty free quota (76% in 2016), New Zealand remains by far the main supplier of the EU, its most important outlet for the highest-value cuts (rather than carcasses). In the beef sector, the EU is a very secondary but increasingly profitable market for New Zealand\u2019s high-value cuts (subject to a very restrictive quota). Source: ABCIS (2018) Investment barriers The New Zealand meat industry has attracted international investment, primarily from China and Japan. New foreign firms continue to invest in the New Zealand meat industry: acquisitions worth over \u20ac 270.4 million occurred between June 2015 and June 2017 whereby overseas firms are looking to secure New Zealand beef and lamb to strengthen their global agri-food positions \u2013 as is shown in Figure 4.2. 141 Figure 4.2: Foreign investments in the New Zealand meat industry (2015-2017) Source: MBIE Government New Zealand (2019) 140 ABCIS (2018), Risques et opportunit\u00e9s pour les fili\u00e8res animales fran\u00e7aises et europ\u00e9ennes dans la perspective d\u2019accords de libre-\u00e9change UE/Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande et UE/Australie.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 105 | P a g e The main investment barrier EU investors face in New Zealand, also in the ruminant meat sector, is a stricter investment screening threshold compared to investors from other countries that have already concluded FTAs with New Zealand. The Overseas Investment Act regulates investments by foreign natural and legal persons that want to invest in New Zealand with more than 25 percent foreign owned investments. For ruminant meat production non-urban land is needed. Regarding the screening of non-urban land, the following factors are of high relative importance to investments in large farmland (e.g. a dairy farm of 1,987.5 hectares or sheep and beef farm of 7,146 hectares): 142 job creation, increased exports, introduction of new technologies or business skills, increased processing of primary products, and oversight and participation by New Zealanders in the investment. The stated rationale behind the new directive is to ensure that benefits realised for New Zealanders from the sale of farmland are genuinely substantial and identifiable. It is clear the Government now considers that the benefit to New Zealand can only be genuinely substantial and identifiable where the economic criteria in the Act are met. Farmland applications which focus solely on environmental and conservation gains, increased public access and other consequential benefits will now not meet the standard for consent under the new directive. Non-urban properties over five hectares, which have previously been purchased by overseas persons through satisfying the non-economic benefit criteria in Act, are now effectively excluded from being purchased by overseas persons unless those persons move to New Zealand within 12 months of the investment, and will be living in New Zealand as a tax resident within two years of the investment. This will significantly limit the sale of non-urban land to overseas buyers. Applicants who still decide to embark on the process established by the Act to purchase non-urban land can expect that the assessment process will be more demanding, takes longer and be more costly. In addition, if immigration rules in New Zealand for the investor visa programme are sharpened, longer-term permanent residency is discouraged and associated \u2013 highly-productive \u2013 capital may no longer come in. Social aspects In the European Union , the livestock sector accounts for 4 million workers (Animal Task Force, 2017 143 ), out of which the cattle sector employs 2.5 million and further 1.5 million work on farms specialised in sheep and goat-rearing 144 with the highest share in total employment (2.7 percent) being in Ireland (European Parliament, 2017). In 2016, unpaid labour (mainly family members) contributed around 90 percent of working hours on the livestock farms (for comparison, in fruits and vegetables sector, it was only around 46 percent, with the rest covered by hired workers) (European Commission 2016a). 145 In 2013, only 16.4 percent of people active in agriculture worked on farms full time (however, there were significant differences between Member States). Other paid activities included processing farm products (22.8 percent), contractual work (19 percent), forestry work (15.9 percent), renewable energy production (11.2 percent), tourism (10.7 percent) and others (Eurostat, 2017a). According to trade union representatives, there is a need for continued efforts to promote respect for labour standards, decent working conditions and health and safety at work in the EU meat (processing) industry, including living wages, equality of workers\u2019 treatment (support for migrant and vulnerable workers) and good relations between employers and workers in the sector. 146 In 2014, construction, 142 Lane Neave law firm based in New Zealand, https://www.laneneave.co.nz/new-overseas-investment- restrictions-major-direction-change-offshore-new-zealand-land-acquisitions/ 143 Animal Task Force.

In 2018, beef, lamb and deer farms employed 18,459 workers in New Zealand (Primary ITO, 2018). The meat processing industry is the largest manufacturing employer and provides up to 25,000 jobs in 60 locations in New Zealand. 147 This means a slight increase from 2008 when the meat processing sector employed 24,000 people (Meat Industry Association, 2009). 148 Industry members have developed a set of voluntary health and safety at work guidelines to be applied in processing plants in addition to Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. 149 The aim is to promote the meat products to international buyers and consumers not only as complying with food safety and quality standards, but also as produced in a safe and ethical way despite challenging working environment (work in meat processing involves the use of sharp knives and saws, lifting or moving objects and being exposed to temperatures extremes). To address it, workers are provided with training (e.g. how to handle knives), are encouraged to report early discomfort caused by repetitive movements and carry out rotating (diverse) tasks to avoid injuries caused by systematic overburdening of certain parts of the body. Industry members are also encouraged to share information about the common problems with a view to developing further guidance. 150 Also, the farmers\u2019 association (Beef and Lamb New Zealand) has taken measures to improve health and safety at work at livestock farms, e.g. by providing Farm Safety Management Systems (FSMS) workshops for farmers (4,000 participants by 2019) and plans to assist them in on-farm implementation of enhanced safety rules (e.g. related to use of vehicles). 151 However, there is room for further improvement. According to a survey carried out in 2017 among 3,000 workers and 2,000 employers from six sectors, incl. agriculture (i.e. not only meat sector), the latter had the lowest scores in training rate on health and safety at work provided to workers (28 percent compared to 51 percent of average across sectors) and in perceiving safety among the top priorities (Work Safe NZ, 2017). The number of fatal accidents at work in the whole New Zealand\u2019s economy has been relatively stable between 2011-April 2019 with a total number of 29-34 accidents a year (with two peaks in 2012 and 2013 with 37 and 40 accidents respectively). The highest number has been recorded in agriculture (14-28 accidents a year with no clear trend), followed by construction (2-9) and forestry (1-10) (Work Safe NZ, 2019). Concerning non-fatal accidents, the total rate of related claims has been decreasing from 154 (per 1,000 Full-Time Equivalent worker) in 2002 to 101 in 2017 for the whole economy. In agriculture, after an increase, from 197 in 2009 to 213 in 2013, a decline has been observed to 186 in 2017 (Stats NZ, 2017b). In 2016, the lowest sectoral rate of trade union membership (around 3 percent) was in agriculture, forestry and fishing (Stats NZ, 2016). The overall number of trade union members decreased by more than half since 1985, with the largest loss (-93.6 percent) recorded in agriculture, forestry and fishing. This was largely due to legislative changes: adoption of the Labour Relations Act 1987, which required unions to have a minimum of 1,000 members (compared to 30 members previously), and the Employment Contracts Act 147 Meat Industry Association: https://www.mia.co.nz/ [accessed on 20 May 2019] 148 Overall, in 2008, the red meat industry in New Zealand employed more than 53,000 people directly and accounted for 2.4% of the national workforce. The industry\u2019s workforce included: 24,000 people employed in the meat processing sector; 23,500 people employed in sheep, beef and deer farming; and 5,600 people employed in shearing services (Meat Industry Association, 2009). 149 Meat Industry Association: https://www.mia.co.nz/ [accessed on 20 May 2019] 150 Meat Industry Association: https://www.mia.co.nz/what-we-do/workforce/health-and-safety/ [accessed on 20 May 2019] 151 Beef + Lamb New Zealand (7 February 2019), Health and safety heads-up: https://beeflambnz.com/news- views/health-and-safety-heads-up [accessed on 20 May 2019] ",

Other factors included e.g. rise in short-term and casual jobs (Parliament of New Zealand, 2000). Human rights aspects Both the EU and New Zealand have human rights obligations with respect to labour rights that are relevant for the workers in the ruminant meat sector (see overview of ratifications for both parties). Trade associations in both Parties at different levels join efforts to promote respect for labour standards, favourable working conditions and health and safety at work in the meat (processing) industry. Several characteristics of the ruminant meat sector matter for the human rights analysis: the sector has a relatively high share of SMEs, the contracting situation (see also the social aspects described above) is dominated by daily hire or casual workers \u2013 not by long-term fixed contracts. Migrant workers, who are often more vulnerable to exploitation, are employed relatively more than in other sectors of the New Zealand economy because they have already acquired the necessary skills and because local workers were less interested in jobs in the sector. This elevates the right to work , the right to an adequate standard of living and working conditions linked to the ILO Core Labour Conventions to prominence for analysis. Also, the impact of the EU-NZ FTA on migrants and vulnerable groups (e.g. indigenous peoples\u2019 rights) needs to be covered, as well as the issue of informal (family) employment. This is the more relevant because the activities of this sector are predominantly concentrated in rural areas in New Zealand. Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 is one of the main documents that establishes guidelines on safe and favourable working conditions in New Zealand. Next to that, Beef and Lamb New Zealand association provides support in trainings through Farm Safety Management Systems (FSMS) workshops for farmers (4,000 participants by 2019). 152 Based on the statistical data, the sector is characterised by low trade union membership rate of approximately 3 percent (Stats NZ, 2016). Media reports increasing employment of migrants in the sector but the exact statistics for the number of migrants working in this sector is not available. 153 Environmental aspects Food production is responsible for about 26 percent of the anthropogenic GHG emissions, 32 percent of global acidification and 78 percent of eutrophication globally. A recent European study found that livestock in particular is responsible for a large share of the agricultural sector\u2019s overall environmental impact: 78 percent of terrestrial biodiversity loss, 80 percent of soil acidification and air pollution (ammonia and nitrogen), 81 percent of the global warming effect produced by the sector and 73 percent of water pollution through nitrogen and phosphorus run-off (Leip et al. 2015). Table 4.1 summarises the results from another study from Oxford University, showing the relative size of the environmental footprint of bovine meat production (Poore and Nemecek, 2019). The production of bovine meat for human consumption creates by far the largest amount of GHG emissions from a life-cycle perspective (taking into account all materials and services needed to consume 100 grams of protein) as compared to other type of typical protein- rich food products. The large amount of GHG emissions largely stem from methane emissions from enteric fermentation by cows. The figure also shows that bovine meat has the second greatest impact on SO 2 emissions, which acidify soils and waters, and eutrophying emissions to water and soils due to the nitrogen content in the urine of cows (Poore & Nemecek, 2019). Sheep meat production is comparatively less emission intensive. 152 Beef + Lamb New Zealand (7 February 2019), Health and safety heads-up: https://beeflambnz.com/news- views/health-and-safety-heads-up [accessed on 20 May 2019] 153 See, e.g. articles available at: https://www.independent.ie/business/farming/news/world-news/large-rise- in-meat-and-dairy-manufacturing-drives-new-zealands-economy-38224061.html or at https://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&objectid=12178163 ",

Figure 4.3 below illustrates the nitrogen cycles involved in production processes related to livestock (feed for livestock and manure from livestock) and how they lead to various undesired emissions and environmental impacts. As shown, key in the figure is the large amount of fertiliser use in soils for crop cultivation, most of which is needed for livestock farming. Nitrogen releases predominantly lead to worsening water quality and soil acidification as well as create some impact on air quality. The impact of beef farming also has a significant impact on land use: for every 100 grams of protein consumed, 170 m 2 of land is needed for cattle grazing and growing cattle feed. Without strict policies in place, land clearing for cattle farming could result in significant impact on biodiversity as the land needed for beef farming could be taken away from natural areas, such as forests, which are key for the existence of animals and plants. According to Beef + Lamb New Zealand, the negative impact on biodiversity of their farming practices are not valid, because 24 percent of New Zealand native vegetation is on beef and sheep farms, thus providing a habitat for native fauna 154 . The New Zealand government has been active on trying to curb the impacts of the sector on the environment. Notably, a tax on methane emissions from ruminants was proposed (\u201cfart tax\u201d), but due to controversy abandoned in 2003. As a compromise, a research commission would be formed to investigate ways to reduce methane emissions from dairy and beef farming. The Commission and the government committed to reduce GHG emissions by 5 percent in 2020 compared to 1990 levels by investigating means of selecting low methane emitting animals, producing lower methane feeds, reducing nitrous oxide and nitrate leaching and increasing soil carbon. 155 A number of recent initiatives have been developed between the New Zealand Government and agricultural industry to reduce agricultural emissions, including a proposal to introduce a farm-level price on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, 156 and the Zero Carbon Act which sets targets for reduced emissions from livestock production to 2050. 157 154 Interview with Julia Beijeman on https://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/2018/07/20/health-environment- impacts-of-meat-consumption-expert-reaction/ 155 Beef + Lamb New Zealand, 2017, Guide to New Zealand Cattle Farming. 156 https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Legislation/RIS/ria-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions- from-agricultural-sector.pdf 157 https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/zero-carbon-amendment-act Product GHG Emissions (kg CO\u2082 eq.)

Economic impact For the EU, total output of ruminant meat is estimated to increase by 0.2 percent under the conservative scenario and decline by 1.4 percent under the ambitious liberalisation scenario, compared to a no change scenario (Table 4.2). In contrast, for New Zealand, the corresponding estimated percentage change in total output of ruminant meat is a negative 0.1 percent and positive 4.1 percent, respectively. The increase in New Zealand\u2019s bilateral exports of ruminant meat to the EU is large under the ambitious scenario ( 25.3 percent), though its total exports of ruminant meat are expected to rise by 5.8 percent only. This indicates that better access to the EU market will lead to some trade diversion \u2013 i.e. some exports of New Zealand are diverted away from other markets towards the EU because it has become relatively more attractive. It should be highlighted again that the ambitious scenario is based on a theoretical assumption of a full elimination of tariffs and quotas in the agricultural sector. Such scenario has not been followed by the Commission in any trade negotiation and the Commission would elaborate its position on the findings of this report in the subsequent position paper. Moreover, some quotas are not filled and tariff- free, and the pasture-based farming nature and limited grazing acreage puts a natural constraint on further production in New Zealand. In their joint submission, B+L New Zealand and MIA point out that the stock numbers in the sheep and beef sector have been dropping and production remained static, despite various FTAs. The effect has been to produce higher-value added meat in the sector, rather than increasing volumes \u2013 which is captured by the econometric results. Despite capturing export value and not export volumes, the modelled liberalisation effects could be over-estimates because of these reasons. 158 The figure shows the input of new reactive nitrogen (Nr) production, contrasting the intended flows to and from European agriculture (black arrows), the unintended flows as this pass down the cascade (red arrows) and the resulting environmental concerns (orange boxes).

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 110 | P a g e The EU's bilateral exports of ruminant meat to New Zealand show more modest increases \u2013 0.6 percent and 4.2 percent under the two scenarios, though its total exports of ruminant meat decline by 3.5 percent in the ambitious scenario. Table 4.2: Effects of EU-NZ FTA on trade and output of the ruminant meat sector Bilateral exports Total exports Output New Zealand Conservative (%) 0.3 -0.2 -0.1 Ambitious (%) 25.3 5.8 4.1 European Union Conservative (%) 0.6 0.6 0.2 Ambitious (%) 4.2 -3.5 -1.4 Source: CGE results provided by DG Trade (2019) Despite its relatively stringent measures protecting human and animal health (SPS) and for mandatory consumer information, including packaging and advertising (TBT) on ruminant meat, the EU still has a huge deficit in its ruminant meat trade with New Zealand, with imports of nearly \u20ac 1 billion. TRQs and differences in standards are the main NTM affecting ruminant meat trade between the two partners. Further mutual recognition of such standards, as in the case of the EU-NZ Veterinary Agreement, and removal of TRQs are likely to further increase NZ-EU bilateral exports of ruminant meat. This is also what is observed in the economic impact analysis under the ambitious scenario, which inter alia simulates the effect of the removal of TRQs in this sector. In terms of investments, raising the investment screening ceiling will facilitate EU investments into New Zealand. This has a relative competitiveness improving effect for EU investors vis-\u00e0-vis CPTPP investors in the sector who already have access, while it also leads to more potential growth and development. 4.1.3. Social impact Based on results of the economic modelling, ruminant meat sector in the EU is likely to be the most negatively affected sector (in relative terms) because of the FTA \u2013 However, only under the ambitious scenario, which is based on the theoretical assumption of full elimination of tariffs and quotas in the agricultural sector, but not in the conservative scenario, which foresees no liberalisation of the ruminant meat sector in the EU. Employment effects are expected to be in line with the estimated changes in output, i.e. an employment increase by 0.2 percent for both, skilled and unskilled workers under the conservative scenario and an employment reduction by 1.4 percent for both groups of workers under the ambitious one. This may relate to the increase in New Zealand\u2019s exports onto the EU market (by 25.3 percent under the ambitious scenario). However, the estimates produced by the economic modelling need to be interpreted in light of the assumptions and methodological constraints. Thus, the assumption that total employment is fixed tends to exaggerate employment effects at sector level. In addition, the majority of EU beef is a by-product of dairy production, and dairy production itself is usually integrated in a mixed farm of arable and (sometimes additional) livestock activities; these inter-sectoral linkages ameliorate the effects on individual sectors as identified in the economic model (such as ruminant meat) but are not reflected in the model estimates. In sum, the anticipated reduction of beef and sheep meat output in the EU under the ambitious scenario is likely to put some pressure on farm employment, but given other factors which are not reflected in the economic model, the estimated almost 1:1 relationship to on-farm employment is likely to be exaggerated. In any case, if the ambitious scenario was to be followed, there would be a need to monitor situation in certain Member States or regions which, due to a higher share of non-dairying cattle farming in economic activity and employment (e.g. in Ireland), may potentially be more affected (in particular if effects of more new FTAs cumulate). For New Zealand, the economic modelling suggests a decline in employment by 0.2 percent for both groups of workers under the ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 111 | P a g e conservative scenario and an employment increase by 4.1 for unskilled workers and 4.2 percent for skilled ones under the ambitious scenario; the caveats mentioned above apply. The EU-NZ FTA (under the ambitious scenario) may also contribute to an increase in employment opportunities for migrant workers in New Zealand, if recently identified staff shortages are not met by local workers. Otherwise, the potential for new jobs and increased sectoral output related to the EU-NZ FTA may only materialize to a limited extent. Impacts related to changes in wage and price levels have been discussed in the general part of the analysis (given that economic modelling provides the former only for the whole economy, i.e. at an aggregated level). Given that there is no visible correlation between employment levels in agriculture in New Zealand and the number of accidents at work (peaks in the number of fatal accidents in 2012-2013 were accompanied by low employment levels and the increasing employment in the following years witnessed a continuous decline in the number of non-fatal accidents), it is difficult to predict the impact of the EU-NZ FTA and the expected employment growth under the ambitious scenario on accidents as one of the indicators of health and safety at work levels. However, one can expect that initiatives taken and planned by farmers and the meat processing industry may increase the level of safety at the workplace in general and contribute to decline in the number of accidents (both, fatal and non-fatal). If they are continued, then the expected employment growth resulting from the EU-NZ FTA should not contribute to a higher number of accidents at work. Moreover, if agreed in negotiations, provisions on health and safety at work under the TSD chapter may encourage the Parties to take further unilateral actions and pursue bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this area. 4.1.4. Human rights impact Results of the economic modelling suggest that ruminant meat sector in the EU is likely to be the most negatively affected sector in relative terms (-1.4 percent in terms of output) because of the EU-NZ FTA. However, only under the ambitious scenario, because New Zealand\u2019s market access to the EU is much more limited in the conservative scenario. With respect to human rights, related to employment changes, right to work and, indirectly, right to an adequate standard of living of the workers in this sector are expected to be affected, proportionate to changes predicted by the model. Thus, in the EU, based on the predicted employment increase of 0.2 percent for both skilled and unskilled workers under the conservative scenario, rights of the workers that benefit from the FTA are expected to be positively affected, creating more jobs. While based on the predicted employment reduction by 1.4 percent for both groups of workers under the ambitious scenario, the impact is expected to be negative for the affected groups of workers. Due to a high share of non-dairy farming in specific EU Member States, e.g. Ireland, Poland or Romania (see Figure 4.4), the impact may need to be monitored and liberalisation may need to be phased in to ensure a more gradual effect on the workers. For New Zealand, the predicted decline in employment of 0.2 percent for both groups of workers under the conservative scenario is expected to generate a proportionate and marginally negative impact on the right to work (and indirectly, right to an adequate standard of living ) for the related groups of the population. While the predicted employment increases by 4.1 for unskilled workers and 4.2 percent for skilled ones under the ambitious scenario is expected to generate an opposite and positive effect for affected workers. Because the ruminant meat sector is by nature of its activities concentrated in the rural areas, these employment effects would be positive for the relatively more vulnerable economic areas in New Zealand, adding to income equality across territorial authorities. The EU-NZ FTA (under the ambitious scenario) may also contribute to an increase in employment opportunities for migrant workers in New Zealand, thereby, positively affecting their right to work . That is, if recently identified staff shortages are continued to be met by overseas workers. Further strengthening of the existing legal mechanisms to ",

This is especially relevant due to the fact that New Zealand did not ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families. Figure 4.4: Regional distribution of EU cattle-keeping farms Source: European Commission (2016) If agreed in negotiations, provisions on health and safety at work under the TSD chapter may encourage the Parties to take further unilateral actions and pursue bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this area which may have a positive impact on labour rights of the workers involved in this sector and nationwide. Based on the environmental analysis (see section 4.1.5), the EU-NZ FTA is expected to increase to some extent the pressure on the right to a clean environment and right to water of the citizens of New Zealand as a result of economic activities in the ruminant meat sector. Water quality and emission pollution are expected to increase due to more intensive beef farming in New Zealand and thereby negatively affect these rights as well as indirectly put pressure on the right to health, especially taking into account the existing sensitivities with respect to water quality (Piddock, 2019). Environmental mitigation measures are key to flank this potential development to guard the right to a clean environment, right to water, and right to health. 4.1.5. Environmental impact The environmental status quo section described that the environmental impact in relation to bovine meat production is significant: climate change is worsened due to the emissions of methane (CH 4 ) from enteric fermentation and life-cycle emissions (including nitrous- dioxide, N 2 O) related to use of fertilizers and feed. Moreover, water quality is impacted through eutrophication from the run-off of urine and manure (containing nitrogen) and biodiversity can be impacted by land clearing for pasture farming. These impacts are potentially aggravated in New Zealand as a result of the FTA due to the predicted increase in output of up to 4 percent in the ambitious scenario (which is based on the theoretical assumption of full elimination of tariffs and quotas). ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 113 | P a g e Based on the overall environmental analysis, in the ambitious scenario methane and nitrous dioxide emissions are predicted to increase (compared to the situation without the FTA) by 0.488 and 0.133 Mton CO 2 eq. respectively in 2030, due to the predicted increase in production in the beef and sheep meat and dairy sector. This represents 1.5 percent of NZ total methane emissions in 2012 and 1 percent of total N 2 O emissions. The sectors dairy and beef and sheep meat could not be split from the quantitative environmental analysis, but since the majority of the growth is predicted to stem from the beef and sheep meat sector in New Zealand, the majority of the predicted impact will hold for this sector. These impacts can be mitigated in part if New Zealand achieves to effectively implement additional GHG reducing policies, such as the Zero Carbon Act 159 . We note that existing policies lowered the GHG intensity in the agricultural sector by 17% between 2007 and 2017. 160 In the EU, methane and nitrous-dioxide emissions are predicted to fall due to a decrease in output in the ambitious scenario. In the conservative scenario, however, the effects are predicted to be reversed. Even though the location of the emissions might matter for both countries\u2019 national emissions accounting, the environmental impact of GHG emissions is global and thus the overall aggregate environmental impact most relevant. This impact is expected to be slightly negative, because the FTA will lower costs (by reducing tariffs and NTMs) and thus stimulate consumption and concomitantly production. The FTA will also lead to more trade flows between both countries, but the GHG emissions related to transportation are small compared to those created from the farming process itself. Secondly, the predicted increase in beef and sheep meat production in New Zealand (in the ambitious scenario) will also lead to increased pressure on water quality in New Zealand since the amount of nitrogen from urine and manure is expected to increase proportionally to the growth in the number of cattle in the ambitious scenario. Water quality is of crucial importance to New Zealand\u2019s citizens. In a recent poll, 82 percent of the respondents said to be \u201cextremely concerned or very concerned about pollution of New Zealand\u2019s rivers and lakes\u201d, ranking water quality as the number one concern (above i.e. cost of living and the health system) (Piddock, 2019). The additional impetus provided by the FTA to increase output will contribute to the ongoing trend of intensification of beef and dairy farming in New Zealand. As a result, soil compaction will increase due to a higher number of cattle on land, increasing the amount of nitrogen run-off into waterways. Lastly, biodiversity can be harmed by land clearing but this is likely minimal since increases in output in recent years have rather led to intensification of land use rather than more land clearing. When we assume this trend to continue, which is not unlikely given the stock of land is fixed, the additional output due to the FTA is likely to contribute to this intensification. Moreover, according to Beef + Lamb New Zealand, their farms host a large share of native vegetation in New Zealand suggesting that land use for cattle farming might not reduce biodiversity to its full extent. 4.1.6. SME analysis The ruminant meat sector in the EU is largely represented by SMEs. According to Eurostat (2010) the manufacturing of food products sector, which includes beef and sheep meat, consists of approximately 97.9 percent SMEs and 2.1 percent of large companies. Additionally, SMEs active in the sector account for 64.6 percent of the employment, whereas large companies employ roughly 35.4 percent. Although, SMEs are more abundant in the food product manufacturing sector, the value-added they generate amounts to 52.1 percent, whilst large companies achieve 47.9 percent. In order to determine the degree of impact for EU SMEs in the ruminant meat sector, a matching approach between the economic model results provided by DG Trade and the data of the prevalence and importance of SMEs in the sector is used. The measures of 159 Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act 2019 160 Greenhouse gas emissions by industry and households account 2007-17, Stats NZ ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 114 | P a g e impact include the changes in bilateral exports, value added and skilled and unskilled labour in the market. The effects of the EU-NZ FTA are modest for EU SMEs. The expected effects are both of direct and indirect nature. Currently EU exports of ruminant meat are quite difficult and limited as EU production costs tend to be higher, and welfare regulations, livestock management standards and SPS regulations are very strict. However, based on the conducted calculations, under the conservative and ambitious scenarios bilateral EU exports to New Zealand of bovine and other meat are generally expected to increase (see Table 4.2). Thus, based on the sector structure, the high presence of SMEs and the reduction of trade barriers and regulatory requirements under the EU-NZ FTA, one is able to predict that SMEs will benefit slightly directly through exporting more ruminant meat under the FTA in light of a reduction in market access barriers, less RoO requirements, and simplified customs procedures. However, as these barriers and extra costs are relatively larger for SMEs compared to large companies due to lower scale and as the ruminant meat sector is comprised of only a few major exporters, SMEs are primarily expected to face modest value chain benefits through beef and sheep meat output increases under the conservative scenario (see Table 4.2). In light of higher output and a higher level of participation in the international marketplace for ruminant meat, higher turnover and growth is to be expected if SMEs are fully taking advantage of the FTA and utilise its required understanding and implementation of rules, provisions and preferences. In regard to employment, the beef and sheep meat and other ruminant meat sector will have a modest decrease in skilled and unskilled workers under the conservative scenario (see Table 3.15). Although, the output is expected to increase and SMEs employ the majority of people in the sector, employment of skilled and unskilled people will reduce as a consequence of the large increase in imports from New Zealand. This large influx of New Zealand ruminant meat will reduce put modest pressure on the production. For New Zealand the ruminant meat sector is also largely represented by SMEs. In Deloitte\u2019s \u201cRed Meat Sector Strategy Report\u201d (2011) for Beef + Lamb New Zealand Limited and the Meat Industry Association of New Zealand, four main actors in the sector are identified: marketers, processors, procurers and suppliers. According to Deloitte, all of these actors except the procurers consist of only a few individuals and teams and are connected via various supply chains. The largest and most capital intensive of these actors are the suppliers which amount to approximately 12,250 farmers, which \u201c[\u2026] vary dramatically in scale from smaller sole operator farms through large consolidated farms run under a corporate structure.\u201d (Deloitte, 2011). In comparison, New Zealand has 80 processing plant, out of which four are listed in the 40 largest companies in New Zealand: Silver Fern Farms, Alliance Group, ANZCO Foods, and AFFCO (The Meat Industry Association, 2009). The remainder vary from small sized farms to single plant operations. To identify the impact of the FTA on New Zealand SMEs a matching approach was used as well. The effect of the EU-NZ FTA looks promising for New Zealand\u2019s SMEs. Same as for the EU SMEs, the expected effects for New Zealand\u2019s SMEs are both of direct and indirect nature. The EU currently has relatively low quotas and tariffs on New Zealand high-quality beef, sheep meat and goatmeat. These regulations are generally more difficult to fulfil by SMEs compared to large enterprises. That said, the obligation to meet various testing, certification and documentation procedures implicitly puts potential SME exporters with their in general lower sales volumes at a comparative disadvantage due to the higher impact of the related costs per unit. However, the calculations project that under both the conservative and the ambitious scenario the bilateral New Zealand exports to the EU are expected to increase (see Table 4.2). Based on the higher prevalence of SMEs and their high value-added, one is able to predict that New Zealand SMEs will benefit from the FTA through exporting more ruminant meat under even more facilitated and simplified market access barriers, less RoO requirements, customs procedures, welfare regulations, livestock management standards and SPS regulations. Additionally, in the occurrence of export increases in the sector and with the presence of several large-scale exporters, active SMEs farmers, suppliers and exporters ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 115 | P a g e will benefit indirectly through value chain benefits. Overall, in light of higher output (under the ambitious scenario), higher bilateral exports and a higher level of participation in the international market place for ruminant meat, higher turnover and growth is to be expected if SMEs are fully taking advantage of the FTA and utilise its required understanding and implementation of rules, provisions and preferences. New Zealand SMEs will also face large increases in terms of employment of skilled and unskilled workers under the ambitious scenarios (see Table 3.15). As SMEs employ the majority of people in the ruminant meat sector an increase in their employment is required as there will be an overall output increase. 4.1.7. Third country impact In this section we address the effects of the EU-NZ FTA for third countries. We cannot cover each country, so we focus on countries that matter policy-wise directly for the EU (Turkey and EU FTA countries), that matter policy-wise directly for New Zealand (ASEAN, Pacific countries), LDCs (to look at impact on poorest countries), and those that matter for important EU and New Zealand competitors (South Korea, Japan, China, US).

The trade effects for Turkey and the EU FTA partners are negative, with their total exports decreasing by 1.6 percent and 1.4 percent, because of preference erosion vis-\u00e0-vis New Zealand. For the Pacific Countries the sector effects of the EU-NZ FTA are positive (in the ambitious scenario): output increases, and so do the islands\u2019 total ruminant meat exports. From the main EU and New Zealand competitors, South Korea benefits relatively most (again, in the ambitious scenario only), with 0.4 percent growth in production and an increase in Korean exports to the world by 0.3 percent. The effects for LDCs, Japan, China and the US are negligible. In general, the FTA would \u2013 in case the ambitious scenario was followed (as mentioned above, a theoretical assumption in the CGE model) \u2013 lead to a diversion of New Zealand\u2019s ruminant meat exports from other markets to the EU, and a diversion of EU exports to some markets in the face of stronger competition on the EU market. 4.1.8. Competitiveness analysis Economic theory suggests that market integration from an FTA is likely to lead to defragmentation and pro-competitive effects with a fall in mark-ups and subsequent industrial restructuring resulting in bigger, fewer, more efficient firms facing more effective competition from each other. The SME analysis undertaken above suggests that this sector is dominated by SMEs in both the EU and New Zealand. While the ruminant meat market is moderately concentrated in ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 116 | P a g e the EU with a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of 2,230 161 , it is amongst the least contested sectors in New Zealand (with a profit elasticity, PE, weighted by gross value added, GVA, of -1.42 162 over 2000-2010). The relative absence of competition and large SME representation suggest that the EU-NZ FTA is likely to unleash pro-competitive effects, leading to a fall in mark-ups and industrial restructuring especially in the ambitious scenario that entails more meaningful liberalisation of this sector via removal of TRQs. This could result in bigger, fewer, more efficient firms in this sector in both partner markets facing more effective competition from each other. 4.1.9. Policy recommendations and flanking measures \uf0b7 In case the ambitious scenario is followed, the employment effects are not negligible and could be regionally concentrated (i.e. negatively affect the right to work and the right to an adequate standard of living). So any tariff and/or TRQ liberalisation for ruminant meats should be introduced gradually and the EU should monitor the situation in EU Member States or regions which, due to a higher share of non-dairying cattle farming in economic activity and employment (e.g. in Ireland), may potentially be more affected (in particular if effects of more new FTAs, such as FTAs with Australia and New Zealand, but also Mercosur, cumulate). Decisions to be taken either at the EU level or by individual EU Member States about the appropriate support measures for farmers should be based on a sound market analysis and trends in demand, supply and prices. Such analysis could be provided e.g. by the EU Meat Market Observatory, with a particular focus on changes following entry into force of new FTAs. Additional evidence related to effects of market changes on farmers and meat processors could be collected by their organisations, e.g. the Irish Farmers\u2019 Association, and reported at the national and EU level. Moreover, to avoid or mitigate potential negative effects, the governments and farmers\u2019 associations in the EU and EU Member States should continue or step up efforts supporting competitiveness of the ruminant meat sector in the EU and high products\u2019 quality, complemented by search for potential additional destination markets for products of this sector. Furthermore, given that the ambitious negotiation scenario may bring about the biggest employment gains, but also the biggest job reductions across sectors, the Parties will need to consider if they wish to follow it at all. \uf0b7 While levels of health and safety at work in New Zealand\u2019s agriculture may require further improvement and monitoring, initiatives taken recently by farmers and meat sector representatives in New Zealand, may contribute to a decline in the number of non-fatal accidents at work in the sector; the Parties should include these initiatives in the dialogue within the FTA framework . An exchange of used practices in the EU and New Zealand with respect to how health and safety at work are pursued, could help further reduce the number of accidents at work in agriculture, including in the red meat and livestock sector. \uf0b7 In order to mitigate any potential negative social impact from the EU-NZ FTA, we recommend that the Parties undertake commitments in the FTA toward ratification of ILO Conventions No. 87, No. 138 and No. 169 as well as the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. \uf0b7 We also recommend those EU Member States who did not yet do so, to ratify the 2014 Protocol to the ILO Forced Labour Convention No. 29. \uf0b7 The impact of the bovine meat sector on climate change is significant. However, for a large part of the emissions there is no easy way to reduce them (e.g. involving biological processes such as enteric fermentation). To the extent that the FTA will create additional demand and thus additional GHG emissions (from the EU to New Zealand), the EU and New Zealand should engage in a dialogue and create public- 161 http://bruegel.org/wp-content/uploads/imported/publications/WP_2014_07__01.pdf 162 https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/f8aae60a4e/competition-in-new-zealand-industries.pdf; note that a more negative PE score denotes more intense competition.

The EU and New Zealand should exchange best practices that resulted from the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2014 (New Zealand) and the Water Framework Directive since 2000 (EU), sharing what works, what does not work and have technical experts contribute to the debate. \uf0b7 We recommend that the Parties agree to New Zealand removing the pre-investment screening mechanism for EU investments or at least increase the threshold for the application of the mechanism. This would improve the competitive position of EU investors and benefit the New Zealand economy and lead to more economic growth. 4.2. Dairy 4.2.1. Current situation Economic aspects Trade in dairy products is important for both the EU and New Zealand. The EU has shown a steady rise in its exports of dairy products to New Zealand though imports from New Zealand have been higher each year from 2010 \u2013 2017. The level of the dairy trade deficit for the EU with New Zealand has, however, declined over time (see Figure 4.5). The EU\u2019s bilateral exports of dairy to New Zealand increased more than ten-fold from \u20ac 8.5 million in 2010 to \u20ac 101.5 million in 2017. In contrast, EU imports of dairy from New Zealand have nearly halved from a value of \u20ac 226 million in 2010 (with a peak of \u20ac 340 million in 2014) to \u20ac 129 million in 2017. The share of bilateral trade of this sector in the EU's total bilateral trade with New Zealand was over 10 percent in 2014 but declined to 5.5 percent in 2017. In contrast, the share of bilateral trade in the sector in the EU's total trade with the world has been stable around 1 percent over the 2010-2017 period. Figure 4.5: EU-New Zealand trade in dairy products Source: UNComtrade; own calculations Milk production in the EU-28 amounted to 154.6 million tons in 2018, whereas New Zealand produced 22.0 million tons in the same year (USDA, 2019). In the EU28 (with a population of 511.5 million) the sector accounts for 300,000 employees, while in New Zealand (with 4.6 million residents), 46,000 persons are employed in the dairy sector. 163 See Mayberry et al.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 118 | P a g e Just these few examples show the interest and the need for market access predictability. Despite their structural and strategic differences, EU and New Zealand dairy market participants thus seek a level-playing field by way of trade and mutual recognition agreements \u2013 not least through transparent and science-based joint committee procedures, and their conformity assessment bodies. The tariff and NTM commitments recently entered into by New Zealand and the EU, the WTO SPS and TBT rules applying to both, and the EU-NZ Veterinary Agreement will be most useful cornerstones for a deep and ambitious FTA accompanying this dynamic industrial sector. \u201cClosing the triangle\u201d would be the Memorandum of Understanding on dairy products between the Australian and New Zealand Dairy Industries concluded under ANZCERTA, dated 28 March 1983 (Australian Treaty Series 1983 No. 2). Box 4.2 The dynamism of New Zealand\u2019s dairy industry 164 For most dairy products, FAO/AMIS data show very strongly (and presently very low) fluctuating prices on most markets. The cyclical and structural factors underlying these fluctuations cannot be discussed here. What matters for the FTA negotiations are the rapidly evolving investment and trade patterns not only in East Asia, and the regulatory context coming as a response to changing consumer demand, trade flows, import market conditions and \u2013 not least \u2013 to food scandals. For New Zealand, the Chinese dairy market is now the most important export outlet. The dairy production, processing and export cooperative, Fonterra, invests and disinvests also in Australia, Europe, in Northern America, in the Middle East and in Brazil. In China it has two vertically integrated \u201cfarming hubs\u201d and Joint Ventures with local or multinational companies (Nestl\u00e9). Even so, competitors in the USA and in Europe have a much bigger home market from which to grow with their exports or their own direct investment abroad. For instance, Oatly (Sweden), and both Lactalis and Danone (France) have started producing in China or plan to do so in the near future. New products specifically directed at Chinese and other consumers keep being developed, such as highly concentrated whey protein concentrate (WPC), whey protein isolate (WPI), milk whey protein, or soy-based follow-on formula or low protein content in complementary children food. Dairy-derived animal feed is also of capital importance for the global lactose market, particularly in China, which is presently affected by African Swine Fever. Besides the evolving sanitary standards and requirements, health claims, labelling, and ethical marketing practices, are other issues under consideration for new regulations. The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) is reviewing the New Zealand Dairy Restructuring Act (DIRA) in order to keep pace with international competition. In 2019 MPI also launched public opinion surveys for producers and consumers of raw milk \u2013 a long-time virtually closed sector in both Australia and New Zealand also for local and imported cheese. The Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA) is the treaty base for the regulatory development of the Single Market between these two countries applying also in the dairy sector. Trade policy measures Together with Australia, New Zealand continuously negotiates trade agreements to develop and secure its meat and dairy exports. In 2018, New Zealand was party to 16 FTAs, and to two large RTAs not yet in force (the CPTPP and the NZ-Gulf Cooperation Council FTA). Beside the ongoing negotiation with the EU, and enlargement negotiations under the ASEAN and China FTAs, it was also engaged in negotiations for 4 new FTAs with 7 countries. Some of these agreements ensure tariff-free access to New Zealand\u2019s dairy exports. Moreover, especially the SPS provisions in the CPTPP allow for virtually unhindered circulation of animal products and a speedy resolution of standard differences. In 2017, the average applied tariff rate on dairy products in the EU on New Zealand's exports was 54.6 percent. This is higher than the 41.5 percent the EU levies on imports from the rest of the world. In contrast, New Zealand has an applied tariff rate of 2 percent on dairy imports from the EU. Tariffs between 3 percent and 5 percent are applied on milk 164 Jim Cornall, Pearly Neo, Beth Newhart, and Cheryl Tay, all in Dairy Reporter.com dated, respectively, 21 March, and 1, 14, 23 and 29 May 2019.

A 7.7 percent tariff is applied on a range of cheese products, while other processed milk products imports face ad valorem zero tariffs. As concerns EU tariffs and quotas, New Zealand benefits from a large number of Tariff- Rate Quotas (TRQs), which the EU opens for all supplier countries (\u201cerga omnes\u201d) or to New Zealand only (either \u201ctraditional suppliers\u201d or \u201cnew suppliers\u201d). 165 Preferential import quota allocations for the year 2017 are for eight TRQs erga omnes, totalling 83,241 tons, while four large TRQs are reserved for New Zealand (for cheeses and butter), totalling 85,693 tons. 166 The last EU notification to the WTO shows fill rates of almost 100 percent under its four erga omnes quotas for butter and cheese. This is also reflected by Eurostat data, according to which New Zealand seems to make relatively good use of erga omnes quotas. The administration of these TRQs on an annual basis and in response to supplier requests is handled by New Zealand, allowing its own operators to keep the \u201cquota rent\u201d. In 2000, Bureau and Tangermann had described the EU system of non-ad valorem tariffs for almost all raw and processed milk products (30 HS6 product lines in total) as \u201ccomplex\u201d, but overall \u201crelatively satisfactory, compared with those of other countries.\u201d 167 According to Eurostat data, New Zealand seems to make relatively good use of those quotas which are available to all producers. 168 In 2004, Meat and Strutt argued that the WTO-established TRQ system leaves serious trade impediments in place, including for New Zealand\u2019s meat and dairy industry. Overall, however, New Zealand consistently underfills by about one third the TRQs to which it is eligible. The analysis by different sources does not seem to answer the question whether this underfill might be due to the EU quota system negatively impacting on New Zealand dairy exports to Europe, or to still increasing exports to other, possibly less lucrative markets in Asia. According to ABCIS, in 2016 New Zealand was the world\u2019s biggest dairy exporter. As noted by European Dairy Association (EDA), while the top ten EU dairy processors collect 36 percent of all milk produced in the EU, New Zealand\u2019s biggest dairy producer, Fonterra, processes 95 percent of all milk produced in New Zealand. This near-monopoly market power \u2013 under review in the Doha Round negotiations \u2013 has turned New Zealand into China\u2019s first supplier of butter and other products. 169 In respect of NTMs and agreements, the EU\u2013NZ Veterinary Agreement agreed in 1996 and substantially updated in 2015 remains the cornerstone for ensuring a relatively smooth EU-NZ dairy trade \u2013 even though New Zealand\u2019s commitments under the CPTPP are in some respects more trade-conducive (\u201cWTO Plus\u201d). The WTO provisions in respect of Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA) aim at more standard equivalence between the whole membership, including as a collateral benefit of regional integration agreements.

Investment barriers As far as dairy, in particular milk production is concerned in New Zealand, EU investments significantly lack behind those from China, Japan and US, countries with who New Zealand already has FTAs. 170 To the extent that land acquisition is required for the production and processing of dairy products, the same applies as in the case of ruminant meat: the investment screening threshold, in particular the OIO is difficult \u2013 as it affects the easy with which foreign investors can invest in non-urban land in New Zealand, needed for dairy production. In particular, non-urban properties over five hectares, which have previously been purchased by overseas persons through satisfying the non-economic benefit criteria in Act, are now excluded from being purchased by overseas persons unless they meet strict additional criteria. In addition, if immigration rules in New Zealand for the investor visa programme are sharpened, longer-term permanent residency is discouraged and associated \u2013 highly- productive \u2013 capital may no longer come in. In this context, it should be noted that there has been a general decline in the number of approved foreign investment applications in the agri-business over the period 2014 to 2018. 171 The drop in the number of approvals by the OIO suggests that the New Zealand market is not as attractive to foreign investors as it once was. Social aspects With respect to the social current situation, in 2016, the European Union dairy sector employed 300,000 people working at 12,000 milk processing and production sites (without considering enterprises cooperating along the supply chains). In addition, there were around 740,000 dairy farms. 172 45,000 jobs were directly linked to exports (European Dairy Association 2016, 2017). In 2016, dairy farms provided higher income than an average farm in the EU and with \u20ac 20,506 ranked 4th among farm types securing the highest incomes, after horticulture, wine and granivores (it is to note that farm incomes increased between 2009 and 2014 to decline in 2015-2017). However, there were differences in average income levels between the EU Member States, depending on productivity, farm size, herd size and levels of milk production. Moreover, taking account of costs of labour and capital used on farms revealed that wages are not sufficient to balance the input of labour and capital invested by farmers in work. Subsidies and direct payments played an important role as income components (European Commission, 2018c). 170 See Dairy report, Who benefits from China\u2019s massive investments in Kiwi dairy, 12 September 2018, https://www.dairyreporter.com/Article/2018/09/12/Who-benefits-from-China-s-massive-investment-in- Kiwi-dairy; KMPG report, Overseas investments in New Zealand Dairy Land, October 2015 https://home.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2015/10/KPMG-Overseas-Investment-NZ-Dairy-Land.pdf; KPMG report, FDI in New Zealand: Trend and Insights, August 2015, https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2015/08/KPMG-Foreign-Direct-Investment-analysis-August- 2015.pdf; KMPG report, FDI in New Zealand: Trends and Insights into OIO decision summary (2013-2015), https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/nz/pdf/November/KPMG-FDI-Thought-Leadership-Web.pdf 171 KMPG report, Foreign Direct Investment Report 2016-2018, https://home.kpmg/nz/en/home/insights/2019/04/foreign-direct-investment-report-16-18.html 172 Given considerable differences between EU Member States regarding size of dairy farms and cattle herds, the studies provide separate data for farms in the 15 \u201cold Member States\u201d, having on average 55 cows in a herd and farms in the 13 \u201cnew Member States\u201d having on average nine cows.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 121 | P a g e New Zealand. In 2019, the dairy sector provides employment for 46,000 people, including 34,000 on-farm jobs (8380 out of these are farm owners or operators) 173 and 12,000 in processing and wholesaling (Dairy NZ, 2019). It also supports 9,284 jobs in other sectors, such as support services, rail transport, veterinary and other professional services, and others (NZIER, 2018). Between 2000 and 2017, the sector has recorded an average annual employment growth of 3.1 percent (compared to 1.8 percent for the whole economy). It has been important to many local economies in New Zealand. In three Districts (Wainmate, West Coast and Southland) it has been the top income generator. In Wainmate, Otorohanga and Southland, it provides over 20 percent of total employment to the local population and in further eight Districts between 10 and 20 percent. In the top 20 Districts, the annual employment growth in the dairy sector (since 2000) was between 6 and 19 percent. Wages in dairy sector rank high among sub-sectors in the agriculture (with the average annual wage of NZ$48,700 in 2017, were the highest in farming) and food processing (also the first rank with an annual average wage of NZ$74,900). The average female dairy processing wage at NZ$72,710 was the fifth highest compared to all other sectors in the economy. The gender wage gap in the dairy sector has been reducing over the last 15 years (from -41 percent to -35 percent in dairy farming and from -33 percent to -20 percent in dairy processing). Dairy sector plays also an important role for M\u0101ori employment and economy. M\u0101ori own 10 percent of all assets in the sector (NZIER, 2017 and 2018). Around 2,000 migrant workers are employed in the dairy industry. 174 In 2018, the dairy sector welcomed the Government\u2019s intention to review the immigration policy and rules related to temporary work visas to provide more certainty for migrant workers and farmers and to help attract skilled migrant workers to regions where New Zealand\u2019s workers with the right skills set are not available. 175 As indicated in the general part of the analysis and Annex III.2, there were reported cases related to exploitation of migrant workers in the dairy sector, including severe underpayment for delivered work. On the other hand, however, there is an increasing awareness about those cases, new investigations, and an increasing number and variety of mechanisms used by the Government, enforcement agencies and employers and trade unions to prevent such cases and to address them when they happen. Dairy sector representatives (Dairy NZ and Federated Farmers) have developed a Workplace Action Plan which assists dairy farming businesses to adopt good workplace management practices. While all farmers and processing industry are expected to comply with the labour legislation, they came to the conclusion that favourable workplace environment which goes beyond legislative requirements, can help to attract and retain the best workers. It rests on five pillars: 1) balanced and productive work time; 2) fair remuneration; 3) wellness, wellbeing health and safety; 4) effective team culture and 5) rewarding careers. 176 According to a survey carried out in 2017 among 3,000 workers and 2,000 employers from six sectors, incl. agriculture, the latter had the lowest scores in training rate on health and safety at work provided to workers (28 percent compared to 51 percent of average across sectors) and in perceiving safety among the top priorities (Work Safe NZ, 2017). The number of fatal accidents at work in the whole New Zealand\u2019s economy has been relatively stable between 2011-April 2019 with a total number of 29-34 accidents a year (with two 173 An average size of a herd on a farm in New Zealand to handle by farm workers is of 431 cows. 174 Stuff: Migrant workers the backbone of the dairy industry, doing the work Kiwis won't (of 17 March 2019): https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/110862196/migrants-workers-are-the-backbone-of-the-dairy- industry-outstrip-kiwis-in-qualifications-and-work-ethic [accessed on 15 May 2019] 175 NZ Herald: Farmers, growers welcome immigration proposals (of 18 December 2018): https://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&objectid=12178976 [accessed on 15 May 2019] 176 Dairy NZ: Workplace Action Plan: https://www.dairynz.co.nz/people/sustainable-dairying-workplace-action- plan/ [accessed on 16 May 2019] ",

The highest number has been recorded in agriculture (14-28 accidents annually with no clear trend), followed by construction (2-9) and forestry (1-10) (Work Safe NZ, 2019). Concerning non-fatal accidents, the highest number occurs in the construction sector, followed by manufacturing and transport, with lower numbers in agriculture and mining (Work Safe NZ, 2019a). However, the total rate of claims related to injuries at work has been decreasing from 154 (per 1,000 Full-Time Equivalent worker) in 2002 to 101 in 2017 for the whole economy. In agriculture, after an increase, from 197 in 2009 to 213 in 2013, a decline has been observed to 186 in 2017 (Stats NZ, 2017b). In 2016, the lowest sectoral rate of trade union membership (around 3 percent) was in agriculture, forestry and fishing (Stats NZ, 2016). The overall number of trade union members decreased by more than half since 1985, with the largest loss (-93.6 percent) recorded in agriculture, forestry and fishing. This was largely due to legislative changes: adoption of the Labour Relations Act 1987, which required unions to have a minimum of 1,000 members (compared to 30 members previously), and the Employment Contracts Act 1991, which abolished the special legal status and representation rights of unions, along with the institutional arrangements which facilitated collective bargaining. Other factors included e.g. rise in short-term and casual jobs (Parliament of New Zealand, 2000). Human rights aspects Both the EU and New Zealand have frameworks in place to enshrine protection of the different human rights. This is explained in detail in section 3.5. The EU has, for example, the Charter of Fundamental rights that recognises explicitly the right to work under its Article 15, while New Zealand recognises and protects human rights under two main legal acts: the New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990 and the New Zealand Human Rights Act 1993. Next to that, New Zealand has an institutional framework in place to promote and monitor protection of human rights. The dairy sector is an important sector for the New Zealand economy, though relatively not as important as ruminant meat (analysed in section 4.1), with 46,000 jobs. Tariffs in the sector are still quite high and there is a range of NTMs that affect two-way trade between the EU and New Zealand (see overall description). The dairy sector is also rural in nature (see Figure 4.6). In the EU the dairy production is spread over 740,000 dairy farms with some concentrations in the EU in for example Ireland and The Netherlands. The FTA\u2019s expected economic impact on the sector is relatively significant, both in the EU and in New Zealand. Hence, it warrants analysing what the potential human rights effects for the sector could be, in particular the right to work , right to health \u2013 including the right to food \u2013 as well as the right to a clean environment . Several characteristics of the dairy sector matter for the human rights analysis: the sector has a high share of SMEs, the sector employs with temporary contracts relatively larger shares of migrant workers and workers from vulnerable groups, and it is a sector that by nature of its activities is concentrated in rural areas. Because of these characteristics, the right to work , the right to an adequate standard of living and working conditions linked to the ILO Core Labour Conventions matter. Also, the impact of the EU-NZ FTA on migrants and vulnerable groups (e.g. indigenous people\u2019s rights) should be looked at in more detail. In this context it is important to note that New Zealand has not yet ratified ILO Core Labour Conventions No. 138 (Minimum Age Convention) and No. 169 (Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention). The focus here is not on New Zealand ratifying these Conventions or not, as this is a domestic policy matter, but whether not having ratified them, the potential effects of the EU-NZ FTA, especially in case of negative (sectoral) effects, could be less effectively mitigated or prompt less action from the government because it has not made these international commitments. In the EU, trade union leaders are focused on promoting and enhancing respect for labour standards , decent working conditions and health and safety at work, equal treatment of workers, (especially relevant for migrant and vulnerable workers), and they also watch closely accidents at work.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 123 | P a g e The right to health and right to food link to the dairy sector in two ways. First the regulatory systems to monitor and enforce the way milk is produced and meet high standards is different in the EU and New Zealand \u2013 insofar this affects the quality of food, the right to health and right to food could be impacted. The other aspect is the impact of the dairy sector on the environment (see also the environmental aspects described below showing the relative size of the environmental footprint of the dairy sector (in particular milk production but also transportation) and thus the right to a clean environment and the right to water because emissions and biodiversity impact could matter. Figure 4.6: Density of dairy cattle by territorial authority in New Zealand (2012) Source: EHINZ Factsheet (2017) Environmental aspects As shown in the sector study on ruminant meat (see section 4.1), GHG emissions from dairy production are about three times lower than GHG emissions from ruminant meat production per 100 grams proteins. Dairy production also has a much lower impact (a factor 6.5 lower) on land use per 100 grams proteins. Both are due to the fact the emissions of a cow due to enteric fermentation and the feed it uses over its lifetime are spread over a much larger amount of protein (form litres of milk and for some extent to meat when it reaches maturity) than for beef cattle that is slaughtered when it reaches maturity. However, the impact of dairy production on climate change and land use is still far above the average impact of food products. Figure 4.7 shows that manure and enteric emissions are indeed the largest contributors to climate change and acidification, whereas eutrophication (impacting water quality) is mainly triggered by the fertilizer use for farm crop production. In terms of air pollution, soil degradation and freshwater use, dairy ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 124 | P a g e production has the biggest environmental footprint of all food products shown in Table 4.1 per 100 grams proteins (Poore & Nemecek, 2019). The pathways through which dairy production creates environmental impacts are very similar to those of ruminant meat production. In terms of GHG emissions, dairy cattle create large amounts of CH 4 emissions (much more than e.g. poultry). As far as for land use, increased land use for dairy farming can go at the costs of natural land and as such negatively affect biodiversity. Moreover, soil quality on land used for dairy farming will deteriorate as a result of increased nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations (e.g. eutrophication emissions). Since dairy cattle often cover a smaller area of land than meat cattle - dairy cattle are more often located in stables than meat cattle \u2013 the impact of increased dairy production on land use is lower than the impact of ruminant meat production. Figure 4.7: Contribution of activities in dairy farming on the environment in Italy Source: Guerci et al, 2013 However, the dairy sector in New Zealand is also characterised by increased intensification of farming, which is a source of competitiveness on an international market (Baskaran, Cullen and Colombo, 2009). The intensification of farming is found in international literature to be positive for the overall environmental impact of the sector in terms of acidification and eutrophication impact per kg of milk and it does not significantly affect climate change impact. However locally at the fewer but intensively farmed sites, the pressures from acidification and eutrophication increase. Whether or not intensification is good or bad therefore depends on the locations (Guerci et al, 2013). In recent years, dairy farming has increased much in size in New Zealand. From 1994 to 2017, the number of dairy cattle increased by 70 percent. As a result, the environmental issues related to dairy farming have also increased. For instance, land use for dairy farming has increased by 42 percent between 2002 and 2016 and the share of nitrate-nitrogen (leading to soil and water quality degradation) leaching from dairy farming increased from 39 percent in 1990 to 65 percent in 2017 (Ministry for the Environment, 2019) though absolute emissions from New Zealand agriculture have remained constant for the last 11 years. 177 The government of New Zealand currently thinks that the limits of growth in the 177 Greenhouse gas emissions by industry and households account 2007-17, Stats NZ.

A number of initiatives have been developed between the New Zealand Government and agricultural industry to reduce agricultural emissions, including a proposal to introduce a farm-level price on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, 179 and the Zero Carbon Act which sets targets for reduced emissions from livestock production to 2050. 180 4.2.2. Economic impact For the EU, total output of dairy is estimated to increase by 0.1 percent under the conservative scenario and to fall by 0.1 percent under the ambitious one, compared to the baseline. For New Zealand, in contrast, the estimated percentage change in total dairy output is -0.8 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, under the two scenarios. The explanation for these results lies in the scenario definitions. In the conservative scenario there is no trade liberalisation in the dairy sector, which means that the dairy sector in New Zealand will not be benefitting from the FTA \u2013 rather resources (e.g. investments, workers) are drawn away from that sector to other sectors that do benefit and grow. From an EU perspective, EU output is not challenged by the New Zealand dairy sector. In the ambitious scenario, market access for New Zealand dairy sector exports to a drop in production in the EU, a rise in production in New Zealand and large increases in trade. Indeed, we find a significant increase in New Zealand\u2019s bilateral exports of dairy to the EU (133.3 percent) under the ambitious liberalisation scenario. Total dairy exports rise by only 0.9 percent, however, indicating the exports to the EU are shifting in from all other \u2013 current \u2013 dairy export markets for New Zealand (especially Australia where New Zealand dairy exports are expected to drop by 12.6 percent). The EU's bilateral exports of dairy to New Zealand rise by 27.2 percent and 29.4 percent under the two scenarios though its total exports of dairy decline (again due to trade diversion, in this case from the intra-EU mainly). Table 4.4: Effects of the EU-NZ FTA on trade and output of the dairy sector Bilateral exports Total exports Output New Zealand Conservative (%) 0.4 -1.0 -0.8 Ambitious (%) 133.3 0.9 0.5 European Union Conservative (%) 27.2 0.2 0.1 Ambitious (%) 29.4 -0.1 -0.1 Source: CGE results provided by DG Trade (2019) The precise extent of the trade impact of TRQs (and possibly even more of their administration) is difficult to calculate for different liberalisation scenarios and a given FTA. A study by the European Commission on the cumulative trade impact of twelve envisaged FTAs, including with Australia and New Zealand, suggests a generally positive overall impact for EU farmers. Of course, the \u201cBali\u201d commitment of WTO Members to review their TRQ administration practices with a view to liberalisation could remove some of the costly procedures involved even for TRQs handled by the exporting country, as is the case for New Zealand\u2019s quota rights under the EU\u2019s dairy TRQs. It goes without saying that an even bigger trade gain would result under an ambitious scenario whereby the EU would return to a single tariff border protection by abolishing the TRQ for countries like New Zealand. Under a conservative scenario, the removal of additional NTM and/or a deepening of the bilateral Veterinary Agreement would be more difficult than under an ambitious scenario with basically all NTBs \u201con the table\u201d. This also depends on the readiness of New Zealand 178 https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11846305 179 https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Legislation/RIS/ria-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions- from-agricultural-sector.pdf 180 https://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate-change/zero-carbon-amendment-act ",

In terms of investments, raising the investment screening ceiling will facilitate EU investments into New Zealand. This has a relative competitiveness improving effect for EU investors vis-\u00e0-vis CPTPP investors in the sector who already have access, while it also leads to more potential growth and development. 4.2.3. Social impact In the EU, employment effects in the sector are expected to be limited and in line with the estimated changes in output, i.e. an employment increase by 0.1 percent for both skilled and unskilled workers under the conservative scenario and a job reduction by 0.1 percent for both groups of workers under the ambitious one, which may be related to the increase in New Zealand\u2019s exports to the EU (by 133.1 percent under the ambitious scenario). For New Zealand, the economic modelling suggests a decline in employment by 0.8 percent for both groups of workers under the conservative scenario, and employment increase by 0.5 for unskilled workers and 0.6 for skilled ones under the ambitious scenario. This is in line with the estimated changes in sectoral output under both scenarios. 181 However, it is to highlight that until 2015, employment in the dairy sector in New Zealand was growing continuously (3.7 percent annually on average). If such a trend was observed in the next few years, the results of the economic modelling would mean a slower job growth in the sector instead of a net job reduction. On the other hand, in case of a declining employment (as in 2016-2017) in the sector in general, the modelled job reduction would add to the observed trend deepening the job loss. Impacts related to changes in wage and price levels have been discussed in the general part of the social analysis (given that economic modelling provides the former only at an aggregated level, i.e. for the whole economy). However, as noted above, wages in the dairy sector in New Zealand have been relatively high (compared to other sub-sectors in agriculture) and growing, hence, the increase predicted by economic modelling would add to that favourable trend. Given limited employment effects of the EU-NZ FTA in the dairy sector, it is rather unlikely that the agreement will bring about noticeable changes in job quality indicators or respect for rights at work (moreover, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any correlation between changes in employment levels and the number of accidents at work in agriculture). These will rather be influenced by domestic factors, such as the new Health and Safety at Work Strategy 2018-2028 or sectoral initiatives, such as Workplace Action Plan, as well as awareness raising among workers and employers. However, if agreed in negotiations, provisions on health and safety at work under the TSD chapter may draw the Parties\u2019 attention to this area and encourage their own actions, as well as bilateral cooperation and dialogue. The EU-NZ FTA should not have any major impact on the situation of migrant workers in the dairy sector (this will rather be influenced by the immigration and visa policy). However, given the predicted increase in output and exports under the ambitious scenario, the EU-NZ FTA may create additional demand for skilled migrant workers given the ageing New Zealand\u2019s workforce and skills shortages among New Zealanders in sector-related areas. One cannot exclude in this context that cases of migrant workers\u2019 exploitation will continue to happen, however, one cannot say either that there will be a direct link between the number of new jobs created by the EU-NZ FTA (part of which may be taken by migrant workers) and the number of cases of workers\u2019 exploitation or violation of different workers\u2019 rights. 181 The caveats made in section 4.1.3 on the simulated employment effects apply. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 127 | P a g e 4.2.4. Human rights impact The trade measures that affect the dairy sector potentially are tariff liberalisation (including changes in TRQs) as well as regulatory alignment (i.e. reductions in NTMs). These trade measures will have the effect of enhancing further the competitiveness of sectors that already are competitive \u2013 allowing them to benefit from increased market access. This economic impact is why also human rights effects are expected to occur though they are not expected to be very large, given the characteristics of the dairy industry (see section 4.2.1 on relevant human rights aspects), and given the human rights frameworks in place in the EU and New Zealand. When we look at the right to work and the right to an adequate standard of living for dairy producers in the EU and New Zealand, we expect positive effects on the right to work for New Zealand in the ambitious scenario. This could also translate into positive effects on the right to an adequate standard of living . As shown in Figure 4.6, the positive effect on these rights is likely to be skewed towards the rural population in New Zealand, positively impacting the relatively poorer areas in New Zealand. If the liberalisation towards the ambitious scenario is the result of the trade negotiations, it could come only over time, so if phased in, these effects could materialise only gradually. It could provide opportunities to also improve working conditions in the sector further, in particular with respect to temporary contracts. The potential TSD chapter of the EU-NZ FTA, including commitments to work towards ratification of the ILO Core Labour Conventions to uphold high labour standards, could have a positive effect on the quality of jobs and working conditions in the dairy sector by encouraging both parties \u201cto promote the highest standards of labour, safety, environmental and consumer protection\u2026\u201d. 182 For the EU dairy sector, the ambitious scenario only leads to a marginal reduction in dairy production, and no negative effect on dairy prices, nor in exports. The impact of the EU-NZ FTA on the right to health in the dairy sector is considered to be minimal. The export growth of EU-NZ milk trade warrants an analysis regarding the quality of milk produced and the regulatory frameworks used to do so safely, but because both countries have very high sanitary standards to guarantee the product\u2019s quality \u2013 though different which leads to trade barriers \u2013 increased milk trade is not expected to have a negative impact on the right to health, especially because the EU and New Zealand already have a veterinary agreement in place. Finally, the issue is whether the right to a clean environment is negatively affected by the EU-NZ FTA. The environmental footprint of the dairy industry is about three times lower than that of the ruminant meat sector and because the relative effect is smaller, the dairy sector impact on the right to a clean environment is much smaller than that of ruminant meat. However, in the ambitious scenario, New Zealand\u2019s production is expected to grow by 0.5 percent, which does lead to an increased negative environmental footprint and thus a negative effect on right to a clean environment . In addition, dairy trade is expected to increase, which increases GHG emissions from transport. And though this effect is small, the direction is negative. 4.2.5. Environmental impact The environmental impact from dairy farming is significant. In particular, dairy farming contributes to climate change due to the emissions of methane (CH 4 ) from enteric fermentation and manure as well as from the emissions embedded in feed. Moreover, water quality is impacted through eutrophication from the run-off of urine and manure (containing nitrogen) and biodiversity can be impacted by land clearing for pasture farming. These impacts are potentially aggravated in New Zealand as a result of the FTA due to the predicted increase in output of up to 0.5 percent. In the ambitious scenario, the EU experiences a similar drop in output of -0.1 percent. In the conservative scenario the effect is reversed. Wherever the impact will occur, the environmental damage is similar. 182 Council of the European Union, Negotiating directives for a Free Trade Agreement with Australia, 7663/18 Add 1 DCL 1, 25 June 2018, p.17, available at: http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-7663- 2018-ADD-1-DCL-1/en/pdf ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 128 | P a g e Whereas the environmental impact areas of the dairy sector are similar to the beef and sheep meat sector, their magnitude is smaller (with an approximate factor of three). Combined with a less dramatic impact of the FTA compared to the beef and sheep meat sector, the environmental impact in the dairy sector is likely to be smaller than in the beef and sheep meat sector. The effect on climate change in both the beef and sheep meat and dairy sectors through the emission of non-GHG emissions of methane and nitrous dioxide are in the overall environmental analysis predicted to increase by 0.509 and 0.133 Mton CO 2 eq. respectively per year from 2030 onwards in the ambitious scenario for the beef and sheep meats and dairy sectors jointly. This represents 1.5 percent of NZ total methane emissions in 2012 and 1 percent of total N 2 O emissions. Since the majority of the growth is predicted to stem from the beef and sheep meat sector in New Zealand, the majority of the predicted impact will hold for this sector. As a result, the overall effect on climate change can be considered to be small, also because dairy farming is conducted more intensely than beef and sheep meat farming. Depending on the scenarios, this effect will occur in either New Zealand or the EU. Even though the location of the emissions might matter for both countries\u2019 national emissions accounting, the environmental impact of GHG emissions is global and thus the overall aggregate environmental impact most relevant. This impact is expected to be slightly negative due to the fact that the FTA will lower costs (by reducing tariffs and NTMs) and thus stimulate consumption and concomitantly production. The FTA will also lead to more trade flows between both countries, but the GHG emissions related to transportation are small compared to those created from the farming process itself. Moreover, the predicted increase in dairy production in New Zealand (in the ambitious scenario) will also lead to increased pressure on water quality in New Zealand since the amount of nitrogen from urine and manure is expected to increase proportionally to the growth in the number of cattle in the ambitious scenario. Since dairy farming is conducted more intensely than beef and sheep meat farming, the overall level of eutrophication is likely to be lower, but the localised impact on water in certain places higher (where farming output will be expanded). Lastly, the impact of the FTA on biodiversity from dairy farming is likely to be minimal due to the relatively minor increase in output due to the FTA and the intensive way of production of dairy. 4.2.6. SME analysis The dairy sector in the EU is largely represented by SMEs. The EU dairy industry partners with around 700,000 dairy farms, all of which work closely along their supply chains. According to the European Dairy Association (2017), more than 80 percent of active dairy companies are SMEs. Additionally, SMEs in the manufacturing of food products sector, which includes dairy, account for 64.6 percent of the employment, whereas large companies employ roughly 35.4 percent (Eurostat, 2010). Value-added generated by SMEs in food manufacturing amounts to 52.1 percent, compared to 47.9 percent by large companies. Five out of the ten world\u2019s largest dairy companies are European: Lactalis, Danone, FrieslandCampina, Arla Foods and M\u00fcller. More than 85 percent of dairy goods produced in the EU are consumed within the EU, but there is a large desire to increase the EU share in global exports (European Dairy Association, 2016). The effects of the EU-NZ FTA are generally positive for EU SMEs. Currently, EU dairy exports are rather limited as EU production costs tend to be higher, and welfare regulations, livestock management standards and SPS regulations are strict. Based on the conducted calculations, the EU dairy sector is expected to increase its exports and output under the conservative scenario (see Table 4.4 above). Thus, based on the sector structure, the high presence of SMEs and the reduction of trade barriers and regulatory requirements under the EU-NZ FTA, one is able to predict that SMEs will benefit directly through exporting more dairy under the FTA through a reduction in market access barriers ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 129 | P a g e and simplified customs procedures. However, as these barriers and extra costs are relatively larger for SMEs compared to large companies due to lower scale and as the dairy sector is comprised of only a few major exporters, SMEs are primarily expected to face modest value chain benefits through dairy output increases under the conservative scenario (see Table 4.4 above). In light of higher exports and a higher level of participation in the international market place for dairy products, higher turnover and growth is to be expected if SMEs are fully taking advantage of the FTA and utilise its required understanding and implementation of rules, provisions and preferences, and through supporting and supplying the larger exporting companies. In regard to employment, the dairy sector will have a modest increase in skilled and unskilled workers under the conservative scenario (see Table 3.15). As SMEs employ the majority of people in the sector an increase in their employment is expected \u2013 this was to be expected as the overall output in the sector increases as well. In New Zealand the importance of SMEs in the dairy sector is also high. Overall, the country\u2019s primary industry is primarily run by SMEs. The dairy sector is a highly vertically integrated global supplier industry with only a few large players. These large companies are also the main exporters of dairy products within the sector. New Zealand has three dairy companies which are co-operatives: Fonterra, Tutua and Westland. Fonterra is the largest one and is owned by more than 10,500 small to medium sized dairy farmers. There are seven further companies exporting dairy products: Goldman Fielder, Open Country, Synlait, Miraka, Yashili, Danone and Oceania Dairy (Beef + Lamb New Zealand, 2018). The effects of the EU-NZ FTA also look quite positive for New Zealand\u2019s SMEs active in the dairy sector. Regarding exports to the EU, the EU currently has imposed relatively low quotas and tariffs on New Zealand dairy products such as cheese (e.g. cheddar and cheese for processing). These regulations are generally more difficult to fulfil by SMEs compared to large enterprises. That said, the obligation to meet various testing, certification and documentation procedures, and SPS requirements implicitly puts potential SME exporters with their in general lower sales volumes at a comparative disadvantage due to the higher impact of the related costs per unit. The calculations, however, project increases in exports and a slight decrease in output under the scenarios (see Table 4.4 above). Based on the higher prevalence of SMEs and their high value-added, one is able to predict that New Zealand SMEs will benefit from the FTA through exporting more dairy under even more facilitated and simplified market access barriers, customs procedures, welfare regulations, livestock management standards and SPS regulations. Additionally, in the occurrence of export increases in the sector and with the presence of several large-scale exporters, active SMEs farmers, suppliers and exporters will benefit indirectly and primarily through value chain benefits. Overall, in light of higher exports and a higher level of participation in the international market place for dairy, higher turnover and growth is to be expected if SMEs are fully taking advantage of the FTA and utilise its required understanding and implementation of rules, provisions and preferences. New Zealand dairy SMEs will also face slight decreases in terms of employment of skilled and unskilled workers under the conservative scenario (see Table 3.15). As SMEs employ the majority of people in the dairy sector a decrease in the industry\u2019s output under the conservative scenario will result in a reduction in employment, requiring SMEs to effectively manage and oversee their resources to fully benefit from the utilisation of the FTA for direct exports and the provision of supplies to the larger exporting firms. 4.2.7. Third country impact Table 4.5 shows the main third country effects for the dairy sector. The effects for Turkey and EU FTA partners are positive but only marginally so (total exports are expected to increase by 0.2 to 0.3 percent). For the Pacific countries the effects of the EU-NZ FTA are negligible (total exports decrease by 0.1 percent). Interestingly, both the EU and New Zealand dairy exports to the Pacific decrease under the scenarios, except under the ambitious scenario where, through larger market opening, the EU exports to New Zealand increase by 0.7 percent \u2013 as a consequence the exports from New Zealand decrease by ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 130 | P a g e 2.4 percent. The results for some of the main competitors for the EU and New Zealand are negligible. Production (except for South Korea under the conservative scenario) and the prices remain unchanged for Korea, Canada, Chin and the US. Similar to the ruminant meat sector, the EU dairy exports reduce for the majority of specified countries and regions. New Zealand\u2019s dairy exports in both the conservative and the ambitious scenarios decrease for all the specified third countries and regions. This effect can be explained by trade diversion to the bilateral EU-New Zealand trade relation resulting from ambitious market opening, away from third countries. Finally, we find that the EU-NZ FTA in dairy does not affect poorer nations in the world (LDCs) negatively. Overall LDC exports increase by 0.3 percent and dairy imports from New Zealand (under the ambitious scenario) are expected to decrease by 3 percent while EU exports to LDCs are expected to go up. Output in LDCs slightly increases by 0.1 percent after the introduction of the FTA.

Competitiveness analysis Economic theory suggests that market integration from an FTA is likely to lead to defragmentation and pro-competitive effects with a fall in mark-ups and subsequent industrial restructuring resulting in bigger, fewer, more efficient firms facing more effective competition from each other. The SME analysis undertaken above suggests that this sector is dominated by SMEs in both the EU and New Zealand. While the dairy market is moderately concentrated in the EU, with a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of 2,230 183 , it is amongst the least competitive sectors in the case of New Zealand (with a profit elasticity, PE, weighted by gross value added, GVA, of -1.42 184 over 2000-2010). The relative absence of competition and large SME representation suggest that the EU-NZ FTA is likely to yield pro-competitive effects, leading to a fall in mark-ups and industrial restructuring especially in the ambitious scenario that entails more meaningful liberalisation of this sector via removal of TRQs. This could result in more efficient firms in this sector in both partner markets facing more effective competition from each other. 4.2.9. Policy recommendations and flanking measures \uf0b7 We recommend that the Parties agree to New Zealand removing the pre-investment screening mechanism for EU investments or at least increase the threshold for the application of the mechanism. This would improve the competitive position of EU investors and benefit the New Zealand economy and lead to more economic growth. 183 http://bruegel.org/wp-content/uploads/imported/publications/WP_2014_07__01.pdf 184 https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/f8aae60a4e/competition-in-new-zealand-industries.pdf; note that a more negative PE score denotes more intense competition. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 131 | P a g e \uf0b7 The Parties should use the opportunity which may be provided by TSD provisions, notably on health and safety at work, to strive towards high levels of labour protection and to pursue dialogue and exchange of good practice, based on experience of individual EU Member States, the EU as a whole and New Zealand in provision of training and raising awareness among workers and employers. If applied, these may help to reduce the number of accidents at work in agriculture, including in the dairy sector. \uf0b7 In case the conservative scenario is followed, New Zealand should monitor employment trends in the dairy sector, in particular if the recent decline continues, in conjunction with potential effects of the EU-NZ FTA. While the expected negative changes under the conservative scenario are limited in general, they may have some impact locally. \uf0b7 Based on results of the economic modelling with predicted employment growth under the ambitious scenario in the dairy sector in New Zealand, it seems likely that at least part of additional jobs may be filled in by seasonal workers (e.g. short-term migrants). In this context, it will be important for New Zealand\u2019s employers to ensure that working conditions for this group of workers are decent and meet the established standards. Labour inspection will need to ensure that cases of migrant workers\u2019 exploitation documented in some studies are prevented and, when they happen, are investigated and addressed. While observance of laws regarding working conditions will be the employers\u2019 obligation, labour inspection and Immigration NZ (supported by information from workers, trade unions, NGOs and others) should identify and address cases of workers\u2019 rights violations. Moreover, measures helping to prevent exploitation of workers, such as information for migrant workers about their rights and banning employers exploiting migrants from employing them in the future should be continued. The Government should also consider granting migrant workers the same or similar protections as enjoyed by other workers in New Zealand. \uf0b7 The impact of the dairy sector on climate change is significant. To the extent that the FTA will create additional demand, also additional GHG emissions will be created. In the case of the ambitious scenario, the EU will \u2018outsource\u2019 the emission creation to New Zealand by importing more dairy products and producing less in the EU (and vice versa in the conservative scenario). The EU and New Zealand \u2013 depending on the final FTA scenario \u2013 should set up a public-private partnership between governments and dairy sector (and beef and sheep meat sector) to mitigate the extent of these extra emissions by working on climate mitigation and adaptation projects in New Zealand, such as for example contributing to the ongoing research on ways to reduce methane emissions in the New Zealand beef and dairy sector, and other measures suggested to reduce emissions (aiming for these sectors to become climate change neutral). \uf0b7 Additional output growth (in the ambitious scenario) in the New Zealand dairy sector will also lead to increased eutrophication, impacting water quality and aquatic biodiversity negatively. The EU and New Zealand should exchange best practices that resulted from the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2014 (New Zealand) and the Water Framework Directive since 2000 (EU), sharing what works, what does not work and have technical experts contribute to the debate \u2013 in order to mitigate the impact of the projected growth of the sector on water quality. 4.3. Machinery 4.3.1. Current situation Economic aspects Trade in machinery products plays an important role in EU-New Zealand trade relations. The EU has shown a steady and rising surplus in its trade of machinery with New Zealand over 2010-2017. In fact, its bilateral exports of machinery to New Zealand have nearly doubled from \u20ac 860 million in 2010 to \u20ac 1.6 billion in 2017, while imports increased from a value of \u20ac 203 million in 2010 to \u20ac 293 million in 2017 (see Figure 4.8). The share of bilateral trade of the machinery sector in the EU's total bilateral trade with New Zealand is high at ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 132 | P a g e just under 40 percent, though its share in EU total trade with the world is only around 0.2 percent. Figure 4.8: EU-New Zealand trade in machinery Source: UNComtrade; own calculations Trade policy measures In 2017, the average applied tariff rate on machinery in the EU on New Zealand's exports was 1.9 percent compared to 0.9 percent for exports from the world. Meanwhile, New Zealand has an applied tariff rate of 2.7 percent on machinery exports from the EU, which is higher than the 1.7 percent tariff on its global imports of machinery. Table 4.6 exhibits a number of NTMs in New-Zealand and the EU applied on imports of machinery products. Although tariffs are already generally low for most of these products, the obligation to fulfil complex customs procedures is a particular obstacle for EU SMEs, and this obstacle would continue to prevail unless tariffs are completely eliminated. Potential economic gains depend to a large extent on the degree of ambition achieved in aligning these NTMs. Other major NTMs include differing product standards, 100 percent container scanning, differences in IPR systems, the EU\u2019s Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, differences in patent systems, different customs and border requirements and electromagnetic compatibility requirements.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 133 | P a g e The EU and New Zealand also have a bilateral agreement for mutual recognition of certain technical certificates, covering inter alia machinery and pressure equipment to facilitate trade by reducing technical barriers. Investment barriers The main (overall) investment barrier that EU investors face in New Zealand \u2013 also for the machinery sector \u2013 relates to stricter investment screening thresholds compared to investors from other countries (e.g. the US, China, and the CPTPP member states) that have already concluded FTAs with New Zealand. In 2005 the Overseas Investment Act entered into force, which regulates foreign investments by foreign natural and legal persons that want to invest in New Zealand with more than 25 percent foreign owned investments. Investments in New Zealand\u2019s sensitive land, significant business assets and fishing quota must obtain consent from the Overseas Investment Office (OIO) before they do so. To gain consent, investments from overseas investors must usually deliver benefits over and above those that a likely New Zealand investor would deliver. These benefits can be economic, such as additional jobs or improved market access, but can also include other benefits. Social aspects In 2015, the European Union machinery industry employed 2.9 million persons. This included such segments of the sector as components specialists, machine manufacturers, equipment and machine system providers, aftersales providers and software providers. It has been operating in a challenging environment, where volatile macroeconomic situation does not support strategic or long-term planning, digitisation strongly influences traditional business models, shorter product lifecycle puts pressure on returns and demands more agility in production and product development. This has an impact on skills requirements, where in addition to diverse engineering skills, companies seek to increase their capability in software design and advanced analytics. In a survey carried out by McKinsey in 2015, many of them recognised attracting and retaining skilled workers as a challenge and as a factor which may hinder competitiveness of European companies. In exchange, they offer attractive development programmes with diverse training proposals, rotation programmes, competitive salaries and flexibility at the workplace (McKinsey, 2016). In 2014, construction, transportation and storage, manufacturing, and agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors together accounted for 67.2 percent of all fatal accidents at work in the EU and 44.9 percent of all non-fatal accidents at work (Eurostat, 2016). The EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2014-2020 stated that while in the preceding years the number of accidents at work decreased due to raising awareness and preventive actions, there was still room for further improvements in implementation of the safety and health at work legislation by the Member States, in particular by micro- small and medium- sized enterprises. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work developed guidance and other online tools for enterprises (European Commission, 2014a). In New Zealand , in 2017, the broad sector of machinery and equipment (including transport, electric and electronic equipment in addition to other types of machinery, equipment and appliances) provided jobs for 36,250 persons (in a more limited scope corresponding with the machinery sector in economic modelling, it offered jobs for 21,850 workers). Between 2007 and 2017, the whole manufacturing sector in New Zealand lost 16,000 jobs (this includes the machinery sector which lost 1,900 jobs, i.e. 0.5 percent of its workforce). For comparison: in the same period, the services sector in New Zealand created 156,000 new jobs and public administration, health care and education provided jointly additional 80,000 jobs. (MBIE, 2018d) The majority of companies in the sector are micro and small enterprises (47.3 percent and 49.4 percent respectively) having either no employees (the first group) or up to 50 of them (the second one). Only 3 percent are medium-sized and large companies employing 50 or more workers. These, however, have an over 50 percent share in the sector\u2019s employment. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 134 | P a g e Wages in manufacturing (i.e. sector broader than machinery) were increasing between 2011 and 2016 and were on average 15 percent higher than in other sectors. However, this may (at least partly) be related to the fact that workers in manufacturing worked more hours per week (39.4) than the average for the whole economy (33.1) (MBIE, 2018d). Due to skills shortages in manufacturing, the recruitment of overseas workers increased in New Zealand, with the number of related visas more than doubling (from 4,187 to 9,469) between 2011 and 2016 (MBIE, 2018d). Concerning job quality and non-fatal accidents at work in New Zealand, the highest number occurs in construction sector, manufacturing and transport (Work Safe NZ, 2019a). However, the total rate of related claims has decreased from 154 (per 1,000 Full-Time Equivalent worker) in 2002 to 101 in 2017 for the whole economy (Stats NZ, 2017b). In 2016, the rate of trade union membership in manufacturing was 20 percent, placing the sector in the middle of the New Zealand\u2019s economy (with values for other sectors ranging from over 40 percent in health care and social assistance, and education and training to around 3 percent in agriculture, forestry and fishing) (Stats NZ, 2016). Human rights aspects Both the European Union and New Zealand have human rights obligations with respect to labour rights that are relevant for workers in the machinery sector (see overview of ratifications for both parties). Trade associations in both Parties at different levels join efforts to promote respect for labour standards, favourable working conditions and health and safety at work. Safety at work is a relative concern for this sector, which is why in the EU, trade union leaders are focused on promoting and enhancing respect for labour standards , decent working conditions and health and safety at work, equal treatment of workers, (especially relevant for migrant and vulnerable workers), and they also watch closely accidents at work. The machinery sector has a challenge to face when it comes to GHG emissions \u2013 and thus the right to a clean environment . For New Zealand, the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 is one of the main documents that establishes guidelines on safe and favourable working conditions in New Zealand. This sector is reported to employ a high share of migrant workers in New Zealand that has doubled between 2011 and 2016 (MBIE, 2018d) (see also social aspects). Environmental aspects The machinery sector is extremely diverse, covering a broad variety of sub-sectors. For EU-New Zealand trade the relevant sub-sectors based on 2015 EU exports to New Zealand (LSE, 2017) include turbo jets, turbo-propellers and other gas turbines (HS 8411); dish washing machines and machinery for cleaning, drying, filling, closing, sealing or labelling containers, bottles, cans, boxes, bags (HS 8422); and harvesting or threshing machinery (HS 8433). All such machinery usually requires a relatively high manufacturing intensity, which subsequently implies high energy consumption and the need for other resources and materials (steel and other ferrous and non-ferrous metals). To illustrate this, Figure 4.9 shows the environmental impact of a standard 12 place setting dishwasher based on a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), where environmental pressures are usually consequential of the production or use phase of the product. Most of the environmental impact is created through the energy use of the appliances, which indirectly creates GHG emissions (depending on the emission profile of electricity production in the country) and thus contributes to climate change. Resource extraction and waste creation are also important. Though other machinery products may not have the same water consumption as a dishwasher, their material use (during production) and energy use (during the use-phase) will likely be similar. ",

Broadly speaking, environmental EU legislation relevant for machinery products is more comprehensive than the New Zealand one. Examples of this include the Ecodesign Directive which ensures all energy related-products 185 meet quality requirements and indicate their compliance via a CE mark 186 and a Declaration of conformity. 187 The New Zealand energy efficiency legal standards only cover certain energy-related products such as household refrigeration appliances, heat pumps, and three-phase cage induction motors 188 . The EU further has the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) Directive and the Directive on Restricting the use of Hazardous Substances in electoral and electronic equipment (RoHS) to mitigate environmental and health pressures by ensuring products do not contain toxic substances 189 of more than 0.1 percent of the product\u2019s weight. New Zealand\u2019s legislation on Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act from 1996 applies more broadly to substances that could be included in all product types, but does not outline particular machinery products (like with the EU\u2019s WEEE legislation) or substance limits. 4.3.2. Economic impact For the EU, total output of machinery is not estimated to change under the conservative scenario and by a marginal 0.1 percent under the ambitious scenario, compared to a situation without the FTA (Figure 4.7); this small relative change is still a significant amount in absolute terms. For New Zealand, in contrast, the estimated percentage change in total machinery output is -0.6 percent and -2.8 percent, respectively, under the two scenarios. The increase in New Zealand\u2019s bilateral machinery exports to the EU under the two scenarios is 9.4 percent and 9.2 percent respectively for the conservative and ambitious scenarios. The EU's bilateral exports of machinery to New Zealand show much larger gains of 19.5 percent and 62.4 percent under the two scenarios (conservative and ambitious). 185 Any product that has an impact on energy consumption during use which is placed on the market, including any parts intended to be used within the energy-related product. 186 Simply a symbol of the letters \u201cCE\u201d placed on the product, denoting the French phrase \u201cConformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne\u201d. 187 As outlined in Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery. 188 New Zealand (2002) Energy Efficiency (Energy Using Products) Regulations 2002.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 136 | P a g e As such this sector is for the EU the single most important one in terms of potential economic effects that could stem from the EU-NZ FTA. Table 4.7: Effects of the EU-NZ FTA on trade and output of the machinery sector Bilateral exports Total exports Output New Zealand Conservative (%) 9.4 0.3 -0.6 Ambitious (%) 9.2 -1.9 -2.8 European Union Conservative (%) 19.5 +0.0 +0.0 Ambitious (%) 62.4 0.3 0.1 Source: CGE results provided by DG Trade (2019) Despite technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures applying to machinery imports in New Zealand, the EU still has a large surplus in its machinery trade with New Zealand, with exports exceeding \u20ac 1 billion. Stringent standards are the main NTM affecting EU machinery exports to New Zealand, liberalisation of which is likely to further increase EU-NZ bilateral exports of machinery. This is also what is observed in the economic impact analysis under the ambitious scenario, which simulates a reduction in NTMs on the EU\u2019s bilateral exports in this sector. In terms of investments, raising the investment screening ceiling will facilitate EU investments into New Zealand. This has a relative competitiveness improving effect for EU investors vis-\u00e0-vis CPTPP investors in the sector who already have access, while it also leads to more potential growth and development. 4.3.3. Social impact Based on the results of the economic modelling, there will be no changes in employment levels in the EU machinery sector under the conservative scenario and a very limited job growth of 0.1 percent for skilled and unskilled workers under the ambitious one. For New Zealand, the economic modelling foresees a likely job reduction of 0.7 percent for both unskilled and skilled workers under the conservative scenario and of 3.4 percent for unskilled and 3.1 percent for skilled workers under the ambitious one. However, the actual effect would depend also on other factors, e.g. total demand for machinery products (and workers in the sector). If the trend of job loss in the sector observed until 2017 continues, then the estimated job reductions resulting from the EU-NZ FTA may add to it, strengthening the negative effect on workforce. For the EU, employment effects (discussed above) are in line with the expected changes in sectoral output and for New Zealand go beyond them under both scenarios (in this case, more pronounced job reductions compared to decline in output may potentially be related to technological changes in the sector, such as automation, and shift from low-skilled jobs to the more advanced ones). Impacts related to changes in wage and price levels have been discussed in the general part of the analysis (given that economic modelling provides estimations for changes in wage levels only for the whole economy, i.e. at an aggregated level). 4.3.4. Human rights impact Results of the economic modelling suggest that there will be no changes in employment levels in the EU machinery sector under the conservative scenario and a marginal job growth of 0.1 percent for skilled and unskilled workers under the ambitious scenario. This means that there will be no impact on the right to work related to employment for the EU workers in this sector. For New Zealand, employment changes suggest a limited negative impact on the right to work (and indirectly, right to an adequate standard of living) for both skilled and unskilled workers (a 0.7 percent employment reduction) under the ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 137 | P a g e conservative scenario. While under the ambitious scenario, the expected negative impact on the right to work (and indirectly, right to an adequate standard of living) is more pronounced, also for both categories of workers (between 3.1 and 3.4 percent employment reduction). 190 In the context of the predicted reduction in employment and taking into account the high share of migrant workers employed in the sector, there is a risk that they may be treated disproportionately negatively. For this reason, New Zealand government may consider strengthening protection of migrant workers in the sector by putting in place a task force that will monitor the situation on the rights of the migrant workers. This is especially relevant due to the fact that New Zealand did not ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families. New Zealand may also propose to only gradually open up the sector to ensure that workers have ample time to find different employ in growing sectors. This should be accompanied by (tested) retraining and job programmes to help workers adjust. Impacts related to changes in wage and price levels (illustrating in more detail the impact on the right to an adequate standard of living) have been discussed in the general part of the analysis (given that economic modelling provides the former only for the whole economy, i.e. at an aggregated level). If agreed in negotiations, provisions on specific vulnerable groups under the TSD chapter could encourage the Parties to take further unilateral actions and pursue bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this area which may have a positive impact on labour rights of the workers from vulnerable population groups involved in this sector and nationwide. 4.3.5. Environmental impact In case of an ambitious FTA, production in the machinery sector is expected to rise by 0.1 percent in the EU and be reduced in New Zealand by 2.8 percent. As such, environmental pressures related to machinery production will be marginally intensified (i.e. the extraction and use of raw materials) in the EU and lowered in New Zealand. The environmental baseline section already described that the bulk of the environmental impacts in the machinery sector are related to climate change and air pollution (from fuel and electricity use in the use and production phases) as well as resource extraction. As regards the impact on climate change , the quantitative analysis conducted for the overall environmental impact analysis predicts a marginal decrease in CH 4 and N 2 O emissions in the machinery, electronic equipment and other manufacture sector in New Zealand (which was analysed as one sector). In the EU, the expected increase in output in the ambitious scenario is expected to lead to a marginal increase in CH 4 and N 2 O emissions in the same broad sector. Given the overall volume of methane and N 2 O emissions in the sector, these impacts are considered very marginal. Most of the climate change impact from the sector is however expected to be created through CO 2 emissions (due to electricity and fuel throughout the life cycle of the products). The ex-ante study already concluded that the CO 2 impacts in the sector are likely small (LSE, 2017). In terms of air pollution, the quantitative environmental analysis also found marginal increases in non-GHG air pollutants for the machinery, electronic equipment and other manufacture sector combined. Beyond this, though, the lowering of tariff and potentially NTBs on imports of machinery equipment into New Zealand could make EU products preferred more often against third party competitors. This does not per se lead directly to environmental impacts, because New Zealand standards to minimum energy performance standards or end-of-life treatment of those products will continue to exist (which apply to all imported products). Still, an impact from the FTA could still be expected if regulatory cooperation between the EU and New Zealand foreseen in the FTA would lead to a further heightening of any environmental standards in either regions, such as for example on the energy efficiency standards of those products, Ecodesign or waste legislation. As explained in the baseline section, the regulatory framework of New Zealand is considered to be less ambitious than 190 See social analysis for relative numbers. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 138 | P a g e the EU\u2019s in these areas. Given the FTA\u2019s principles of countries maintaining their full autonomy and right to regulate on domestic policies, it is unlikely to expect material impact on this front. 4.3.6. SME analysis The machinery sector in the EU is one with a high share of SMEs. According to Eurostat (2016) the machinery consists of approximately 99.2 percent SMEs and 0.8 percent of large companies. Additionally, SMEs active in the sector account for 57.6 percent of the employment, whereas large companies employ roughly 42.4 percent. Despite the high number of SMEs, the value-added large companies contribute is larger than the value- added of SMEs: Large companies account for approximately 58.5 percent and SMEs for 41.5 percent. The expected direct and indirect effects of the EU-NZ FTA are positive for EU SMEs. Based on the conducted calculations, the EU machinery sector is one of the largest gaining sectors under the top 15 gaining sectors in exports under both scenarios, whilst output is projected to increase only slightly (see Table 4.7 above). In addition, New-Zealand regulators require specific product conditions and requirements especially for (electrical) machinery products (see Table 4.6 above for NTMs). Although the difficulty to overcome language differences weighs lower on EU SMEs compared to other export destinations, these regulations are generally more difficult to fulfil by SMEs compared to large enterprises. That said, the obligation to meet various testing, certification and documentation procedures implicitly puts potential SME exporters with their in general lower sales volumes at a comparative disadvantage due to the higher impact of the related costs per unit. Thus, based on the sector structure, the high presence of SMEs and the reduction of trade barriers and regulatory requirements and the introduction of mutual recognition standards and procedures under the EU-NZ FTA, one is able to say that SMEs will benefit directly through exporting more machinery under the FTA. However, as these barriers and extra costs are relatively larger for SMEs compared to large companies due to lower scale and as the machinery sector is comprised of several major exporters, SMEs are primarily expected to face modest value chain benefits through slight machinery output increases under both scenarios (see Table 4.7 above) through supplying products to the large companies. With regard to SMEs and the employment of skilled and unskilled workers, one is able to project a slight increase under the ambitious scenario (see Table 3.15). As SMEs employ the majority of people in the sector an increase in their employment is expected \u2013 this was to be expected as the overall output in the sector slightly increases as well. In New Zealand, SMEs also play an important role in the machinery sector. According to New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (2018), there is only a small limited number of large companies in the manufacturing industry. More specifically, the overall manufacturing sector consists of a total of 300 companies with more than 100 employees, whilst in the machinery and equipment manufacturing sector there are only 51 firms that employ more than 100 people. New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (2018) also states that 3 percent of the firms active in the manufacturing sector employ more than 50 people and that the entire manufacturing industry consists of approximately 49.4 percent of small firms. However, although there is a high number of SMEs in the machinery sector, the main exporters are still the large companies. The effects of the EU-NZ FTA are modest for the majority of New Zealand\u2019s SMEs active in the machinery sector. The calculations project increases in exports but decreases in output under the conservative and ambitious scenario (see Table 4.7 above). Currently, EU regulators require specific product conditions and requirements especially for (electrical) machinery products (see Table 4.6 above for NTMs). Similar as for EU SMEs, these regulations are more difficult to fulfil by SMEs exporters due to their generally lower sales volumes, which causes a comparative disadvantage for SMEs due to the higher impact of the related costs per unit. Based on the higher prevalence of SMEs and their high value- added, one is able to predict that generally New Zealand\u2019s SMEs will benefit from the FTA ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 139 | P a g e through exporting more machinery under even more facilitated and simplified market access barriers and customs procedures. Additionally, the presence of several large-scale exporters requires supplies from active SMEs. Generally, SMEs will thus benefit indirectly through value chain benefits. Overall, in light of higher exports and a higher level of participation in the international market place for machinery, higher turnover and growth is to be expected if SMEs are fully taking advantage of the FTA and utilise its required understanding and implementation of rules, provisions and preferences. In terms of employment, SMEs will also face decreases in terms of employment of skilled and unskilled workers under both scenarios (see Table 3.15). As SMEs employ the majority of people in the machinery sector a decrease in the industry\u2019s output will result in a reduction in employment, requiring SMEs to effectively manage and oversee their resources to fully benefit from the utilisation of the FTA for direct exports and the provision of supplies to the larger exporting firms. 4.3.7. Third country impact Table 4.8 shows the main third country effects for the machinery sector. Turkey will only marginally be affected, but New Zealand\u2019s exports there are predicted to increase as a result of the EU-Turkey customs union for industrial goods, which implies that Turkey\u2019s tariffs will also be eliminated under the EU-NZ FTA. The effects for EU FTA partners are negative but only marginal: the EU FTA partners will see a decrease of -0.1% in machinery output and total exports, and slightly reduce their imports from the EU and New Zealand. For the Pacific countries the EU-NZ FTA has a slightly negative impact for the machinery sector: production goes down marginally (-0.4 percent in the ambitious and -0.1 percent in the conservative scenario), and so do the islands\u2019 total machinery exports \u2013 a consequence of the increase in New Zealand\u2019s competitiveness in the region, and as a result of a stronger motor vehicle and transport equipment sector for the Pacific countries, which draws away resources. The effects for the main EU and New Zealand competitors (South Korea Japan, China and the US) are negligible. Finally, we find that the EU-NZ FTA in machinery does not affect poorer nations in the world (LDCs) negatively.

Competitiveness analysis Economic theory suggests that market integration from an FTA is likely to lead to defragmentation and pro-competitive effects with a fall in mark-ups and subsequent industrial restructuring resulting in bigger, fewer, more efficient firms facing more effective competition from each other. The SME analysis undertaken above suggests that this sector is dominated by SMEs in both the EU and New Zealand. The machinery market shows a high degree of competition in the ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 140 | P a g e EU, with a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of 979 191 , and also in New Zealand (with a profit elasticity, PE, weighted by gross value added, GVA, of -3.20 192 over 2000-2010). The relatively competitive market structure and large SME representation suggest that the EU-NZ FTA could yield further pro-competitive effects, leading to a fall in mark-ups and industrial restructuring especially in the ambitious scenario that entails more meaningful liberalisation of this sector via a 10 percent reduction in NTM AVEs on EU\u2019s bilateral exports. This could result in even more efficient firms in this sector in both partner markets facing more effective competition from each other. 4.3.9. Policy recommendations and flanking measures \uf0b7 Trends in the machinery sector both in the EU and New Zealand suggest that future jobs (whether new or the existing ones) may be related with new skills requirements such as engineering skills, software design and advanced analytics. Therefore, for the expected limited job growth (in the EU) to materialise, EU institutions and Member States should work with industry and training providers to create a training offer, which would equip workers with the right skills set and enable them to continue or to start working in the sector. In New Zealand, a well-designed training offer may help to maintain or improve competitiveness of the sector and support employability of local workers and their competitiveness (given that currently, due to skills shortages, recruitment needs to focus on overseas candidates). \uf0b7 New Zealand and the EU should discuss whether it would be feasible to gradually open up the machinery sector to ensure that companies and workers have sufficient time to adapt e.g. for businesses to diversify to other markets or sectors and for workers to upskill or find employment in other sectors. This should be accompanied domestically in New Zealand by (tested) retraining and job programmes to help workers adjust. \uf0b7 The scale and speed of change in the machinery sector in New Zealand will need to be monitored by the industry itself (by reporting the number of jobs created and lost over time or the number of workers employed) the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Stats NZ. If job reductions occur (as a result of the EU-NZ FTA), workers should receive support to help them adapt (e.g. via training, career advice, an opportunity to participate in a job fair or to set up an own company). \uf0b7 Regarding the mitigation of environmental impact, no specific flanking measures are proposed given the marginal output increases expected in the sector, implying the climate change, air pollution and resource extraction impacts are expected to be limited. The most significant environmental impact created of machinery is through its energy use in the use phase. Energy efficiency policy in New Zealand is however considered to be less ambitious than in the EU. Therefore, any regulatory cooperation foreseen in the FTA could focus on exchanging best practice standards and increasing the ambition in New Zealand\u2019s energy efficiency policy, while respecting their domestic right to regulate. \uf0b7 The Parties are encouraged to agree to the removal of the New Zealand pre-investment screening mechanism for EU investments or at least agree to raise of the threshold for the application of the mechanism. This would improve the competitive position of EU investors. For example, raising the threshold to \u20ac 516 million, which is already applicable to non-governmental investors from Australia at this moment. 4.4. Motor vehicles and transport equipment 4.4.1.

The share of bilateral trade in the sector in the EU's total bilateral trade with New Zealand is high at around 30 percent, though its share in EU total trade with the world is only around 0.2 percent. Figure 4.10: EU-New Zealand trade in motor vehicles and transport equipment Source: UNComtrade; own calculations Trade policy measures In 2017, the average applied tariff rate on motor vehicles and transport equipment in the EU on imports from New Zealand was 4.0 percent compared to 1.7 percent for imports from all other countries in the world (on average).

Table 4.9 summarises a number of regulations in New Zealand and the EU applied on imports of transport equipment.

However, there is no MRA between EU-NZ covering this sector. Investment barriers The main (overall) investment barrier EU investors face in New Zealand \u2013 also for the motor vehicle and transport equipment sector \u2013 relates to stricter investment screening thresholds compared to investors from other countries (e.g. the US, China, and the CPTPP member states) that have already concluded FTAs with New Zealand. The 2015 Overseas Investment Act regulates investments by foreign natural and legal persons that want to invest in New Zealand with more than 25 percent foreign owned investments. Investments in New Zealand\u2019s sensitive land, significant business assets and fishing quota must obtain consent from the Overseas Investment Office before they do so. To gain consent, investments from overseas investors must usually deliver benefits over and above those that a likely New Zealand investor would deliver. These benefits can be economic, such as additional jobs or improved market access, but can also include other benefits. Social aspects In 2016, the European Union automotive industry employed in total around 13.3 million persons (out of which 3.4 million were high-skilled). The total included direct and indirect (3.4 million) jobs in manufacturing, automobile use 193 (4.4 million), transport (4.8 million) and infrastructure (0.7 million). This was an increase since 2012, when around 12.4 million people worked in this sector. 194 Automotive industry has been facing skills shortages due to dynamic technological changes (e.g. an increasing importance of software and electronics engineering skills, advanced data analytics or artificial intelligence) and the related need for workforce adaptation, moreover, poor perception of the manufacturing sector by skilled youth, ageing workforce and diverging approaches taken by education systems. There has been an acknowledged need to create a framework of standard job roles with associated skills requirements (to increase the understanding of available opportunities in the sector), improve mobility of workforce across the value chain and transferability of competences, create a better functioning EU apprenticeship market and improve the recognition of non-formal / informal learning. Moreover, it is necessary to address workforce-related needs of SMEs operating in the sector. In 2018, a four-year EU project, Development and Research on Innovative Vocational Education Skills (DRIVES), was launched with a view to delivering human capital development solutions for the automobile industry along its value chain. (European Commission, 2019a) Another project initiated in 2019 focuses on upskilling and reskilling strategies for SMEs in the automotive industry (European Commission, 2019b). According to analysis based on megatrends in the sector, in the coming years the number of direct and indirect jobs in automotive manufacturing in the EU may decrease as a result of influence of such factors as automation (may bring about job reduction in the region of 0.4 million, with a shift from low-skilled towards high-skilled jobs) and electrification (0.3 million jobs less by 2030 due to lower complexity and a higher degree of automation in production of alternative powertrains compared to engines). On the other hand, connected and autonomous vehicles may contribute to creation of 0.4 million new jobs for software specialists. However, their current shortage, if persists, may prevent this opportunity from materialising and impair competitiveness of the European automotive industry. Moreover, new jobs may be created in mobility services and data-enabled business models, as well as in other related areas, e.g. infrastructure (e.g. charging, grid, 5G, and control towers), energy (e.g. renewables and alternative fuels) and chemicals (e.g. advanced materials and battery cell chemistry) (McKinsey & Company, 2019). 193 Automobile use is defined in this context as sale, maintenance and repair of motor vehicles, sale of vehicle parts, accessories and fuel, as well as renting and leasing motor vehicles.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 143 | P a g e In 2015, the automotive industry in New Zealand provided 64,852 jobs in manufacturing and 9,560 in repair and maintenance. This was a 3 percent increase compared to previous year and it was expected that the workforce will remain stable in the few following years (until 2020). 82 percent of enterprises in the sector were micro-businesses employing on average 4.4 workers. Men constituted the vast majority of workers in both sub-sectors (86 percent in manufacturing and 92 percent in repair and maintenance) (MITO, 2016). Fast-paced technological, policy and legislative changes, and ageing workforce represent challenges for the automotive sector, which \u2013 at least partly \u2013 can be addressed through provision of training and development of new skills related to production and maintenance of electric cars and those on biofuels, intelligent transport systems, e-commerce and other services provided through internet. Training providers suggest in this context consideration of a few components of a skills development strategy, including an offer for youth (transition from school to vocational training or apprenticeships), provision of continuous, flexible learning enabling workers to keep up with technological changes, an increased participation of employers in formalised industry training, as well as promotion of best practices in human capital development (MITO, 2016). Wages in manufacturing (i.e. sector broader than motor vehicles) were increasing between 2011 and 2016 and were on average 15 percent higher than in other sectors in total. However, this may (at least partly) be related to the fact that workers in manufacturing worked more hours per week (39.4) than the average for the whole economy (33.1) (MBIE, 2018d). Due to skills shortages in manufacturing, the recruitment of overseas workers increased in New Zealand, with the number of related visas more than doubling (from 4,187 to 9,469) between 2011 and 2016 (MBIE, 2018d). Concerning job quality and non-fatal accidents at work in New Zealand, the highest number occurs in construction sector, manufacturing and transport (Work Safe NZ, 2019a). However, the total rate of related claims has been decreasing from 154 (per 1,000 Full- Time Equivalent worker) in 2002 to 101 in 2017 for the whole economy. The same indicator for manufacturing (i.e. a sector broader than motor vehicles) has been fluctuating between 2009 and 2017 with numbers between 151 and 166, where an increase has been observed every second year followed by a decrease in the number of claims. Hence, there is no clear correlation between the number of jobs in the sector and the number of non-fatal accidents and related claims (Stats NZ, 2017b). In 2016, the rate of trade union membership in manufacturing was 20 percent placing the sector in the middle of the New Zealand\u2019s economy (with values for other sectors ranging from over 40 percent in health care and social assistance, and education and training to around 3 percent in agriculture, forestry and fishing) (Stats NZ, 2016). Human rights aspects Both the EU and New Zealand have human rights obligations with respect to labour rights that are relevant for the workers in the automotive industry sector (see overview of ratifications for both parties). Trade associations in both parties at different levels join efforts to promote respect for labour standards, favourable working conditions and health and safety at work. The motor vehicles and transport equipment sector is very important for the EU and less so for New Zealand. As with the machinery sector (the other manufacturing industry we analyse) New Zealand\u2019s geography and market size are not attractive for reaping economies of scale in the automotive industry. The automotive and transport equipment sector is very globalised with a range of very large players operating in an oligopolistic market, but also with a wide range of larger and smaller suppliers (i.e. SMEs) in their complex global value chains. Because New Zealand is to some extent part of this value chain, and with employment in the sector growing, strengthening its participation is important. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 144 | P a g e The motor vehicles and transport equipment sector has a large challenge to face when it comes to GHG emissions \u2013 which for 80 percent come from the use-phase of the vehicles. In addition, there are currently no standards provided by New Zealand on CO 2 emissions from motor vehicles, which means that fuel efficiency in New Zealand is much lower than in the EU (per km). Increased production, trade and demand (i.e. driving) for motor vehicles would therefore have the potential to negatively affect the right to a clean environment . Environmental aspects The sector\u2019s environmental impacts are predominantly accrued over the use-phase of the vehicles it produces (roughly 80 percent of their environmental pressure), as shown in Figure 4.11 (Martinuzzi, 2011). The environmental pressures caused by the sector are mostly from energy consumption and GHG emissions. This causes additional indirect pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity (primarily via acidification and eutrophication). In 2016, motor vehicle emissions contributed to around 20 percent of total EU GHG emissions (EEA, 2018). New Zealand road transport made up 17.9 percent of total GHG emissions in 2017 (Ministry for the environment, 2019). Additionally, the sector contributes to resource use, waste production, and water consumption (JRC, 2017) during its manufacturing and end of life stages. It has been estimated that the End-of-Life Vehicle (ELV) phase, makes up another 10 percent of the sector\u2019s environmental pressures. Therefore, product design and efficiency (using light-weight reusable materials, improving fuel efficiency, inventing new energy sources, using non-toxic chemicals, electrification and automation etc.) plays a key role in the sustainability in this sector. The EU automotive sector achieves these advances through its large investments into automotive R&D of \u20ac 53.9 billion per year, making up 5 percent of the sectors total turnover. 195 Recently the Volvo Group, along with DAF, Daimler, Iveco, MAN and Scania have been developing smart technology to allow multi-brand automated heavy vehicle platooning in Europe. Platooning will improve fuel economy, CO 2 emissions, as well as road safety. 196 Figure 4.11: Share of life cycle impacts for a petrol car (% shares per life cycle stage) Source: JRC (2017) Best Environmental Management Practice for the Car Manufacturing Sector. The main differences between the EU and New Zealand in the legislative landscape of motor vehicles and environmental standards are outlined in Table 4.10. Most importantly, there are currently no standards provided by New Zealand on CO 2 emissions from motor vehicles. In practice this means that the average fuel efficiency of EU vehicles was 121.6g CO 2 /km (petrol) and 117.9g CO 2 /km (diesel) in 2017 197 , whereas for New Zealand it was 164.8g 195 See https://www.acea.be/industry-topics/tag/category/research-and-innovation for more information 196 For more information on European platooning see https://www.volvogroup.com/en- en/news/2018/feb/truck-platooning-on-european-roads.html. 197 See https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/no-improvements-on-average-co2.

There is no requirement in the country to recycle ELV and once deregistered, a vehicle can stay on private or public property indefinitely without penalty. Furthermore, to deregister the car no proof of whereabouts is required from the owner.

For New Zealand, the estimated percentage change in total output of motor vehicles is -1.3 percent and -2.7 percent, respectively, under the two scenarios. The rise in New Zealand\u2019s bilateral exports of motor vehicles to the EU under the two scenarios expected to be 12.3 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively (in contrast, its total exports of motor vehicles will decline under both scenarios). The EU's bilateral exports of motor vehicles to New Zealand are expected to increase by 22.2 percent and 43.0 percent under the conservative and ambitious scenarios respectively.

This is also what is observed in the economic impact analysis especially under ambitious scenario, which simulates a reduction in NTMs in New Zealand affecting EU\u2019s bilateral exports. In terms of investments, raising the investment screening ceiling will facilitate EU investments into New Zealand. This has a relative competitiveness improving effect for EU investors vis-\u00e0-vis CPTPP investors in the sector who already have access, while it also leads to more potential growth and development. Case Study 4.1: Aluminium Current situation Currently, New Zealand has a small number of heavy industry sectors which were established by the government or with the aid of the government in order to exploit abundant natural resources. One of these sectors is aluminium smelting under New Zealand\u2019s Aluminium Smelter \u2013 the country\u2019s sole smelter situated in Southland. Aluminium represents one of the major primary manufacturing processes for local consumption and exports in New Zealand. In 2017, New Zealand\u2019s aluminium smelting industry directly employed 900 people and indirectly employed 3,200 people and produced approximately 337,016 tonnes. Out of this manufactured and saleable aluminium, the sector was able to create export earnings of \u20ac 772 million. The sector accounts for 2.2 percent of New Zealand\u2019s exports and 22 percent of Southland\u2019s exports. The GDP benefits for the Southland region in 2017 were estimated to be at \u20ac 307 million. Figure CS4.1-1 below shows the location of the New Zealand Aluminium Smelter. Overall, New Zealand exported 89 percent of the produced aluminium to a total of 20 countries: Brazil, China, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, Romania, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US and Vietnam. The major demand driver for New Zealand\u2019s aluminium smelting sector is Asian countries. In 2018, 58 percent of the exported aluminium was imported by Japan at a value of \u20ac 403.2 million. South Korea imports amounted to \u20ac 110.9 million. The largest EU importer was the Netherlands with \u20ac 31.3 million. Figure CS4.1-1: New Zealand Aluminium Smelter in the Southland region within New Zealand Source: Southland New Zealand (2019) Currently, the EU itself accounts for 8 percent in global aluminium production with 14 smelters in ten countries (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden). In 2017, the EU exported a total of \u20ac 11.9 billion, out of which \u20ac 2.1 billion was imported by Switzerland, \u20ac 1.8 billion by the US and \u20ac 847.3 million by China. In the past however, the EU used to be self-sufficient in aluminium, but today the region imports more than 6 million ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 147 | P a g e tonnes of aluminium ingot, which represents around 50 percent of the overall required amount. The EU imports primarily from Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Mozambique. Aluminium has a large environmental footprint. To start with, aluminium production is an extremely energy intensive process; about nine times more energy intensive than steel production (Rankin, 2012). Around 80% of the GHG emissions related to aluminium production are created by energy use (Australian aluminium council, 2019). Globally, aluminium production accounts for roughly 1% of the total GHG emissions. Aside from (in)direct CO2 emissions, aluminium production can create significant amounts of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) emissions which have a much higher (more than a thousand times) global warming potential than CO2. Aside from climate change, aluminium production requires large amounts of (fresh) water and can negatively impact soil and water quality through hazardous waste. New Zealand's Aluminium Smelters is claimed to have one of the lightest carbon footprints per ton aluminium (NZAS, 2015). The smelter is responsible for about 13% of the country\u2019s electricity consumption (Devlin and McCarthy, 2015) and creates about 0.5 megaton of direct CO2 emissions (i.e. without the indirect emissions from electricity consumption) which accounts for about 1.5% of New Zealand\u2019s CO2 emissions (greens.org, 2016). In recent years, one incident took place through which large amounts of toxic waste were found in the surroundings of the smelter (Heron, 2018). Potential FTA effects Within the framework of the economic modelling, we have conducted a Global Simulation (GSIM) analysis (see Annex II for a methodological description) to detail the potential effects for aluminium. We did not reduce tariffs because \u2013 except for the ROW \u2013 these were already at zero percent, but we did assume a marginal reduction in NTMs due to more alignment between the EU and New Zealand, including further alignment in other sectors that use aluminium as inputs. We find that the economic effects are positive for New Zealand and the EU27 in terms of welfare (see Table CS4.1-1), while the gains in these countries is more for consumers of aluminium (in the form of lower prices) \u2013 i.e. industries using aluminium as inputs for manufacturing machinery and equipment. Overall, the effects are not large in terms of order and magnitude. New Zealand will face gains of \u20ac 1.3 million and the EU27 of \u20ac 1.1 million. Trade diversion primarily hurts Japanese consumers of aluminium. In terms of output not much change is expected. This was expected as the EU27 and New Zealand are not each other\u2019s main trading partners with respect to aluminium. Table CS4.1-2 shows changes in bilateral trade in aluminium as a consequence of the EU-NZ FTA. We see roughly that the increase in New Zealand aluminium exports to the EU27 is diverted from Japan, at the expense of Chinese and ROW exports to the EU27 \u2013 who in turn will divert exports to Japan. The total global trade effect of the EU-NZ FTA on aluminium trade is an increase of \u20ac 74.2 million.

The aluminium sector\u2019s market structure is characterised by very large firms that make heavy and long-term investments and that do not contain many SMEs \u2013 so no SME effect is envisaged. Also, from a human rights angle, no impact is foreseen. From an environmental perspective, the increase in trade could have a negative effect on CO\u2082 emissions. The increased trade between New Zealand and the EU is expected to cause additional environmental impacts through the emissions related to transportation (even though most is of the increased trade between the EU and New Zealand is trade diversion, the large distance between the EU and New Zealand can still cause additional GHG emissions). Because the increase in New Zealand production is very small (0.1 percent), environmental effects around the smelter resulting from the EU NZ FTA are considered negligible. There could be a small impact on competitiveness of downstream industries because consumer prices (i.e. prices for aluminium consumers, which is downstream industry) decrease marginally in New Zealand.

Hence, it is recommended that the EU and New Zealand further align NTMs (i.e. increased coherence and convergence between the two country\u2019s respective regulatory systems). 4.4.3. Social impact Based on the results of the economic modelling, the motor vehicles sector in the EU is likely to experience job creation of 0.2 percent for both groups of workers under the conservative scenario and 0.3 percent under the ambitious one. While these changes are limited if compared to the number of workers in the sector in the EU, locally they may bring about some relief against expected job reductions to be caused by technological changes, such as automation. However, new jobs may be related with new skills requirements, which in turn may create a need for provision of training for existing and new workers. Positive changes may become more pronounced if similar effects of several FTAs cumulate. For New Zealand, the economic modelling foresees a likely job reduction of 1.5 percent for unskilled workers and 1.4 percent for skilled ones under the conservative scenario and of 3.2 percent and 3.0 percent respectively under the ambitious scenario. However, the actual net effect would depend also on other factors, e.g. the total demand for cars in New Zealand and export markets. If, thanks to these factors, the sector grows in the next few years, then the net effect of the EU-NZ FTA may be closer to a slower job growth rather than to a net job reduction. 205 Impacts related to changes in wage and price levels have been discussed in the general part of the analysis (given that economic modelling provides estimations for changes in wage levels only for the whole economy, i.e. at an aggregated level). 4.4.4. Human rights impact Results of the economic modelling suggest employment creation in the EU motor vehicles and transport equipment sector (0.2 percent for both groups of workers under the conservative scenario and 0.3 percent under the ambitious one). This means that the right to work (and the right to an adequate standard of living ) of the workers employed in this sector is expected to be positively affected as a result of the EU-NZ FTA. This positive impact may become more pronounced if similar effects of other FTAs (e.g EU-Mercosur, CETA) accumulate. For New Zealand, employment changes suggest a modest negative impact on the right to work (and indirectly, right to an adequate standard of living) for both skilled and unskilled workers (1.4 and 1.5 percent employment reduction respectively) under the conservative scenario. Under the ambitious scenario, the negative effect is expected to be more 205 Also note the methodological caveats made in section 4.1.3 on the simulated employment effects. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 149 | P a g e pronounced negative impact on the right to work (and, indirectly, right to an adequate standard of living) also for both categories of workers (between 3.0 and 3.2 percent employment reduction). 206 In the context of predicted reductions in employment and taking into account a relatively high share of migrant workers employed in the sector, there is a risk that they may be treated negatively in a disproportionate way. For this reason, the New Zealand government may consider strengthening protection of migrant workers in the sector by putting in place a task force that will monitor the situation on the rights of the migrant workers. This is especially relevant due to the fact that New Zealand did not ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families. Prices for motor vehicles and transport equipment are expected to drop by 1.3 percent. This is one of the more significant sectoral price effects that would benefit consumers of cars in New Zealand and downstream industries for transport equipment (e.g. the local communities buying buses or other transport equipment). If agreed in negotiations, provisions on specific vulnerable groups under the TSD chapter could encourage the Parties to take further unilateral actions and pursue bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this area which may have a positive impact on labour rights of the workers from vulnerable population groups involved in this sector and nationwide. 4.4.5. Environmental impact The increase in net motor vehicle production results in increased environmental pressures from the production phase, having minor impacts on resource depletion and bulk waste. However, due to the on average higher fuel efficiency (CO 2 /km) of EU cars, there is potential for the FTA to lower the climate change impact in the road transportation sector in New Zealand in case car manufacturers in the EU sell the same cars in New Zealand as in the EU. If this is the case, it can be expected that an increase in motor vehicle trade will lead to a minor decrease in the New Zealand motor vehicle sector\u2019s CO 2 emissions (in regard to the products\u2019 use phase). This is similar for the motor vehicle sector\u2019s toxic air pollution. The EU\u2019s higher standards (Euro 6/VI) compared to New Zealand ones (Euro 4/IV and above) may influence more exports of old EU Euro 5/V and lower standard vehicles to New Zealand. This would simultaneously increase the standards of both the EU (with fewer Euro 5/V vehicles and less in its fleet) and New Zealand (where the majority of the fleet has standards lower than Euro 4 207 ). An impact from the FTA could also be expected if regulatory cooperation between the EU and New Zealand foreseen in the FTA would lead to a further heightening of any environmental standards in either regions, such as for example on Euro, CO 2 , or ELV standards (as mentioned in the previous subsection). However, given the FTA\u2019s principles of countries maintaining their full autonomy and right to regulate on domestic policies, no material impact is expected on this front. Since the overall quantitative environmental analysis could not single out the car manufacturing sector, no detailed climate change and air pollution impacts through CH 4 and N 2 O emissions are available for the sector. However, since the expected impact on output in the EU in the sector is predicted to be small (+0.2 to +0.3 percent), the associated increase in environmental impacts due to production in the sector is expected to be limited as well. 4.4.6. SME analysis The motor vehicles and transport equipment sector in the EU is also largely represented by SMEs. According to Eurostat (2010) the sector consists of approximately 96.1 percent SMEs and 2.0 percent large companies. Additionally, SMEs active in the sector account for 54.5 percent of the employment, whereas large companies employ roughly 45.6 percent. 206 See social analysis Table 3.15 for relative numbers. 207 In 2017 around 30% of New Zealand vehicles were Euro 4/IV or the similar Japanese 2005 standard. Only 8-16% were Euro 5/V or the Japanese 2009 standards. See https://www.transport.govt.nz/mot- resources/vehicle-fleet-statistics/#annual. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 150 | P a g e Despite the high number of SMEs in the sector, they contribute a value-added of 45.5 percent, whereas large companies contribute 54.5 percent. Overall, the effects of the EU-NZ FTA on EU SMEs seem positive. Based on the conducted calculations, the EU motor vehicles and transport equipment sector is one of the largest gaining sectors in terms of exports under both scenarios (see Table 4.11 above). Although tariffs are already generally low for most of these products, the obligation to fulfil complex customs procedures is an obstacle. Particular obstacle for EU SMEs, and this obstacle would continue to prevail even if tariffs are completely eliminated. In addition, New Zealand\u2019s regulators require specific product conditions and requirements especially for (electrical) machinery products (see Table 4.9 and Table 4.10). Although the difficulty to overcome language differences weights much lower on EU SMEs compared to other export destinations, these regulations are generally more difficult to fulfil by SMEs compared to large enterprises. That said, the obligation to meet various testing, certification and documentation procedures implicitly puts potential SME exporters with their in general lower sales volumes at a comparative disadvantage due to the higher impact of the related costs per unit. Accordingly, EU SMEs would generally benefit from a comprehensive FTA between the EU and Australia that aims for greater degrees of mutual recognition of standards and procedures and harmonisation in cases where standards are equivalent. Thus, based on the sector structure, the high presence of SMEs and the reduction of trade barriers and regulatory requirements under the EU-NZ FTA, one can expect that SMEs will benefit directly through exporting more motor vehicles and transport equipment under the FTA. On the other hand, the high value-added of large firms in the sector implies that the majority of exports is conducted via large firms. In that regard, and as large firms are able to cope with the current regulations and requirements more easily, supplier SMEs are expected to face value chain benefits through machinery output increases under both scenarios (see Table 4.11 above). Regarding employment, the sector is expected to have a modest increase in skilled and unskilled workers under both scenarios (see Table 3.15). As SMEs employ the majority of people in the sector an increase in their employment is expected \u2013 this was to be expected as the overall output in the sector increases as well. These trends are in light with the EU\u2019s projects, e.g. the DRIVES project, aimed at delivering human capital development solutions for the automobile industry along its value chain (European Commission, 2019a) and upskilling and reskilling strategies for SMEs in the automotive industry (European Commission, 2019b). Similar as in New Zealand\u2019s machinery manufacturing sector, the motor vehicles and transport equipment sector is also a large industry represented by SMEs. According to New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (2018), 3 percent of the firms active in the manufacturing sector employ more than 50 people. The entire industry consists of approximately 49.4 percent of small firms. The sector consists of 78 firms with 50 to 99 employees and 51 firms with 100 or more employees. New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (2018) also states that although there is a high representation of SMEs in the machinery sector, the main exporters are still the large companies. The effects of the EU-NZ FTA look modest for New Zealand\u2019s SMEs active in the motor vehicles and transport equipment sector. The calculations project increases in bilateral exports but decreases in output under the conservative and ambitious scenario (see Table 4.11 above). In addition, EU regulators require specific product conditions and requirements for automotive products. These regulations are generally more difficult to fulfil by SMEs compared to large enterprises. The requirement to fulfil testings, certifications and further documentation procedures implicitly puts potential SME exporters with their in general lower sales volumes at a comparative disadvantage due to the higher impact of the related costs per unit. Based on the country\u2019s motor vehicles and transport equipment sector structure, the high presence of SMEs and the reduction of trade barriers and further regulatory requirements and the introduction of mutual recognition systems ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 151 | P a g e and procedures under the EU-NZ FTA, New Zealand\u2019s motor vehicles and transport equipment sector SMEs will benefit primarily through value chain benefits, caused through higher exports under the EU-NZ FTA. The opening of markets through FTAs reduces the requirement to process and meet the different regulatory requirements and establishes mutual recognition systems, which will benefit SMEs as they are able to reallocate their resources more efficiently to support the large exporting companies. Furthermore, New Zealand\u2019s SMEs will also face decreases in terms of employment of skilled and unskilled workers under both scenarios (see Table 3.15). As SMEs employ the majority of people in the motor vehicles and transport equipment sector a decrease in the industry\u2019s output will result in a reduction in employment, requiring SMEs to effectively manage and oversee their resources to fully benefit from the utilisation of the FTA. 4.4.7. Third country impact Table 4.12 shows the main third country effects for the motor vehicles and transport equipment sector. For Turkey, sector output increases slightly in both scenarios, and New Zealand\u2019s exports there are predicted to increase as a result of the EU-Turkey customs union for industrial goods, which implies that Turkey\u2019s tariffs will also be eliminated under the EU-NZ FTA. The effects for EU FTA partners are positive but only to a limited extent (total exports are expected to remain unchanged). However, New Zealand\u2019s and EU\u2019s exports to the EU FTA partners are expected to slightly decrease under both scenarios. For the Pacific Countries the EU-NZ FTA is positive in motor vehicles and transport equipment: their output is expected to increase under the ambitious scenario (0.6 percent), and so do the islands\u2019 total motor vehicles and transport equipment exports (0.8 percent). This leads for the Pacific Countries to economic adjustment between motor vehicles and transport equipment (the growing sector) and machinery (the declining sector \u2013 see previous sector analysis). The ASEAN region will produce less under both scenarios, following the implementation of the EU-NZ FTA. The region\u2019s imports from the EU and New Zealand will decline, and overall exports will go down by 0.7 percent. From the main EU and New Zealand competitors, South Korea suffers relatively most (-0.4 percent reduction in production) while also for the other three countries, imports of motor vehicles and transport equipment from the EU and New Zealand decrease. Overall, Korean exports to the world decrease by 0.6 percent. The overall export effects for Japan, China and the US are negative but not very high. Due to trade diversion, New Zealand exports of motor vehicles and transport equipment to third countries decline in both the conservative and the ambitious scenario. Finally, we find that the EU-NZ FTA in motor vehicles and transport equipment does not affect poorer nations in the world (LDCs, Pacific Countries) negatively.

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 152 | P a g e 4.4.8. Competitiveness analysis Economic theory suggests that market integration from an FTA is likely to lead to defragmentation and pro-competitive effects with a fall in mark-ups and subsequent industrial restructuring resulting in bigger, fewer, more efficient firms facing more effective competition from each other. The SME analysis undertaken above shows that SMEs play an important role in this sector both the EU and New Zealand. The motor vehicles and transport equipment market is not very concentrated in the EU, with a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) ranging from 1,231 208 for motor vehicles to 1,641 for other transport equipment, and in New Zealand (with a profit elasticity, PE, weighted by gross value added, GVA, of -3.20 209 over 2000- 2010). The relatively competitive market structure and large SME representation suggest that the EU-NZ FTA is likely to unleash further pro-competitive effects, leading to a fall in mark-ups and industrial restructuring especially in the ambitious scenario that entails more meaningful liberalisation of this sector via a 10 percent reduction in NTM AVEs on EU\u2019s bilateral exports. This could result in even more efficient firms in this sector in both partner markets facing more effective competition from each other. 4.4.9. Policy recommendations and flanking measures \uf0b7 Trends in the automotive sector, both in the EU and New Zealand suggest that new jobs may be related with new skills requirements e.g. software and electronics engineering skills, advanced data analytics, and new types of jobs in cooperating sectors and enabling services, e.g. research on advanced materials and battery cell chemistry, renewables and alternative fuels or 5G network. Therefore, for the expected job growth (in the EU) to materialise EU institutions and Member States should work with industry and training providers to create (re)training and adjustment programmes, which would equip workers with the right skills set and enable them to continue or to start working in the sector. One example of such an initiative is the DRIVES project with a budget of \u20ac 3.9 million over four years implemented through a network of partner organisations from 11 countries. Components of the project include monitoring of skills needed in the automotive sector, design of job profiles and a pilot certification and training offer 210 . \uf0b7 The situation in the automotive sector in New Zealand will need to be monitored by the industry itself (by reporting the number of jobs created and lost over time or the number of workers employed) the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Stats NZ. If job reductions occur (as a result of the EU-NZ FTA), workers should receive support (e.g. social security assistance, training to upgrade / update their skills, career advice, a possibility to attend job fairs) to find new jobs. \uf0b7 The environmental impacts associated with the motor vehicles sector are largely produced during the use phase of the vehicle, by burning petrol or diesel. Vehicle emission standards as used in the EU are an effective way to reduce the environmental impact of cars overall. New Zealand does not have CO 2 emission standards and lower toxic emission standards than in the EU. Within the remit of both parties to regulate domestically, New Zealand could be encouraged to adopt tighter emission standards via bilateral dialogues and by providing consumer incentives. \uf0b7 The Parties should agree to the removal of the New Zealand pre-investment screening mechanism for EU investments or at least agree to raise of the threshold for the application of the mechanism. This would improve the competitive position of EU investors. For example, raising the threshold to \u20ac 516 million, which is already applicable to non-governmental investors from Australia. 208 http://bruegel.org/wp-content/uploads/imported/publications/WP_2014_07__01.pdf 209 https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/f8aae60a4e/competition-in-new-zealand-industries.pdf; note that a more negative PE score denotes more intense competition. 210 DRIVES: https://www.project-drives.eu/en/home ",

The econometric model can only allow us to present the overall sector economic impact results on which we base our subsequent impact analyses. Qualitatively we add more detailed information. 4.5.1. Current situation Economic aspects The EU had a surplus in its trade of telecom services with New Zealand over the period 2010-2017, with the magnitude of the surplus and its bilateral exports to New Zealand rising sharply since 2013. The EU's bilateral exports to New Zealand initially nearly doubled from \u20ac 80 million in 2013 to \u20ac 150 million in 2014 but have fallen since then to only \u20ac 14.3 million in 2017. In 2017, the EU-New Zealand trade in communication services (mostly telecommunication) was in balance (see Figure 4.12). The EU's imports of telecom services from New Zealand have also nearly halved from \u20ac 25 million in 2010 to \u20ac 14 million in 2017. The share of the sector in EU total bilateral services trade with New Zealand hovered around 2.0 percent until 2013 before nearly doubling in 2014. It has fallen below 1.0 percent in 2017. The importance of bilateral trade in telecom services in the EU's total trade with the world has also been low at a share well less than 0.5 percent, both regarding imports and exports. Figure 4.12: EU-New Zealand trade in communication services Source: OECD; own calculations The EU also had a trade surplus in its trade of other business services (OBS) with New Zealand over the 2010-2017 period, though the magnitude of the surplus and its bilateral exports to New Zealand have both fluctuated over 2010-2017. The EUs bilateral exports of OBS to New Zealand went up from \u20ac 261 million in 2010 to \u20ac 392 million in 2017 while the value of bilateral imports increased from \u20ac 138 million to \u20ac 175 million over the same time period (see Figure 4.13).

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 154 | P a g e Figure 4.13: EU-New Zealand trade in other business services (OBS) Source: OECD; own calculations According to the OECD database on services trade restrictiveness index (STRI), the EU is more restrictive than NZL in accounting, architecture, engineering and especially legal services but less restrictive in telecom services. Even so, traditional telecommunications services providers in the EU benefit from high barriers to new entry and little direct competition. In addition, the extension of national regulatory authority (NRA) to Internet services raises concerns because most traditional telecommunications services suppliers historically serve one or a limited number of Member State markets, whereas most Internet \u201cinterpersonal communications services\u201d are available in every Member State, thereby potentially subjecting them to conflicting NRA jurisdictions. With regard to legal services within OBS, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, and Slovakia require EU or EEA nationality or citizenship for full admission to the bar, which is necessary for the practice of EU and Member State law. In many cases, non-EU lawyers holding authorisation to practice law in one Member State face more burdensome procedures to obtain authorisation in another Member State than would a similarly situated lawyer holding EU citizenship. In the case of accounting services, the EC has taken the position that its directive on statutory auditing prohibits Member States from considering professional experience of foreign auditors acquired outside of the EU when considering whether to grant statutory auditing rights. This interpretation has hampered movement of experienced professionals and inhibited Member States from participating in the growing movement towards mutual recognition in this profession.

These investments have benefits to New Zealand and represent an expansion of New Zealand\u2019s intellectual property (IP) and innovation abroad. The increasing offshore footprint of these firms is not necessarily reflected in traditional export figures. The main (overall) investment barrier EU investors face in New Zealand \u2013 also for the communication and business services sector \u2013 relates to stricter investment screening thresholds compared to investors from other countries (e.g. the US, China, and the CPTPP member states) that have already concluded FTAs with New Zealand. The Overseas Investment Act regulates foreign investments by foreign natural and legal persons that want to invest in New Zealand with more than 25 percent foreign owned investments. To gain consent, investments from overseas investors must usually deliver benefits over and above those that a likely New Zealand investor would deliver. Social aspects In the European Union , the information and communication sector employed 7.1 million people in 2018 212 . According to another classification, in 2014, 1.1 million people worked in the EU telecommunications sector in 43,000 businesses. 213 This sector covers activities including wired, satellite and other telecommunications activities; network maintenance, software publishing, computer programming, consultancy, data processing and hosting and related activities, web portals, and repair of computers and communication equipment. Given continuous technological change, innovation and increasing competition, there is a shift towards new skills sets, including computer and electronic engineering, marketing and finance skills, while traditional skills, such as network maintenance and repair, and the related employment, decline. Social partners (employers and trade unions) focus on future training and skills needs, changes in organisation of work introduced by digitisation, quality of service and work, economic performance of enterprises and health and safety at work. The professional, scientific and technical services sector includes activities that require a high degree of training. They include legal and accounting activities; activities of head offices; management consultancy activities; architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis; scientific research and development; advertising and market research; and veterinary activities. In 2017, the share of professional services in total EU employment was 6.5 percent (i.e. around 14.8 million people), which means an increase by 15.8 percent since 2012. Further employment growth in the sector is estimated at 27.5 percent for the period 2016-2030 for the whole EU, with differences between the Member States (ranging from a reduction of 10.6 percent in Spain to an increase of 91.4 percent in Romania). 64 percent of employed in this sector in 2017 in the EU had higher education. 214 In 2018, in New Zealand , the telecommunications sector employed 16,000 workers, including migrants, an increase from 7,000 in early 2000s. 215 In 2018, the professional, scientific, technical, administrative and support services sector employed 334,300 people, i.e. 12.6 percent of the workforce (12.0 percent among women and 13.3 percent among men), being the second largest employer in New Zealand after retail trade, accommodation and food services having a 15.2 percent share in total employment in 2018 (Stats NZ, 2019).

        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 156 | P a g e this means that in general, employment in this area was continuously increasing from 242,200 in 2012. 216 In the years 2005-2012 (the latest identified data so far), wages in professional services sector were increasing and were around 40 percent higher than the average in New Zealand reflecting higher level of qualifications in this sector (MBIE, 2014). In 2016, the rate of trade union membership in professional services sector was 4 percent, i.e. the second lowest (just above agriculture, forestry and fishing, 3 percent). The highest rate of over 40 percent was in health care and social assistance, and education and training (Stats NZ, 2016). Human rights aspects Both the EU and New Zealand have human rights obligations with respect to labour rights that are relevant for the workers in the communications and business services sector (see overview of ratifications for both parties). Trade associations in both parties at different levels join efforts to promote respect for labour standards, favourable working conditions and health and safety at work. Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 is one of the main documents that establishes guidelines on safe and favourable working conditions in New Zealand. Environmental aspects The direct environmental impacts created in a service sector are based on the electricity use by offices, the heating and cooling of office buildings and the impacts associated with transport done by staff members for work. In New Zealand, electricity generation and heating made up only 8.8 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions in 2016, which is largely because New Zealand has a high share of renewable electricity sources. The share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources in New Zealand was 85 percent in 2016 (MBIE, 2018). The sector also creates environmental impacts in an indirect manner, through by exercising demand for goods and services, the production of which involve creating emissions, waste or resource extraction (such as datacentres for IT, office supplies etc.). The environmental impacts of those sectors are covered in other sectoral analyses, if selected for this report. 4.5.2. Economic impact For the EU, total output of communication services is estimated to stay the same under both the conservative and ambitious scenarios (Table 4.13). For New Zealand, the estimated percentage change in total output of communication services is 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, under the two scenarios, and compared to a situation without the FTA. The increase in New Zealand\u2019s bilateral exports of communication services to the EU under the two scenarios is considerable: 8.7 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively in the conservative and ambitious scenarios (the rise in its total exports of communication services is much lower at 0.9 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively). The rise in the EU's bilateral exports of communication services to New Zealand is also significant: 7.2 percent and 7.6 percent under the conservative and ambitious scenarios. The bilateral increases in communication services come at the expense of third countries (i.e. trade diversion), because the total EU trade in communication services does not change significantly (-0.1 percent at most under the ambitious scenario. Similarly, for the EU, total output of other services (that include OBS) will not change under the conservative scenario nor under the ambitious liberalisation scenario (Table 4.14). For New Zealand, the estimated percentage change in total output of other services is 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively under the conservative and ambitious scenarios. The increase in New Zealand\u2019s bilateral exports of other services to the EU under the two scenarios is 8.5 percent and 7.9 percent respectively (though the rise in its total exports of other services is much lower, increasing by between 0.8 and 0.2 percent). The rise in 216 Data comes from the Stats NZ series \u201cLabour market statistics\u201d from the period 2012-2018. ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 157 | P a g e the EU's bilateral exports of other services to New Zealand is also significant, at 7.8 percent and 8.3 percent under the two scenarios, against almost no change in total exports, indicating that the bilateral gain in other services is diverted away from other countries.

This has a relative competitiveness improving effect for EU investors vis-\u00e0-vis CPTPP investors in the sector who already have access, while it also leads to more potential growth and development. With respect to communication services (i.e. telecommunications), there may, however, be certain investment concerns. 4.5.3. Social impact Based on the economic modelling results, there will be no changes in employment levels in the EU communication and business services sector (which includes telecommunications, as well as professional services) under the conservative scenario and no changes either under the ambitious one. For New Zealand, the economic modelling predicts a likely job reduction of 0.1 percent for unskilled workers under the conservative scenario and of 0.3 percent for the same group under the ambitious one. There will be no changes in employment levels for skilled workers. However, taking into consideration the overall positive trend and increasing employment in the sector in the last few years, one can assume that \u2013 if this trend continues, effects of the EU-NZ FTA may mean a slightly slower job growth rather than a net job reduction. Impacts related to changes in wage and price levels have been discussed in the general part of the analysis (given that economic modelling provides estimations for changes in wage levels only for the whole economy, i.e. at an aggregated level). Based on the textual proposal tabled by the EU, the EU-NZ FTA also has the potential to open the way to further mutual recognition of professional qualifications between the Parties and to facilitate in this way mobility of professionals and supply of services between the EU and New Zealand. The text envisages that professional bodies based on their territory may provide a joint recommendation supported by evidence (e.g. the value of a potential future Mutual Recognition Agreement, MRA, and the compatibility of the respective regimes of both Parties, i.e. to what extent their systems of authorisation, licensing, operation and certification of entrepreneurs and service suppliers are ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 158 | P a g e compatible). Upon a positive consideration of a relevant FTA Committee, the Parties may be invited to start negotiations of an MRA. 217 4.5.4. Human rights impact Results of the economic modelling suggest no employment changes in the EU communication and business services. This means there will be no impact on the right to work related to employment for the EU workers in this sector. For New Zealand, employment changes suggest a limited negative impact on the right to work (and indirectly, right to an adequate standard of living ) for unskilled workers under both scenarios (0.1 and 0.3 percent employment reduction respectively). The human right to privacy and personal data is one that could be impacted by the EU-NZ FTA with regard to the flow of information, digital trade and telecommunications. Because we understand, however, that privacy and protection of personal data will not be discussed as part of the FTA, no impact on these issues is expected. 4.5.5. Environmental impact The communication and businesses services sector causes its most significant environmental via electricity use, heating and cooling of office buildings and transportation for work purposes. The environmental status quo section already explained that the impact of electricity use and heating and cooling is relatively low in New Zealand. Through its effect on the transport sector, the communication and business services sector can affect several environmental impact areas (e.g. air quality, resource use), but the most prevailing environmental impact area is climate change (through the GHG emissions related to the transportation sector). Other indirect effects can for instance occur due to changes in energy use and raw materials use (e.g. paper, plastics etc.). Since output is expected to increase in New Zealand\u2019s communication sector, indirect environmental impacts are also likely to increase. We expect that the increase in output in the communication sector will result in a minor increase in GHG emissions (through higher demand for flights and road transport), air pollutant emissions (through road transport), energy use (e.g. in offices) and material use (e.g. in offices). In the EU, these impacts are not foreseen as output is not expected to change significantly. The overall environmental analysis conducted (see section 3.6) showed that the impact on CH 4 and N 2 O emissions and other non-GHG air pollutants in New Zealand are expected to be negligible. 4.5.6. SME analysis The communication and business services sector in the EU is largely represented by SMEs. According to Eurostat (2006) the business services sector consists of approximately 64.6 percent SMEs and 35.4 percent of large companies. 99 percent of the SMEs active in the business services sector also employ less than 50 people. SMEs also account for 66.7 percent of the value added, large companies on the other hand account for 33.4 percent. In the communication services sector, large companies make up the majority of the sectoral structure. 81.3 percent are large companies, whereas 18.7 percent are SMEs (Eurostat, 2015). The large companies in the communication services sector thus also employ 88.8 percent of the people, whilst SMEs employ the remaining 11.2 percent. The effects of the EU-NZ FTA are expected to be modest for EU SMEs in the sector. Generally, the EU internal communication and business services market is characterised by bureaucracy, fragmented legislation, taxation and insurance regimes, and high barriers to entry. In addition to the aforementioned administrative burdens, the lacking group of middle-sized companies and mutual recognition principles is a reason limited cross-border trade and growth. However, the EC states in its High-Level Group on Business Services 217 Textual proposal tabled by the EU (Investment liberalisation and trade in services): http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2018/december/tradoc_157580.pdf ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 159 | P a g e report (2014) that the SMEs in these sectors are active and willing to seize new international opportunities. Based on the conducted calculations, the communications and business services sector is one of the largest gaining sectors, however output remains unchanged and bilateral exports increase under both scenarios (see Table 4.13 and Table 4.14 above). Based on the sector structure, the high presence of SMEs and the reduction of trade barriers and regulatory requirements under the EU-NZ FTA, one can expect that generally the SMEs will benefit directly through exporting more communications and business services under the FTA in light of a reduction of market access barriers and simplified bureaucratic procedures. However, as these barriers and extra costs are relatively larger for SMEs compared to large companies due to lower scale and as both sectors are comprised of only a few major exporters, SMEs are primarily expected to face modest value chain benefits through output increases under the scenarios (see Table 4.13 and Table 4.14). In light of higher output and a higher level of participation in the international market place, higher turnover and growth is to be expected if SMEs are fully taking advantage of the FTA and utilise its required understanding and implementation of rules, provisions and preferences. In regard to employment, the communication and business services sector will have no increase in skilled and unskilled workers (see Table 3.15). In New Zealand SMEs are also important for the communication and business services sector. According to New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (2016) 47 percent of the people employed in the sector are employed by a SME, which amounts to a total of 17,500 people. Large companies employed the remaining 12,200 people within the sector. Out of the active SMEs, 76 percent of the small companies do not have any employees. Similar findings can be made in the medium-large firms of New Zealand, where approximately 81 percent employ around ten to 49 employees. However, New Zealand\u2019s Productivity Commission (2014) states that the industry is mainly dominated by large companies, which have the ability to fully exploit economies of scale. The effects of the EU-NZ FTA also appear to be positive for New Zealand\u2019s SMEs active in the communication and business services sector. The country\u2019s communication and business services industry is one of the gaining sectors, in terms of output and bilateral exports, under both scenarios (see Table 4.13 and Table 4.14 above). Based on the country\u2019s communication and business services sector structure, the high presence of SMEs and the reduction of trade barriers and further regulatory requirements under the EU-NZ FTA, including the obligation to meet various certification and documentation procedures, New Zealand\u2019s communication and business services sector SMEs will benefit primarily through value chain benefits, caused through higher exports of large companies under the EU-NZ FTA. The opening of markets through FTAs reduces the requirement to process and meet the different regulatory requirements and establishes mutual recognition systems, which will benefit SMEs as they are able to reallocate their resources more efficiently to support the large exporting companies. Same as for the EU SMEs active in this sector there are none to slight decreases in regard to the employment of skilled and unskilled employees (see Table 3.15). 4.5.7. Third country impact As the communications and business services sector comprises two separate sectors in the economic modelling, we analyse both independently. Table 4.15 shows the main third country effects for the communication services sector. Overall, the effects of the EU-NZ FTA on the sector in other countries are negligible. Output and prices are not expected to change in both scenarios, except in the Pacific, however these changes are quite limited. Generally, the EU\u2019s and New Zealand\u2019s exports of communication services to the regions and countries decline. The Pacific countries reduce their imports of New Zealand\u2019s communication services by the largest percentage (0.9 percent) under the ambitious scenario. Additionally, the Pacific region increases its total ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 160 | P a g e exports by 0.6 percent. The effects for EU FTA partners and the main EU and New Zealand competitors are negligible as well. Finally, we find that the EU-NZ FTA in communication services does not affect poorer nations in the world (LDCs) negatively. The total sector exports of LDCs are expected to grow by 0.1 percent. Table 4.16 shows the main third country effects for the other services (business services) sector. The effects are very similar to the communication services sector.

Competitiveness analysis The SME analysis is difficult to undertake for this combined sector. The above parts on professional services clearly indicate that this part of the sector is dominated by SMEs in both the EU and New Zealand. While the communications and business services market is competitive in the case of the EU with a concentration ratio ranging from 8% 218 to 13%, it is also among the most competitive sectors in the case of New Zealand (with a profit 218 ECB (2019) \u201cConcentration, market power and dynamism in the euro area\u201d, Working Paper Series No. 2253.

For communication services, however, market concentration in both the EU and New Zealand is much higher. The relatively competitive market structure and large SME representation suggest that the EU-NZ FTA is likely to unleash further pro-competitive effects, leading to a fall in mark-ups and industrial restructuring especially in the ambitious scenario that entails more meaningful liberalisation of this sector via a 3 percent reduction in AVEs. This could result in further consolidation with even more efficient firms in this sector in both partner markets facing more effective competition from each other. 4.5.9. Policy recommendations and flanking measures \uf0b7 As mentioned above for the other sectors analysed, we recommend that the Parties should agree to the removal of the New Zealand pre-investment screening mechanism for EU investments or at least agree to raising the threshold for the application of the mechanism. \uf0b7 Trends in the professional services and telecommunications sectors, both in the EU and New Zealand are positive with employment growing over the last few years and suggest that future jobs may be related with new skills requirements and an overall high level of skills, including those related to digital economy. To continue with this trend and to mitigate potential limited negative impacts expected as a result of the EU-NZ FTA, the Governments should work with industry and training providers to create a training offer, which would equip workers with the right skills set and enable them to continue or to start working in these sectors. A well-designed training offer may help to maintain or improve sector\u2019s competitiveness and support employability and competitiveness of local workers. \uf0b7 Increasing employment in the services sector, including digital, is linked to the latest trends in the economy, trade and organisation of work. Hence, both Parties, as well as business and civil society representatives are encouraged to use channels for dialogue provided by the TSD chapter to discuss challenges and opportunities related to the Future of work (as defined by the ILO and discussed by G20), i.e. new forms of work organisation and changes related to digital economy and technology in general, and the best course of unilateral and bilateral/joint action helping both Parties to seize the opportunities offered by new trends and technologies and the EU-NZ FTA. 219 https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/f8aae60a4e/competition-in-new-zealand-industries.pdf; note that a more negative PE score denotes more intense competition.

CONSULTATIONS Consultation and communication activities were undertaken in line with the consultations plan presented in the inception report. In total, about 400 stakeholders (organisational entities) - 85 in New Zealand and 314 in the EU \u2013 were included in the database and contacted to provide comments through the online surveys, interviews or written contributions. In total, 24 respondents participated across the two surveys, of which 20 in the general one and 4 in the business/SME survey. 29% of the respondents (7) are New Zealanders, and the remaining 71% (17) located in the EU. 17% businesses, and 8% individuals. This section presents a summary of the findings from the survey; contributions made through position papers and interviews have been reflected in the analyses presented in the preceding sections. Detailed information about the consultation activities undertaken and contributions from stakeholders obtained from these consultations are provided in a separate consultations report (Annex VI). The overall view among stakeholders of the FTA is positive (Figure 5.1). Around 50% of respondents stated that the overall effect of the Agreement was positive or very positive, while 8% anticipated a negative overall impact of the Agreement. Respondents from New Zealand were more positive than EU respondents, and impact on New Zealand was also seen as more positive than in the EU, by both EU and New Zealand respondents (see Annex VI). Figure 5.1: Anticipated overall effects of the FTA Source: Responses to online surveys; n = 36. With regard to economic effects of the FTA, stakeholders overall expect positive effects. The strongest positive effects are anticipated for the level of goods exports from New Zealand to the EU, better protection of IPR, and economic growth in New Zealand. Conversely, the most limited positive effects of the new Agreement are expected for the incidence of corruption, consumers in New Zealand, and for the economic growth in the EU. On average, New Zealand respondents are clearly more optimistic about the Agreement than EU respondents. In terms of sectors, respondents in New Zealand consider that agriculture is the sector in which the FTA will have the highest effect. EU survey participants see the dairy sector, meat production, and agriculture as more influenced by the negotiations than other sectors; in New Zealand the dairy sector and meat products are also considered as most influenced, followed by construction, services and food products.

Regarding the potential social effects of the Agreement in the EU, respondents expect a very limited impact across all indicators. With respect to the effects on different social groups in the EU and in New Zealand, few survey participants provided a response, indicating that the scale of the impact on any social group is expected to be limited. Most survey participants considered the Agreement\u2019s effect on human rights to be negligible. With regard to the anticipated environmental effects, about 30% of respondents expect effects to occur in the EU and NZ, around 15% expect environmental effect only in New Zealand and 5% only in the EU. Half of all respondents expect no effect or provided no response. The responses to the various potential environmental effects show a generally slightly positive perception, due to positive views held among New Zealanders survey participants; conversely, EU respondents are more critical. However, very few respondents expressed a view. Finally, in terms of FTA negotiation topics, the three issues considered most important overall are rules on state aid/subsidies, removal of remaining tariffs, and stronger rules for environmental protection. New Zealander respondents on average assign higher priorities on most issues than EU respondents, the only exceptions being rules on state aid and competition. ",

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND FLANKING MEASURES Throughout this report, both in Chapter 3 (overall analysis) and Chapter 4 (sector-specific analysis), we have drafted policy recommendations and flanking measures. Policy recommendations are directed at the EU-NZ FTA negotiations, while flanking measures are recommendations that are not part of the FTA negotiations but which we recommend in any case for the two negotiating partners because they could have an impact on the way the EU-NZ FTA works through the economies and impacts the EU, New Zealand or others. For ease of reading, we summarise the study\u2019s main horizontal recommendations in this Chapter, split between policy recommendations (section 6.1) and flanking measures (section 6.2). For each recommendation, we provide a cross-reference to the sections providing the underlying analysis and detailed recommendation. 6.1. Main policy recommendations Main economic and SME policy recommendations \uf0b7 The tariff and NTM liberalisations in the ambitious scenario show some sectoral effects. In order to minimise any potential negative effects of liberalisation in most affected sectors and give companies and workers time to adjust, the EU and New Zealand could negotiate to introduce liberalisation gradually (e.g. tariff liberalisation in ruminant meat, machinery or motor vehicles) over time, or partially liberalise, considering the costs and benefits from liberalisation in these sectors (see sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.7). This recommendation is also supported by the findings of the social impact and human rights impact analysis (see sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3 for the social analysis, and sections 3.5.4.1 and 3.5.5 for the human rights impact analysis). \uf0b7 The FTA\u2019s anticipated impact on the EU Outermost Regions is expected to be small. Nevertheless, the fact that the ORs\u2019 economies depend heavily on a few sensitive products should be taken into account in the negotiations, and specific measures, such as safeguard clauses or quotas, could be envisaged as appropriate to ensure that the ORs are not negatively affected (see section 3.1.5). \uf0b7 The EU and New Zealand should discuss how to open their economies for two-way investments, given the potential gains for both Parties from investment liberalisation. Negotiations should aim at the removal (or increase) of thresholds for investments in New Zealand, so that no investments (or only very large ones) will be pre-screened. The EU should ask New Zealand at the minimum for EU investors to be treated similar to other foreign investors with which New Zealand has an FTA (see sections 3.1.6 and 3.1.7). \uf0b7 We recommend that EU and New Zealand negotiators aim at reaching a comprehensive and ambitious agreement on bilateral opening of public procurement markets, as this is expected to have 2-way positive economic effects which could be stimulated by the EU-NZ FTA (see sections 3.1.6 and 3.1.7). Main social and gender equality policy recommendations \uf0b7 If agreed in negotiations, the EU-NZ FTA provisions on health and safety at work under TSD chapter may encourage the Parties to take further unilateral actions and pursue bilateral cooperation and dialogue in the area of health and safety at work. In this context, it would be important that the TSD chapter provides a space for workshops, joint projects and other opportunities for exchange of information and best practice, on the EU side based on Member States\u2019 experience and expertise developed by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. In the past, such cooperation with partner countries, e.g. Chile (under the Association Agreement) included study visits, also in the Agency, and discussion about legislative solutions and their practical application in risk-related sectors, such as mining. Dialogue involved also employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives. The EU and New Zealand would need to choose the most ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 166 | P a g e relevant set of sectors for their relations and ensure that cooperation activities engage sector representatives from both Parties (see sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3). \uf0b7 While quantitative impacts of the EU-NZ FTA on the respect of rights at work are likely to be limited (e.g. employment of disabled persons) or difficult to establish (e.g. regarding work of young persons or cases of exploitation of migrant workers), there may be a qualitative positive impact. The Parties should continue their dialogue on rights at work during negotiations with a view to identifying steps to take by New Zealand towards ratification and effective implementation of the two outstanding ILO fundamental conventions, No. 87 and 138 (see sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3; this also follows from the human rights impact analysis, sections 3.5.3, 3.5.4 and 3.5.5). \uf0b7 If agreed in negotiations, the EU-NZ FTA provisions on trade and responsible supply chain management, including CSR/RBC practices, under the TSD chapter may encourage the Parties to take further unilateral actions and pursue bilateral cooperation and dialogue in these areas, as well as contribution to multilateral initiatives. In this context, it would be important that the TSD chapter provides a space for workshops, joint projects and other opportunities for exchange of information and best practice or search for solutions to address common challenges and that these activities can engage also businesses and other relevant stakeholders from both Parties (see sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3). \uf0b7 Cooperation and dialogue under the TSD chapter could also foresee seminars to be attended by representatives of National Contact Points (NCP) under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to share information and best practice related to their operation and handling of specific instances (see sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3). \uf0b7 Because FTA provisions may have a different impact on men and women , the Parties should consider such differential impacts at the time of design and implementation of the EU-NZ FTA provisions in core trade disciplines, e.g. trade in services (given the large share of women employed as workers and operating as entrepreneurs and international traders in the services sectors), technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures (given participation of women-led SMEs in exports to New Zealand in sectors such as clothing or electronic components), public procurement (and impacts on SMEs\u2019 participation), investment, e-commerce or policy on SMEs (see sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3). Main human rights policy recommendations \uf0b7 In addition to commitments towards ratification and implementation of ILO conventions No. 87 and No. 138 (addressed above), the Parties should continue their dialogue on the protection of rights of vulnerable population groups potentially affected by the FTA. With this aim, the FTA should include commitments by the Parties to ratify the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention No. 169 and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (see sections 3.5.3, 3.5.4 and 3.5.5). \uf0b7 Complementing the TSD Chapter, which already includes binding obligations for the Parties that are intended to be enforced by the TSD Sub-Committees, the Parties should consider including provisions on specific vulnerable groups (indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, children, women, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers) that contain clear and measurable targets to strengthen their rights within the framework of the EU\u2019s trade policy \u2013 if possible linked to this FTA (see sections 3.5.3, 3.5.4 and 3.5.5). \uf0b7 While the exact text of the EU-NZ FTA is not available at the time of writing of this report, access to essential medicines may be affected. Increased IP protection stimulates innovation and can contribute to reducing medicines shortages, but it can also put certain pressure on the New Zealand government via increasing costs for healthcare in case new innovative drugs hit the market and no economic benefit assessment is in place. The FTA should aim to contribute to availability of medicines for patients in the EU and New Zealand and reduce costs in the New Zealand healthcare system by encouraging innovation (see sections 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.5). \uf0b7 Finally, we recommend to include continued monitoring and evaluation of the impact ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 167 | P a g e of the EU-NZ FTA beyond a one-time evaluation after 5 years, and to carry out targeted assessments of the human rights impact of the Agreement at regular intervals (see section 3.5.5). Main environmental policy recommendations \uf0b7 The Parties should explore ways to stimulate further climate action in the context of the FTA in order to \u2018offset\u2019 the slightly negative impact of the FTA by increased ambition \u2013 a provision in the TSD chapter could cover this. In terms of global effects, an ambitious FTA (full trade liberalisation) is expected to have a slightly negative impact on climate change, particularly from the foreseen trade liberalisation in the agricultural sector (see sections 3.6.2 and 3.6.8). \uf0b7 The Parties should consider ways in the negotiation on how to promote the exchange of information on effective policy making between the EU and New Zealand in the field of water quality between the EU and New Zealand in the context of the FTA. The EU\u2019s regulation in the field of water (Water Framework Directive) is viewed as comprehensive and ambitious, but also suffers from difficulties in implementation. Both are encouraged to share best practices and in the area of implementation and regulatory measures to stimulate strengthening of water policy in both regions to accommodate the additional pressure from the FTA in this area (see sections 3.6.5 and 3.6.8). 6.2. Main flanking measures Main economic flanking measures \uf0b7 The EU and New Zealand should agree to establish a one-stop-shop on EU-New Zealand trade for SMEs in the EU Member States and New Zealand to ensure that SMEs have an easily accessible source of information regarding the EU-NZ FTA and ways for benefitting from it (see section 3.2). \uf0b7 We propose for the EU and New Zealand to establish a public-private cooperation \u2018SME task force\u2019 in both Parties, linking the Chambers of Commerce and SME representatives up with the relevant ministry departments to develop and execute a 3-year action plan to explain to SMEs the potential of the EU-NZ FTA and to work with SMEs to reap benefits and become themselves ambassadors to other SMEs. In the EU this recommendation can build on the SME European Network (see section 3.2). Main social flanking measures \uf0b7 While the expected employment reductions at the EU level in the sector (under the ambitious scenario) are likely to be relatively limited, some EU Member States or regions having a higher share of non-dairy cattle farming in economic activity and employment (e.g. in Ireland) may potentially be more (negatively) affected (in particular if effects of several FTAs cumulate). To avoid or mitigate potential negative effects, governments and farmer associations in the EU should continue or step up efforts supporting competitiveness of the ruminant meat sector in the EU and high product quality, complemented by search for potential additional destination markets for products of this sector. Decisions about the appropriate support measures should be based on a sound market analysis and trends in demand, supply and prices. Such analysis could be provided e.g. by the EU Meat Market Observatory, complemented by collection of evidence related to effects of market changes on farmers and meat processors by sector organisations at the national and EU level (see sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3 and 4.1). \uf0b7 Trends in the motor vehicles sector, both in the EU and New Zealand, suggest that new jobs may require new skills e.g. software and electronics engineering skills, advanced data analytics, and new types of jobs in cooperating sectors and enabling services, e.g. research on advanced materials and battery cell chemistry, renewables and alternative fuels or 5G network. Therefore, for the expected job growth (in the EU) to materialise, the EU institutions and Member States should work with industry and training providers to create training offers, which would equip workers with the right skills set and enable ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 168 | P a g e them to continue or to start working in the sector and to maintain or improve its competitiveness (see sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3 and 4.4). \uf0b7 The situation in sectors of New Zealand\u2019s economy that are likely to be negatively affected by the EU-NZ FTA, e.g. motor vehicles and machinery, may require that the New Zealand Government takes measures to support workers in transition to new jobs in case employment reductions occur in these sectors. Support measures could include training, career advice, support to set up own business, job fairs to facilitate matching workers with potential employers, as well as support for SMEs in the supply chains to diversify into other sectors (see sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 4.3 and 4.4). \uf0b7 The government of New Zealand should ensure that working conditions for seasonal workers (e.g. short-term migrants) or casual workers hired in response to increasing output in the agricultural sector are decent and meet the established standards, and that cases of migrant workers\u2019 exploitation documented in some studies are prevented and, if they happen, are investigated and addressed. While observance of laws regarding working conditions will be the employers\u2019 obligation, labour inspection and Immigration NZ (supported by information from workers, trade unions, NGOs and others) should identify and address cases of workers\u2019 rights violations. Moreover, measures helping to prevent exploitation of workers, such as information for migrant workers about their rights and banning employers exploiting migrants from employing them should be continued. The Government should also consider granting migrant workers the same or similar protections as enjoyed by other workers in New Zealand (see sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3). \uf0b7 We recommend that both the EU and New Zealand flank the EU-NZ FTA with initiatives aiming at reducing the number of accidents at work \u2013 especially in agriculture and construction to ensure that the FTA does not lead to increases in accidents at work. These programmes should be led by sector representatives and build on recent initiatives (see sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 4.1 and Annex III.2). \uf0b7 In the framework of CSR/RBC, all relevant stakeholders (government, civil society, companies, interest groups, etc.) should work on promoting the human rights responsibilities of companies and monitoring their responsible business conduct \u2013 setting up public-private-partnerships is one way to proceed (see sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, as well as the human rights impact analysis, sections 3.5.3, 3.5.4 and 3.5.5). \uf0b7 To enable monitoring of impacts of the EU-NZ FTA on women, the Parties should further collect and analyse data disaggregated by gender. This applies in particular to the EU level data related to women entrepreneurs and traders (e.g. sectors of their economic activity, as well as internationally traded goods and services), and to women entrepreneurs and traders in New Zealand. Exchange of best practice related to methods of data collection and analysis could follow in the regular dialogue under the TSD chapter of the EU-NZ FTA or other relevant chapters, e.g. on SMEs, and within other bilateral or multilateral initiatives, e.g. follow-up to the Buenos Aires Declaration on Trade and Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment. The government of New Zealand should also monitor (in cooperation with social partners) whether women may be disproportionately impacted by price increases in food products in New Zealand as a result of the EU-NZ FTA (see sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3). \uf0b7 The Parties should consider the launch and/or continuation of tools and initiatives (discussed in detail in Annex III.2 to this Report) supporting women\u2019s economic activity, i.e. setting up and operation of enterprises, with access to funding, advisory services and networks, and engagement in international trade, including under the EU- NZ FTA (see sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3). Main human rights flanking measures \uf0b7 Because of the predicted shifts in employment triggered by the Agreement, both parties should consider allocation of special budget to provide for the training programmes and necessary social support of the workers that are expected to be negatively affected by the EU-NZ FTA, or keep the potential effects of the EU-NZ in mind when allocating existing funds. Also both the EU and New Zealand should monitor that the right to work ",
        "Trade SIA in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and New Zealand 169 | P a g e of the workers from the affected sectors is not violated; this also follows from the social impact analysis (see sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.5.3, 3.5.4 and 3.5.5). \uf0b7 We recommend that the EU authorities regularly monitor labour rights of workers in declining sectors ensuring that their rights are not violated and assist them in adjusting to the new situation (see sections 3.5.3, 3.5.4 and 3.5.5). \uf0b7 We recommend that New Zealand considers introduction of a special taskforce directed at monitoring that the labour rights of the workers from the declining sectors are protected and allocate financial resources in order to assist affected workers in adjusting to the new employment situation. Next to that, we recommend that New Zealand authorities establish a separate taskforce that works out a detailed plan on how to use benefits from the growing sectors and direct them to the needs of the vulnerable groups employed in the sector (see sections 3.5.3, 3.5.4 and 3.5.5). Main environmental flanking measures \uf0b7 The Parties should find ways to alleviate the impacts of increased agricultural production on biodiversity. The FTA is likely to exacerbate the pressures on biodiversity in New Zealand through the expected land clearing as a result of the predicted expansion of the agricultural sector (see section 3.6.4, case study 3.3 and section 3.6.8). \uf0b7 The EU and the government of New Zealand should explore possibilities to stimulate the implementation of New Zealand\u2019s Biosecurity Strategy in the context of the FTA (see section 3.6.4, case study 3.3 and section 3.6.8).
