        "8550/19 MI/lv 31 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN PILLAR I EXCELLENT SCIENCE The scientific, economic, social and cultural progress in all its forms depends on an adequate supply of excellent researchers; the search for breakthroughs in understanding and the acquisition of knowledge at all levels; the world class facilities needed to achieve this including physical and knowledge infrastructures for research and innovation as well as the means to openly disseminate and share knowledge (open science), methodologies and skills. The achievement of world leading innovation is linked to the advancements of open and excellent science. Scientific and technological paradigm shifts, can be key drivers for productivity growth, competitiveness, wealth, sustainable development and social progress. Such paradigm shifts have historically tended to originate from the public-sector science base before going on to lay the foundations for whole new industries and sectors and for comprehensive societal progress. Public investment in research, especially through universities and public research institutions (PRIs) and research facilities, often undertakes the longer-term, higher-risk research and complements the activities of the private sector. Besides this, it creates highly skilled human resources, knowhow and experience, new scientific instruments and methodologies, as well creating the networks which transmit the latest knowledge. European science and European-based researchers have been and continue to be at the forefront in many areas. But this is not a position we can take for granted. The traditional challenge from countries such as the United States is now being joined by economic giants such as China and India, from the newly industrialising parts of the world in particular, and from all countries where governments recognise the manifold and abundant returns which derive from investing in research. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 32 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN 1. EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ERC) 1.1. Rationale Although the EU remains the largest producer of scientific publications in the world, it has, relative to its size, comparatively few centres of excellence that standout at the world level and with large areas of average and poor performance. Compared with the US and now China to some degree, the EU follows a 'distributed excellence model' in which resources are spread across a larger number of researchers and research institutions. Creating attractive conditions for the best researchers will help Europe to raise its attractiveness in the global competition for scientific talent. The global research landscape is evolving dramatically and becoming increasingly multipolar as a result of a growing number of emerging countries, in particular China, expanding their scientific production. So whereas the EU and the United States accounted for nearly two-thirds of world expenditure on research and development in 2000, this share had fallen to less than half by 2013. The ERC supports the best researchers, including talented researchers who are at an early stage of their career, with flexible, long-term funding to pursue ground breaking, high-gain/high-risk research primarily in Europe. It operates autonomously led by an independent Scientific Council made up of scientists, engineers and scholars of the highest repute and appropriate expertise and diversity. The ERC is able to draw on a wider pool of talents and ideas than would be possible for any national scheme, reinforcing excellence through the way in which the best researchers and the best ideas compete against each other. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 33 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN Frontier research funded by the ERC has a proven substantial direct impact in the form of advances at the frontiers of knowledge, opening the way to new and often unexpected scientific and technological results and new areas for research. In turn, this generates radically new ideas which drive innovation and business inventiveness and tackle societal challenges. The ERC also has a significant structural impact, driving up the quality of the European research system over and above the researchers and actions it funds directly. ERC-funded actions and researchers set an inspirational target for frontier research in Europe, raising its profile and making it more attractive for the best researchers worldwide as a place to work, and work with. The prestige of hosting ERC grant- holders creates competition between Europe's universities and research organisations to offer the most attractive conditions for top researchers and can indirectly help them to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses and bring about reforms. The ERC funds a relatively small percentage of all European research, but from this achieves a high scientific impact. The average citation impact of the research supported by the ERC is comparable to that of the world\u2019s top elite research universities. The ERC\u2019s research performance is extremely high when compared with the world\u2019s largest research funders. The ERC funds a great deal of frontier research in many of the research areas that have received the highest numbers of citations, including those areas that are rapidly emerging. Although ERC funding is targeted to frontier research it has resulted in a substantial number of patents. So there is clear evidence that the ERC attracts and funds excellent researchers through its calls and ERC actions are producing a substantial number of the most significant and high impact research findings worldwide in emerging areas leading to breakthroughs and major advances. The work of ERC grantees is also highly interdisciplinary and ERC grantees collaborate internationally and publish their results openly across all fields of research including the social sciences, research on the arts and the humanities. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 34 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN There is also already evidence of the longer term impacts of ERC grants on careers, on training highly skilled recognised researchers and holders of doctoral degrees, on raising the global visibility and prestige of European research and on national research systems through its strong benchmarking effect. This effect is particularly valuable in the EU's distributed excellence model because ERC funded status can replace and serve as a more accurate indicator of research quality than recognition based on the status of institutions. This allows ambitious individuals, institutions, regions and countries to seize the initiative and scale up the research profiles in which they are particularly strong. 1.2. Areas of intervention 1.2.1. Frontier Science Research funded by the ERC is expected to lead to advances at the frontier of knowledge, with scientific publications of the highest quality to achieve research results with high societal and economic potential impact and with the ERC setting a clear and inspirational target for frontier research across the EU, Europe and internationally. Aiming to make the EU a more attractive environment for the world's best scientists, the ERC will target a measurable improvement in the EU's share of the world's top 1 % most highly cited publications, and aim to increase in the number of excellent researchers including from outside Europe which it funds. ERC funding shall be awarded in accordance with the following well-established principles. Scientific excellence shall be the sole criterion on which ERC grants are awarded. The ERC shall operate on a 'bottom-up' basis without predetermined priorities. Broad Lines \u2013 Long-term funding to support excellent ideas of investigators of any age and gender, from any country in the world, and their research teams to pursue ground-breaking, high-gain/high-risk research; ",

MARIE SK\u0141ODOWSKA -CURIE ACTIONS (MSCA) 2.1. Rationale Europe needs a highly-skilled and resilient human capital base in research and innovation that can easily adapt to and find sustainable solutions for current and future challenges, such as major demographic changes in Europe. To ensure excellence, researchers need to be mobile, collaborate and diffuse knowledge across countries, sectors and disciplines, with the right combination of knowledge and skills to tackle societal challenges and support innovation. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 40 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN Europe is a scientific powerhouse with around 1.8 million researchers working in thousands of universities, research centres and companies. However, it is estimated that the EU will need to train and employ at least one million new researchers by 2027 in order to achieve the targets beings set for increased investment in research and innovation. This need is particularly acute beyond the academic sector (such as in industry and business, including SMEs, government, civil society organisations, cultural institutions, hospitals etc.) and requires collaboration between the different sectors to provide adequately trained new researchers. The EU must reinforce its efforts to entice more young women and men to a career in research, be more inclusive and promote better work/family life balance, attract researchers from third countries, retain its own researchers and reintegrate European researchers working elsewhere back to Europe. In addition, in order to more widely spread excellence, the conditions under which researchers perform must be further improved throughout the European Research Area (ERA). In this respect, stronger links are needed notably with the European Education Area (EEdA), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and European Social Fund (ESF+). These challenges can best be addressed at EU level due to their systemic nature and to the cross- country effort needed to solve them.) The Marie Sk\u0142odowska -Curie Actions (MSCA) focus on excellent research that is fully bottom-up, open to any field of research and innovation from basic research up to market take-up and innovation services. This includes research fields covered under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). If specific needs arise and additional funding sources become available, the MSCA may seek links to certain activities in specific challenges (incl. identified missions), types of research and innovation institutions, or geographical locations in order to respond to the evolution of Europe's requirements in terms of skills, research training, career development and knowledge sharing. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 41 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN The MSCA are the main instrument at EU-level for attracting researchers from third countries to Europe, thus making a major contribution to global cooperation in research and innovation. Evidence shows that the MSCA not only have a positive impact on individuals, organisations, and at system level, but also yield high-impact and breakthrough research results while at the same time contributing significantly to societal as well as strategic challenges. Long-term investment in people pays off, as indicated by the number of Nobel Prize winners who have been either former MSCA fellows or supervisors. Through global research competition between scientists and between host organisations from both the academic and non-academic sector, and through the creation and sharing of high-quality knowledge across countries, sectors and disciplines, the MSCA contribute notably to the goals of the 'Jobs, growth and investment' agenda, the EU Global Strategy and to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The MSCA contribute to making the ERA more effective, competitive and attractive on a global scale. This is achieved by focusing on a new generation of highly-skilled researchers and providing support for emerging talent from across the EU and beyond including fostering their transition to other components of the programme, such as ERC and EIT; by fostering the diffusion and application of new knowledge and ideas to European policies, the economy and society, inter alia through improved science communication and public outreach measures; by facilitating cooperation between research-performing organisations and by publishing following the principles of open science and FAIR data; and by having a pronounced structuring impact on the ERA, advocating an open labour market and setting standards for quality training, attractive employment conditions and open, transparent and merit-based recruitment for all researchers in line with the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers.

Nurturing Excellence through Mobility of Researchers across Borders, Sectors and Disciplines The EU must remain a reference point for excellent research and thus attractive for the most promising researchers, European and non-European alike, at all stages of their careers. This can be achieved by enabling researchers and research-related staff to move and collaborate between countries, sectors and disciplines and thus benefit from high-quality training and career opportunities. This will facilitate career moves between academia and other sectors as well as stimulate entrepreneurial activity. Broad Lines \u2013 Mobility experiences within or outside Europe for the best or most promising researchers regardless of nationality to undertake excellent research and develop their skills as well as career and broaden their network in academia and other sectors (including research infrastructures). 2.2.2. Fostering new Skills through Excellent Training of Researchers The EU needs a strong, resilient and creative human resource base, with the right combination of skills to match the future needs of the labour market, to innovate and to convert knowledge and ideas into products and services for economic and social benefit. This can be achieved through training researchers to further develop their core research competences as well as enhance their transferable skills such as a creative, responsible, open-to-society and entrepreneurial mindset and awareness of sustainable development. This will allow them to face current and future global challenges, and improve their career prospects and innovation potential. Broad Lines \u2013 Training programmes to equip researchers with a diversity of skills relevant to current and future global challenges. ",

Strengthening Human Resources and Skills Development across the European Research Area In order to foster excellence, promote cooperation between research-performing organisations and create a positive structuring effect, high-quality training and mentoring standards, good working conditions and effective career development of researchers need to be introduced across the ERA. If appropriate and justified by a study, support for researchers to return to their country of origin within and to the Union shall be provided within the context of the existing broad lines.

RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURES 3.1. Rationale State of the art research infrastructures provide key services to research and innovation communities, playing an essential role in extending the frontiers of knowledge and laying the basis for research and innovation contributions to tackle the global challenges and industrial competitiveness. Supporting research infrastructures at the EU level helps to mitigate what in many cases is the reality of scattered national and regional research infrastructures and pockets of scientific excellence, and so strengthening the ERA as well as increasing the circulation of knowledge across silos. Scientific progress is increasingly dependent on the collaborations of research infrastructures and industry that develop the necessary instruments based on new key enabling technologies and other new technologies. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 45 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN The overall aim is to endow Europe with world-class sustainable research infrastructures open and accessible to all researchers in Europe and beyond, which fully exploit their potential for scientific advance and innovation. Key objectives are to reduce the fragmentation of the research and innovation ecosystem, avoiding duplication of effort, and better coordinate the design, development, accessibility and use of research infrastructures, including those financed from ERDF. It is crucial to support open access to research infrastructures for all European researchers as well as, inter alia through the European Open Science Cloud (hereafter 'EOSC'), increased access to digital research resources, specifically stimulating the up-take of open science and open data practises. It is also important to improve the long-term sustainability of research infrastructures as they are typically operational for several decades and therefore should produce plans to secure continuous and stable support. Equally, the EU needs to tackle the rapid increase of global competition for talent by attracting third country researchers to work with European world-class research infrastructures. Increasing the competitiveness and innovation capabilities of European industry is also a major objective, supporting key technologies and services relevant for research infrastructures and their users, thus improving the conditions for supply of innovative solutions. Past framework programmes have made a significant contribution towards the more efficient and effective use of national research infrastructures as well as developed with the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) a coherent and strategy-led approach to policy making on pan-European research infrastructures. This strategic approach has generated clear advantages, including reducing duplication of effort with more efficient overall use of resources, as well as standardising processes and procedures. Research mobility plays an important role in facilitating the use of research infrastructures, therefore synergies with national and European mobility schemes have to be considered. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 46 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN EU supported activity will provide added value through: consolidating and optimising the existing research infrastructure landscape in Europe alongside efforts to develop new research infrastructures of pan-European importance and impact; ensuring similar sets of research infrastructures work together to address strategic issues affecting user communities; establishing the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) as an effective scalable and sustainable environment for data-driven research; the interconnection of national and regional research and education networks, enhancing and securing high-capacity network infrastructure for massive amounts of data and access to digital resources across borders and domain boundaries; promoting the pan-European coverage of distributed research infrastructures, also to enable cross-country comparison of research data, e.g. in the SSH and environmental fields; fostering the interoperability of research infrastructures; enhancing and reinforcing knowledge transfer and training of high-skilled human resources; fostering the use and where relevant upgrading of existing world-class pan-European research infrastructures across Horizon Europe; overcoming barriers preventing the best research teams from accessing the best research infrastructures services in Europe; fostering the innovation potential of research infrastructures, focused on technology development and co-innovation as well as increased use of research infrastructures by industry. And the international dimension of EU research infrastructures must be reinforced, fostering stronger cooperation with international counterparts and international participation in European research infrastructures for mutual benefit.

        "8550/19 MI/lv 51 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN PILLAR II GLOBAL CHALLENGES AND EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS The EU is confronted by many challenges, some of which are also global challenges. The scale and complexity of the problems are vast, need to be tackled jointly and matched by adequate, properly trained and skilled human resources, by the appropriate amount of financial resources and a proportionate effort in order to find solutions. These are precisely the areas where the EU must work together; smart, flexible and joined-up for the benefit and well-being of all our citizens. Greater impact can be obtained through aligning actions with other nations and regions of the world within international cooperation along the lines indicated by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate agreement. Based on mutual benefit, partners from across the world will be invited to join EU efforts as an integral part of research and innovation for sustainable development. Research and innovation are key drivers of sustainable and inclusive growth and technological and industrial competitiveness. They will contribute to finding solutions to today\u2019s problems, and the problems of tomorrow, in order to reverse as quickly as possible, the negative and dangerous trend that currently links economic development with the growing use of natural resources and growing social challenges. This will turn the challenges into new business opportunities and into rapid benefits for society. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 52 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN The EU will benefit as user and producer of knowledge, technologies and industries showcasing how modern industrialised, sustainable, inclusive, creative, resilient, open and democratic society and economy can function and develop. The growing economic-environmental-social examples of the sustainable economy of the future will be fostered and boosted, be they for: health and well- being for all; or resilient, creative and inclusive societies; or societies strengthened by civil security; or available clean energy and mobility; or a digitised economy and society; or a transdisciplinary and creative industry; or space-related, marine or land-based solutions; or a well-functioning bioeconomy, including food and nutrition solutions; sustainable use of natural resources, protection of the environment, climate change mitigation and adaptation, all generating wealth in Europe and offering higher quality jobs. Industrial transformation will be crucial, as well as developing EU innovative industrial value chains. New technologies affect virtually all policy areas. For each separate technology there is often a combination of social and economic opportunities, opportunities for efficiency and quality and improvement of the government, consequences for employment and education, but also possible risks for safety, privacy and ethics. Technology policy therefore necessarily requires an integral weighing of interests, and cross-sectoral cooperation and strategy formulation. Research and innovation under this pillar of Horizon Europe is grouped into integrated, non-siloed broad clusters of activities. Rather than addressing sectors, the investments aim at systemic changes for our society and economy along a sustainability vector. These will only be achieved if all actors, both private and public, engage in co-designing and co-creating research and innovation; bringing together end-users, scientists, technologists, producers, innovators, businesses, educators, policy- makers, citizens and civil society organisations. Therefore, none of the clusters is intended for only one set of actors and all activities will be implemented primarily by collaborative research and innovation projects selected on the basis of competitive calls for proposals. In addition to addressing global challenges, activities in the clusters will also develop and apply, key enabling and emerging technologies (either or not digital-based) as part of a common strategy to promote the EU's industrial and social leadership. Where appropriate this will use EU space- enabled data and services. All TRL levels up to 8 will be covered in this pillar of Horizon Europe without prejudice to Union competition law. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 53 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN Actions will generate new knowledge and develop technological and non-technological solutions, bring technology from lab to market and to develop applications including pilot lines and demonstrators, and include measures to stimulate market uptake and to boost private sector commitment and incentives to standardisation activities within the Union. Technologies require critical mass of European researchers and industry to establish world leading eco-systems, that include state of the art technology infrastructures e.g. for testing. Synergies with other parts of Horizon Europe and the EIT, as well as other programmes will be maximised. The clusters will boost the quick introduction of first-of-its-kind innovation in the EU through a broad range of embedded activities, including communication, dissemination and exploitation, standardisation as well as support to non-technological innovation and innovative delivery mechanisms, helping create innovation friendly societal, regulatory and market conditions such as the innovation deals. Pipelines of innovative solutions originating from research and innovation actions will be established and targeted to public and private investors as well as other relevant EU and national or regional programmes. Synergies will be developed with the third pillar of Horizon Europe in that perspective. Gender equality is a crucial factor in order to obtain sustainable economic growth. It is therefore important to integrate a gender perspective in all global challenges. 1. CLUSTER 'HEALTH' 1.1. Rationale The EU Pillar of Social Rights asserts that everyone has the right to timely access to affordable, preventive and curative health care that is safe and of good quality. This underlines the EU\u2019s commitment to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals calling for universal health coverage for all and at all ages by 2030, leaving no one behind, and ending preventable deaths. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 54 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN A healthy population is vital for a stable, sustainable and inclusive society, and improvements in health are crucial in reducing poverty, in dealing with an ageing European society, in fostering social progress and prosperity, and in increasing economic growth. According to the OECD a 10% improvement in life expectancy is associated with a rise in economic growth of 0.3-0.4% a year. Life expectancy in the EU increased by 12 years since its establishment as a result of tremendous improvements achieved in the quality of life, environment, education, health and care of its people. In 2015, overall life expectancy at birth was 80.6 years in the EU compared to 71.4 years globally. In the past years, it increased in the EU on average by 3 months annually. Besides these improvements social and gender-specific differences in life expectancy can be observed between specific groups and across European countries. Health research and innovation have played a significant part in this achievement but also in improving productivity and quality in the health and care industry. However, the EU continues to face novel, newly emerging or persisting challenges that are threatening citizens and public health, the sustainability of its health care and social protection systems, as well as the competitiveness of its health and care industry. Major health challenges in the EU include: accessibility and affordability of health and care; the lack of effective health promotion and disease prevention; the rise of non-communicable diseases; the increased cases of cancer; the increase of mental illness; the spread of antimicrobial drug resistance and the emergence of infectious epidemics; increased environmental pollution; the persistence of health inequalities among and within countries disproportionally affecting people that are disadvantaged or in vulnerable stages of life; the detection, understanding, control, prevention and mitigation of health risks, including poverty- related aspects, in a rapidly changing social, urban, rural and natural environment; demographic change, including ageing-related issues, and the increasing costs for European health care systems; and the increasing pressure on the European health and care industry to remain competitive in and by developing health innovation vis-a-vis emerging global players. In addition, vaccine hesitancy may decrease immunisation coverage among certain population groups. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 55 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN These health challenges are complex, interlinked and global in nature and require multidisciplinary, technical and non-technical, cross-sectorial and transnational collaborations. Research and innovation activities will build close linkages between discovery, clinical, translational epidemiological, ethical, environmental and socio-economic research as well as with regulatory sciences. They will address areas of unmet clinical needs such as for example rare or hard to treat diseases (cancers, such as paediatric and lung cancer). They will harness the combined skills of academia, practitioners, regulatory bodies and industry and foster their collaboration with health services, social services, patients, policy-makers and citizens in order to leverage on public funding and ensure the uptake of results in clinical practice as well as in health care systems taking into account the competencies of Member States regarding the organisation and financing of their health systems. Full advantage will be taken of genomic and other multiomics frontier research, as well as the progressive introduction of personalised medicine approaches, relevant for addressing a variety of non-communicable diseases and the digitalisation in health and care. Research and innovation will foster strategic collaboration at EU and international level in order to pool the expertise, capacities and resources needed to create scope, speed and economies of scale, as well as to exploit synergies, avoid duplication of effort and share the expected benefits and financial risks involved. Synergies in health research and innovation in Horizon Europe shall be promoted, in particular with the Health Strand within the European Social Fund Plus. Digital health solutions have created many opportunities to solve the problems of care services and to address other emerging issues of ageing society. Full advantage should be taken of the opportunities that digitalisation in health and care can provide without jeopardising the right to privacy and data protection. Digital devices and software have been developed to diagnose, treat and facilitate patients\u2019 self -management of illness, including chronic diseases. Digital technologies are also increasingly used in medical training and education and for patients and other healthcare consumers to access, share and create health information. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 56 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN The research and innovation activities of this global challenge will develop the knowledge base, exploit existing knowledge and technologies, consolidate and create the research and innovation capacity and develop the solutions needed for a more effective promotion of health and the integrated prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, rehabilitation and cure of diseases and (long-term and palliative) care. Results of research will be translated as recommendations for action and communicated with the relevant stakeholders. Improving health outcomes will in turn result in increased well-being and life expectancy, healthy active lives, improved quality of life and productivity, more healthy life years and sustainability of health and care systems. In line with articles 14 and 15 of the Regulation and the Charter for Human Rights and Fundamental Principles, ethics, protection of human dignity, gender and ethnical aspects and the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable people will receive special attention. Addressing major health challenges will support the EU\u2019s commitment to the United Nation's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and those in the context of other UN organisations and international initiatives, including the global strategies and plans of action of the World Health Organization (WHO). It will contribute to the EU's policy goals and strategies, notably to the EU Pillar of Social Rights, the EU Digital Single Market, the EU Directive on cross-border healthcare, and the European One Health Action Plan against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and to the implementation of the relevant EU regulatory frameworks. Activities will contribute directly to the following Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) in particular: SDG 3 \u2013 Good Health and Well-Being for People; SDG13 \u2013 Climate Action. ",

CLUSTER CULTURE, CREATIVITY AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY' 2.1. Rationale The EU stands for a unique way of combining economic growth with sustainable development goals and social policies, with high levels of social inclusion, shared values embracing democracy, human rights, gender equality and the richness of diversity. This model is constantly evolving and needs to deal with the challenges from amongst other things, globalisation and technological change and rising inequalities. The EU must promote a model of inclusive and sustainable growth while reaping the benefits of technological advancements, enhancing trust in and promoting innovation of democratic governance, fostering education, combatting inequalities, unemployment, marginalisation, discrimination and radicalisation, guaranteeing human rights, fostering cultural diversity and European cultural heritage and empowering citizens through social innovation. The management of migration and the integration of migrants will also continue to be priority issues. The role of research and innovation in social sciences, humanities, and arts, as well as in the cultural and creative sectors, in responding to these challenges and achieving the EU\u2019s goals is fundamental. In particular SSH aspects are included in all intervention areas of this cluster. The magnitude, complexity, intergenerational and trans-national character of the challenges call for multi-layered EU action. Addressing such critical social, political, cultural and economic issues only at national level would carry the danger of inefficient use of resources, fragmented approaches and dissimilar standards of knowledge and capacity. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 65 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN Research and Innovation activities in this Global Challenge will be overall aligned with the EU's priorities on Democratic Change; Jobs, Growth and Investment; Justice and Fundamental Rights; Migration; A Deeper and Fairer European Monetary Union; Digital Single Market. It will respond to the commitment of the Rome Agenda to work towards: \"a social Europe\" and \"a Union which preserves our cultural heritage and promotes cultural diversity\". It will also support the European Pillar of Social Rights, and the Global Compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.

Rationale European cooperation has contributed to an era of unprecedented peace, stability and prosperity on the European continent. However, Europe has to respond to the challenges arising from persistent threats to the security of our increasingly complex and digitalised society. Terrorist attacks and radicalisation, as well as cyber-attacks and hybrid threats, raise major security concerns and put particular strain on societies. New, emerging security threats caused by new technologies in the near future, also require attention. Future security and prosperity depend on improving the abilities to protect Europe against such threats. These cannot be dealt with purely by technological means but require knowledge about people, their history, culture and behaviour, and include ethical considerations regarding the balance between security and freedom. Moreover, Europe has to ensure its non-dependence on security-critical technologies and support the development of breakthrough security technologies. European citizens, state institutions, EU bodies and the economy need to be protected from the continued threats of terrorism and organised crime, including firearms trafficking, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings and trafficking of cultural goods. Human and social dimensions of criminality and violent radicalisation require better understanding so as to improve public policies in terms of security. Strengthening protection and security through better border management, including maritime and land borders, is also key. Cybercrime is on the increase and related risks are diversifying as the economy and society digitalise. Europe needs to continue its efforts to improve cybersecurity, digital privacy, personal data protection and combat the spread of false and harmful information in order to safeguard democratic, social and economic stability. Further efforts are required to limit the effects on lives and livelihoods of extreme weather events which are intensifying due to climate change, such as floods, storms, heat waves or droughts leading to forest fires, land degradation and other natural disasters, e.g. earthquakes. Disasters, whether natural or human-made, can put at risk important societal functions and critical infrastructures, such as communication, health, food, drinking water, energy supply, transport, security and government. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 73 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN This requires both technical research and research into the human factors involved to improve disaster resilience, including, where appropriate, testing applications, training and cyber hygiene and education. More efforts are needed to evaluate the results of security research and promote their uptake. This cluster will seek synergies, in particular with the following Programmes: Internal Security Fund, Integrated Border Management Fund and Digital Europe as well as improved research and innovation cooperation between intergovernmental agencies and organisations including through exchange and consultation mechanisms for example in the intervention area 'Protection and Security'. Security research is part of the wider comprehensive EU response to security threats. It contributes to the capability development process by enabling the future availability of technologies, techniques and applications to fill capability gaps identified by policy-makers and practitioners and civil society organisations. Already, funding to research through the EU's framework programme has represented around 50% of total public funding for security research in the EU. Full use will be made of available instruments, including the European space programme (Galileo and EGNOS, Copernicus, Space Situational Awareness and Governmental Satellite Communications). Whereas research and innovation activities under this Programme will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with EU-funded defence research will be sought in order to strengthen synergies, recognizing that there are areas of dual-use technology. Duplication of funding is avoided. Cross-border collaboration contributes to developing a European single security market and improving industrial performance, underpinning the EU's autonomy. Due attention will be given to the human understanding and perception of security. Security research responds to the commitment of the Rome Agenda to work towards \"a safe and secure Europe\", contributing to a genuine and effective Security Union. Activities will contribute directly to the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in particular: SDG 16 \u2013 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. ",

Cybersecurity Malicious cyber activities not only threaten our economies but also the very functioning of our democracies, our freedoms and our values. Cyber threats are often criminal, motivated by profit, but they can also be political and strategic. Our future security, freedom, democracy and prosperity depend on improving our ability to protect the EU against cyber threats. The digital transformation requires improving cybersecurity substantially, to ensure the protection of the huge number of IoT devices expected to be connected to the internet, and the safe operation of network and information systems, including for power grids, drinking water supply and distribution, vehicles and transport systems, hospitals, finances, public institutions, factories, homes. Europe must build resilience to cyber-attacks and create effective cyber deterrence, while making sure that data protection and the freedom of citizens are strengthened. It is in the Union's interest to ensure that it develops and retains essential cybersecurity strategic capacities in order to secure the Digital Single Market, and, in particular, to ensure the protection of critical networks and of information systems and to provide key cybersecurity services. The Union must be in a position to autonomously secure its digital assets and to compete on the global cybersecurity market. ",

CLUSTER 'DIGITAL, INDUSTRY AND SPACE' 4.1. Rationale To ensure industrial competitiveness and the capacity to address the global challenges ahead, the EU must increase its technological sovereignty and its scientific, technological and industrial capacities in the key areas that underpin the transformation of our economy, the work place and society. EU industry provides one out of five jobs and two thirds of private sector R&D investments and generates 80% of EU exports. A new wave of innovation, involving a merging of physical and digital technologies, will trigger huge opportunities for EU industry and improve the quality of life for EU citizens. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 79 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN Digitisation is a major driver. As it continues at a rapid pace across all sectors, investment in priority areas ranging from trustworthy artificial intelligence to next generation internet, high performance computing, photonics, quantum technologies, robotics and micro-/nano-electronics, becomes essential for the strength of our economy and the sustainability of our society. Investing, producing and using digital technologies provides a major boost to EU economic growth, amounting to an increase of 30% between 2001 and 2011 alone. In this context, the role of SMEs remains fundamental in the EU, both in terms of growth and jobs. Digital uptake among SMEs promotes competitiveness and sustainability. Key enabling technologies 12 underpin the blending of the digital and the physical worlds, central to this new global wave of innovation. Investing in research, development, demonstration and deployment of key enabling technologies, and ensuring a secure, sustainable and affordable supply of raw and advanced materials, will secure EU strategic autonomy and help EU industry to significantly reduce its carbon and environmental footprints. Specific future and emerging technologies will also be pursued as appropriate. Space is of strategic importance; around 10% of the EU's GDP depends on the use of space services. The EU has a world-class space sector, with a strong satellite manufacturing industry and a dynamic downstream services sector. Space provides important tools for monitoring, communication, navigation, and surveillance and opens up many business opportunities especially in combination with digital technologies and other sources of data. The EU must make the most of these opportunities by fully exploiting the potential of its space programmes Copernicus, EGNOS and Galileo, and by protecting space and ground infrastructures against threats from space. The EU has the unique chance of being a global leader and increase its share of world markets, by showcasing how digital transformation, leadership in key enabling and space technologies, the transition to a low-carbon, circular economy and competitiveness can reinforce each other through scientific and technological excellence. 12 The Key Enabling Technologies of the future include advanced materials and nanotechnology, photonics and micro- and nano-electronics, life science technologies, advanced manufacturing and processing, artificial intelligence and digital security and connectivity ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 80 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN To make the digitised, circular, low-carbon and low-emission economy a reality, action is needed at EU level because of the complexity of value chains, the systemic and multi-disciplinary nature of the technologies and their high development costs, and the cross-sectoral nature of the problems to be addressed. The EU must ensure that all industrial players, and society at large, can benefit from advanced and clean technologies and digitalisation. Developing technologies alone will not suffice. A societal understanding of these technologies and evolutions is crucial for engaging end users and behavioural change. Industrially-oriented infrastructures, including pilot lines, will help EU businesses, and in particular SMEs, deploy these technologies and improve their innovation performance and may be facilitated also by other EU programmes. A strong engagement of industry and civil society is essential for setting priorities and developing research and innovation agendas, increasing the leverage of public funding through private and public investments, and ensuring the better uptake of results. Societal understanding and acceptance, including consideration of the design of products, goods and services, are key ingredients for success, as well as a new agenda for industry-relevant skills and standardisation. Bringing together activities on digital, key enabling and space technologies, as well as a sustainable supply of raw materials, will allow for a more systemic approach, and a faster and more profound digital and industrial transformation. It will ensure that research and innovation in these areas feed into, and contribute to the implementation of, the EU\u2019s policies for industry, digitisation, environment, energy and climate, circular economy, raw and advanced materials and space. Complementarity will be ensured with activities in particular under the Digital Europe Programme and the Space Programme, while respecting the delineation between Programmes and avoiding overlaps.

Rationale The intersection of research and innovation on climate, energy and mobility will address in a highly integrated and effective way, one of the most important global challenges for the sustainability and future of our environment, economy and way of life. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement the EU will need to transition to climate neutral, resource-efficient and resilient economies and societies. This will entail profound changes in technology, processes, products and services, to the ways in which businesses and consumers behave. The transformation of the energy market will take place through interaction of technology, infrastructure, the market as well as policy and regulatory frameworks, including new forms of governance. Pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C, requires rapid progress in decarbonising the energy, transport, buildings, industrial and agriculture sectors. New impetus is needed to accelerate the pace of developing next-generation breakthroughs as well as demonstrating and deploying cost-efficient innovative technologies and solutions, using also the opportunities provided by digital, bio and space technologies, as well as key enabling technologies and advanced materials. This will be pursued through an integrated approach encompassing decarbonisation, resource efficiency, improved recovery, reuse and recycling, reduction of air pollution, access to raw materials and circular economy in Horizon Europe. Progress in these sectors - but also across the spectrum of EU industry including energy infrastructures, transport, agriculture and forestry, tourism, buildings, industrial processes and product use, waste management and recycling 15 - will require continued efforts to better understand the mechanisms and dynamics of climate change and the associated impacts across the economy and society, exploiting synergies with regional and national activities, other EU types of actions and international cooperation, including through Mission Innovation. 15 Substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors is addressed in other Parts of Pillar II and Horizon Europe in general ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 97 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN Over the past decades, considerable advances have been made in climate science, in particular in observations and data assimilation and climate modelling. However, the complexity of the climate- system and the need to support implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals and EU policies necessitate a reinforced effort to fill the remaining knowledge gaps, further enhance spatial and temporal granularity of climate science while ensuring adequate interaction with citizens and other stakeholders. The EU has established a comprehensive policy framework in the Energy Union strategy, with binding targets, legislative acts and research and innovation activities aiming to lead in developing and deploying efficient energy production systems based on renewable and alternative energy 16 . Transport, including vehicles, ensures the mobility of people and goods necessary for an integrated European single market, territorial cohesion and an open and inclusive society. At the same time, transport can have significant effects on human health, congestion, land, water, climate, air quality and noise, as well as safety resulting in numerous premature deaths and increased socio-economic costs. Demand for goods and mobility will continue to grow. Therefore, innovation will have to bridge growing demand with cleaner and more efficient mobility and transport systems that need to be also safe, smart, secure, silent, reliable, accessible, inclusive and affordable, offering a seamless integrated door-to-door service to all. Both sectors are major drivers of Europe\u2019s economic competitiveness and growth. Transport is a fundamental sector for and of the economy with the EU being a world leader in vehicle, rail, aircraft and vessel design and manufacturing. It embraces a complex network of around 1.2 million private and public companies in the EU, employing around 10.5 million people. The sector is also important for the EU's international trade: in 2016, 17.2% of the EU's total exports of services were transport related. At the same time, the EU has upwards of 2 million people working in the field of renewables and energy efficiency, while patenting of innovative clean energy technologies, places the EU in second place worldwide. 16 The term \"alternative energy\" does not include energy produced from nuclear energy sources. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 98 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN The issues faced by the energy and transport sectors go therefore beyond the need for emission reduction. Effective solutions are needed to respond to changes in user behaviour and mobility patterns, globalisation, increasing international competition and an older, more urban and increasingly diverse, population. At the same time, the increasing penetration of digital and space- based technologies, automated vehicles, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, new market entrants, disruptive business models and the need for increased system resilience against multifaceted hazards (including cyber threats) bring substantive transformation and create challenges and opportunities for the competitiveness of the European transport and energy sectors. Cities' ability to function will become dependent on technology and the liveability of cities will evolve around mobility, energy and resource efficiency, spatial planning and competition in space use. Developments will also be posing a challenge to the sustainability of existing social models and social participation, aspects of inclusion and accessibility as well as affordability. Finding new ways to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy-based and energy efficient technologies (including through intermediate carriers such as power-to-gas and hydrogen) and other non-technological solutions for the decarbonisation of the European economy requires also increased demand for innovation. This can be stimulated through the empowerment of citizens, greening of public procurement as well as socio-economic and public sector innovation and will lead to approaches broader than technology-driven innovation. Socio-economic research covering inter alia user needs and patterns, foresight activities, environmental, regulatory, economic, social, cultural and behavioural aspects, business cases and models and pre-normative research for standard setting and market uptake innovation, will also facilitate actions fostering regulatory, financing and social innovation, skills, as well as engagement and empowerment of market players, consumers and citizens. A better coordination, complementarity and synergy between national and European research and innovation efforts by promoting information exchange and cooperation among EU countries, industries and research institutions will build on the achievements of e.g. the SET-Plan and the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA).

The concepts of the circular economy, the sustainable bioeconomy 17 and the blue economy 18 provide an opportunity to balance environmental, social and economic goals and to set human activities on a path to sustainability. 17 The bioeconomy covers all sectors and systems that rely on biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and derived biomass, including organic waste) , their functions and principles. It includes and interlinks: land and marine ecosystems and the services they provide; all primary production sectors that use and produce biological resources (agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture); and all economic and industrial sectors that use biological resources and processes to produce food, feed, bio-based products, energy and services. Biomedicines and health biotechnology are excluded. 18 \u2018Sustainable blue economy\u2019 means all sec toral and cross-sectoral economic activities throughout the single market related to oceans, seas, coasts and inland waters, covering the Union's outermost regions and landlocked countries, including emerging sectors and non- market goods and services and being consistent with Union environmental legislation.'

But the pathways for the transition to sustainability and ways to overcome resilient barriers are hardly understood. Making the transition to sustainable consumption and production and restoring planetary health requires investment in research and technologies, novel, high quality products and services, new business models, and social, territorial and environmental innovations. This creates new opportunities for a sustainable, resilient, innovative and responsible European bioeconomy, boosting resource efficiency, productivity and competitiveness, generating new and green jobs and growth and increasing social inclusion. It is essential for Europe to use its natural resources more efficiently and in a sustainable manner. Activities will build a knowledge base and deliver solutions to: protect, sustainably manage and use natural resources from land and sea 19 - and enhance the role of terrestrial and aquatic systems as carbon sinks; protect biodiversity, secure ecosystem services and ensure food and nutrition security, providing safe, healthy and nutritious diets; accelerate the transition from a fossil-based linear economy to a resource efficient, resilient, low emission, low-carbon circular economy, and supporting the development of a sustainable bioeconomy and the blue economy; and develop resilient and vibrant rural, mountain, coastal and urban areas. These activities will help to maintain and enhance biodiversity and secure the long-term provision of ecosystem services, such as climate change adaptation and mitigation and carbon sequestration (both on land and sea). They will help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and other emissions, waste and pollution from primary production (both terrestrial and aquatic), the use of hazardous substances, processing, consumption and other human activities. They will trigger investments, supporting the shift towards a circular economy, sustainable bioeconomy and blue economy, whilst protecting environmental health and integrity. 19 The expression \u2018land and sea\u2019 includes \u2018inland waters\u2019 throughout the text of Cluster 6.

Rationale High-quality and trusted scientific evidence is essential for good public policies. New initiatives and proposals for EU legislation need transparent, comprehensive and balanced evidence, whereas implementation of policies needs evidence to measure and monitor their impact and progress. The JRC adds value to EU policies because its science is excellent, multi-disciplinary and independent of national, private and other external interests. Serving all areas of EU policy, it provides the cross-sectoral support that policymakers need to tackle increasingly complex societal challenges. The JRC's independence from special interests combined with its scientific-technical reference role enable it to facilitate consensus building between stakeholders and other actors such as citizens, and policy makers. With its capacity to respond rapidly to policy needs, the JRC's activities are complementary with indirect actions aiming at supporting longer term policy objectives. The JRC performs its own research and is a strategic manager of knowledge, information, data and competences to deliver high quality and relevant evidence for smarter policies. To achieve this, the JRC works together with the best organisations world-wide, and with international, national and regional experts and stakeholders. Its research contributes to the general objectives and priorities of Horizon Europe, provides independent scientific knowledge, advice and technical support for EU policies throughout the policy cycle, and is focussed on European policy priorities, supporting a Europe that is safe and secure, prosperous and sustainable, social and stronger on the global scene.

        "8550/19 MI/lv 139 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN PILLAR III INNOVATIVE EUROPE Innovation in all its forms is a key driver for the EU to continue delivering prosperity to its citizens and meeting challenges of the future. Implementing it requires a systemic, cross-cutting and multifaceted approach. Europe's economic progress, social welfare and quality of life rely on its ability to boost productivity and growth, which, in turn, depends heavily on its ability to innovate. Innovation is also key to solving the major challenges that lie ahead for the EU. Innovation has to be responsible, ethical and sustainable. Like in the case of its predecessor, innovation is at the heart of Horizon Europe. The quest for acceleration of knowledge transfer and new ideas, products and processes is driving Horizon Europe objectives and implementing modalities, from strategic programming to calls, and is present from the onset to the end of any project supported, from 'blue-sky' research to industrial or technological roadmaps and missions. Yet, innovation deserves specific measures, as the EU must decisively enhance the conditions and environment for European innovation to thrive, so that ideas are quickly shared between actors in the innovation ecosystem, and new ideas and technologies swiftly transformed into the products and services needed for the EU to deliver. Recent decades have seen the emergence of major and global new markets in health care, media, entertainment, communication and retail, based on breakthrough innovations in ICT, biotech, green- tech, internet and the platform economy. Further downstream in the innovation process, these market-creating innovations, which impact the EU economy as a whole, are deployed by fast growing and often new companies which, however, seldom originate and scale-up in the EU. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 140 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN A new global wave of breakthrough innovation is coming up, one that will be based on more 'deep- tech' technologies such as block-chain, artificial intelligence, genomics/multiomics and robotics, and other technologies, which may also emerge from individual innovators and communities of citizens. They have in common that they are taking shape at the intersection between different scientific disciplines, technological solutions and economic sectors, offering radically new combinations of products, processes, services and business models, and have the potential to open up new markets worldwide. Additional critical sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, transport or energy will also be impacted. Europe has to ride that wave. It is well positioned as the new wave comes in 'deep-tech' areas, in which Europe has already significantly invested notably in the KETs, has therefore some competitive advantages regarding science and knowledge, including in terms of human resources, and can build on close public-private cooperation (e.g. in health care or energy). For Europe to lead that new wave of breakthrough innovation, the following underlying challenges need to be met: \u2013 Increase risk finance to overcome financing gaps: Europe's innovators suffer from a low supply of risk finance. Private venture capital is key to turning breakthrough innovations into world-leading companies but, in Europe, it is less than a quarter of the amounts raised in the US and in Asia. Europe must bridge the 'Valleys of death', whereby ideas and innovations fail to reach the market due to the gap between public support and private investment, in particular with regard to high-risk breakthrough innovations that have to be supported by long-term investments; \u2013 Facilitate the access to research results, improve the transformation of science into innovation and accelerate the transfer of ideas, technologies and talent from the research base into start- ups and industry; \u2013 Further support the development of all forms of innovation, including user-driven, consumer- driven service and inclusive social innovation; ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 141 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN \u2013 Speed up business transformation: European economy is lagging behind in embracing new technologies and scaling up: 77% of the young and big R&D companies are in US or Asia and only 16% are based in Europe; \u2013 Enhance and simplify the European landscape for funding and supporting research and innovation: the multitude of funding sources provides a complex landscape for innovators. EU intervention has to cooperate and coordinate with other initiatives at European, national and regional level, public and private, to better enhance and align supporting capacities, avoid duplication of activities and provide for an easy-to-navigate landscape for any European innovator; \u2013 Overcome fragmentation to the innovation ecosystem. While Europe is home to a growing number of hotspots, these are not well connected. Companies with international growth potential have to cope with fragmentation of national markets with their diverse languages, business cultures and regulations. The EU has a role to play in supporting effective collaboration between national and regional ecosystems, so that companies, and SMEs in particular, can access the best knowledge, expertise, infrastructures and services across Europe. The EU shall support collaboration between ecosystems, including through regulation, so that interoperability between different technologies and practical solutions is improved. In order to cope with that new global wave of breakthrough innovation, EU support to innovators requires an agile, simple, seamless and tailored approach. Policy to develop and deploy breakthrough innovations and scale-up companies has to be bold in taking risks and must take into account the above-mentioned challenges and add value to related innovation activities implemented by individual Member States or regions. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 142 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN Horizon Europe's Innovative Europe pillar, in cooperation with other EU policies and in particular the InvestEU Programme, is designed to deliver such tangible results. It builds on lessons learned and on experience gained under the previous framework programmes, in particular from activities such as Future Emerging Technologies (FET), Fast Track to Innovation (FTI) and the SME Instrument, but also private and corporate finance (such as FP7 RSFF, Horizon 2020 InnovFin), gathered and streamlined within the ' EIC pilot's activities launched for the period 2018-2020. Based on these experiences, this Pillar provides for the launch of the European Innovation Council (EIC), which will mainly promote breakthrough and disruptive technologies and innovation targeting especially market- creating innovation, while also supporting all types of innovations, including incremental, especially within SMEs including start-ups, and in exceptional cases small- mid-caps with rapid scale-up potential at EU and global level and with dedicated types of actions and activities: \u2013 Supporting the development of future and emerging breakthrough innovations, including \u201cdeep - tech\u201d innovations as well as non -technological innovations; \u2013 Bridging financing gaps in the development, deployment and scaling up of market-creating innovations; \u2013 Leverage private capital and investment; \u2013 Increasing the impact and visibility of EU innovation support. This pillar shall also provide for the activities developed under the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular through its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). Additionally, systematic synergies shall be ensured between the EIC and the EIT. Innovative companies stemming from an EIT KIC may be channelled to the EIC to create a pipeline of not yet bankable innovations, while high potential innovative companies funded by the EIC that are not already engaged in one of the EIT KICs may be offered access to this additional support. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 143 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN Whilst the EIC and the EIT KICs may directly support innovations across the EU, the overall environment from which European innovations nurture and emerge must be further developed and enhanced: findings in fundamental research are seeds for market-creating innovations. It must be a common European endeavour to support innovation all across Europe, and in all dimensions and forms, including through complementary EU and national and regional policies (including through effective synergies with ERDF and smart specialisation strategies) and resources whenever possible. Hence, this Pillar provides also for renewed and reinforced coordination and cooperation mechanisms with Member States and Associated Countries, but also with private initiatives, in order to support all actors of the European innovation ecosystems, including at regional and local level; \u2013 Additionally, as a continued effort to enhance risk-finance capacities for research and innovation in Europe, this pillar will closely link with the InvestEU programme. Building on the successes and the experiences gained under Horizon 2020 InnovFin, as well as under EFSI, the InvestEU Programme will enhance access to risk finance for bankable entities, as well as for investors. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 144 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN 1 THE EUROPEAN INNOVATION COUNCIL (EIC) 1.1. Areas of Intervention The EIC shall operate according to the following principles: clear EU added value, autonomy, ability to take risks, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and accountability. The EIC will act as the one-stop-shop for all types of innovators including from individuals to universities, research organisations and companies (SMEs, including start-ups, and, in exceptional cases, small mid-caps). Depending of its schemes, it will provide support to single beneficiaries and multi-disciplinary consortia. The objectives of the EIC are: \u2013 to identify, develop and deploy high risk innovations of all kinds including incremental with a strong focus on breakthrough, disruptive and deep-tech innovations that have the potential to become market-creating innovations, and \u2013 to support the rapid scale-up of innovative companies mainly SMEs, including start-ups and in exceptional cases small mid-caps at EU and international levels along the pathway from ideas to market. Where relevant, the EIC shall contribute to the activities supported under other parts of Horizon Europe, in particular in Pillar II. The EIC will be implemented primarily through two complementary types of action, namely the Pathfinder for advanced research , for the early stages of technology development, and the Accelerator for innovation and market deployment actions, including the pre-mass commercialisation stages and company growth. With the idea to offer a single one-stop shop and a single process of support for high risk innovations carried out by start-ups, SMEs and, in exceptional cases, small midcaps, the Accelerator will notably award two types of support: mainly blended finance (combining grants with equity investments) as well as grants, optionally followed by equity support. In addition, it will also channel access to loans and guarantees, notably those provided under the InvestEU programme. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 145 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN These two complementary types of actions will share common characteristics. They will: \u2013 Support high-risk innovations where the risks, whether financial, technological/scientific, market and/or regulatory, cannot be borne by the market alone or yet supported by financial instruments under InvestEU; \u2013 Mainly focus on high-risk breakthrough, and/or deep-tech innovations, while also supporting other forms of innovation, including incremental, that have the potential to create new markets or contribute to resolving global challenges; \u2013 Be mainly bottom-up, open to innovations from all fields of science, technology and applications in any sector, while also enabling targeted support for emerging breakthrough, market-creating and/or deep-tech technologies of potential strategic significance in terms of economic and/or social impact. The Commission services will evaluate this potential strategic impact on the basis of recommendations from the independent experts, from the EIC programme managers and, where appropriate, from the EIC Advisory Board; \u2013 Encourage innovations that cut across different scientific, technological (e.g. combining physical and digital) fields and sectors; \u2013 Be centred on innovators, simplifying procedures and administrative requirements, making use of interviews to help assess applications, and ensuring fast decision making; \u2013 Implemented with the aim of significantly enhancing the European innovation ecosystem; \u2013 Be managed pro-actively with milestones or other predefined criteria to gauge progress and the possibility to, after a thorough assessment, with the possible use of independent experts, reorient, reschedule or terminate the projects where needed. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 146 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN As well as financial support, innovators will have access to EIC business advisory services providing to projects coaching, mentoring and technical assistance, and pairing innovators with peers, industrial partners and investors. Innovators will also have facilitated access to expertise, facilities (including innovation hubs 25 and open innovation testbeds) and partners from across EU supported activities including those of the EIT, in particular through its KICs. The Commission will ensure seamless continuity between the EIT, the EIC, and InvestEU, to deliver complementarity and synergies. To allow the strengthening of the European innovation ecosystem, particular attention will be paid to ensuring proper and efficient complementarity with individual or networked Member States or interregional initiatives, including in the form of a European Partnership. 1.1.1. The Pathfinder for Advanced Research The Pathfinder's will provide grants to high-risk cutting-edge projects exploring new and deep-tech areas aiming to develop into potentially radical innovative technologies of the future and new market opportunities. Merging them into a single model with a unique set of criteria. It will build on the experience from the Future and Emerging Technology (FET) schemes supported under FP7 and Horizon 2020, including the Horizon 2020 FET-Innovation Launchpad, as well as the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Phase 1. The Pathfinder overall objective will be to nurture potential market creating innovation out of breakthrough ideas, and bring them to demonstration stage or development of business cases or strategies for further take-up by the Accelerator or any other market deployment solution. To that end, the Pathfinder will support the earliest stages of scientific and technological research and development, including proof of concept and prototypes for technology validation. 25 Innovation Hub is an umbrella term for a broad variety of skills. It can serve as an active partner, a community, a knowledge center, a facilitator or a connector that offers access to latest knowledge and expertise on digital and related enabling technologies necessary for companies to become more competitive with regard to production, services and business processes. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 147 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN In order to be fully open to broad-sweeping explorations, opportunities of serendipity and unexpected ideas, concepts and discoveries, the Pathfinder will be mainly implemented through a continuous and competitive open call with cut-off dates for bottom-up proposals. While maintaining its mainly bottom-up nature, the Pathfinder will also provide for competitive challenges to develop key strategic objectives 26 calling for deep-tech and radical thinking. The topics for those challenges will be determined in the work programmes. Regrouping of selected projects into thematic or objective driven portfolios will allow establishing critical mass of efforts and structuring new multidisciplinary research communities. These portfolios of selected projects will be further developed and enhanced, each along a vision developed with their innovators, but also shared with the research and innovation community at large. The Pathfinder's Transition activities will be implemented to help researchers and innovators develop the pathway to commercial development, such as demonstration activities and feasibility studies to assess potential business cases, and support the creation of spin offs and start-ups. These Pathfinder's Transition activities may also consist of complementary grants to top-up or enlarge the scope of previous and on-going actions, to bring in new partners, to enable collaboration within the portfolio and to develop its multidisciplinary community. The Pathfinder will be open to all types of innovators, from individuals to universities, research organisations and companies, in particular startups and SMEs, and focusing on multi-disciplinary consortia. In the case of single beneficiary projects, mid-caps and larger companies will not be permitted. The Pathfinder will be implemented mainly through collaborative research and in close coordination with other parts of Horizon Europe, in particular with the European Research Council (ERC), the Marie Sk\u0142odowska -Curie Actions (MSCA), the European Ecosystem part of Pillar III and the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) activities to identify radical new ideas and concepts with breakthrough potential. 26 Relevant topics may be identified in the context of the Horizon Europe Strategic planning.

        "8550/19 MI/lv 148 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN 1.1.2. The Accelerator Available private and corporate financing remains scarce between late stage of research and innovation activities and market take-up for high-risk 27 and therefore not 'bankable' or investors- attractive breakthrough and market-creating innovations. In order to bridge the 'valley of death' for any type of high-risk innovations, including in particular breakthrough and 'deep tech' innovations that are key to Europe\u2019s future growth, public support must develop a radically new approach. Where the market does not provide viable financial solutions, public support should provide for a specific risk-sharing mechanism, bearing more if not all of the initial risk of potential breakthrough market-creating innovations to attract alternate private investors in a second stage, as operations unfold and the risk is reduced until the company carrying the innovative project becomes bankable. Consequently the Accelerator will provide financial support to SMEs including start-ups and, in exceptional cases, small mid-caps that have the ambition to develop and deploy in EU and international markets their breakthrough innovations and to scale up rapidly. For that purpose it will build on the experience from the Phases 2 and 3 of Horizon 2020 SME Instrument and from Horizon 2020 InnovFin, including through the addition of non-grant components and the ability to support larger and longer investments. The Accelerator shall mainly provide support in the form of EIC blended finance, as well as grants and equity. The EIC blended finance shall be a mix of: \u2013 Grant or reimbursable advance 28 , to cover innovation activities; 27 Typically as a combination of scientific/technological risks, management/financial risks, market/economical risks and regulatory risks. Unforeseen additional risks may also be taken into account. 28 As an alternative to a grant when risk is deemed lower than average, a reimbursable advance shall be paid back to the EU on an agreed schedule and then becomes an interest-free loan. In case the beneficiary is not able to reimburse, but can continue its activity, the reimbursable advance shall be transformed into equity. In case of bankruptcy, the reimbursable advance becomes just a grant. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 149 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN \u2013 Support for investment in equity 29 or other repayable forms (loans, guarantees, etc.), so as to bridge innovation activities with effective market deployment, including scale-up, in a manner that does not crowd out private investments or distorts competition in the internal market. In case a project is deemed bankable from its initial selection (due diligence), or where the level of risk has been sufficiently reduced, it will channel the selected/supported company to access to debt financing (e.g. loans or guarantees) and on equity financing provided by the InvestEU programme. Blended financial support will be awarded through a single process and with a single decision, providing the supported innovator with a single global commitment to financial resources covering the various stages of innovation down to market deployment including pre-mass commercialisation. The full implementation of the awarded support will be subject to milestones and review. The combination and volume of financing will be adapted to the needs of the firm, its size and stage, the nature of the technology/innovation and the length of the innovation cycle. It will cover financing needs until replacement by alternative sources of investment. The EIC Accelerator will also provide support in the form of grants to SMEs, including start-ups, to carry out a range of innovation types, from incremental to breakthrough and disruptive innovation, who are aiming to subsequently scale up. The support will be provided through the same continuously open and bottom-up call as the one used for the blended-finance support. A start-up or an SME may benefit only once during Horizon Europe from grant-only support from the EIC that will not exceed EUR 2.5 million. Proposals shall include detailed information on the capacities of the applicant to scale up. For projects that have benefitted from a grant-only support, the Accelerator may subsequently upon the request of the beneficiaries provide them with finance support (e.g. \"an equity support only\"), through its \u201cSpecial Purpose Vehicle\u201d (SPV) subject to the due diligence results of the latter. 29 As a principle, the EU is not expected to hold more than a minority of voting rights in companies supported. In exceptional cases, the EU may secure the acquisition of a blocking minority to protect European interests in essential areas, e.g. cyber security. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 150 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN When selected projects are receiving a grant component support for its research and innovation activities; the activities may be implemented in collaboration with public or private research organisations, for example through subcontracting, to ensure that the beneficiary can have optimal access to technical and business expertise. This will allow the beneficiary to develop with a strong foundation in the existing knowledge, expertise and ecosystems across Europe. Where the various risks are reduced (financial, scientific/technological, market, management, regulatory, etc.), the relative importance of the reimbursable advance component is expected to increase. While the EU may bear alone the initial risk of selected innovation and market deployment actions, the aim will be to de-risk these and stimulate, from the out-set and during the development of the action, co-investments from alternative sources and even substitutive investors. In that event, co- investment objectives and times schedule will be agreed with the co-investor(s) and the beneficiaries/supported companies. The Accelerator will mainly operate through a continuously open, and bottom-up call, with cut-off dates, targeting SMEs including start-ups, and in exceptional cases small-mid-caps, including young and female innovators managing or holding key skills in these companies. This open and bottom-up call may be complemented by targeted support for on emerging breakthrough, market-creating and/or deep-tech innovations of potential strategic significance in terms of economic and/or social impact, while maintaining the predominantly bottom up nature of the Accelerator. The topics for this targeted support will be described in the work programmes. Investors, including public innovation agencies, may also submit proposals, but the support shall be awarded directly to the company carrying the innovative project they are interested in. ",

Lastly, they will have experience in overseeing important budgets, which require sense of responsibility. Programme managers will be expected to boost the impact of EIC funding by fostering an \u00ab active management \u00bb culture, combining a sound technological knowledge with a hands-on approach involving development at portfolio and projects levels of vision-based budgets, timelines and milestones EIC projects must meet to receive continued funding. In particular, programme managers oversee the implementation of Pathfinder and Accelerator calls, and provide opinion to the expert evaluation committees, based on clear and fair criteria and in view of a consistent strategic portfolio of projects, expected to make essential contributions to the emergence of potential societal or economic market creating innovations. Programme managers will have the task of nurturing Pathfinder portfolios by developing together with beneficiaries a common vision and a common strategic approach that leads to a critical mass of effort. This will involve the enhancement of new, recently developed fields of research, and the building up and structuring of new communities, with the objective of bringing cutting-edge breakthrough ideas into genuine and mature market creating innovations. Programme managers will implement transition activities , further developing portfolio with relevant additional activities and partners, and closely monitoring potential spin-offs and start-ups. To allow more flexibility, programme managers will review Pathfinder and Accelerator \u2019s projects, for each milestone or predefined criteria at relevant intervals according to the project development, to assess whether they should be continued, reoriented or terminated according to defined methods and procedures for project management. Where relevant, such assessments may involve independent external experts. In accordance with staff regulations, the Commission will ensure that there is no conflict of interest, nor breach of confidentiality, of programme managers in the execution of all their tasks. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 156 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN Given the high risk nature of the actions, it is expected that a significant number of projects will not reach completion. Budget decommitted from such terminations will be used to support other EIC actions and shall be communicated in a timely manner to the Programme Committee. 1.2.3. Implementation of the EIC blended finance The Commission will manage all operational elements of Accelerator projects, including the grant or other non-repayable forms of support. For the purpose of managing EIC blended finance, the Commission shall establish a special purpose vehicle (EIC SPV). The Commission shall seek to ensure the participation of other public and private investors. Where this is not possible at the initial set up, the special purpose vehicle will be structured in such a way that it can attract other public or private investors in order to increase the leverage effect of the Union contribution. The investment strategy of the EIC SPV will be endorsed by the Commission. The EIC SPV shall define and implement an exit strategy for its equity participations, which will include the possibility to propose the transfer of (a share) of an investment operation to the implementing partners supported under the InvestEU programme, where appropriate and for operations whose risks have been sufficiently lowered so that they meet criteria of Article 209(2) of the Financial Regulation. The Programme Committee will be informed accordingly. The EIC SPV will perform due diligence, and negotiate technical terms of each investment in compliance with the principles of additionality and prevention of conflict of interests with other activities of the investees and of other counterparts. The EIC SPV will proactively leverage public and/or private investments into individual Accelerator\u2019s operations. ",

Rationale To fully harness the potential of innovation involving researchers, entrepreneurs, industry and society at large, the EU, together with the Member States, must improve the environment within which innovation can flourish at all levels. This will mean contributing to the development of an effective innovation ecosystem at EU level, and encouraging cooperation, networking, and the exchange of ideas and knowledge, developing open innovation processes in organisations, funding and skills among national, regional and local innovation ecosystems, in order to support all types of innovation, reach out to all innovators across the EU and provide them with adequate support. The EU and Member States must also aim to develop ecosystems that support social innovation and public sector innovation, in addition to innovation in private enterprises. Indeed, the government sector must innovate and renew itself in order to be able to support the changes in regulation and governance required to support the large-scale deployment of innovations, including new technologies and a growing public demand for the more efficient and effective delivery of services. Social innovations are crucial to enhance the welfare of our societies. To attain these objectives, activities will be implemented to complement and to ensure synergies with the EIC\u2019s types of action, as well as with the activities of the EIT, with activities undertaken under other pillars of Horizon Europe and with activities implemented by Member States and Associated Countries, but also by private initiatives. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 158 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN 2.2. Areas of intervention As a first step the Commission will organise an EIC Forum of Member States and Associated countries\u2019 public authorities and bodies in charge of innovation policies and programmes, with the aim of promoting coordination and dialogue on the development of the EU's innovation ecosystem. The EIC Board and the EIT Board will also be associated. Within this EIC Forum, the Commission will: \u2013 Discuss the development of innovation-friendly regulation, through the continued application of the Innovation Principle 32 and development of innovative approaches to public procurement including developing and enhancing the Public Procurement of Innovation (PPI) instrument to drive innovation. The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation will also continue to support internal government innovation efforts, alongside the revamped Policy Support Facility; \u2013 Promote the alignment of research and innovation agendas with EU efforts to consolidate an open market for capital flows and investment, such as the development of key framework conditions in favour of innovation under the Capital Markets Union; \u2013 Enhance coordination between national and regional innovation programmes and innovation activities under Horizon Europe, including notably the EIC and the EIT, so as to stimulate operational synergies and avoid overlaps, by sharing data on programmes and their implementation, resources and expertise, analysis and monitoring of technological and innovation trends, interconnecting respective innovators' communities; 32 Commission Communication of 15 May 2018 'A renewed European Agenda for Research and Innovation - Europe's chance to shape its future' (COM(2018)306, Council Decision of 27 May 2016 (8675/16 RECH 127 COMPET 212 MI 300 POGEN 34).

It will aim at stimulating the EU's most talented innovators, entrepreneurs, particularly young ones, SMEs and start-ups throughout the EU. It will stress the EU added-value that technical, non-technical, and social innovators can bring to EU citizens by developing their idea/vision into a thriving enterprise (social value/impact, jobs and growth, societal progression). The EU will also, in synergy with other Horizon Europe activities, including those of the EIC and EIT, and with the regional smart specialisation strategies: \u2013 Promote and co-fund joint innovation programmes managed by authorities in charge of public national, regional or local innovation policies and programmes, to which private entities supporting innovation and innovators may be associated. Such demand-driven joint programmes may target, among others, early stage and feasibility study support, academia- enterprise cooperation, support to high-tech SMEs' collaborative research, technology and knowledge transfer, internationalisation of SMEs, market analysis and development, digitalisation of low-tech SMEs, support the development and interconnection of open innovation infrastructures, such as pilots, demonstrators, maker spaces and testbeds, financial instruments for close to market innovations activities or market deployment, social innovation. They may also include joint public procurement initiatives, enabling innovations to be commercialised in the public sector, in particular in support of the development of new policy. This could be particularly effective to stimulate innovation in public service areas and to provide market opportunities to European innovators; ",

EN \u2013 Support also joint programmes for mentoring, coaching, technical assistance and other services that are delivered close to innovators, by networks such as National Contact Points, Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), clusters, pan-European platforms such as Startup Europe, regional or local innovation actors, public but also private, in particular incubators and innovation hubs that could moreover be interconnected to favour partnering between innovators. Support may also be given to promote soft skills for innovation, including to networks of vocational institutions and in close cooperation with the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and its KICs; \u2013 Improve data and knowledge about innovation support, including mapping of support schemes, establishing data sharing platforms, benchmarking and evaluation of support schemes. The EU will also launch actions necessary to further monitor and nurture the overall innovation landscape and innovation management capacity in Europe. The ecosystem support activities will be implemented by the Commission, supported by an executive agency for the evaluation process. ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 161 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN PART - WIDENING PARTICIPATION AND STRENGTHENING THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH AREA This part of the Programme shall implement concrete measures in support of widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area. It shall aim to strengthen collaborate links across Europe and open up European R&I networks, contribute to improving research management capacities in the widening countries, support national policy reforms as well as exploit the potential of the Union\u2019s talent pool by targeted actions. The EU has a history of world-class scientific and technological achievements, but its research and innovation potential fails to be fully exploited. Despite much progress in developing the European Research Area (ERA), including the ERA roadmap and national ERA action plans, Europe has still a fragmented research and innovation landscape, and all Member States face bottlenecks in their research and innovation systems which require policy reforms. In some areas, progress is too slow to catch-up with an increasingly dynamic research and innovation ecosystem 33 . The level of research and innovation investment in Europe is still far below the policy objective of 3% of GDP and continues to grow less than our main competitors such as US, Japan, China or South-Korea. Meanwhile, there is a growing disparity in Europe between the R&I-leading and the R&I-lagging countries and regions. Change, for example through more and better links between research and innovation actors across Europe, is needed if Europe as a whole is to capitalise on excellence from across the continent, maximise the value of public and private investments, and their impacts on productivity, economic growth, job creation and well-being. In addition, there is a need for structural R&I policy reforms and better national and regional as well as institutional cooperation in the production and diffusion of high-quality knowledge. 33 The ERA progress report of 2018 ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 162 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN In addition, research and innovation are seen by some as distant and elitist without clear benefits for citizens, instilling attitudes that hamper the creation and uptake of innovative solutions, and scepticism about evidence-based public policies. This requires both better linkages between scientists, researchers, innovators, entrepreneurs, citizens and policy-makers, and more robust approaches to pooling scientific evidence itself in a changing society. The EU now needs to raise the bar on the quality and impact of its research and innovation system, requiring a revitalised European Research Area (ERA) 34 , across the European Union and Associated Countries, better supported by the EU's research and innovation Framework Programme and national and regional programmes. Specifically, a well-integrated yet tailored set of EU measures 35 is needed, combined with reforms and performance enhancements at national level (to which the Smart Specialisation Strategies supported under the European Regional Development Fund as well as the Policy Support Facility can contribute) and, in turn, effective institutional changes within research funding and performing organisations, including universities, leading to outstanding knowledge production. By combining efforts at EU level, synergies can be exploited across Europe and the necessary scale can be found to make support to national policy reforms more efficient and impactful. The activities supported under this part specifically address ERA policy priorities, while generally underpinning all parts of Horizon Europe. Activities may also be established to foster brain circulation across ERA through mobility of researchers and innovators, taking fully into account current imbalances, and to create and develop networks of scholars, scientists, researchers and innovators to put all their (intangible) assets to the service of the ERA and by supporting the development of domain-specific science roadmaps. 34 Council Conclusions on the ERA Roadmap, 19 May 2015 [To be updated as necessary] . 35 TFEU Article 181.2 ",
        "8550/19 MI/lv 163 ANNEX TO THE ANNEX ECOMP.3.C. EN The goal is for an EU where knowledge and a highly skilled workforce circulate freely, research outputs are shared rapidly and efficiently, researchers benefit from attractive careers and gender equality is ensured, where Member States and Associated Countries develop common strategic research agendas, aligning national plans, defining and implementing joint programmes, and where the outcomes of research and innovation are understood and trusted by informed citizens and benefit society as a whole. This part will contribute de facto to all Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but directly to the following: SDG 4 - Quality Education; SDG 5 - Gender Equality; SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 17 - Partnership for the Goals. 1. WIDENING PARTICIPATION AND SPREADING EXCELLENCE Reducing disparities and the existing divide in research and innovation performance by sharing knowledge and expertise across the EU will help widening countries and the EU outermost regions to attain a competitive position in the global value chains and the Union to fully benefit from R&I potential of all Member States. Further action, for example through the promotion of openness and diversity of project consortia, is therefore needed to counter the trend for closed collaborations, which can exclude large number of promising institutions and individuals, including newcomers, and to exploit the potential of the EU's talent pool by maximising and sharing the benefits of research and innovation across the EU. Within the broad areas of activities, the funding lines will facilitate specific research elements customised to the particular needs of the actions.
