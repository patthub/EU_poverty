In the event it did not happen. This part of the building of Europe is for a later day. Virtually everyone agrees that Amsterdam's key achieve\u00ad ments were in employment. At Amsterdam the jobs issue lived up to its long\u00adtrailed de\u00ad scription as the leading prior\u00ad ity on the European agenda. We now have a well\u00addefined and detailed Title on employ\u00ad ment in the Treaty. The Euro\u00ad pean Council Resolution on growth and employment has established a place for employ\u00ad ment policy at the core of the economic decision\u00admaking process in the Union. The importance of this should not gives his views be underestimated. It will enable the EU to develop its labour market policies in close association with its high\u00adprofile macroeconomic and structural policies. With barely a pause, there will be a special European Council on employment later this year under the Luxem\u00ad bourg Presidency. This will be an excellent chance to build on the Amsterdam decisions. It will also give Member States their first opportunity to show how the new Treaty and the new Resolution can be trans\u00ad lated into budgetary planning and commitments for 1998. Member States are still the key players. They will con\u00ad tinue to have the primary role in ensuring that people can participate to the full in a pro\u00ad ductive society. The change has come with a Union\u00adwide shift in awareness. Together Linking Welfare and Work The Foundation is continuing to research the complicated relat\u00ad ionship between welfare and work: a major theme of the Irish Presidency conference New Directions in Social Welfare organ\u00ad ized jointly by the Foundation and the Department of Social Welfare in 1996. Exploratory work is now starting on the theme of LINKING WELFARE AND WORK. Its aim is to examine within one frame\u00ad work, three closely interrelated and topical areas relevant to the welfare policy in the European Union. They concern: \u25a1 various activation measures in combination with social benefits; \u25a1 attempts to increase the incentive to move from welfare to work. \u25a1 current trends in guaranteed minimum income policies. This work was launched at a two\u00adday workshop in Dublin on 2\u00ad3 October 1997. Some 25 experts from the fields of research, policy making and implementation are invited to take part in this seminar, including representatives of the European Commission, OECD, social partners and NGOs. These experts are assisting the Foundation to develop new research activities in the area of activation policy related to employment and social protection. It is planned to publish a monograph of papers developed from this workshop. \u25a0 For further information please contact Teresa Renehan at the Foundation. Ordinary people have been given a very tangible sense of being citizens of the European Union. It has become a Union with a stated commitment to guaranteeing the basic social rights of its people. - tU Commissioner Padraig Flynn we have acknowledged that the failure of one country to fight unemployment can effectively damage the labour markets of others. Together we have made the case for working more closely togeth\u00ad er, the Union and the Member States, each with our different set of roles and responsibil\u00ad ities. We now have more than just a potential for co\u00adordinat\u00ad ion and co\u00adoperation. We have a solid and credible basis. Another success saw us set\u00ad ting the seal on a fully Euro\u00ad pean Social Protocol. We have a single, coherent framework for all 15 Member States, which applies the existing provisions on the social partners across the board. I look forward to seeing the social partners go on to even greater achieve\u00ad ments as agents of social change and modernisation, now that the United Kingdom is able to play its full and con\u00ad structive part in the whole process. We did more. As Commiss\u00ad ioner with responsibility for employment and social affairs, I take real satisfaction in what was achieved on behalf of Eur\u00ad ope's people. We have emer\u00ad ged more able to help those most vulnerable in the EU through provisions on social exclusion and changes in qualified majority voting.

        "ity for women and men has been reinforced through a broadening of the provisions on equality and significant progress was made on the question of fundamental rights of citizens of the Union. Ordinaiy people have been given a very tangible sense of being citizens of the European Union. It has become a Union with a stated commitment to guaranteeing the basic social rights of its people. A new Article prohibiting discrimination in broad terms will enable us to take a stronger stance against racism. These are real achievements. In considering Amsterdam's outcome, we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Of course there is still work to be done, not least as far as civil society is con\u00ad cerned. NGOs are leading players in the provision of social support for people who suffer discriminat\u00ad ion and disadvantage. I will be con\u00ad tinuing to work to see NGOs get\u00ad ting their rightful recognition and taking their place in solid partner\u00ad ships for social policy development. My argument is that Amsterdam basically got Social Europe right and this will have considerable implications for the future of the Union. We now have the tools which will enable the Union to con\u00ad tribute to the modernisation of our social systems, to make them, even more that they have been, positive, vibrant forces for Europe's econ\u00ad omic and social benefit. We are now sending the appropriate sig\u00ad nals and guarantees to European citizens. Amsterdam, by providing both a clear picture of where we are going in terms of employment and social policy and the means to get there, has greatly strengthened not just Social Europe, but Europe itself. As a result of this latest Euro\u00ad pean Council, we are the citizens of a more robust, competitive, attractive and socially cohesive Union, with all that this means for our lives at home, at work and in our individual communities. \u25a0 Members of Finnish Parliament Visit the Foundation The Finnish Parliamentary Committee of Labour Affairs, composed of fifteen Members of the Finnish Parliament, visited the European Foundation on 3 September 1997. The Committee was led by its Chairman, Mr Reijo Lind\u00ad roos, who represents the Social Demo\u00ad cratic Party: the largest party in the Finnish Parliament. The Committee is made up of representatives from the National Coalition Party (conservat\u00ad ives), the Left\u00adwing Alliance, the Swed\u00ad ish People's Party and the opposition parties the Finnish Centre Party (agrar\u00ad ian party) and the one\u00adman party Virtanen Parliamentary Faction. Clive Purkiss, Director of the Found\u00ad ation, welcomed the delegation as the largest single parliamentary group ever to visit the Foundation. He was delighted with the close working relat\u00ad Work Organization and the M a n a g e m e nt of Change European Ecology of Work Conference The Fifth European Ecology of Work Conference was held in the Foundation Conference Centre from 13 to 16 May, 1997. Over 130 delegates from business, government and the social partners took part. Some twenty enterprise case studies were presented, mostly by joint management and unions teams. These sessions looked at how enterprises dealt with organizational change through involving their employees. The emphasis was on co\u00adoperative re\u00addesign and re\u00adstructuring of work and worker participation strategies. The presentations included case studies from Europe, North America, Australia and South Africa and ranged from multinational companies, such as Microsoft and Novartis, to SMEs, such as Dutton Engin\u00ad eering (UK) and Southcorp Wines from Australia and State Ministries. A number of other sessions concentrated on the techniques applied to the change process, and the theories behind their introduction. The attitudes and response of the various players in the change process \u00ad middle management, employees, and unions \u00ad to the new work M*-, environment were highlighted. Panels of leading experts in these different techniques stimulated the discussions. The conference finished with site visits to a number of enterprises in the Dublin area to see these techniques in practice. \u25a0 The proceedings of the conference will be available by the end of 1997.

Research Man\u00ad agers Eberhard K\u00f6hler, Wendy O'Conghaile, Pascal Paoli and Hubert Krieger spoke too about the ongoing trans\u00ad ition toward the information soc\u00ad iety, the creation of new jobs, new working time arrangements, flexiwork, flexible I organisations and Mr Reijo Lindroos. virtual com\u00ad panies. It was pointed out that the transition from mass production to customised special products has many positive aspects but also provides many challenges. One such challenge concerns how good practices in equal opportunities can best be established. Mia Heikkinen spoke on this. Across Europe the problem of high unemployment continues to have priority. There are 18 million unem\u00ad ployed which challenges and points to the need for changes in the welfare society. Social cohesion is endangered by the unequal distribution of income. There is great call for a new way of thinking in the field of social policy. In spite of new technologies work\u00ad ing conditions continue to create major problems. 45 percent of workers are involved in repetitive work and the pace of work is accelerating. The way that workers participate is also changing: with a strong trend to\u00ad wards direct participation existing side by\u00adside with representative part\u00ad icipation. There was lively discussion about these issues. The delegates from the Finnish Parliamentary Committee were especially interested in the inform\u00ad \u2022 continued on page 3 ",
        "ation society and its impact on employment and living and working conditions and in flexible working time arrangements. They had grave concerns about unemployment, the changes affecting the welfare society and decreasing social cohesion. Safety and health, especially with regard to repetitive work and poor working conditions, aroused much discussion. On the positive side, the MPs welcomed the idea of increasing participation, especially through direct participation. Finally Timo Kauppinen, a detach\u00ad ed national expert at the Foundation, argued that a veritable revolution has taken place in Finland, especially within the organisation of industrial relations. This took place in 1995. when Finnish income policy was, for the first time, defined outside Finland, namely in Brussels, where the EMU entry criteria were set and then applied to Finnish income policy. \u25a0 A NOTE FROM THF DIRECTOR T he emphasis coming from the meeting of the Council Ministers in Amsterdam on employment and social policy very much aligns the Foundation's programme for 1997 to 2000 to current priorities of the European Union. The new agenda for employability, growth and job\u00adcreating flexibility, designed to bring advan\u00ad tages to all concerned, is a principle objective of the Foundation's current work. The recognition that social policy needs to be looked at afresh as an essential productive factor has strong echoes in the Foundation's work on social cohesion, equality of opportunities and health and well\u00adbeing. With the incorporation of the social protocol fully into the Treaty, the role of the social part\u00ad ners in progressing actions in the field of social policy will be firmly underpinned. It will require that all parties have access to sound objective information to help point the way to how advances might be made. The role of the Found\u00ad ation, working with the European Institutions, social partners and Member States, is to provide such information in the light of practical experience and identify those factors which will lead to change for the better. \u25a0 \u03c4 Compressed Working Time Compressed working time is the theme of the tenth issue of BEST, the Foundation's Bulletin of European Studies on Time. In this context, compressed work\u00ad ing time means: 1. Spells of more than eight hours, and a working week of less than five full days; 2. Spells of more than eight hours for part\u00adtime workers; 3. More than seven consecutive working days; 4. Service away from home, prim\u00ad arily in the oil and transport industries. The report does not deal with overtime. Since the European Directive on Working Time was approved in Nov\u00ad ember 1993, Member States have been bringing their national laws into line with the Directive, and in some cases have banned twelve\u00adhour shifts. Ten hour shifts appeared in the UK when the working week was reduced to 40 hours in the car in\u00ad dustry, and the workforce preferred four ten\u00adhour nights rather than four and a half nine hour shifts, other examples are given from a wide var\u00ad iety of industries and countries. These range from the simple, especially where the work is discontinuous; to the quite complex, when ten individ\u00ad uals cover four working places in turn. In France, the introduction of the 35\u00adhour working week in hospit\u00ad als led to all Parisian public hospitals using ten\u00adhour night shifts. In Italy air traffic controllers do the longest shift (eleven hours), at the quietest time, i.e. nights, compared with sev\u00ad en hours on afternoon shift and six on morning shift. They then tend to pack these shifts into the shortest time possible, doubling back from a morning shift to a night shift on the same day. Permitted sleep breaks of two to three hours in turn help to ease stress. Twelve hour shifts can be worked on a four\u00adcrew system with a 42 hour average week. However, five and six\u00adcrew systems are often nec\u00ad essary to cover absences. A great advantage of the 12\u00adhour shift is that crew\u00adhandover is more symmetrical than with eight hour shifts: crews mostly take over from the crew to which they handed over. This can be an important factor in plant safety. Even where steady 12\u00adhour shifts are not used continuously, they can be introduced at weekends, to maximise the numbers with weekends free. The conditions and qualifications regarding the use of 12\u00adhour shifts are based on several sources, although there is surprisingly little conclusive evidence about their effectiveness. It suits some part\u00adtime workers to concentrate their work into a few long shifts a week, and examples are given from hospitals and supermarkets. Part\u00adtimers' shifts can be meshed in with those of full\u00adtime workers, as exemplified in Germany and Austria. Long sequences of work also lead to long breaks, as for examples in the steel industry, the health sector, and chemical industry. An interesting example describes the pattern in an Italian paper mill, where the shift system is changed seasonally to con\u00ad dense the work periods and allow the workers time for farming activity too. The variety of shift systems oper\u00ad ating in the oil industry are explored and explained, along with summaries of research on sleep and fatigue off\u00ad shore, and of accidents in the Norweg\u00ad ian oil sector. The commonest pattern in the UK is still 14 hours on 14 hours off with a shift change after one week. For oil\u00adrelated work further afield, some Italian oil workers extend to five weeks on, five weeks off. This tends to attract people for relatively short periods of six to seven years. Several attempts at evaluation of alternative work patterns are report\u00ad ed, but they tend to be inconclusive or mixed in their findings. A wide range of factors need to be carefully examined if compressed working time is to be introduced successfully, and the conclusions distil these from a number of studies.

        "The Contribution of Social Public Services A recent Communication from the European Commission on 'Services of General Interest in Europe' foc\u00ad used upon public services primarily of economic or commercial signif\u00ad icance such as telecommunications, postal services, transport, electricity and broadcasting. The Communic\u00ad ation was prompted by the import\u00ad ance of modernising and develop\u00ad ing these services given their con\u00ad tribution to European competitive\u00ad ness, social solidarity and quality of life. It resulted in a new Article being inserted in the Amsterdam Treaty, calling on Member States to \"take care that services of a general interest operate on the basis of principles and conditions which enable them to fulfil their mission\". The Communication refers to the vital contribution of non\u00adeconomic or 'social public services' \u00ad such as health, welfare, education and housing \u00ad particularly in connection with efforts to promote equality of opportunity and to combat poverty and marginalization. These social public services account for approximately 40% of the gross national product of European coun\u00ad tries and a quarter or so of total employment. Their costs and efficiency are currently high on the political agenda, reflected in calls for their reform and modernisation. The importance of these services for Europe's citizens, but a lack of a focus for EU debate, prompted the Foundation to join the Commission services (DG V) in organizing a workshop in May 1997 on the 'Mod\u00ad ernisation of Social Public Services'. The workshop was attended by 30 experts from research and policy areas as well as from public admin\u00ad istration and the social partners. Allan Larsson, Director General of DG V of the Commission opened the workshop together with the Dir\u00ad ector of the Foundation, Clive Purkiss. Mr Larsson stressed the role of the Commission as a facilitator rather than the main policy\u00admaker in this area. He emphasised the role of the EU as a forum for debate and inform\u00ad ation exchange, for understanding of the common challenges facing Member States, and for the devel\u00ad opment of longer term perspectives. While recognizing that many changes are already underway, such as privatisation, competition bet\u00ad ween services and decentralization, there were many open questions about the relationship between, for example, pressures for change and modernisation processes, and bet\u00ad ween the reforms and their impacts on citizens and workers. The following areas were among many identified for future activity: \u25a1 the role of social public services in building economic and social cohesion; Q users as clients and citizens/ taxpayers; Publications referred to in this issue Best No. 10 - Compressed Working Time.
