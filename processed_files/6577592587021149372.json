        "ISSN 1025-871X wove Editorial T he Florence Summit may seem modest, but it managed to assert itself despite the disturbances which, for a short time, fuelled fears that it might be a \"pointless\" meeting. I, for example, will remember it as being a relatively important turning point for the IGC. From a static phase, with Member State representatives presenting the positions of their governments, we have now moved towards the start-up of real negotiations backed by a tight working schedule and an obligation, so to speak, to produce results. A decision was made to speed up the pace of work and the Irish Presidency has taken a firm and energetic grip on this both delicate and vital phase of Treaty review. While EU leaders were trying to make good progress on the economic and democratic future of Europe in which the rights and interests of citizens are really taken into account, other leaders, in a much wider context, were questioning how we could and should, at world level, ensure decent living conditions for rapidly growing urban populations. I am referring to the Habitat II World Conference held in Istanbul in June.The challenges there were even greater given that no single country, whatever its level of development, is currently able to control the rapid urbanisation taking place almost everywhere in an unmanageable and often chaotic way. Women are often hardest hit by these living conditions which affect them and their children first and foremost, and they were able to make their voices heard in Istanbul. Governments committed themselves to guaranteeing women the same rights and above all to enable them to partici pate fully in the planning process. As usual, the follow-up to this Conference will have to be monitored and pressure brought to bear on governments to keep their promises. As for Europe, it will also have to implement the Habi tat II Action Plan as it has committed itself to do. V\u00e9ronique Houdart-Blazy Head of Section - Information for Women Employment to remain top priority T he June European Council held in Florence brought an end to the row over the ban on British beef which had blocked EU decision-making because of the UK's policy of non-cooperation. The agreement between the UK and its EU partners cleared the way for the Summit to return to normal business. The row over the beef ban left some scars and heads of state had little time to consid er what they said was the EU's top priority, the fight for employment.The issue of equal opportunities was also sidelined to a one- line declaration emphasising that it re mained an important issue. To make up for lost time, an additional meeting of the Eu ropean Council has been called for Octo ber. The Commission's \"Action for Employ ment in Europe: A Confidence Pact\", pre sented by President Jacques Santer, was seen as an important contribution to the em ployment debate. The Summit called for structural policies to become more focused on job creation especially by better support ing Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and local employment initiatives. They said this should not involve any extra EU funds. The Commission's new action plan for SMEs should be adopted by the end of the year, they promised. The Com mission was also asked to come up with an action plan to foster innovation. The idea of setting up, next year, pilot projects on terri torial and local employment pacts to pro mote local job creation and development was backed by the Summit. Member States were asked to select regions or cities inter ested in participating. The recent agreement by the social part ners to start negotiations on flexible work organisation and working time including part-time work, affecting thousands of women, was welcomed by the Council. It urged social partners to take \"initiatives to enhance the integration of young people, the long-term unemployed and unem ployed women into the labour market\". Spotlight on the Intergovernmental Conference After nearly three months of talks, the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) is now ready V' \u00b7 * M to see k \"balanced solutions\" to r *i \u00b7 J the main political issues facing Europe today, said EU heads of state in their Summit conclusions. The Italian Foreign Minister, Piero Fassi no, who reported on the progress of the negotiations to the Council, said he was confident that the conference would be able to reach agreement as planned by mid-1997. The \"first Firenze o CREW solutions\" have already been identified, he said. A major issue was bringing the Union closer to its citizens. There was general agreement that it should be made clear that EU citizenship was additional to, and not a substitute for, national citizenship. The proposed inclusion of a non-dis crimination clause in the revised Treaty raised questions among the negotiators as to whether it should cover race and gender or include other factors such as religion, dis ability and sexual orientation. Another sug gestion was that the present Treaty principle of equal treatment between women and men should be extended beyond social pro visions and also include positive action mea sures. Opinion was also divided as to whether fundamental human and social rights should be part of the revised Treaty. During the talks, some of the negotiators wanted the new Treaty to include rights such as the right to free expression, to freedom of asso ciation, to a healthy environment, to health protection, to equal opportunities, to work and to organize, to cultural diversity and to information from public authorities. The functioning of the European institu tions, especially with further enlargement in sight, remained a contentious issue. Negoti ations revolved around finding a balance be tween the needs of each Meinber State to be well represented at EU level and the de mands of efficiency to ensure decisions can be taken in an open and effective way.

Women key to rural development lhe reform of the EU's agricultural policy over the past io years has lead to a greater emphasis being placed on rural development. More than ever before, farmers are called upon to be rural entrepreneurs. New economic activities are sought alongside agriculture to maintain rural communities and basic services to the rural population which accounts for nearly a quarter of the EU's population and almost 85% of its surface area. There are two inter-linked issues: the situation of women farmers and that of women living in rural areas. I Full agenda for the Irish Presidency Boosting employment, tackling organised crime and drug abuse, preparing for the fi\u00ad nal stage of monetary union and making progress on the IGC were some of the ma\u00ad jor tasks identified by the Irish government when it took over the Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers on 1 July. Irish Foreign Minister and deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring admitted that the presidency would be \"no easy task\" because of the \"daunting agenda\" inherited at a crucial moment in EU history. The question of employment was para\u00ad mount, he said. President Santer's proposed Action for Employment in Europe: A Con\u00ad fidence Pact will be looked at closely. The Irish Presidency also wants to review progress made in all Member States to pro\u00ad mote employment. This would be \"a single, substantive, incisive analysis of the measures taken so far and the effect they are having,\" he said. The result will be presented to the European Council in December. Mervyn Taylor, the Irish Minister for Equality and Law Reform, said the Presi\u00ad dency will be organising a major conference in October on the mainstreaming of equal\u00ad ity. This will also be the occasion for the of\u00ad ficial launch of the Fourth Action Pro\u00ad gramme on Equal Opportunities. The Pres\u00ad idency will be pursuing two equality direc\u00ad tives, he said. The first concerns the amend\u00ad ment of the equal treatment directive fol\u00ad lowing the Kalanke ruling to clarify the type of positive action measures which are permissible. The second draft directive will cover the burden of proof in discrimination cases to make it easier for plaintiffs to argue their case in court. Ireland will also be tabling a resolution on the integration of equal opportunities in the Structural Funds at the 24 September Social Affairs Council. \"The increasing diversification of farm \u2022 activities is leading to an even more impor\u00ad \u25a0 tant role for women,\" said Franz Fischler, \u2022 the European Commissioner responsible for \u2022 agriculture and rural development, during a recent conference on equal opportunities and the Structural Funds. He said the role of ; women was not restricted to agriculture. They played a central part in stimulating rural communities. \"Women are at the fore\u00ad front of the suc\u00ad cessful develop\u00ad ment of farm tourism,\" for example. They \u2022 are also actively involved in new e m p l o y m e nt opportunities emerging in rural areas, such as teleworking. Commission\u00ad er Franz Fis\u00ad chler said the .. EU's Structural Funds tend to benefit men more than \u2022 women. Despite women representing over \u2022 one\u00adthird of the active agricultural popula\u00ad 1 tion and 10% of heads of farms, they are still seen as playing an essential but subordinate role, he said. Women in rural areas face lim\u00ad ited employment opportunities, inadequate childcare, insufficient public transport which rarely meets their demands and a lack of training. \"These disadvantages underpin the need to provide resources which can \u03b9 ensure equal opportunities for women liv\u00ad ing in rural areas.\" Commissioner Fischler said the Commis\u00ad sion, in response to this, has set aside 20 mil\u00ad \u25a0 lion ECU for 1997\u00ad1999 to fund pilot pro\u00ad jects promoting women's participation in rural development. An additional 400,000 ECU is earmarked for information activities targeting rural women. The Commissioner is also organising a major European confer\u00ad ence on rural development in Ireland on 7\u00ad 9 November which will include a workshop on equal opportunities between women and men with a specific focus on employ\u00ad ment. A study on the role played by women \u2022 in farming and a comparative analysis of na\u00ad \u2022 tional social protection regulations for farm\u00ad \u2022 ing women were also in the pipeline, he \u2022 said. EU should become a signatory to the Euro\u00ad pean Rural Charter under consideration in the Council of Europe. The proposed Charter aims to give a framework for action in European rural ar\u00ad eas to balance existing agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture industries, on the one hand, with a healthy environment and a capacity for attracting economic activities, and retaining and developing the rural popu\u00ad lation. Liam Hyland, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Develop\u00ad ment, is draw\u00ad ing up the Par\u00ad liament's report on EU rural policy and the proposed Rural Charter. He said that EU rural policy must embrace agricul\u00ad tural, social, regional and environmental policies, involve local populations and pay special attention to female employment. On behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, Birgitta Ahlqvist was critical of the Rural Charter, saying it did not once men\u00ad tion the contributions and specific problems of women in the countryside. Yet, she ex\u00ad plained, the problems of today's rural society often have a bigger impact on women than on men. Women carry the largest share of caring for the young and elderly as well as playing a vital economic and social role in their communities.

        "September 1996 \u00b7 n\" 63 Committee on Women's Rights C o l e t te Flesch, Director General of DG X, gave an overview of informa\u00ad tion targeted more specifically at women within her DG. She underlined some recent positive developments includ\u00ad ing: \u00ad the trend towards mainstreaming or in\u00ad cluding the women's dimension in all Com\u00ad munity activities and information actions, \u00ad the evaluation of the DG's traditional activities to match them better with the de\u00ad mands of women, \u00ad developing significantly the work on publications, maintaining traditional activi\u00ad ties and taking on an advisory role, \u00ad priority information actions. Speaking on the work of the Women's In\u00ad formation Sec\u00ad tion, Colette Flesch high\u00ad lighted its pub\u00ad lications saying they had been o v e r h a u l e d, both in form and content, in the last year. Since May 1996, they are distributed in the 11 officiai EU languages. Special issues are published on current affairs (Beijing Conference, 9 May, Europe Day). The provision of on\u00adline information is now being examined to bet\u00ad ter reach the target public, especially since women are increasingly surfing the Inter\u00ad net. The Section has established close working relationships with different bodies and net\u00ad works including associative movements, lo\u00ad cal and regional elected women representa\u00ad tives, networks of women journalists. The Section also participates in numerous Com\u00ad mission working groups such as the interde\u00ad partmental group for equal opportunities and has an advisory role among certain DGs in the framework of specific sectoral poli\u00ad Finally, Colette Flesch explained the ac\u00ad tivities being prepared specifically for women under the priority information ac\u00ad tions: \u00ad the \"Citizens First!\" information action, \u00ad the \"Euro\" information action, \u00ad \"Building Europe together\": under this action a conference will be held in Vienna under the theme of women and the future of Europe. A two\u00adday symposium will take place in Turin, organized by the ILO and the European Trade Union Confederation, attended by the main women's unions on women's employment, workers' rights, equal opportunities. Colette Flesch was invited to provide an overview of the activities of her DG regu\u00ad larly to the Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights. A number of reports and opinions drawn up by Committee members were discussed. Looking at the implementation of equal op\u00ad portunities for men and women in the Eu\u00ad ropean civil services, rapporteur Jessica Larive wanted to see a review of selection procedures and to extend the derogation on the age limit for entrance to written com\u00ad petitions. In her report on the Commission's communication on mainstreaming, Angela Kokkola recommended setting up a special service within the Commission's General Secretariat to monitor the implementation of equality in all Commission policies and programmes. Rouva Riita Jouppila introduced her opinion on the Commission's communica\u00ad tion on human rights by saying poverty, ed\u00ad ucation, training, violence against women and the imbalance of women in decision\u00ad making were all issues that needed to be in\u00ad cluded. Many members wanted to see a so\u00ad cial and human rights clause appear in all trade agreements. Reporting on the 1997 budget, Lissy Gr\u00f6ner called for the reinstatement of the original 12 million ECU financial envelope for the 4th Action Programme cut by min\u00ad isters to 6 million ECU. To \"mainstream\" the budget, she is proposing to insert a com\u00ad ment on equal opportunities under numer\u00ad ous budget lines especially those concerning the Structural Funds. The Commission's equal opportunities activities were presented by Odile Quintin, Director of Commission's DG V/D. She outlined the current state of play on a num\u00ad ber of draft directives and said the Commis\u00ad sion was planning a communication on the individualisation of social rights for early next year. \u00b7 For further information: Mary Brennan European Commission, General Secretariat avenue des Nervlens 9, B-1049 Brussels.

        "The United Nations City Summit looks to a new future \u03a4 he future of the world's cities and the management of urban resources was the focus of the United Nations' Habitat II Conference held in Istanbul, Turkey, from 3 to 14 June. This was the second UN Conference on Human Settlements (the first was held in Vancouver in 1976). It addressed the problems of housing and shelter in a rapidly urbanizing world. An estimated 16,400 people attended Habitat II including many government leaders who adopted the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements. In this Declaration, they recognised the right to housing for all and committed themselves to improving standards of living and promoting the sustainable development of cities, towns and villages. Today, 100 million peo\u00ad ple are homeless in the world and hundreds of mil\u00ad lions live in life-threatening shel\u00ad ters. Some 40% of urban dwellers world\u00ad wide do not have access to safe drinking water or adequate sanitation. Everyday, some 50.000 people, mainly women and children, die as a result of bad living conditions. By the year 2025, two- thirds of the world's population will be living in cities. These were some of the figures which formed the backdrop for debate at the Habitat II Conference and showed the scale of the problem worldwide. Migration from rural areas accounts for 40 per cent of the urban increase. Women migrate to cities as much as men for economic reasons. But for them, the road is much harder. Already representing 70% of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty, they are the fastest growing group of im\u00ad poverished. \u00bb Overwhelmed by the rapid population growth, many of the world's cities have found themselves unable to ensure adequate shelter and basic services turning them into potential social timebombs. The UN Secre\u00ad tary General, Boutros Boutros Ghali, open\u00ad ing the Conference, said that these same ur\u00ad ban areas are also where future generations will look to find most of their employment and economic growth. He said \"we face a future for \u2022which the past is no guide.\" The world's \"human settlements must therefore, become sustainable, productive, safe, healthy , and humane.\" This is what government leaders promised to strive for by signing the Decla\u00ad ration. Adequate housing was recognised as a universal right. Adequate means healthy, safe, secure, accessible and affordable. Gov\u00ad ernments saw their role as one of \"enablers\" rather than as providers of low cost housing by ensuring property markets worked in a more efficient and socially responsible man\u00ad ner and by facilitating the involvement in urban planning of all the stakeholders: NGOs, local populations, the private sector and local government. They promised action to guarantee equal\u00ad ly to women and men security of tenure, ac\u00ad cess to land, access to credit and protection from arbitrary evictions and to accompany the provision of adequate shelter with af\u00ad fordable basic services including drinking water, energy and transport. Local authorities, the private sector and community groups must work in partner\u00ad ship with governments to plan, manage and bring improvements in the urban environ\u00ad ment. This is why for the first time at a UN Women who migrate from rural areas often face special disadvantages which make it difficult to provide for their families In the city. Photo above: Rural migrants in Mexico City. C UNPF/Mark Edwards, Still Picture\u00b7 Conference, mayors of towns and cities, lo\u00ad cal authority officials, NGOs, community and women's organisations and representa\u00ad tives of the private sector were given a dis\u00ad cussion platform alongside national govern\u00ad ments and took part in negotiating the Habitat Agenda and defining the contents of the Global Plan of Action. The EU was represented at the Confer\u00ad ence by the Italian Presidency in the person of the Minister for Public Works, Antonio Di Pietro, who signed the Declaration con\u00ad firming the EU's political will to implement the Habitat Action Plan. Welcoming the idea of wider partnerships between govern\u00ad ments and local communities, he explained the responsibility for the Action Plan's im\u00ad plementation will lie with each Member State. Women, homes and the community Dominating the world's poor, women as a group were key to the debate at Habitat II. A special Commission made up primarily of N GO representatives, was set up by Dr Wal\u00ad ly N'Dow, the Secretary General of Habitat II, to ensure gender concerns were carried forward at the Conference. The final Habi\u00ad tat document calls for women's equal access to housing, to decision making, to improved health and the eradication of poverty. Government leaders said that women's equality should be included in all aspects of urban development with women fully par\u00ad ticipating in the planning process. This should avoid past mistakes such as inad\u00ad equate lighting of streets and public ar\u00ad eas; the absence of daycare facilities and children's play parks; inappropriate loca\u00ad tion of public water points; costly and inconvenient public transport; and hous\u00ad ing design that did not take account of women's specific needs when using space. The right to property was another major issue for women. Legal systems in many countries, or local customs and traditions, bar women from owning or inheriting property. A commitment was made by governments pledging legal se\u00ad curity of tenure for all women, their right to own and inherit land and build\u00ad ings and their equal access to housing cred\u00ad its. An Indian women's initiative, The Self- Employed Women's Bank of India, which pro\u00ad vides loans at market rates to women, won a prize at the Conference. It was selected by an international jury as one of 12 best prac\u00ad tice examples for improving the living envi\u00ad ronment. Closing Habitat II, Dr N'Dow said that the Conference had shown conclusively \"that the resources exist to put a roof over the head and bring safe water and sanita\u00ad tion, for less that $100 dollars per person to every man, woman and child on this plan- et.\"The Conference had also shown that the viability of cities rests on their ability to pro\u00ad vide a livelihood for their dwellers. This means greater social investment in health and in education to ensure women and men \u2022 have the skills to fill the jobs of tomorrow.
