        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 9 Introduction This report is an update to the EASO COI Report: Iraq Key Socio-economic Indicators, published in September 2020. The purpose of this report is to provide relevant information for the assessment of international protection status determination, including refugee status and subsidiary protection. In particular, it is intended to inform the update of the chapter on Internal Protection Alternative (IPA) within the EASO Country Guidance on Iraq 2021 update. This report provides information on key socio- economic indicators in Iraq, focusing on the cities of Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah and highlights aspects of the legal and administrative requirements for Iraqis to enter and settle in the respective city, ID documents and access to basic services, the situation of IDPs and returnees, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology This report is produced in line with the EASO COI report methodology (2019) 2 and the EASO COI Writing and Referencing Guide (2019) 3 . The reference period for this report covers the time period between 1 August 2020 and 15 October 2021. Some additional information was added during the finalisation of this report in response to feedback received during the quality control process, until 31 October 2021. In this quality review process, a review was carried out by a COI specialist from the Netherlands as stated in the Acknowledgments section of this report, and internally by EASO. All comments made by reviewers were taken into consideration and most of them were implemented in the final draft of this report. Furthermore, and since this report is an update to the previous Iraq Key Socio-economic Indicators report published in September 2020, reference to that report was included for background information and where no new information was available. In those sections where no specific information was found on the respective city, information on the governorate was included. Where possible, the distinction is made in the report. Defining the terms of reference The terms of reference of this report are based on the input received from policy experts from EU+ countries 4 within the context of an EASO country guidance development on Iraq. It was determined that the report will concentrate information on the main urban areas of Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah, within the relevant national context. Members of the EASO COI Specialist Network on Iraq and EASO Country Guidance Network were consulted and gave input on the ToR prior to its finalisation. After consultation with stakeholders, it was determined that information on the situation in Sulaymaniyah would also be beneficial to decision makers. For this reason, it was covered in this report in lieu of Erbil as a representative city for northern Iraq for this update.

The TOR for this report can be found in the Annex 2: Terms of Reference. Sources In accordance with EASO COI methodology, a range of different published documentary sources have been consulted on relevant topics for this report. These include: COI reports by governments; information from civil society, advocacy groups, humanitarian organisations, and NGOs; international and NGO human rights reports; reports produced by various bodies of the United Nations; Iraqi and regionally-based media and social media; academic publications and think tank reports and specialised sources covering Iraq. Additionally, at the request of the drafters, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provided information regarding access to residency in Sulaymaniyah through written correspondence. Structure and use of the report The report is divided into three main parts: Part 1 deals with access and residency requirements for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah, including legal and administrative requirements for Iraqis to enter and settle in those cities. Part 2 covers key socio-economic indicators in the three cities, including the economy, employment, poverty, food security, healthcare, education and housing and living conditions.

Access and residency requirements for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 1.1 General information on access and residency requirements In Article 44 (1), the Constitution of Iraq grants that \u2018each Iraqi has freedom of movement, travel, and residence inside and outside Iraq\u2019 while, in Article 44 (2), it stipulates that \u2018no Iraqi may be exiled, displaced, or deprived from returning to the homeland.\u2019 6 Iraq also has a National Policy on Displacement, dating from July 2008, which provides for a broad range of IDP rights including non-discrimination and freedom of movement. 7 Under the provisions on the Right to Freedom of Movement, Section 6.9 states that: \u2018The competent authorities have the responsibility to ensure that the IDPs enjoy the right to move freely and choose their place of residence. It also includes the right to return and rehabilitate themselves in their places of origin or habitual residence, local integration or resettlement in other places in Iraq. [...] The Government ensures that a person\u2019s freedom of movement and choice of place of residence will not be subject to any restrictions save those maintained by the law as they are deemed necessary for reasons pertaining to national security, public order or health, morals or other people\u2019s rights and freedoms. The governorates and local authorities shall not prevent IDPs from residing in their areas, and they shall not create obstacles to that effect. The Government of Iraq realizes the consequences that resulted regionally from imposing internal obstacles on those who have been seeking safety.\u2019 8 According to information from October 2018, the Ministry of Displacement and Migration (MoDM), created after 2003, was the federal body entrusted with addressing IDP and returnee issues under the National Policy on Displacement, and reportedly maintained offices in all governorates. 9 When the 2014 ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) crisis began and with the 2008 National Policy on Displacement proving to be inadequate to tackle the challenges arising from new mass displacement, Iraq established an additional body 10 called the Supreme Committee for the Relief and Shelter of Families Displaced by Terrorist Operations (renamed in 2019 into Higher Committee for the Relief and Support of the Displaced) 11 to coordinate the intersectoral response. 12 6 Iraq, Constitution of the Republic of Iraq, 15 October 2005, url, Article 44 (1), (2) 7 Iraq, National Policy on Displacement, July 2008, url, section 6 8 Iraq, National Policy on Displacement, July 2008, url, section 6.9 9 Chatelard, G., Comment made during the review of EASO Report on Internal Mobility, 10 October 2018, cited from EASO, COI Report: Iraq \u2013 Internal Mobility, February 2019, url, p. 15, footnote 28; see also Costantini, I. and Palani, K., Displacement-Emigration-Return: Understanding Uncertainty in the Context of Iraq, MERI, January 2018, url, p. 37 10 Costantini, I. and Palani, K., Displacement-Emigration-Return: Understanding Uncertainty in the Context of Iraq, MERI, January 2018, url, p. 38 11 Iraq, Government of Iraq, Cabinet approves measures to strengthen support for people displaced by terrorist operations, 25 December 2019, url 12 Costantini, I. and Palani, K., Displacement-Emigration-Return: Understanding Uncertainty in the Context of Iraq, MERI, January 2018, url, p. 38 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 13 While the KRI, unlike Baghdad-administered Iraq, does not have a ministry dedicated to the issue of displacement, 13 the Joint Crisis Coordination Cell (JCCC) was formed in 2015 as a body within the Kurdish Ministry of Interior to coordinate responses to the displacement crisis. 14 Iraq\u2019s security forces are authorised to restrict movement within the country 15 and, in recent years, local authorities in many areas have put in place requirements relating to access and residency. 16 According to UNHCR, these \u2018access and residency requirements are not always officially announced and/or clearly defined, and/or implementation can vary or be subject to changes depending on political or security dynamics\u2019. 17 They have also been enforced selectively on ethno-sectarian grounds. 18 In the face of mass displacement prompted by the expansion of ISIL and the ensuing military conflict between 2014 and 2017, authorities have imposed restrictions on entry and residency in numerous localities, including sponsorship requirements. In some places, they have imposed near-total entry bans for people originating from conflict areas, especially Sunni Arabs. While access bans and entry restrictions had been lifted in most places by early 2020, sponsorship and other clearance requirements still existed in several governorates as of January 2021 with regard to residency for persons from areas formerly held by ISIL or affected by conflict. 19 Two of the main obstacles to freedom of movement and residency for IDPs and returnees are proving one\u2019s identity and obtaining security clearance. 20 Missing civil documents (as a result of documents being lost or left behind while fleeing, confiscation of documents or destruction of civil registries during conflict 21 ) have been reported as a major concern for 43 % of IDP households living outside camps, 55 % of camp-based IDP households and 57 % of returnee households across the country. 22 For more information regarding lost civil documentation, as well as the requirements for obtaining ID documents, please see section 3.1 Requirements to obtain ID documents. Security clearance for persons with alleged affiliation with ISIL involves a review by security services. Moreover, the process \u2018relies centrally on the mukhtar , the local headman in the displaced person\u2019s hometown or city neighbourhood\u2019, who acts in coordination with the security forces 23 and can provide a signed letter attesting that a person suspected of ISIL affiliation has not actually committed any crime. 24 For more information relating to security clearance requirements for 13 Khedir, H.

Individuals alleged to be affiliated with ISIL appear to have limited prospects for settling outside of IDP camps 25 as they are subjected to denial of security clearance by security forces 26 or are compelled to undergo procedures that involve reporting relatives with alleged ISIL ties to the authorities or disavowing these relatives 27 in order to obtain civil documents. 28 What is meant by ISIL affiliation, however, varies by location. In some places ISIL affiliation is attributed to persons who lived in ISIL- held areas or those who did not flee until the military offensive was underway. In other places, it may only refer to those who have close family members directly involved in crimes committed by the group. 29 1.2 Legal and administrative requirements to enter the respective city 1.2.1 Baghdad Baghdad City has a mixed resident population that includes \u2018Sunni and Shia Arabs with smaller pockets of Christians, Sunni and Shia Kurds, and Sunni and Shia Turkmen\u2019. The city\u2019s displaced population is composed mainly by Sunni Arab. 30 A person is required to hold a valid identity document (e.g., Civil Status ID card, Iraqi Nationality Certificate, or passport) 31 in order to be allowed to pass checkpoints and be admitted into Baghdad. 32 As of January 2021, individuals originating from areas formerly held by ISIL or affected by conflict (including returnees from a third country) do not need a sponsor to enter Baghdad governorate. 33 1.2.2 Basrah The majority of Basrah City\u2019s population is Shia, 34 while it also includes a minority of Sunnis, 35 a small Christian community 36 and other groups including Sabean Mandeans. 37 25 IOM, Cities as Home: Understanding Belonging and Acceptance Among IDPs and Host Communities in Iraq, 19 October 2020, url, p. 29 26 UNOCHA, Iraq: 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 7 February 2021, url, p. 74 27 IOM, Protracted Displacement in Iraq: Revisiting Categories of Return Barriers, 24 January 2021, url, pp. 31-32 28 UNOCHA, Iraq: 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 7 February 2021, url, p. 74 29 IOM, Protracted Displacement in Iraq: Revisiting Categories of Return Barriers, 24 January 2021, url, p. 31 30 IOM, Cities as Home: Location Factsheets and Case Studies of Local Integration, 6 January 2021, url, p. 39 31 Since 2018/19, the Civil Status ID Card and Iraqi Nationality Certificate have been progressively replaced by the Unified ID Card, a biometric document that functions both as nationality and ID certificate.

        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 15 A person is required to hold a valid identity document (e.g., Civil Status ID card, Iraqi Nationality Certificate, or passport) in order to be able to pass checkpoints and be admitted into Basrah. 38 As of January 2021, individuals originating from areas formerly held by ISIL or affected by conflict (including returnees from a third country) do not need a sponsor to enter Basrah governorate. 39 1.2.3 Sulaymaniyah Sulaymaniyah City has a predominantly Sunni Kurdish resident population, with smaller numbers of Shia Kurds, Sunni and Shia Arabs, Christians and other minorities. Since 2014, the city \u2018has hosted primarily Sunni Arab IDPs from across conflict-affected governorates\u2019. 40 A person is required to hold a valid identity document (e.g., Civil Status ID card, Iraqi Nationality Certificate, or passport) in order to be able to pass checkpoints and be admitted into Sulaymaniyah governorate. 41 IDPs, including ethnic Arabs and Turkmen not originating from the KRI, such as those stemming from areas formerly held by ISIL or affected by conflict, do not need a sponsor to enter Sulaymaniyah governorate. 42 However, IDPs need to undergo a security screening and clearance process (for which holding ID documentation is a prerequisite) before they are allowed to enter Sulaymaniyah governorate. 43 Regarding Iraqi Arabs whose Civil Status ID Card or Unified ID Card has been issued in a governorate outside the KRI and who also do not have a residency permit from any KRI governorate, UNHCR states that \u2018upon entry to Sulaymaniyah governorate at an internal border checkpoint and following security screening, the Asayish 44 generally provides such persons with a temporary entry authorization (Tourist Visitor Card) valid for 30 days\u2019. This authorisation is granted for short-term visits (for business, shopping, medical care, or similar purposes) and \u2018enables the holder to enter and remain in Sulaymaniyah governorate within the validity period of the authorization\u2019. It does not authorise the holder to rent a house or obtain regular employment (they are however able to rent accommodation in a hotel).

Iraqi Arabs whose Civil Status ID Card or Unified ID Card has been issued in one of the governorates that are part to the KRI are generally able to enter Sulaymaniyah governorate without restrictions by presenting such documents. Iraqi Arabs who hold a residency permit issued by any of the four KRI governorates, but whose civil documentation has been issued in a governorate outside the KRI, are able to enter Sulaymaniyah governorate by showing their \u2018residency permit\u2019. 46 For further information on this permit, please see section 1.3.3 Sulaymaniyah on legal and administrative requirements to settle in the respective city. The same source indicates that the following requirements apply for Iraqi Kurds or Yazidis \u2018from outside the KRI\u2019, i.e., those whose Civil Status ID Card or Unified ID Card has been issued in a governorate falling under the administration of the Iraqi federal government: Iraqi Kurds can enter Sulaymaniyah governorate by \u2018presenting their Civil Status ID Cards or Unified ID Cards, regardless of the governorate in which their documents have been issued\u2019. Iraqi Yazidis are, in practice, treated similarly to Iraqi Kurds and \u2018can enter Sulaymaniyah governorate by showing their Civil Status ID Card or Unified ID Card, regardless of where these have been issued\u2019. 47 1.3 Legal and administrative requirements to settle in the respective city 1.3.1 Baghdad IDPs seeking to stay in Baghdad are required to hold identity documentation in order to be able to obtain security clearance from the local security forces. This security clearance relating to the conflict with ISIL is the prerequisite for obtaining residency. Once clearance has been obtained, the individual can apply for residency documentation. 48 UNHCR reported that, as of January 2021, all individuals, including those originating from areas formerly held by ISIL or affected by conflict (as well as returnees from a third country), are requested to have a letter of support from the mukhtar of the neighbourhood where they intend to reside, in addition to two sponsors from the same neighbourhood. 49 Meanwhile, IOM noted that IDPs need either a support letter from the mukhtar or sponsorship from two residents of the relevant neighbourhood. 50 Meanwhile, former Baghdad residents who have a Housing Card (\u2018Information Card\u2019) issued in Baghdad and intend to take up residency again in the same neighbourhood do not need sponsors or a support letter from the mukhtar . The housing card indicates the address at which the household head owns or rents a house or flat and is issued by the General Directorate for Nationality within the Ministry of the Interior. 51 46 UNHCR, Access to and Residency in Sulaymaniyah \u2013 Response to ACCORD, 25 October 2021, p. 1 47 UNHCR, Access to and Residency in Sulaymaniyah \u2013 Response to ACCORD, 25 October 2021, p. 3 48 IOM, Cities as Home: Understanding Belonging and Acceptance Among IDPs and Host Communities in Iraq, 19 October 2020, url, p. 29; see also IOM, Cities as Home: Location Factsheets and Case Studies of Local Integration, 6 January 2021, url, p. 41 49 UNHCR, Relevant Country of Origin Information to Assist with the Application of UNHCR\u2019s Country Guidance on Iraq: Ability of Persons Originating from Formerly ISIS-Held or Conflict-Affected Areas to Legally Access and Remain in Proposed Areas of Internal Relocation, 11 January 2021, url, p. 3 50 IOM, Cities as Home: Location Factsheets and Case Studies of Local Integration, 6 January 2021, url, p. 41 51 UNHCR, Relevant Country of Origin Information to Assist with the Application of UNHCR\u2019s Country Guidance on Iraq: Ability of Persons Originating from Formerly ISIS-Held or Conflict-Affected Areas to Legally Access and Remain in Proposed Areas of Internal Relocation, 11 January 2021, url , p. 3, footnote 8 ",

Moreover, the relevant Operations Command at the Governorate level must grant additional security clearance to the security clearance given by local security actors. 55 1.3.3 Sulaymaniyah According to IOM, IDPs displaced within the KRI originate either from outside the region or from the territories disputed between the KRI and the Federal Government of Iraq. As for IDPs from the KRI who have been displaced to other regions, authorities in the region\u2019s major cities, including Sulaymaniyah, have \u2018no instructions, regulations, or laws\u2019 with regard to their returns. As a result, those IDPs who have returned have reportedly done so either spontaneously or under the Federal Government of Iraq regulations that have been applied to all IDPs in the country. 56 As of January 2021, ethnic Arabs and Turkmen originating from outside the KRI, including those from areas formerly held by ISIL or affected by conflict, are not required to have a sponsor but \u2018must approach the local Asayish in the neighbourhood in which they seek to reside in order to obtain a residency permit issued by Asayish \u2019. 57 In order to obtain residency permission, they need security clearance. 58 While this permit, which is issued in the form of an ID card proving legal registration with the Asayish , 59 is commonly called \u2018residency permit\u2019, it is in fact a security clearance permit that is issued by the Asayish . 60 52 IOM, Cities as Home: Location Factsheets and Case Studies of Local Integration, 6 January 2021, url, p. 41 53 IOM, Cities as Home: Understanding Belonging and Acceptance Among IDPs and Host Communities in Iraq, 19 October 2020, url, p. 30 54 IOM, Cities as Home: Location Factsheets and Case Studies of Local Integration, 6 January 2021, url, p. 41 55 UNHCR, Relevant Country of Origin Information to Assist with the Application of UNHCR\u2019s Country Guidance on Iraq: Ability of Persons Originating from Formerly ISIS-Held or Conflict-Affected Areas to Legally Access and Remain in Proposed Areas of Internal Relocation, 11 January 2021, url, p. 3 56 IOM, Cities as Home: Understanding Belonging and Acceptance Among IDPs and Host Communities in Iraq, 19 October 2020, url, p. 29 57 UNHCR, Relevant Country of Origin Information to Assist with the Application of UNHCR\u2019s Country Guidance on Iraq: Ability of Persons Originating from Formerly ISIS-Held or Conflict-Affected Areas to Legally Access and Remain in Proposed Areas of Internal Relocation, 11 January 2021, url, p. 4; see also MEI, The War at Home: The Need for Internal Security Sector Reform in Iraqi Kurdistan, July 2021, url, p. 15; USDOS, Country reports on human rights practices for 2020 - Iraq, 30 March 2021, url, p. 28 58 IOM, Cities as Home: Location Factsheets and Case Studies of Local Integration, 6 January 2021, url, p. 20 59 Australia, DFAT, Country Information Report \u2013 Iraq, 17 August 2020, url, p. 65 60 UNHCR, Access to and Residency in Sulaymaniyah \u2013 Response to ACCORD, 25 October 2021, p. 1, footnote 2 ",

Although \u2018single Arab and Turkmen men who have proof of regular employment and a support letter from their employer can apply for a one-year Asayish -issued residency permit\u2019, only few of those who apply are granted one. 66 IDPs, including Arabs, who have residency in Sulaymaniyah are allowed to buy property in the city and have it registered under their own names. This new regulation applies to any person not originating from the KRI, whether or not they have been displaced. 67 According to UNHCR, the following requirements apply for Iraqi Arabs \u2018from the KRI\u2019, i.e., 1) those whose Civil Status ID Card or Unified ID Card has been issued in one of the KRI\u2019s other governorates and 2) those whose Civil Status ID Card or Unified ID Card has been issued outside the KRI but who hold a residency permit granted by one of the other governorates of the KRI.

The process of obtaining a new Asayish code involves that, initially, the local Asayish in the neighbourhood in which the person seeks to settle will refer him or her to the General Asayish Directorate of Sulaymaniyah. There, the person will be interviewed and given a new Asayish code that confirms that the person/family is known to the General Asayish Directorate of Sulaymaniyah. The person will subsequently have to approach the local mukhtar of the area where s/he seeks to settle and inform him about his/her arrival presenting him the Asayish code. In order to transfer the Housing Card, the person requires a support letter from the local mukhtar to be approved by the local Asayish . This letter then needs to be presented to the local police station for additional endorsement, followed by endorsement by the local mayor\u2019s office. Once these steps have been completed, the Sulaymaniyah Information Office can transfer the person\u2019s Housing Card to Sulaymaniyah. As the same source notes, an individual can already initiate the process of renting a house based on the Asayish code but will need to transfer the Housing Card before being allowed to sign the rental contract.

The process of transferring the residency permit involves that initially, the local Asayish in the neighbourhood where the person seeks to settle will refer him or her to the Sulaymaniyah\u2019s General Asayish Directorate. There, the person will be interviewed and issued a new Asayish code to confirm that the person/family is known by the General Asayish in Sulaymaniyah. The General Asayish in Sulaymaniyah will then process the transfer of the residency permit. This involves reaching out to the Asayish in the governorate in which the residency permit was issued and informing them of the person\u2019s move to Sulaymaniyah. After a security screening, the individual will be given the new Asayish code in Sulaymaniyah. Once the person has obtained the new code, s/he can proceed to requesting the transfer of the Housing Card. This process is the same as for Iraqi Arabs whose Civil Status ID Card or Unified ID Card has been issued in one of the KRI\u2019s other governorates (an Asayish -approved letter from the local mukhtar that has been further endorsed by the local police and mayor\u2019s office).

Having issued/transferred the residency permit to Sulaymaniyah requires payment of a fee of 10 000 Iraqi Dinars (EUR 5,88 72 ) (8 000 card fees and 2 000 administrative fees). Likewise, the issuance/transfer of the Housing Card to Sulaymaniyah entails fees totalling 10 000 Iraqi dinars (EUR 5,88 73 ) (8 000 card fees and 2 000 administrative fees). 74 The residency permit and the Housing Card are both issued per household. 75 The same source indicates that the below requirements apply for Iraqi Kurds or Yazidis \u2018from outside the KRI\u2019, i.e., those whose Civil Status ID Card or Unified ID Card has been issued in a governorate falling under the administration of the Iraqi federal government. Individuals of Kurdish or Yazidi background, regardless of where their ID documents have been issued, do not need a residency permit to settle in Sulaymaniyah governorate. Kurds and Yazidis who have obtained their Civil Status ID Card or Unified ID Card in any governorate outside the KRI need to request an Asayish code and the transfer of their Housing Card through the local Asayish office in the neighbourhood in which they want to settle in Sulaymaniyah. This process includes the following steps: the local Asayish in the neighbourhood in which the person intends to settle will refer him/her to the General Asayish Directorate of Sulaymaniyah. S/he will be issued an Asayish code confirming that the individual/family is known by the General Asayish .

As the capital city, \u2018it represents one of the wealthiest and most economically diverse areas of the country.\u2019 Baghdad\u2019s development has been linked to the growth of the oil industry. Oil refining is the \u2018principal economic activity\u2019. 80 The city\u2019s location is \u2018crucial\u2019 for the petroleum industry, since it is well connected to other parts of Iraq by both road and rail with the oil-rich areas of Southern Iraq. 81 During the 1970s, Baghdad experienced a rapid economic growth, which reportedly stagnated as oil prices fell in 2020 82 . Other local economic sectors are the production of textiles, cement, tobacco products, leather and carpets. The city is therefore the manufacturing hub of Iraq. 83 Baghdad is also the \u2018center for commerce, banking and the financial sector\u2019. 84 Iraq\u2019s three largest financial banks and 76 UNHCR, Access to and Residency in Sulaymaniyah \u2013 Response to ACCORD, 25 October 2021, p. 4 77 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 29 October 2021 78 UNHCR, Access to and Residency in Sulaymaniyah \u2013 Response to ACCORD, 25 October 2021, p. 4 79 UNHCR, Access to and Residency in Sulaymaniyah \u2013 Response to ACCORD, 25 October 2021, p. 4 80 Jiyad, S. et al., Economic Drivers of Youth Political Discontent in Iraq: The Voice of Young People in Kurdistan, Baghdad, Basra and Thi-Qar, February 2021, url, p.26; see also, NCCI, Baghdad Governorate Profile, updated December 2015, url, p. 2 81 Jiyad, S. et al., Economic Drivers of Youth Political Discontent in Iraq: The Voice of Young People in Kurdistan, Baghdad, Basra and Thi-Qar, February 2021, url, p.26 82 World Bank (The), COVID-19 and Low Oil Prices Push Millions of Iraqis into Poverty, 11 November 2020, url; NPR, In Iraq's 'Dire' Economy, Poverty Is Rising \u2014 And So Are Fears Of Instability, 3 February 2021, url 83 Jiyad, S. et al., Economic Drivers of Youth Political Discontent in Iraq: The Voice of Young People in Kurdistan, Baghdad, Basra and Thi-Qar, February 2021, url , p. 26; Rawabet Center for Research and Strategic Studies, Economy of the largest cities of Iraq \u201cBaghdad\u201d, 4 October 2018, url 84 NCCI, Baghdad Governorate Profile, updated December 2015, url, p. 2 ",

Furthermore, the city attracts more than one million tourists each year. 88 Also to be mentioned are the various military industries located there. 89 Construction work has increased since 2003 due to destructions in the course of military conflicts and terrorist operations. At the same time, the risk for companies and workers involved has increased, particularly at sites near military bases or territories where military operations are conducted. 90 In December 2020, the government devalued the Iraqi dinar against the dollar by about 20 %, causing food prices to increase, especially in Baghdad 91 . Shopkeepers near the Khadimiya shrine, a major religious site in Baghdad, 92 moreover complained in early 2021 that \u2018no one has been buying much\u2019 since. 93 The Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) wield influence both at economic and political levels.

The largest protests have taken place in Baghdad. With an interruption due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 96 demonstrations continued into 2021. In February 2021, forceful crackdowns were reported, but growing poverty was one factor that kept them going. 97 However, small businesses had to deal with losses and suffered from the \u2018halt in commerce and outright destruction of property\u2019 in the context of the protests. 98 The COVID-19 lockdowns initiated in Baghdad on 17 March 2020, including curfews and restrictions of movement, impacted opening hours and business activities as well as limited foot traffic, 85 Rawabet Center for Research and Strategic Studies, Economy of the largest cities of Iraq \u201cBaghdad\u201d, 4 October 2018, url 86 Chambers, R.

This led to the rapid development of the manufacturing sector. A great expansion of petrochemical production and oil refining in Basrah was propelled by the construction of petrochemical, iron and steel plants at Khawr al-Zubayr. 103 Exploration, drilling, and refining was boosted by foreign investment. But instead of creating local job opportunities and a rise in wages, foreign oil companies caused anger and frustration by their hiring practices, culminating in protests against patronage and corruption within the oil industry in 2018 and 2019 (for more information on the protests in Basrah, see section 2.3.2 Basrah in this report). 104 Basrah is a wealthy province due to its large volume of oil exports which secure 80 % of Iraq\u2019s oil budget. However, Basrah\u2019s citizens \u2018do not benefit from services in line with the value of its exploited resources.\u2019 105 Corruption and nepotism reportedly occurred \u2018widespread\u2019 in the form of \u2018failed contracts\u2019 between local authorities and companies, which resulted in non-executed or incomplete projects funded by the Iraqi federal government. Furthermore, powerful militias are heavily involved in the smuggling of oil and drugs. 106 Basrah\u2019s governor, Asa\u2018ad Al-Eidani, distributed financial and natural resources and projects among factions of Iraq\u2019s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), on the one hand, in order to limit their political influence, and on the other, to secure their support. 107 With all six of Iraq\u2019s ports and an international airport located in Basrah, major industries in shipping, logistics and transport have developed in the city. 108 Meanwhile, in October 2020, UN-Habitat identified the following main economic issues: a damaged industrial sector in need of financial resources and investment plans; the fact that only two of the six ports (Khor Al-Zubair and Umm Qasr) were operational; damaged infrastructure, ships and bridges preventing access, heavy siltation, lack of security as well as decreasing water levels of the inland waterways hindering movement of freight from the Shatt Al-Arab and Shatt Al-Basrah. 109 As of August 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, income stability decreased, particularly affecting taxi drivers, whose income decreased by 90 % due to the curfew. The income of crop production farmers was affected by a decrease of 25 % and that of animal husbandry farmers by 15 % in the 99 World Bank (The), Iraq High Frequency Phone Survey (IHFPS) - To Assess the Impact of COVID-19 on Firms, June 2021, url, pp. 8-9 100 US, CIA, The World Factbook, Iraq, last updated 20 October 2021, url 101 UN-Habitat, Basra Urban Profile, October 2020, url, p. 24 102 Jiyad, S. et al, Economic Drivers of Youth Political Discontent in Iraq: The Voice of Young People in Kurdistan, Baghdad, Basra and Thi-Qar, February 2021, url, p.26 103 Chambers, R.

        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 23 Basrah governorate. 110 The nationwide lockdown, including closed borders, travel restrictions and curfews, had \u2018a significant negative impact on non-oil activity\u2019. In 2020, oil prices declined. This resulted \u2018in a sharp fall in oil revenues\u2019. 111 Already in the months before the COVID-19 pandemic, an oil crisis as well as a decline in global demand and oil prices had been affecting the economy. In April 2020, prices of Basrah oil reached their lowest level. 112 2.1.3 Sulaymaniyah For 2021, the Iraqi CSO (Central Statistical Organization) estimated the governorate\u2019s population at 2 336 191 with around 450 295 people living in rural and around 1 276 114 in urban areas. 113 In Sulaymaniyah, natural water reserves, favourable climatic conditions and a rather calm security situation bring potential advantages to the economy. However, infrastructural and bureaucratic barriers impede the development of the private sector. 114 The city is an important point of trade for local farm products and maintains active trade links between Baghdad and Tabriz in Iran. 115 Moreover, several news reports mentioned smuggling to be an issue in Sulaymaniyah, including illegal trade of livestock, drugs and organs. 116 On 6 April 2021, KRG Deputy Prime Minister Talabani established the parliamentarian Anti- Corruption and Integrity Committee, under decree 3662, its function being the investigation of corruption cases and irresponsible spending within the jurisdiction of the municipality of Sulaymaniyah. Moreover, the committee aims to increase accountability and integrity in the public sector. 117 However, as the chairwoman of the Kurdistan Region parliament\u2019s integrity committee told Rudaw in September 2021, \u2018as long as the political parties are powerful in the Kurdistan Region, the role of parliament will be weak. That\u2019s why the committees haven\u2019t garnered results for things that are their responsibility.\u2019 118 Levels of corruption are high in the entire KRI and undermine economic reform. 119 A study published in August 2021 found that, from a sample of 30 entrepreneurs, men in Sulaymaniyah city had more entrepreneurial opportunities than women, and that, therefore, the number of male entrepreneurs (67.3 %) was significantly higher than that of women (36.7 %). The age group of 18- to 24-year-olds was most active in the entrepreneurial field. 40 % of the entrepreneurs draw income from financial support by their families. Management of taxes, business registration, as well as dealing with government procedures was mentioned as particularly challenging for entrepreneurs. 120 In Sulaymaniyah, a part of agricultural production is rainfed. Insufficient rainfall in November 2020, March and early April 2021 impacted winter cereal production.

Reduction of revenues were reported by 75 % of the surveyed firms, many of which responded by reducing their wage bill, laying off their workers or stopping to pay social security and health insurance for their workers. 123 Enterprises suffered from reduced production activity and worsened economic status. 124 The pandemic and related response measures impacted household incomes, but coping mechanisms were limited, as a June 2020 survey showed. 84 % of households in the Kurdistan region of Iraq (KRI) and the northern governorates did not have any savings. They rather relied on loans from their families or friends (70 %) and/or took on debts from a shop owner nearby (66 %). The majority neither received cash nor in-kind assistance. 125 2.2 Employment For general information on employment in Iraq, please see section 2.2.1 Country overview of EASO\u2019s COI report Iraq: Key socio-economic indicators - For Baghdad, Basra and Erbil from September 2020. 2.2.1 Baghdad The state both stimulates and monopolises most economic activities, and functions as the city\u2019s principal employer. Public sector employment includes the civil service, government-run educational institutions as well as government-owned industrial and commercial enterprises. 126 University graduates suffer from lack of jobs and employment opportunities. Therefore, the announcement of an employment stop and a delay in payment of public sector salaries shocked and frustrated people in Baghdad and beyond, particularly the youth, who took to the streets protesting. 127 After protests for better employment had started in Basrah, they spread to Baghdad in October 2019 and continued into 2021 with some interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see section 2.1 Economy above). 128 In early 2021, protests against the government's employment policy for 2021 took place in central Baghdad. Protesters rejected the government\u2019s decision to suspend new jobs in the public sector for the year 2021 and demanded an amendment of this policy. 129 The 121 FAO, GIEWS Update \u2013 The Republic of Iraq: Drought in northern parts of the country, 11 June 2021, url, pp. 1-2; FAO, GIEWS Country Brief \u2013 The Republic of Iraq, 11 June 2021, url, p. 1; see also, MEE, Iraq's Kurdish farmers in anguish as drought kills harvest season, 24 April 2021, url 122 FAO, GIEWS Update \u2013 The Republic of Iraq: Drought in northern parts of the country, 11 June 2021, url, p. 3 123 World Bank (The), Iraq High Frequency Phone Survey (IHFPS) - To Assess the Impact of COVID-19 on Firms, June 2021, url, p. 10 124 ILO and Fafo, Rapid Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Populations and Small-Scale Enterprises in Iraq, 16 July 2020, url, p. 30 125 ILO and Fafo, Rapid Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Populations and Small-Scale Enterprises in Iraq, 16 July 2020, url, pp. 18-19 126 Marr, Ph.

        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 25 economic and unemployment crisis was severe. 130 According to information published in July 2021 by the National Committee for Sustainable Development of the Ministry of Planning (MoP), the unemployment rate in Baghdad governorate was 9.3 % and the youth unemployment rate 15 %. 131 The World Bank published a report in spring 2021, stating that in Baghdad over two thirds of female and male employees in the private and public sector had difficulties finding a job because of the limited job opportunities. The World Bank linked these challenges to the economically hampering effects of the 2003-2011 and 2014-2017 Iraq wars as well as to the high dependency on oil, which hinders employment potential in productive sectors. 132 In 2019, oil accounted for 43 % of the GDP in Iraq 133 and the budget revenues stemming from the oil exports are used, among others, to pay salaries and benefits to state employees 134 . The above-mentioned World Bank report showed a clear difference in preferences of men and women in Baghdad and other regions regarding employment in the private or public sector: men mostly preferred to work in the private sector, whereas most women preferred the public sector due to prevailing gender norms and perceived benefits, such as a secure income and fewer working hours. For self-employed people a lack of financial support or capital was the main challenge for starting their self-employment activities. 135 Usually, foreign oil companies are obliged to recruit 85 % of their employees from Iraq\u2019s labour market. However, as an assessment conducted in Baghdad, Basrah and Erbil showed, this rule is widely thought to be ignored in practice, and, in general, recruitment is instrumentalised \u2018as a means for patronage and appeasement of different tribes and loyalties.\u2019 To see the central government profit from a flourishing oil industry, yet locals not benefitting much, caused high frustration among the population. 136 A survey on the labour market in Al-Mahmoudiya district, located close to the governorate\u2019s capital, Baghdad, suggested a preference of jobseekers for entrepreneurship. The given reason preventing the opening of an own business was lack of financing. For not accessing the desired job, the reasons were lack of jobs, lack of connections, lack of resources, lack of skills and lack of equipment. Key informants to the survey named construction, retail in malls, retail in groceries, agriculture and restaurants as the sectors employing most people. 137 The employment of IDPs in Baghdad in the public and private sector is not restricted, however, as all other citizens of Baghdad, IDPs face problems in finding jobs because of the difficult economic conditions. The local authorities also noted that \u2018some IDPs with reasonable financial capacity have been able to open businesses without any restrictions\u2019. 138 No additional information could be found on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment in Baghdad. 130 Peoples Dispatch, Iraqis protest government\u2019s 2021 employment policy, demand public sector jobs, 4 February 2021, url; see also GardaWorld, Iraq: Security forces kill at least one protester and wound 11 others in clashes with anti- government protesters in Baghdad May 25 /update 1, 25 May 2021, url 131 Iraq, MoP, The Second National Voluntary Review Report on the Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, July 2021, url, p. 96 132 World Bank (The), Iraq Economic Monitor: Seizing the Opportunity for Reforms and Managing Volatility, Spring 2021, url, p. 23 133 UNOCHA, Iraq: 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 7 February 2021, url, p. 18 134 US, CRS, Iraq and U.S. Policy, last updated 4 June 2021, url, p. 1 135 World Bank (The), Iraq Economic Monitor: Seizing the Opportunity for Reforms and Managing Volatility, Spring 2021, url, pp. 25-27 136 Jiyad, S. et al, Economic Drivers of Youth Political Discontent in Iraq: The Voice of Young People in Kurdistan, Baghdad, Basra and Thi-Qar, February 2021, url, p. 26 137 IOM, Labour Market Assessment: Covid-19 and Labour Markets - Al-Musayyab Babylon Governorate [sic], September 2021, url , pp. 6-8 138 IOM, Cities as Home: Location Factsheets and Case Studies of Local Integration, 6 January 2021, url, p. 41 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 26 2.2.2 Basrah As mentioned above (in section 2.2.1 Baghdad), among the local population there is high frustration about politicised employment practices in the oil industry and lack of benefit from its profits and employment potential. 139 In Basrah, similarly to Baghdad, lack of jobs and employment opportunities highly affect university graduates. Even engineering graduates suffer from unemployment after graduation despite Basrah\u2019s oil wealth. 140 Protests for better employment opportunities and public services erupted in Basrah in July 2018. 141 Nationwide protests followed in October 2019 and continued into the first months of 2020 until the COVID-19 pandemic caused them to stop, but they resumed on a smaller scale in May 2020. 142 According to information published in July 2021 by the National Committee for Sustainable Development of the MoP, the unemployment rate in Basrah governorate was 7.6 % and the youth unemployment rate (age 15-29) was 16.5 %. 143 The influx of populations from neighbouring provinces since 2010 was another factor that reduced the number of available jobs for local citizens. 144 As of May 2020, the sectors employing the highest numbers of people in Basrah city were drinking water bottling plants, water desalinisation, construction, carpentry, manufacturing, restaurants, cafes, malls, medical centres, banks, services in general, as well as oil and gas. The average salary was 460 US dollars for skilled workers and 322 US dollars for unskilled workers. A perspective on female employment showed that generally, women owned businesses related to tailoring, nursing care and health care, food processing, agriculture and livestock (particularly calves raising and fish), or worked in beauty, administration, medical labs, education, kindergartens and fitness centres. The average salary for women was 220 US dollars per month. However, IOM stated that only 31 % of women contributed to household income. 145 In interviews, women mentioned restrictions by patriarchal structures in society as obstacles to women\u2019s employment. 146 Similarly to Baghdad, in Basrah over two thirds of female and male employees in the private and public sector experienced challenges finding their current job because of the limited job opportunities. Men preferred employment in the private sector, women in the public sector. 147 In a 2021 interview study on young Iraqis\u2019 economic situation, a 22-year-old woman in Basrah was quoted stating that there were generally too few job opportunities, that women in particular had a hard time finding employment in the private sector, and that social constraints on working women 139 Jiyad, S. et al, Economic Drivers of Youth Political Discontent in Iraq: The Voice of Young People in Kurdistan, Baghdad, Basra and Thi-Qar, February 2021, url, p. 26 140 MEMO, Having unemployed oil engineers in oil-rich Iraq is unacceptable, 23 December 2020, url 141 AP, Soaring unemployment fuels protests in southern Iraq, 26 July 2018, url 142 AI, Amnesty International Report 2020/21: The State of the World\u2019s Human Rights, 7 April 2021, url, p. 196; Chatham House, Networks of power; The Popular Mobilization Forces and the State in Iraq, February 2021, url, p.14; Arab Weekly (The), Iraqi university graduates take to the streets again, 10 August 2020, url 143 Iraq, MoP, The Second National Voluntary Review Report on the Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, July 2021, url, p. 105 144 Skelton, M. and Saleem, Z.

Basrah was among the most affected regions regarding unemployment as a result of COVID-19-related movement restrictions. 151 2.2.3 Sulaymaniyah According to information published in July 2021 by the National Committee for Sustainable Development of the MoP, the economic activity rate of people between the age of 15 and 29 was 44.7 % in Sulaymaniyah governorate (above the national average of 36.8 %), however the unemployment rate in this group was high at 27.7 %. 152 Compared to the rest of Iraq, unemployment among women (28 %) and youth (42 %) was particularly high in the KRI already before the COVID-19 pandemic. The construction sector and the service sector were the strongest sectors for employment in the KRI before March 2020. 153 A survey published in May 2020 showed that 77 % of jobseekers interviewed preferred to own their business. In Sulaymaniyah\u2019s Khabat community, where many IDPs and their host families reside, many young people found job opportunities in one of three sweets factories; young men worked with government police units, Peshmerga departments, or in the private trade and service sectors. Female business owners and employees were engaged in breadmaking, hairdressing or tailoring. Trade was mentioned as the sector with most opportunities for employment, hiring the largest number of people in the city, along with the service sector. Respondents particularly mentioned marketing, working with larger companies, tourism services and supermarkets. IOM provided different amounts for the average salary. For unskilled workers it was 265 US dollars, for skilled workers 429 US dollars. Among the businesses in and around Khabat, average monthly wages for skilled and unskilled workers reached up to 900 US dollars. Consumers\u2019 monthly incomes were 362 US dollars, and, according to job-seekers, women-owned businesses earned on average 296 US dollars per month. 154 In December 2020, mass protests erupted against the delay in payment of public sector employees\u2019 salaries by the Kurdish regional government. 155 2.3 Poverty The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\u2019 (UNOCHA) Humanitarian needs overview for 2020 stated that the poverty rate in Iraq was expected to possibly double and 148 Jiyad, S. et al, Economic Drivers of Youth Political Discontent in Iraq: The Voice of Young People in Kurdistan, Baghdad, Basra and Thi-Qar, February 2021, url, p. 57 149 World Bank (The), Iraq Economic Monitor: Seizing the Opportunity for Reforms and Managing Volatility, Spring 2021, url, p. 25 150 IMF, Policy Responses to COVID-19 \u2013 Iraq, last updated 2 July 2021, url 151 UNSDG, Iraq Socio-Economic Response Plan, 31 August 2020, url, p. 47 152 Iraq, MoP, The Second National Voluntary Review Report on the Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, July 2021, url, p. 99 153 ILO and Fafo, Rapid Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Populations and Small-Scale Enterprises in Iraq, 16 July 2020, url 154 IOM, Labour Market Opportunities and Challenges: Sulaymaniyah District, Sulaymaniyah Governorate, May 2020, url, pp. 5, 7 155 EPC, Sulaymaniyah-Erbil Disagreement: Scenarios of Division in Iraqi Kurdistan, 21 March 2021, url; MRG, Minority and Indigenous Trends 2021 \u2013 Focus on Covid-19, 30 June 2021, url, p. 154; AI, Amnesty International Report 2020/21: The State of the World\u2019s Human Rights, 7 April 2021, url, p. 197 ",

Food production In July 2021, an economist told France 24 that cultivating land no longer created sufficient income, which is why many farmers near Basrah have sold their plots. Linked to urban population growth, agricultural land was increasingly turned into residential areas. 211 The reduced flow of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers was one reason for increasing salt water intrusion from the gulf. This caused problems for farmers in Basrah and destroyed thousands of hectares of farmland. One of the farmers said that everything they planted died, including those plants that normally tolerated salt water. 212 Increasingly frequent and intense droughts in central and southern Iraq were an additional threat to agricultural production and contributed to the problem of water scarcity.

However, this consumes more water than modern methods and increases soil salinity. Alarmingly low water levels and high salinity on the Shatt Al-Arab in Basrah governorate have rendered its waters unsuitable for human consumption or agriculture. 213 In summer 2021, shrunken Tigris tributaries, which had cut-off or decreased river flows, caused a major water crisis and losses for farmers in Basrah and other central and southern regions. A serious impact on food security and access to drinking water was apprehended. 214 For more information on the water crisis in Basrah, please see section 2.7.2 Basrah. Food production in Basrah included fishing which was prohibited in rivers, marshes and lakes during breeding season usually extending from mid-February to mid-April. 215 Food retailers in Basrah reported a decrease in sales between June and August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more specifically mostly because of the movement restrictions. 216 Food support In some parts of Basrah city, sugar commodity was distributed via the PDS in early 2021. 217 As of March 2021, 2 569 tons of sugar were distributed in Basrah. 218 In Basrah, among other regions, humanitarian organisations reached returnees, IDPs and hosts living in out-of-camp settings through emergency food baskets as well as agriculture inputs, animal feed and health inputs in January 2021. 219 Food security The Shatt Al-Arab River water supplied most households in Basrah governorate with drinking water. Almost half of the governorate\u2019s inhabitants informed UN-Habitat that the availability of drinking water was bad or very bad and less than half of the people with access to the public water network had water available for the full day. Environmental problems threatened Basrah\u2019s fresh water supply and limited the availability of drinking water. Due to its low quality and high salinity, drinking water requires treatment, provided by treatment plants, compact units or desalination units before consumption. 220 In September 2020, none of the IDP households in Basrah had a food security LSG. 221 2.4.3 Sulaymaniyah Food production WFP warned in September 2021 that barley and wheat crops could be negatively impacted by below average rainfall, particularly in the KRI. 222 In October 2021, \u2018sporadic and insufficient precipitation during the cropping season (2020-21)\u2019 in portions of Sulaymaniyah were \u2018expected to affect rainfed winter cereal production significantly compared to [2020]\u2019. 223 213 FDI, Iraqi Food Security at Risk in a Year of Mounting Disasters, 13 August 2020, url, p. 3 214 IFRC, Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA), Iraq: Droughts, 2 September 2021, url, pp. 1-2 215 FAO et al., Iraq Covid-19 Food Security Monitor \u2013 Bi-weekly Update, Issue 28, 16 February 2021, url, p. 1 216 FAO et al., Food Security in Iraq \u2013 Impact of COVID-19: With a Special Feature on Digital Innovation, June-August 2020, 23 September 2020, url, p. 16 217 FAO et al., Iraq Covid-19 Food Security Monitor \u2013 Bi-weekly Update, Issue 28, 16 February 2021, url, p. 1 218 FAO et al., Iraq Covid-19 Food Security Monitor - Bi-weekly Update, Issue 29, 25 February 2021, url, p. 2 219 FAO et al., Iraq Covid-19 Food Security Monitor \u2013 Bi-weekly Update, Issue 25, 5 January 2021, url, p. 2 220 UN-Habitat, Basra Urban Profile, October 2020, url, pp. 36, 38 221 REACH, Iraq: Multi-Cluster Needs Assessment - Key Findings for Iraq, September 2020, 2 June 2021, url, p. 5 222 WFP, WFP resilience projects respond to water shortages in Iraq, 6 September 2021, url, p. 1 223 FAO et al., Food Security in Iraq: Impact of COVID-19, with a Special Section on Water Shortages and Adaptation, 3 October 2021, url, p. 21; see also p. 31 ",

Statistically, the number of public hospitals on secondary and tertiary-care level available per population of 100 000 was 0.6. 238 A World Bank report published in May 2021 and based on data from the Ministry of Health noted that some private hospitals also provided publicly financed medical services, such as a clinic in Baghdad offering dialysis care. 239 According to the Health Ministry\u2019s 2020 Statistical Report, Baghdad disposed of the nationwide highest bed availability in public hospitals \u2013 1.6 beds per 1 000 people -, with a total number of 13 628 beds, among them 10 729 general hospital beds and the remainder being labelled as \u2018emergency beds\u2019. Baghdad\u2019s private hospitals offered an additional 2 342 general hospital beds. Numbers concerning the availability of \u2018emergency beds\u2019 in private medical facilities were not included in the report. 240 With regard to other health-related institutions, there were 1 008 private laboratories, 1 561 pharmacies, 977 pharmaceutical offices and 304 drugstores located in Baghdad in 2020. 241 In 2020, 9 622 physicians were working in Baghdad, that is, statistically, 11.24 physicians per 10 000 people. Other health personnel included 4 466 dentists (5.21 per 10 000 people), 5 353 pharmacists (6.3 per 10 000 people), 12 334 nursing staff (a ratio of 14.4, making Baghdad the second-last in Iraq with regard to nursing staff available per 10 000 people), 22 437 paramedical staff (26.2 per 10 000) and 1 479 midwives. 242 Regarding maternity health, maternal mortality was 42.2 per 100 000 births, while perinatal mortality was 20.4 per 1 000 births, according to the Health Ministry\u2019s 2020 Statistical Report. 243 A report by the UK Home Office on medical and healthcare provision in Iraq, published in January 2021, listed some examples found on the MedCOI website of hospitals/clinics that treated diseases such as cancer, heart conditions, mental health issues and diabetes as well as pharmacies/clinics that provided appropriate medication. 244 Dr. Abdulameer al-Shammary, the former head of the Iraqi Medical Association, noted in an interview with Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) in April 2021 that in Iraq the numbers of health professionals and centres were very low and did not match the population growth.

The waiting list in public hospitals is very long. Patients prefer to go to the private sector. There are no guidelines for treatment or proper sanitation or disposal of waste\u2019. 245 A nurse in Baghdad noted in June 2021 that patients had to pay 2 000 IQD (EUR 1.18 246 ) for a ticket at a public primary health care centre. This included a medical consultation and, if necessary, basic medication or other basic medical supplies (e.g., dressing material). In case of a referral to a specialised hospital, patients had to buy another ticket for a similar price. If a certain drug or other material was not available, patients had to acquire it in a private pharmacy at their own account. According to the nurse, those patients who could afford it would prefer going to private specialists. Costs for an appointment were between 15 and 25 US-dollars, but additional examinations had to be paid for separately. Costs for private surgery ranged from several hundred to thousands of US- dollars. 247 The COVID-19 pandemic only aggravated the existing situation. One medical doctor in Baghdad told PHR in a phone interview that during the peak of infections, he often had to examine more than 100 patients per day, which made it \u2018impossible to give enough time to each patient\u2019, leaving \u2018doctors so exhausted and the patient frustrated\u2019. 248 Another doctor who worked on a COVID-19 ward in Baghdad told AFP, as quoted in AsiaNews, they were \u2018collapsing\u2019, after working a 48-hour shift. 249 The relative of a COVID-19 patient in Baghdad\u2019s al-Kindi hospital told PHR that the \u2018service and the treatment were very bad.\u2019 250 In April 2021, 82 people died in a fire in the COVID-19 intensive care unit of Ibn al-Khatib Hospital when an oxygen tank exploded. According to the deputy director of the hospital, the number of patients being treated at the intensive care unit at the time of the explosion was about four time its capacity and reportedly there was also an unspecified number of relatives staying with them. 251 Poor construction of medical facilities and negligence of safety measures made doctors worry about further incidents. 252 The ongoing healthcare crisis resulted in an increased number of attacks on doctors by the families of patients who died of COVID-19, according to a UNDP report of June 2021, 253 and in September 2020, doctors publicly protested in Baghdad for better protection of medical professionals. 254 Medical college graduates and other health workers joined the protests to demand employment as many had been unable to find a job due to the government\u2019s lack of funds for the health sector. 255 Moreover, in some areas people reportedly prohibited their family members from going to the hospital, as they believed that being taken into quarantine meant being taken into detention. 256 Women, in addition, feared stigmatisation if they had to stay alone at a hospital without family 245 PHR, Challenges Faced by the Iraqi Health Sector in Responding to COVID-19, April 2021, url, p. 1 246 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 14 October 2021 247 ACCORD, Anfragebeantwortung zum Irak: Medizinische Behandlung von Fettgewebsnekrose; Zugang zu und Kosten von bestimmten Medikamenten [a-11610-1] [Query response on Iraq: Medical treatment of fat necrosis, access to and cost of certain medicines [a-11610-1]] [source: nurse in Baghdad], 30 June 2021, url 248 PHR, Challenges Faced by the Iraqi Health Sector in Responding to COVID-19, April 2021, url, p. 3 249 AsiaNews, COVID-19: Iraqi doctors near collapse; for Fr Paul, the situation is 'critical', 30 June 2020, url 250 PHR, Challenges Faced by the Iraqi Health Sector in Responding to COVID-19, April 2021, url, p. 3 251 TNH, What was really behind Baghdad\u2019s hospital fire?, 26 April 2021, url 252 Arab Weekly (The), Doctors beg for donations as Iraq loses battle against pandemic, 16 July 2021, url 253 UNDP, Iraq, Sustainable recovery from COVID-19 in Iraq: Key findings, June 2021, url, p. 13 254 Reuters, Violence mounts against Iraqi doctors as COVID cases spike, 23 September 2020, url; PHR, Challenges Faced by the Iraqi Health Sector in Responding to COVID-19, April 2021, url, p. 4 255 Hasan, S., A Perfect Storm has Hit Iraq\u2019s Economy, LSE [Blog], 22 October 2020, url 256 UNDP, Iraq, Sustainable recovery from COVID-19 in Iraq: Key findings, June 2021, url, p. 13 ",

The report described the situation in the city\u2019s children cancer hospital: lack of beds, doctors and nursing staff, technical equipment and of cancer drugs, which had to be acquired through the Ministry of Health that often was experiencing shortages itself. 268 Medical personnel - in particular in Basrah, Baghdad and Thi Qar - has come under increasing attack by relatives of patients who have died during the COVID-19 pandemic, blaming the doctors for the death of their family members.

        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 40 Six years of schooling between ages six and twelve are compulsory for children in Baghdad, as in the rest of Baghdad-governed Iraq. 288 In Baghdad, it is not uncommon that public schools operate in shifts, since different schools and school types share a building. Numbers of children in class range around 50. 289 There is, furthermore, a lack of qualified teachers. The quality of education in the public system but also in many private schools does not meet international standards. Education standards and enrolment costs in private schools vary greatly. 290 Schools in Baghdad closed due to COVID-19-restrictions in late February 2020 and partly reopened on 29 November 2020, with fewer days of attendance per week. 291 Schools reportedly opened for six instead of five days to make up for lost time and maintain physical distancing. 292 Different days of attendance were allocated to the different levels. Online teaching remained an alternative option, for which the Ministry of Education (MoE) had launched applications for online classes and a TV channel. According to a local school teacher \u2018private schools and some public ones in central Baghdad are well equipped for the new situation, but those in poor or rural areas such as Yousifiyah struggle to cope.\u2019 He teaches in a school in Yousifiyah operating out of caravans because of lack of public funding. He said, furthermore, that most families that opted for online learning for their children cannot afford smartphones or computers for the study online. Additionally, poor electricity supply and internet made online learning hard. 293 The WFP supported reopening schools through their Urban Livelihoods activities in Baghdad and other cities in 2020. 294 Further disruption in secondary school and university classes was caused by students\u2019 participation in protests in late 2019 and through 2020. 295 During April 2020, 64 % of children aged 5-17 in four IDP camps in Baghdad governorate surveyed by Mercy Hands for Humanitarian Aid reportedly did not receive any kind of schooling. 296 This pointed to \u2018significant shortcoming[s] in the initial shift to remote learning\u2019. 297 Their illiteracy rate was reported as 12 %. 298 A survey published in March 2021 showed that for 38 % of IDPs in Baghdad, functioning schools were the best aspect of living in the current location compared to their area of origin. 299 In September 2020, in Baghdad\u2019s Al-Adhamiya, Al-Khadhmiyah, Al-Risafa, Al-Karkh and Al-Mahmoudiya 288 IRFAD, Iraq Education, n.d., url 289 Al-Monitor, Decline in education threatens future Iraqi generations, 15 April 2016, url 290 IRFAD, Iraq Education, n.d., url 291 Al Jazeera, COVID-19: 10 million Iraqi children back to school, 29 November 2020, url; see also HRW, World Report 2021 - Iraq, 13 January 2021, url; National (The), Coronavirus: Iraqi children resume education despite difficulties, 7 December 2020, url 292 Al Jazeera, COVID-19: 10 million Iraqi children back to school, 29 November 2020, url; National (The), Coronavirus: Iraqi children resume education despite difficulties, 7 December 2020, url 293 National (The), Coronavirus: Iraqi children resume education despite difficulties, 7 December 2020, url 294 WFP, Iraq Annual Country Report 2020: Country Strategic Plan 2020-2024, 20 April 2021, url, p. 17 295 ACAPS, Education in Iraq: Impact of COVID-19, protests, and pre-existing crises on needs, 9 November 2020, url, p. 5; see also National (The), Coronavirus: Iraqi children resume education despite difficulties, 7 December 2020, url 296 Mercy Hands for Humanitarian Aid, Health and Educational Status of Iraqi Children in IDP Camps During COVID-19: An Assessment of Children in IDP Camps in Salah Al Din, Anbar, Ninewa, and Baghdad Governorates of Iraq, May 2020, url, pp. 3-4, 9 297 ACAPS, Education in Iraq: Impact of COVID-19, protests, and pre-existing crises on needs, 9 November 2020, url, p. 8 298 Mercy Hands for Humanitarian Aid, Health and Educational Status of Iraqi Children in IDP Camps During COVID-19: An Assessment of Children in IDP Camps in Salah Al Din, Anbar, Ninewa, and Baghdad Governorates of Iraq, May 2020, url , p. 4 299 IOM, An Analysis of Urban Displacement in Iraq, 14 March 2021, url, p. 14 ",

Out of school rates were 6 % on the primary, 24 % on the lower secondary and 52 % on the upper secondary levels. 304 In the southern provinces of Iraq, including Basrah, a much higher percentage of children were out of school than in the north. 305 The latest United Nations human development report from 2014 stated that the rate of illiterate youth in Basrah governorate was 14.9 % (16.7 % females, 13.4 % males). 306 The overall literacy rate in Basrah governorate was 81.9 % in 2015. 307 In September 2020, the education LSG score among IDPs in Basrah city was between 1 and 10 %. 308 Six years of schooling between ages six and twelve are compulsory for children in Basrah, as in the rest of Baghdad-governed Iraq. In primary school, classes can be mixed or separated by sexes. On the secondary level sexes are separated. The public education system is centralised and state- funded including tertiary education. 309 In Basrah, it is not uncommon that public schools have up to three class shifts as different schools and educational levels share the same building. 310 There is a \u2018severe shortage in the number of school buildings throughout the governorate due to the lack of land allocated for construction and in places that suffer from overcrowding such as the centre of the province and its urban areas\u2019. 311 Numbers of children in class range around 50. 312 Lack of electricity in schools bring hardship on hot summer or cold winter days. 313 In 2018, of the 1 068 primary schools in Basra, only 682 (64 %) had 300 The education LSG score considers the \u2018% of households reporting barriers to education related to a lack of household resources; % of households with at least one child not attending formal or informal education regularly (at least 4 days a week) prior to the COVID-19 outbreak; % of households with no child attending formal or informal education regularly (at least 4 days a week) prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and % of households without a functioning primary or secondary school within 2km of their dwellings.\u2019 REACH, Iraq: Multi-Cluster Needs Assessment - Key Findings for Iraq, September 2020, 2 June 2021, url, p. 9 301 REACH, Iraq: Multi-Cluster Needs Assessment - Key Findings for Iraq, September 2020, 2 June 2021, url, p. 9 302 Iraq, CSO, The net and gross enrollment rate at the primary level, including (governmental, private, religious) by governorate and gender for the academic year 2019/2020, n.d., url 303 Iraq, CSO, The net and gross enrollment rate at the secondary school stage (governmental, private and religious) by sex and governorate year 2019/2020, n.d., url 304 UNICEF, Iraq Education Fact Sheet 2020 \u2013 Analyses for learning and equity using MICS data, 2020, url, pp. 9, 15 305 UNICEF, Iraq Education Fact Sheet 2020 \u2013 Analyses for learning and equity using MICS data, 2020, url, p. 13 306 UNDP, Iraq Human Development Report 2014: Iraqi Youth \u2013 Challenges and Opportunities, 20 July 2016, url, p. 157 307 NCCI, Basrah Governorate Profile, updated December 2015, url, p. 5 308 REACH, Iraq: Multi-Cluster Needs Assessment - Key Findings for Iraq, September 2020, 2 June 2021, url, p. 9 309 IRFAD, Iraq Education, n.d., url 310 RFE/RL, Iraq's Basra Province Struggles To Meet Demand For Schools, 13 April 2011, url; Altai Consulting et al., Economic Relief, Recovery, and Resilience Assessment for Southern Iraq: Final Report, May 2021, url, pp. 25-26 311 UN-Habitat, Basra Urban Profile, October 2020, url, p. 40 312 Al-Monitor, Decline in education threatens future Iraqi generations, 15 April 2016, url 313 IRFAD, Iraq Education, n.d., url ",

Out of these, 494 (72 %) were served by the public sewage network and 396 (58 %) had access to public water, \u2018which is mostly not drinkable\u2019. 314 There is, furthermore, a lack of qualified teachers. The quality of education in the public system but also in many private schools does not meet international standards. Education standards and enrolment costs in private schools vary greatly. 315 Schools in Basrah closed due to COVID-19-restrictions in late February 2020 and partly reopened in November 2020 with fewer days of attendance per week. 316 Schools reportedly opened for six instead of five days to make up for lost time and maintain physical distancing. 317 Different days of attendance were allocated to the different levels. Online teaching remained an alternative option, for which the MoE had launched applications for online classes and a TV channel. However, poor electricity supply and internet made online learning hard. 318 Further disruption in secondary school and university classes was caused by students\u2019 participation in protests in 2019 and 2020. 319 The WFP supported reopening schools through their Urban Livelihoods activities in Basrah in 2020. 320 Together with the Basrah Directorate of Education and UNICEF, it developed a new pilot project in 2021 supporting 2 500 girls transition from primary to intermediate education through financial support for the girls\u2019 families during the academic year. 321 UNESCO provided technical and vocational education and training courses in construction to 50 young people in Basrah Governorate. They also supported the enrolment of students in catch-up classes, provided transportation support, psychological support as well as case management for students between February and early May 2021. 322 People with disabilities in Basrah governorate face difficulties in accessing education due to inadequate and far-away schools and too few institutions catering for their specific disability. 323 Partly, since it is almost impossible for persons with disabilities to secure employment after completing their education, parents are little aware of the importance of education for children with disabilities, especially females. 324 2.6.3 Sulaymaniyah School completion rates in Sulaymaniyah governorate were 91 % for primary school, 72 % for lower secondary school and 45 % for upper secondary school. Out of school rates were 2 % on the primary, 9 % on the lower secondary and 20 % on the upper secondary levels. 325 Thus, in the Kurdish north, a much lower percentage of children were out of school than in the southern provinces of Iraq. 326 314 UNDP, United Nations Joint Programme Document: Response to Basra water crisis-Iraq, 4 November 2020 url, p. 6 315 IRFAD, Iraq Education, n.d., url; UN-Habitat, Basra Urban Profile, October 2020, url, pp. 40-41 316 Al Jazeera, COVID-19: 10 million Iraqi children back to school, 29 November 2020, url 317 Al Jazeera, COVID-19: 10 million Iraqi children back to school, 29 November 2020, url; National (The), Coronavirus: Iraqi children resume education despite difficulties, 7 December 2020, url 318 National (The), Coronavirus: Iraqi children resume education despite difficulties, 7 December 2020, url 319 ACAPS, Education in Iraq: Impact of COVID-19, protests, and pre-existing crises on needs, 9 November 2020, url, p. 5; National (The), Coronavirus: Iraqi children resume education despite difficulties, 7 December 2020, url 320 WFP, Iraq Annual Country Report 2020: Country Strategic Plan 2020-2024, 20 April 2021, url, p. 17 321 WFP, Iraq Annual Country Report 2020: Country Strategic Plan 2020-2024, 20 April 2021, url, p. 19 322 UNSG, Implementation of resolution 2522 (2020), S/2021/426, 4 May 2021, url, para. 65 323 ACAPS, Education in Iraq: Impact of COVID-19, protests, and pre-existing crises on needs, 9 November 2020, url, p. 15 324 Optimum Analysis and Handicap International, Barriers to Accessing Services for Persons with Disabilities in Basra Governorate Iraq - July 2020, 2020, url , pp. 4, 24, 50 325 UNICEF, Iraq Education Fact Sheet 2020 \u2013 Analyses for learning and equity using MICS data, 2020, url, pp. 9, 15 326 UNICEF, Iraq Education Fact Sheet 2020 \u2013 Analyses for learning and equity using MICS data, 2020, url, p. 13 ",

For the small number of students with access to internet and a computer, power outages that constantly interrupted connectivity were a problem hindering their study. 336 2.7 Housing and Living Conditions For general information on housing and living conditions in Iraq, please see section 2.7.1 Country overview of EASO\u2019s COI report Iraq: Key socio-economic indicators - For Baghdad, Basra and Erbil from September 2020. 2.7.1 Baghdad A population boom in Baghdad 337 put pressure on utilities and housing. As reported in February 2021, 18 % of the population were affected by water service interruptions. Lack of housing led to a growing number of informal settlements. 338 As reported in February 2020, the 1 022 informal settlements in Baghdad represented around 26 % of the total housing sector.

        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 44 According to IOM, current rental costs have slightly decreased due to COVID-19-related restriction of work and income generating activities. In the first quarter of 2021, the rent for a house with two bedrooms, one bathroom, one toilet, kitchen and living room close to the city centre of Baghdad cost around 500-800 US dollars. Housing locations further away from the city centre had cheaper rents, with costs around 300-600 US dollars, depending on the location and services available within the area. Utilities - depending on the lifestyle and needs- were about 100-150 US dollars per month for electricity, power generators, water, and internet. 340 According to a real estate agent in Al-Mansour, a traditionally wealthy district in the west of the city, a house with a floor area of 100 square metres and three floors, including four bedrooms, cost 1 000 US dollars per month as of January 2021. A house with a floor area of 300 square metres and two floors cost between 1 700 and 1 800 dollars rent per month. The real estate agency charged an additional monthly rent for the brokerage. There was no deposit, but it was likely that landlords would insist on receiving several months of rent in advance. The potential tenant had to show his or her identity and residency card. In Al-Ghadeer, a middle-class neighbourhood east of the city, an older house for a family of eight cost one million Iraqi dinars (EUR 587.72 341 ) per month. In the less affluent suburban neighbourhood of Sadr City in Baghdad\u2019s east, a house of 144 square metres and two floors cost 400-500 US dollars per month. In the new urban project of Bismaya, 10 kilometres southeast of Baghdad, a 140 square metre flat with four bedrooms for rent cost 600 US dollars per month. 342 Water and sanitation In Baghdad, high concentrations of cadmium were found in drinking water in 2018 and 2019, which can cause kidney failure and cancer diseases among other health problems. Highest concentrations of cadmium were found in water from the Tigris River and water wells, but also bottled water was polluted. 343 The sewer system in Baghdad serves between 75.9 and 90 % of the city\u2019s households but it is old and, therefore, inefficient. 344 The city\u2019s electricity supply from the grid is insufficient to power the sewage treatment plant. Therefore, the levels of water pollution continue to be dangerous. 345 Electricity According to BBC\u2019s Middle East analyst Alan Johnston, \u2018Iraq\u2019s power network has been in a dire state for years, largely on account of bad management and corruption.\u2019 Repeated power cuts in Baghdad affect peoples\u2019 lives and living conditions especially in summer, when temperatures rise above 50 degrees Celsius. 346 In July 2021, private generators served as a solution alternative to the public 340 IOM, ZIRF Counselling: Wohnsituation, 1.

The highest number of IDPs lived in Mahmoudiyah (7 236 individuals in 1 206 households ), f ollowed by Abu Ghraib (5 316 individuals in 886 households) and Karkh (5 088 individuals in 848 households). Fewest IDPs lived in Thawra 1 district (six individuals in one household). 349 Data collected between March and December 2020 showed that Baghdad and Abu Ghraib hosted 19 506 IDPs or 3 251 IDP households in 365 neighbourhoods. The IDP to host population ratio was 0.29. The displacement situation in Baghdad was the most dynamic compared to other urban centres in Iraq. IDPs mentioned as the best aspects of living in Baghdad and Abu Ghraib proximity to relatives and friends that can offer support (27 %) and affordable cost of living (24 %). The latter probably related to the high proportion of heads of household that were working (87 %). 2 % of IDPs lived in a house they owned, although 36 % of IDPs still owned a property in their area of origin. 350 In October 2020, three IDP camps closed in Baghdad governorate 351 leaving some IDP households unable to return \u2018displaced in random areas suffering from difficult humanitarian conditions.\u2019 352 Subsequently, the number of IDPs in slum areas and on Baghdad\u2019s outskirts and governorate\u2019s borders reached 13 477. 353 The camp closures followed a government\u2019s policy aiming at closing all IDP camps in the Baghdad-controlled regions by December 2020. 354 UNOCHA reported that \u2018large- scale closures of IDP camps and informal sites in Baghdad\u2019 and other regions continued in December 2020, which resulted in \u2018not well-coordinated\u2019 movements and protection issues. 355 10.1-25 % of IDP households in Baghdad governorate\u2019s Al-Khadhmiyah and Al-Mahmoudiya districts suffered from a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) living standards gap (LSG) 356 .

There exists only one wastewater treatment facility. The city\u2019s sewage system is obsolete and sewerage services are deteriorating. Officially, 93.6 % of the residents have access to improved sanitation. However, only 24.8 % are served by piped systems, while 37.8% use a covered external canal. 60 % of Basrah\u2019s inhabitants are served by a sewerage network, 35 % rely on septic tanks and 5 % are not served at all. A lack of specialised equipment and technical staff, the increasing demand of urban growth and the growing number of slums without adequate connection to the drainage network, intensify the problematic situation. 367 Protests in Basrah continued in July 2021 demanding from the local government to address chronic electricity cuts and poor public services. 368 Already in 2018, failings in water management were at the heart of massive protests that erupted in Basrah city as residents demanded improvements in public services. The increased use of polluted water from the Shatt Al-Arab triggered an outbreak of water related illnesses. Public water infrastructure had deteriorated due to decades of armed conflict and tap water has been undrinkable since the 1990s. Therefore, most households had to purchase water privately from mobile tankers or in bottles. In 2020, one ton of water, covering the needs of an Iraqi family for about seven days, costed about 8 000-10 000 Iraqi dinars (US 5.50\u20136.80 US dollars). Low-income households had to rely on tap water. 369 Compact water treatment units (CWTUs), dominantly used for purification, supplied 83 or 85 % of treatment capacity across Basrah Governorate and 92 or 95 % in Basrah city.

The summer of 2021 was \u2018intolerably harsh\u2019 and, together with historically low water levels due to a lack of winter rainfall in the region as well as snowmelt in the mountains of southern Turkey, has created major water shortages in Basrah, Diyala and Ninewa governorates. Access to drinking water was jeopardized. 372 In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2018the need for clean water has become even more urgent for residents\u2019. 373 Electricity According to BBC\u2019s Middle East analyst Alan Johnston, \u2018Iraq\u2019s power network has been in a dire state for years, largely on account of bad management and corruption.\u2019 Repeated power cuts affect peoples\u2019 lives and living conditions in southern Iraq especially in summer, when temperatures rise above 50 degrees Celsius. 374 In July 2021, private generators served as an alternative to the public power network, but \u2018these often overheat or run out of fuel.\u2019 375 Power cuts in times of extreme heat in July 2021 led to protests in Basrah and other southern regions. 376 2.7.3 Sulaymaniyah In Sulaymaniyah, the demand for housing was growing. People moved from the villages to the city, attracted by employment opportunities. 377 It was reported that there are non-financial barriers for certain groups when it comes to accessing certain types of housing.

In Khabat, rent was reportedly less than in other districts of the governorate. 387 Water and sanitation In June 2021, drought impacted Sulaymaniyah city, and in the whole governorate contaminated water caused a rise in diseases due to the consumption of non-potable water. The drought-related decline of publicly provided potable water forced people to buy it from private tankers. 388 In August 2021, protests erupted in Tangro, 30 kilometres east of Sulaymaniyah, because of water shortages in the past five years. According to one protester, people had to pay for potable water from private tankers, one tanker costing 20 000 Iraqi dinars (EUR 11.75 389 ). 390 Electricity In contrast to other regions in Iraq, which can only provide a few hours of electricity a day, Sulaymaniyah governorate provides on average 12 hours of electricity a day. 391 IDPs ISIL-related conflict between 2014 and 2017 caused \u2018systematic and widespread destruction, looting, and confiscation of housing\u2019, which contributed to the displacement of people in Iraq\u2019s northern and western regions. Their houses having been ruined or being occupied or disputed, limited ability to access compensation for damage as well as lack of security were barriers for IDPs to return to their places of origin. 392 Particularly in Duhok, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah a large percentage of IDPs from the first waves of displacement in 2014 and 2015 was still present. IDPs in Sulaymaniyah and other regions in KRI lived in camps and in out-of-camp settings. 393 According to UNOCHA, Sulaymaniyah, with 123 000, had the third largest overall number of out-of- camp IDPs in KRI in January 2021. 90 % of them lived in private, rented housing and about 500 IDPs lived in critical shelter in Sulaymaniyah and Erbil. 394 IOM reported that Sulaymaniyah city hosted 90 075 IDPs living in 15 364 households as of 31 July 2021. The largest camp is the Ashti IDP camp holding 9 100 individuals or 1 820 households. 395 No camps for IDPs were closed, and no closures are planned. 396 The camps are equipped with six amps of electricity for each caravan, which can generate electricity around the clock. 397 In Sulaymaniyah district, 0.1-10 % of IDP households suffered from a WASH LSG. 398 Hardly any information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on housing and living conditions in Sulaymaniyah could be found. 385 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 14 October 386 OpenSooq, \u0627\u062f\u06d5\u0632\ufe8e\ufe97 \u06cc\ufbda\ufe9f\u06d5\ufeae\ufb90\u06d5\u0628 \u0641 \u0626\ufffd\ufffd\ufeb7 \ufee6\ufffd \u062a \ufffd\ufeb7\ufe8e\u0628\u06d5\ufedf ( 10 * 10 ) \u06d5\ufeb7\ufbda\ufb94\u0631\u0627\ufeee\ufb7c \u06cc\ufeae\ufe97\u06d5\ufee3 100 \ufee6\ufb90\u0648\u0695 \ufffd\ufffd\u0648\ufeee\ufee7\ufe8e\ufea7 , [100 square metres house in the best part of \u2018new Bakraj\u2019],19 August 2021, url 387 IOM, Labour Market Opportunities and Challenges: Sulaymaniyah District, Sulaymaniyah Governorate, May 2020, url, p. 5 388 Kurdistan 24, Sulaimani warns of surge in waterborne illness as region feels drought effects, 10 June 2021, url 389 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 14 October 390 Shafaq News, Demonstrators in al-Sulaymaniyah block roads to protest potable water shortage, 15 August 2021, url 391 AA, Oil-rich Iraq grapples with power outages for 30 years, 8 July 2021, url 392 IOM, Protracted Displacement in Iraq: Revisiting Categories of Return Barriers, 24 January 2021, url, p. 23 393 UNOCHA, Iraq: 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 7 February 2021, url, p. 48 394 UNOCHA, Iraq: 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 7 February 2021, url, pp. 48-49, 105 endnote 24 395 IOM, DTM: IDP Master List 31-07-2021, 31 July 2021, url, 396 Although a committee formed by the Iraqi Prime Minister aimed at closing all IDP camps in the KRI by 2021 (HRW, Iraq: Camp Expulsions Leave Families Homeless, Vulnerable, 2 December 2020, url). 397 Euro-Med Monitor, Exiled At Home: Internal displacement resulted from the armed conflict in Iraq and its humanitarian consequences, June 2021, url , pp. 22, 30 398 REACH, Iraq: Multi-Cluster Needs Assessment - Key Findings for Iraq, September 2020, 2 June 2021, url, p. 6 ",

Overview of the situation as regards ID documents, security clearances, and COVID- 19 3.1 Requirements to obtain ID documents There are four documents in Iraq which were often required to update one another: the civil status ID 399 [also called national ID 400 , hawwiyat al-ahwal al-madaniya 401 , bitaqa shakhsiya 402 , bitaqa hawwiya 403 ], the nationality certificate 404 [also called nationality card 405 , shahadat al-jinsiya (al- \u2018iraqiya) 406 , shahadat jinsiya 407 ], the Public Distribution System (PDS) card 408 [also called ration card 409 , al-bitaqa al-tamwiniya 410 ] and the residency card 411 [also called housing card 412 , housing information card 413 , residence card 414 , bitaqat al-sakan 415 ]. Furthermore, a combination of those four documents was required to access a number of services. Civil documentation processes are interlinked: in order to get a birth certificate for a child or a civil status ID for example, individuals had to present other documents such as official marriage certificates, birth certificates or death certificates. Since Iraq does not have a centralised, digitised civil registry, the relevant directorates often still relied on paper documents. Hence, a loss of those documents significantly complicated the procedure. 416 In the governorates Anbar, Ninawa and Salah Al-Din, which were all affected by 399 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 8 400 Signpost Project, Iraqi Official Identification Documents: What are they and how do I get them?, July 2021, url 401 Iraq, Directorate of National Card Affairs, Home, n.d., url 402 Signpost Project, \u061f\ufe8e\ufeec\ufef4\ufee0\ufecb \u0644\ufeee\ufebc\ufea4\ufedf\u0627 \u064a\u0641 \u0626\ufee8\ufedc\ufee4\ufffd \ufed2\ufffd\ufedb\u0648 \u064a \ufffd \ufe8e\ufee3 :\ufe94\ufffd\ufed7\u0627\ufeae\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \ufe94\ufffd\ufee4\ufeb3\ufeae\ufedf\u0627 \u062a\ufe8e\u0643\ufeb4\ufee4\ufe98\ufeb4\ufee4\ufedf\u0627\u0648 \ufed6\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufe9b\ufeee\ufedf\u0627 [Iraqi Official Identification Documents: What are they and how do I get them?], July 2021, url 403 Norway, Landinfo, Irak: Reisedokumenter og andre ID-dokumenter [Iraq: Travel documents and other ID documents], 11 April 2018, url, p. 23 404 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 8 405 NRC, Barriers from birth: Undocumented children in Iraq sentenced to a life on the margins, April 2019, url, p. 11 406 Signpost Project, \u061f\ufe8e\ufeec\ufef4\ufee0\ufecb \u0644\ufeee\ufebc\ufea4\ufedf\u0627 \u064a\u0641 \u0626\ufee8\ufedc\ufee4\ufffd \ufed2\ufffd\ufedb\u0648 \u064a \ufffd \ufe8e\ufee3 :\ufe94\ufffd\ufed7\u0627\ufeae\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \ufe94\ufffd\ufee4\ufeb3\ufeae\ufedf\u0627 \u062a\ufe8e\u0643\ufeb4\ufee4\ufe98\ufeb4\ufee4\ufedf\u0627\u0648 \ufed6\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufe9b\ufeee\ufedf\u0627 [Iraqi Official Identification Documents: What are they and how do I get them?], July 2021, url 407 Norway, Landinfo, Irak: Reisedokumenter og andre ID-dokumenter [Iraq: Travel documents and other ID documents], 11 April 2018, url, p. 23 408 CaLP, Humanitarian Cash and Social Protection in Iraq, 28 January 2021, url, p. 12 409 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 15 410 Signpost Project, \u061f\ufe8e\ufeec\ufef4\ufee0\ufecb \u0644\ufeee\ufebc\ufea4\ufedf\u0627 \u064a\u0641 \u0626\ufee8\ufedc\ufee4\ufffd \ufed2\ufffd\ufedb\u0648 \u064a \ufffd \ufe8e\ufee3 :\ufe94\ufffd\ufed7\u0627\ufeae\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \ufe94\ufffd\ufee4\ufeb3\ufeae\ufedf\u0627 \u062a\ufe8e\u0643\ufeb4\ufee4\ufe98\ufeb4\ufee4\ufedf\u0627\u0648 \ufed6\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufe9b\ufeee\ufedf\u0627 [Iraqi Official Identification Documents: What are they and how do I get them?], July 2021, url 411 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 8 412 NRC, Barriers from birth: Undocumented children in Iraq sentenced to a life on the margins, April 2019, url, p. 17 413 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 8 414 Canada, IRB, Iraq: Nationality Certificate, including purpose and validity; requirements and procedures for the issuance, renewal and replacement; frequency of fraudulent certificates (2011-November 2013), 25 November 2013, url 415 Signpost Project, \u061f\ufe8e\ufeec\ufef4\ufee0\ufecb \u0644\ufeee\ufebc\ufea4\ufedf\u0627 \u064a\u0641 \u0626\ufee8\ufedc\ufee4\ufffd \ufed2\ufffd\ufedb\u0648 \u064a \ufffd \ufe8e\ufee3 :\ufe94\ufffd\ufed7\u0627\ufeae\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \ufe94\ufffd\ufee4\ufeb3\ufeae\ufedf\u0627 \u062a\ufe8e\u0643\ufeb4\ufee4\ufe98\ufeb4\ufee4\ufedf\u0627\u0648 \ufed6\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufe9b\ufeee\ufedf\u0627 [Iraqi Official Identification Documents: What are they and how do I get them?], July 2021, url 416 NRC, Barriers from birth: Undocumented children in Iraq sentenced to a life on the margins, April 2019, url, p. 17 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 50 ISIL and the military operations against ISIL 417 , reportedly challenges related to civil documentation access were most frequent. 418 In September 2015, the issuance of new electronic and biometric unified national cards 419 [also called new national card 420 , new ID card 421 , al-bitaqa al-wataniya al-muwahhada 422 , al-bitaqa al- wataniya al-jadida 423 ] started in Iraq. The unified national card is supposed to replace the civil status ID and make the nationality certificate and ultimately the residency card obsolete, so that Iraqis will eventually have only one official ID document, while it was uncertain when the residency card will also be included. 424 By obtaining a unified national card Iraqi citizens will be given a personal registration number. 425 As of 2018, the civil status ID was still being issued in Civil Affairs Directorates (CAD) lacking the necessary equipment for the unified national card. Reportedly, some offices that had the equipment to issue unified national cards were also issuing civil status IDs as a temporary solution because of the long waiting time for the unified national card. 426 As of September 2021, both identification systems reportedly existed in Iraq. 427 3.1.1 Unified national card According to a diplomatic source in Amman interviewed by Landinfo, both the unified national card and the civil status ID were issued at the local offices of the Directorate of National Card Affairs, situated all over the country 428 and were referred to as Civil Affairs Directorate (CAD) offices. 429 This directorate is part of the Directorate of Civil Status, Passports and Residencies of the General Directorate of Nationality which belongs to the Ministry of Interior. 430 The offices can be found in most cities and in the provincial capitals. Both types of ID cards could only be issued in the district where the family was registered, which made it difficult for IDPs to obtain new documents as they often needed help if they lived in a province other than where they were registered. 431 Individuals applying for the unified national card had to book an appointment with the local office via the website of the Directorate of National Card Affairs and download an application form, which had to be completed and taken to the appointment. In addition, they had to submit their civil status ID and their nationality certificate.

Subsequently, the application is sent to a central office in Baghdad together with the biometrics, where the information is checked. 434 It costs 5 000 Iraqi dinars (IQD) (EUR 2.90 435 ) to get the unified national card issued, both at the first issuance and upon renewal after the expiration of the validity period. Should the card be damaged or get lost, the issuance of a new card costs 10 000 IQD (EUR 5.80 436 ) and 25 000 IQD (EUR 14.51 437 ), respectively. 438 In accordance with the Act on National ID Cards of 2016 a new unified national card has to be issued in the event of loss or damage to the card. 439 All newborns will be given the unified national card provided that they are registered in an area where the population registration office has the necessary equipment. 440 No information was found regarding the requirement for children in Iraq to give biometric data, such as an iris scan and fingerprints, for the application. In the KRI, however, children below the age of 12 were reportedly not required to give biometry to get a unified national card. 441 With a few deviations, the aforementioned procedure applies for the KRI. According to Abdulrahman Ismael Azaz, Director of the Directorate of Nationality and Civil Status in Erbil, which belongs to the Ministry of the Interior of the KRG, interviewed in 2018 by Landinfo and DIS, in Erbil, people did not need to make an appointment via the website, because many people did not have internet access. Applicants needed to present their civil status ID, their nationality certificate and their residency card with the application. The documents handed in were first checked at the Directorate of Nationality and Civil Status and only after the document check was finished, they were sent to the main servers in Baghdad, where the personal identification number was produced. According to Director Azaz, the applicants\u2019 fingerprints of all ten fingers had to be taken as well. 442 The card was valid for ten years but, when the civil status changed, e.g., through marriage or divorce, a renewal was required by submitting a new application for the issuance of a new unified national card. 443 In the KRI, only a picture was required when applying for the unified national card for children under the age of 12. Furthermore, the parents needed to present a court document attesting the marriage 432 Iraq, Directorate of National Card Affairs, Home, n.d., url 433 Norway, Landinfo, Irak: Innf\u00f8ring av nytt nasjonalt ID-kort og digitalisering av folkeregisteret [Iraq: Introduction of a new national ID card and digitization of the population register] [source: Norwegian embassy in Amman], 16 February 2017, url, p. 3 434 Norway, Landinfo, Irak: Innf\u00f8ring av nytt nasjonalt ID-kort og digitalisering av folkeregisteret [Iraq: Introduction of a new national ID card and digitization of the population register] [source: Norwegian embassy in Amman], 16 February 2017, url, p. 3; Norway, Landinfo, Irak: Reisedokumenter og andre ID-dokumenter [Iraq: Travel documents and other ID documents] [source: Norwegian embassy in Amman], 11 April 2018, url, p. 24; 435 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 7 October 2021 436 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 7 October 2021 437 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 7 October 2021 438 Iraq, Act on National ID Cards, 1 February 2016, url, Art. 37 (1-3) 439 Iraq, Act on National ID Cards, 1 February 2016, url, Art. 34 440 Norway, Landinfo, Irak: Reisedokumenter og andre ID-dokumenter [Iraq: Travel documents and other ID documents], 11 April 2018, url, p. 21 441 Norway, Landinfo and Denmark, DIS, Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI): Report on issuance of the new Iraqi ID card, November 2018, url, p. 6 442 Norway, Landinfo and Denmark, DIS, Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI): Report on issuance of the new Iraqi ID card [source: Director Abdulrahman Ismael Azaz, Directorate of Nationality and Civil Status, Erbil, Ministry of the Interior, KRG], November 2018, url , pp. 6-7 443 Norway, Landinfo and Denmark, DIS, Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI): Report on issuance of the new Iraqi ID card [source: Directorate of Nationality and Civil Status], November 2018, url, p. 6 ",

When the child reached the age of 12, it had to give full biometry to get a unified national card. 444 Iraqi women with either deceased or missing husbands, who needed to have civil documentation issued, had to undergo a lengthier and more complex process of proving the circumstances of their husband\u2019s death and providing a marriage certificate, which were necessary to obtain birth certificates, nationality certificates or civil IDs for their children. 445 The unified national card was reportedly criticised by human rights monitoring bodies for being discriminatory, limited in regard to freedom of religion and lacking equal status for men and women. The registration of a child\u2019s name for example was reportedly only allowed under the father\u2019s name, because only he can establish affiliation, while a mother did not have the right to request an ID card for her child. This situation led back to Article 19(2) of the National Identity Card Law of 2016. Moreover, according to Article 20(2) of the same law, foundlings were considered to be Muslim and Iraqi, which was discriminatory in regard to other religions and denied individuals the right to choose their own religion. Similarly, Article 26 allowed non-Muslims to change their religion, but it did not refer to a possible change of religions of Muslims. 446 3.1.2 Civil status ID While the civil status IDs were being phased out, they were still issued where the correct equipment was not available for the issuance of the unified national card. 447 As of 2018, in the KRI, the unified national cards were being issued in the bigger cities, while outside them, the civil status ID was still being issued. 448 According to information obtained in a meeting with the General Directorate of Nationality in Bagdad in 2012 by Landinfo, it was necessary to fill out an application form, which had to be signed by the head of the household, the guardian or lawyer, and to attach two passport photos, when applying for an old type of ID card. In addition, the applicant\u2019s identity had to be documented by presenting a birth certificate at the first issue and an ID card from a close relative such as a father or grandfather. The fee for getting civil status ID is 1 000 IQD (EUR 0.58 449 ) 450 . A webpage of the information service Signpost Project, dealing with civil documentation in Iraq, stated that a residence card as well as a \u2018residence support letter\u2019 were also required for the application and that was possible to process the application in one day in case no information or document was missing. 451 Children below the age of two years were not required to hand in a photo and photos of women in hijab were accepted. Authorities in the Kurdistan region required four photographs. 452 A husband or father can apply for the civil status ID for his wife or children, unless the civil status ID gets lost, in case of which the applicants have to appear in person. This does not apply to children under the age of twelve.

The identity of both the applicant and the person authorized has to be documented. In the KRI, it has also been possible to issue civil status IDs via a proxy. 453 3.1.3 Birth certificate Parents must obtain a birth certificate from the hospital where the child was born in order to register a new-born child in Iraq. In case the child is born outside of health facilities, the certificate can be obtained from the obstetrician or a licensed nurse or midwife. 454 According to the results of a household survey published in 2018, 16,4 % of children in Iraq were born at home. 455 DRC, IRC, and NRC reported that the civil IDs of both the child\u2019s father and mother as well as a state-issued marriage certificate, in case the IDs were not updated in that regard yet, were cited by members of focus group discussions 456 as a general requirement across the three governorates Anbar, Ninawa and Salah Al-Din previously held by ISIL for giving birth in a hospital. 457 UNICEF and UNAMI reported that a distinction had to be made between children born in areas under the control of ISIL. On the one hand, there were cases in which both parents were Iraqi nationals and were married before ISIL gained control of the provinces they lived in. On the other hand, there were couples who got officially married under ISIL control but were not affiliated with ISIL. In the first case, both parents had to go to the Personal Status Court which issued proof of paternity and a birth certificate for the child. If one of the parents was deceased or unknown, the death certificate for the deceased spouse had to be presented. In case the unknown parent was the father, the child was termed a foundling under Iraqi Law. In order for the mother to keep the child, she had to prove that she was the biological mother by undergoing a DNA test. 458 For married couples who got married under ISIL control slight variations to the beforehand described general procedure applied. The marriage was treated as a marriage conducted outside the court and had to be registered again. 459 Marriages in Iraq have to be registered in a Personal Status Court, which issues the marriage certificates. 460 This court had to decide regarding proof of paternity and registration of the birth certificate for the child and had to inform the relevant Directorate of Civil Status, which then issued the birth certificate. 461 Once the marriage was registered in a state court, the couple was able to update their marital status in their ID cards, which was \u2018a complicated and lengthy process\u2019. 462 In case both partners still possessed their ID cards, it was possible to retroactively register the marriage in a Personal Status Court by bringing along two witnesses. With the thereupon obtained marriage certificate, they were able to update their marital status on their ID cards and subsequently get a birth certificate for their child. 463 453 Norway, Landinfo, Irak: Reisedokumenter og andre ID-dokumenter [Iraq: Travel documents and other ID documents], 11 April 2018, url, p. 24 454 UNHCR, Birth registration, n.d., url 455 Moazzem Hossain, S.

According to UNICEF and UNAMI \u2018it is viewed by many as adding another layer of complication, causing further delays and acting as an additional obstacle to obtaining birth registration and civil documentation for children.\u2019 464 Hospitals reportedly refused to register a birth in the absence of the ID cards of the parents or \u2013 in case the father was deceased \u2013 the absence of a death certificate. 465 According to a source of April 2019 \u2018without the marriage certificate and both civil IDs, registering a birth is either delayed until these documents or suitable alternatives are obtained, or not possible at all.\u2019 466 The birth certificate then needed to be presented to the Directorate of Health in order to be validated and recorded in the Birth and Deceased logs. In the central and southern governorates, a copy of the endorsed birth certificate needed to be delivered by one of the parents to the CAD for the family record. 467 3.1.4 Nationality certificate A nationality certificate is issued to all Iraqi nationals upon application. Children normally obtain them around the age of 12. 468 In practice, both the ID card and nationality certificate were required to obtain certain services such as health services or education access. 469 Referring to information obtained in 2013 from IOM, the Canadian immigration authorities reported that Iraqis living in Iraq needed to present a nationality certificate from the father or a brother, their own ID card, their own or their father\u2019s residency card, their own or their father\u2019s PDS card and four passport photos against a white background in order to be issued a nationality certificate. 470 3.1.5 Residency card The residency card is a \u2018proof of an individual\u2019s place of residence and must be routinely presented as part of the application procedure for other identity cards and for access to a range of services.\u2019 It is issued by the Ministry of Interior to the head of the household. 471 Information on requirements to obtain the residency card in Iraq is scarce. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada stated in 2013 with reference to an IOM representative in Iraq that for the issuance, renewal and replacement of the residency card applicants needed to present an original and a copy of the nationality certificate for the applicant and the applicant's wife and children, an original and copy of the civil status ID for the applicant and the applicant's wife and children, the original and a copy of the residency card of the applicant's father, the original and a copy of the PDS card of the applicant or his father, the original and a copy of the marriage certificate and a support of residence from the 464 UNICEF and UNAMI, Analysis of the legal framework governing civil documentation in Iraq, 2019, url, pp. 3-4 465 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 14 466 NRC, Barriers from birth: Undocumented children in Iraq sentenced to a life on the margins, April 2019, url, p. 17 467 UNHCR, Birth registration, n.d., url 468 Norway, Landinfo, Travel documents and other identity documents,16 December 2015 [source: General Directorate of Nationality], url, pp. 23-24. 469 Chatelard, G., Comment made during the review of EASO Report on Internal Mobility, 10 October 2018, cited from EASO, COI Report: Iraq \u2013 Internal Mobility, February 2019, url, p. 20, footnote 84 470 Canada, IRB, Iraq: Nationality Certificate, including purpose and validity; requirements and procedures for the issuance, renewal and replacement; frequency of fraudulent certificates (2011-November 2013), 25 November 2013, url 471 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 8 ",

Those individuals had to register at the Asayish office close to their envisaged place of residency. 474 They then received what was called an ID card 475 , a residency permit 476 or a residence card 477 . In Dohuk governorate, if they wished to stay longer than a month, a sponsor was further required for the application and the issued residency permit was reportedly valid for up to six months, while for Sulaymaniyah and Erbil, it was stated that the permit was \u2018usually valid for a year\u2019. However, single Arab and Turkmen men only received a renewable residency permit for one month in Sulaymaniyah and Erbil.

        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 56 Several sources indicated that the PDS card was one of the key civil documents in Iraq 480 which sometimes also served as an identity document. 481 Humanitarian and UN agencies used the card to verify family units that were out to receive assistance. 482 In order to get a PDS card, it is necessary to present a civil ID and a residency card. Should the family composition change in any way, the PDS card had to be updated by handing in a marriage, birth or death certificate respectively. 483 In cooperation with the World Food Programme (WFP), as of summer 2020, the Government of Iraq was working on the digitalisation of the PDS System in a pilot study via the MoT. The smartphone app Tamwini (\u2018My Food Ration\u2019 484 ), which was launched on 8 July 2020 as a pilot project in Baghdad 485 , was supposed to enable households to remotely update family information using their smartphone. 486 3.2 ID documents and access to services The ID card and other state-issued civil documents 487 , i.e., the PDS card, the nationality certificate, the residency card, 488 the passport, and certificates of birth, death, and marriage, 489 are required to access the rights stipulated by the law, e.g., healthcare, education, and freedom of movement within the country, the state justice system, and social welfare. 490 In addition, possession of a legal identity enables access to humanitarian assistance for displaced persons. 491 The ID card is used in all contact with public authorities. It is necessary to access health services, social welfare services, schools and for buying and selling a home and a car. In addition, it must be presented when applying for other official documents, such as passports. 492 Stateless persons who were not able to register for ID cards were reported to be unable to register marriages and to gain access to some government services without ID cards. 493 According to a 2015 report, a nationality certificate was required when applying for work in the public sector, educational contexts and other public services.

Paperless Iraqi families in urban areas formerly under ISIL control were not only limited in essential services but also in \u2018their ability to recover and rebuild their lives\u2019 after the war due to their lack of necessary documents. In addition to the above-mentioned restrictions, they had limited access to formal employment, government compensation schemes for damaged housing, and opportunities to own or rent property. People without civil documents were barred from accessing a significant portion of Iraq's recovery and reconstruction efforts. 496 Moreover, people without documents also faced a considerably higher risk of arbitrary detention and arrest. Reasons for individuals lacking documents could be manifold: some lost their documents when fleeing their homes; for others, they were confiscated by various factions in the conflict; and still others received ISIL documents that were of no value anymore. 497 Especially, IDPs and returnees were reported to be severely impacted by a lack of documentation. 498 Marginalised groups such as Faili Kurds, Bidoons, the Dom (Roma) and Palestinian refugees also had been barred access to civil documents, such as the ID card or the nationality certificate, or have faced difficulties in accessing them. 499 In April 2019, it was reported that 45 000 children displaced in camps had not received Iraqi-state issued birth certificates or other documents providing their legal identity. Children without legal documents faced a high risk of being condemned to spend their lives on the margins of society. They were not able to travel within the country, attend formal schools or obtain educational certificates and had no access to health-care or state social-welfare programs. If this issue is not resolved before they reach adulthood, these children are at risk of not having their marriages state-recognized, not being able to own or rent property, and lacking a fair chance at formal employment. Moreover, not owning civil documents puts children at increased risk of statelessness. 500 Difficulties in obtaining a death or missing person certificate furthermore affected women\u2019s access to services in cases where relevant documents were issued in the names of their husbands or fathers. NRC stated that this included claiming unpaid salaries of spouses. 501 Furthermore, to acquire an ID card, women reportedly needed the consent of a male relative. 502 495 Chatelard, G., Comment made during the review of EASO Report on Internal Mobility, 10 October 2018, cited from EASO, COI Report: Iraq \u2013 Internal Mobility, February 2019, url, p. 20, footnote 84 496 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 6 497 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, pp. 5-6 498 UNHCR, Over 29,500 internally displaced persons in camps in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq receive civil identification documents [Press release], 6 July2021, url, p. 1 499 Yassen, A.

        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 58 3.2.1 Education The directives of the MoE stipulate that several types of civil documentation, including the PDS card 503 and the ID cards of the students and their parents, are required for school enrolment. 504 Children from previously ISIL-held areas were reported to face difficulties in school enrolment due to missing required civil documentation and experienced problems obtaining it from the authorities. 505 This situation was reported to persist despite the issuance of a ministerial directive in 2018 506 that allows undocumented children to attend school, as a number of education officials interviewed by DRC, IRC, and NRC were unaware of the directive. Furthermore, there was diverging information circulating about what types of civil documents were required to attend school. While some thought that the student\u2019s ID card was required, others assumed that the ID card of the father and the mother were also required, and that, in case the father was deceased, his death certificate had to be submitted. The issuance of a death certificate was reported to depict an extremely protracted, expensive, and difficult procedure. In addition, among officials who were aware of a directive, there were discrepancies regarding its content as well. 507 In a September 2019 published survey, more than half the respondents in Anbar, Ninewa, and Salah Al-Din stated that a woman could not enrol their children in school by using only her papers. Almost half of the respondents indicated that the father\u2019s ID card or, if deceased, the father\u2019s death certificate was also necessary for this purpose. 508 The same survey found that 18 % of respondents who said their children lacked civil documentation reported that their children were denied access to education due to this reason. 509 3.2.2 Health-Care Basically, all citizens of Iraq have access to the health system, since a health insurance system does not exist in Iraq. Public hospitals can be consulted in order to get checked by a physician for relatively low charges and medicine can be acquired for lower prices than in the private sector. 510 While a 2019 IOM report indicated that a valid ID card must be presented to register for treatment at a health care facility, 511 a 2019 NRC report stated that, for routine consultations, civil documents were not required. However, for inpatient stays, surgeries, and other major procedures, an ID card was required. Reportedly, ID requirements varied at health care facilities across the country. 512 In practice, the documentation requirements for accessing hospitals or medical facilities reportedly varied a lot in Iraq. NRC reported the case of a pregnant woman with a missing husband from Mosul. Because she was not in possession of a valid ID card or a marriage certificate, she was turned down 503 IOM, Country Fact Sheet Iraq, 2019, url, p. 9 504 UNAMI and OHCHR, The Right to Education in Iraq, Part One: The legacy of ISIL territorial control and access to education, February 2020, url, p. 11, see also IOM, Country Fact Sheet Iraq, 2019, url, p. 9 505 HRW, Iraq: School Doors Barred to Many Children, 28 August 2019, url; UN Human Right Council, Visit to Iraq, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons [A/HRC/44/41/Add.1], 13 May 2020, url, para. 44 506 UNICEF, Iraq: Humanitarian Situation Report, December 2018 url, p. 4 507 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 11 508 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 12 509 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 26 510 IOM, Country Fact Sheet Iraq, 2019, url, p. 4 511 IOM, Country Fact Sheet Iraq, 2019, url, p. 4 512 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url , p. 13; see also DSP, Far from Home: Future Prospects for Syrian Refugees in Iraq, January 2019, url, p. 24 ",

For the Hawija area in Kirkuk, it was reported that women without documentation were allowed to give birth in hospitals, however these children were not issued birth certificates by the hospitals. Without a birth certificate, new-borns would not receive vaccinations, which has led to the emergence of children\u2019s diseases which were not present in the area before ISIL. 513 3.2.3 Housing, Land and Property (HLP) According to a survey published in September 2019, individuals without ID cards were less likely to be the owners of the properties they lived in or to have rental contracts for rented properties, therefore facing an increased risk of eviction. Various types of documents were reported to be required for renting a home, such as the head of household\u2019s ID card, nationality certificate, residency card and PDS card. As far as housing, land and property rights were concerned, the local tribal official ( mukhtar ) played the role of an important interlocutor. In some cities, such as Mosul, Tikrit, or Ramadi, the approval from the mukhtar had to be obtained first. For Mosul city, it was reported that without a valid ID card, a mukhtar would not agree to a tenancy or validate a contract. Furthermore, he needed to be presented the aforementioned documents which he would then submit to the local intelligence office for a final approval. Reportedly, all of these documents, as well as a household-level security clearance, were also necessary in order to file a housing or property dispute in court. 514 Members of the Yazidi community were reported to have only limited chances to restore HLP rights as many had lost civil and property documents during the forced displacement. 515 A study published in May 2020 found that especially in the districts of Sinjar, Tal Afar, and Tal Keif IDPs mentioned the lack of HLP documentation as one of the main barriers to return. 516 Households headed by paperless women were reported to encounter additional hurdles when it comes to claiming housing, land or property rights. This was due to the fact that their names were often not mentioned in property deeds, which could be challenging when a woman\u2019s husband was either missing or deceased, and the woman wasn\u2019t able to acquire a death certificate, or substantiate her rights. 517 3.2.4 Social Welfare Iraq\u2019s Public Distribution System provides for monthly food distributions, including flour, rice, sugar, beans and cooking oil, for every Iraqi who earns less than 1 million IQD (EUR 580.40 518 ) per month and is not employed by the government. However, paperless people cannot benefit from the PDS, as a PDS card from the area of origin of the head of the household is needed, for the issuance of which an ID card and a residency card are required. In case the family composition changed in some way, the PDS card has to be updated by presenting a marriage, birth or death certificate, respectively. 519 513 NRC, Barriers from birth: Undocumented children in Iraq sentenced to a life on the margins, April 2019, url, p. 13 514 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 14 515 Salih, S.Y and Qadr, K.M., How the Deprivation of Land Ownership Makes Minority Groups more Vulnerable: An Examination of the Case of Yazidis in Iraq, 2019, url, p. 116 516 USIP and MERI, Ninewa Plains and Western Ninewa, Barriers to Return and Community Resilience, A Meta-analysis of Existing Studies and Literature, 7 May 2020, url, pp. 31, 33, 36 517 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, pp. 14-15 518 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 7 October 2021 519 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 15 ",

It is supposed to prioritize children, youth, women, the elderly, people with disabilities, displaced persons and workers in the informal sector. Reportedly, the PDS card (in digitized form) will continue to play a central role even under the new arrangement. 523 3.3 IDPs and returnees An IOM study which carried out a survey between March and December 2020 found that 8 % of IDPs in Tuz Khurmatu 524 , 6 % in Baquba 525 , 3 % in Mosul 526 , 2 % in Bagdad and Abu Ghraib 527 and 1 % in Tikrit 528 reported having issues regarding access to documents and security clearance. 529 Findings of the National Protection Cluster of Iraq monitoring the protection situation between July and August 2021 show that 49 % of 2 097 interviewed key informants (among them 698 IDPs and returnees) across 18 governorates said that \u2018some or most people are facing issues to obtain or renew their civil documentation\u2019, while access to civil documentation was reported to be most hindered in Dohuk, Anbar and Ninawa. 530 The Civil Status Law requires applicants to renew their identification documents in their place of origin. Hence, IDPs needed to travel back to their hometown for the relevant application process. However, the return of IDPs to areas previously held by ISIL was described as problematic due to \u2018local \u201cdecrees\u201d and threats of violence\u2019. 531 Some IDPs were reportedly blocked from returning to their areas of origin because of the alleged ISIL affiliation of a family member and were therefore, among others, facing difficulties in obtaining civil documents. 532 However, UNHCR was implementing mobile missions in order to make it easier for IDPs to access civil documentation. 533 For further information on the mobile missions, please refer to section 3.3.1 Obtaining lost ID documents.

Several respondents indicated that they needed to pay 50 000 IQD (EUR 29.39) 536 ] for a blood test required to formalize marriages in Tikrit, while the blood test had reportedly been free of charge before 2014. 537 Moreover, a \u2018serious backlog\u2019 in providing civil documentation to people living in former ISIL-held areas was reported in 2019. This was due to \u2018the sheer number of people who lost documents over the last four years\u2019 as well as the effects of the conflict on administrative institutions and services, which led to the disappearance of some services in these areas. 538 Over- crowdedness of the civil directorates (most serious in Anbar, Salah Al-Din and Ninawa) overstrained courts and bureaucracy made it difficult for Iraqis to obtain documents. In Mosul, IDPs and returnees signaled significant delays in the process of document renewal. 539 3.3.1 Obtaining lost ID documents The first step in the process for obtaining new civil registration documents in Iraq was to apply for security clearance by submitting one\u2019s name to the intelligence forces in the applicant\u2019s area. Security clearances were required for residents of areas formerly under ISIL control. The names were checked against a database of ISIL affiliates, and the application was denied if a relative\u2019s name appeared in the database. Otherwise, the IDP was handed out a document confirming clearance. 540 However, perceived ISIL affiliation often led to the denial of security clearances by officials and hence, to problems for displaced households in obtaining civil documentation. 541 For detailed information about security clearance and the steps returnees need to take in case they are suspected of ISIL affiliation, please see section 3.3.3 Security clearance requirement for returnees. Persons with a missing or deceased relative were not able to obtain documents until the government located the body of the relative. Due to the difficulty in proving death in Mosul, the relatives were required to declare the person missing in a police station with the testimony of two men or four women. The Criminal Investigation Court then opened a case and the relatives were required to publish a public notice in the newspaper. After two years without any news from the missing persons, the relatives could request that the person be declared dead by the Personal Status Court, although this could take up to four years according to the source. 542 According to a 2018 534 Protection Cluster Iraq, Protection Monitoring System/Civil Status and Documentation: Third Round, n.d., url 535 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s most vulnerable: The plight of displaced persons, April 2021, url, p. 16 536 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 6 October 2021 537 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 19 538 NRC, Barriers from birth: Undocumented children in Iraq sentenced to a life on the margins, April 2019, url, p. 19 539 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 20 540 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s most vulnerable: The plight of displaced persons, April 2021, url, p. 13; HRW, Iraq: Inadequate Plans for Camp Closures, 3 June 2021 url; UNHCR, Relevant Country of Origin Information to Assist with the Application of UNHCR\u2019s Country Guidance on Iraq: Ability of Persons Originating from Formerly ISIS-Held or Conflict-Affected Areas to Legally Access and Remain in Proposed Areas of Internal Relocation, 11 January 2021, url, pp. 2-3; UNAMI and OHCHR, The Right to Education in Iraq: Part One: the legacy of ISIL territorial control on access to education, February 2020, url, p. 12 541 USDOS, Country reports on human rights practices for 2020 - Iraq, 30 March 2021, url, p. 31 542 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p. 21 ",

According to the report, \u2018these certificates may be withheld from families of disappeared suspected ISIL members, including those that went missing after surrendering to ISF [Iraqi Security Forces] or affiliated forces.\u2019 543 As outlined in section 3.1 Requirements to obtain ID documents, in order to obtain new documentation, individuals have to present several civil documents that may be missing as well. ISIL \u2018routinely confiscated and destroyed civil and other state-issued documents, instead issuing their own documentation that is not recognized by the Iraqi state\u2019, such as marriage certificates. Therefore, the larger part of the families who lived under ISIL rule between 2014 and 2017 miss certain civil documents. Other reasons for missing civil documentation are the loss of documents during the fighting or having them confiscated by security actors. 544 Since April 2019, UNHCR has implemented mobile missions in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior through which government officials were sent to IDPs in camps and out-of-camp locations to issue civil documentation. 545 This enabled IDPs to have access to civil documentation without the need to travel to their area of origin. 546 IDPs and returnees were furthermore helped to get access to legal advice and representation. 547 As of July 2021, UNHCR was still supporting the mobile missions and was helping IDPs and returnees to get access to legal advice and representation in collaboration with legal assistance partners. 548 25 048 individuals made use of legal assistance and 37 255 civil documents were issued with the support of this programme between January to July 2021. 549 While courts and civil affairs offices were reported to have worked at full capacity during the first quarter of 2021, some COVID-19 restrictions were imposed by the end of March. 550 However, some of the restrictions were lifted between June and July 2021 and previously halted applications for the unified national card were processed again, while courts and CADs were said to have been functioning \u2018at near full capacities (generally up to 80%) in most locations\u2019 551 . Civil documentation for IDPs who live in the KRI were being issued again after a break due to COVID-19 restrictions. By July 2021, 29 593 applications had been processed during 5 missions to 12 IDP camps in Dohuk. 552 The first national identification card centre was inaugurated in Ninawa at the end of 2019 by the Ninawa Directorate of Civil Affairs, Passports and Residencies. 553 In January 2021, two CADs were opened in Rabia and Zummar in Ninawa governorate. 554 As of May 2021, 11 CAD offices in Mosul were rehabilitated, 5 of which were functional, while the rest of the offices \u2018rehabilitated and furnished between the end of 2020 and 2021 in Ayadiyah, Haman Al-Alil, Qayarah, Tal Abta, Shimal/Sinuni, and Qahtaniya are yet to be officially opened and also await the recruitment of additional staffing by the authorities in order to become fully functional\u2019 555 .

According to the Ministry, the applicant had to submit a form \u2018used to obtain the Civil Status Card for the first time or to renew it or to get damaged or lost alternate form and stamp with the circular stamp of the consulate.\u2019 The form had to be filled in by the head of the family, the \u2018family housewife\u2019, the owner of the record, the guardian, or the legal agent. The applicant had to sign and write his full name and address in the cell provided and then the form had to be stamped by the consul.\u2019 Moreover, an amount of 750 IQD (EUR 0.44 558 ) had to be paid and two 3 x 3 cm photos had to be attached to the form. If the card got lost and the applicant applied for a replacement, the consul had to write down a statement of the applicant on the back of the form stating when, where and how the applicant thought the original ID card was lost. Additionally, a copy of the applicant\u2019s lost ID card and a copy of the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s, brother\u2019s or unmarried sister\u2019s ID card had to be attached to the form. The copies had to be certified by the consul. In case the ID card got damaged and needed to be replaced, in addition to the applicant\u2019s statement, the damaged ID card had to be attached to the form as well as a recent photograph of the applicant and a personal document \u2018to support the identity of the applicant\u2019. According to the source, the applicant 'can authorize one of the citizens inside Iraq [...] to come to the Civil Affairs Department for the purpose of following-up.' Once issued, the Department of Nationality and Civil Status would send the card to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which in turn would send it to the embassy concerned. 559 The same information was found on the websites of the Iraqi embassies in Brussels 560 , Berlin 561 , Vienna 562 , and Bern 563 among others. None of the sources gave information on or referred to modalities of issuance of the unified national card. Regarding the issuance of a nationality certificate for Iraqi citizens living abroad, the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that to obtain one, the applicant needed to fill in an application for a nationality certificate to which two photographs of the applicant needed to be attached. One of the photographs had to be stamped by the consulate. In addition, the applicant\u2019s left thumbprint was required in the form and the consul had to validate the information in the form, sign it by providing his full name and stamp it with the consular stamp. Furthermore, the applicant had to attach a coloured copy of the Iraqi nationality certificate of the applicant\u2019s father or mother and a coloured copy of the civil ID card of the applicant and his or her father\u2019s or mother\u2019s ID card. Adult applicants needed to further give testimony. In case the applicant was a minor, a declaration from the father of the applicant was necessary. 564 In case the nationality certificate was damaged or got lost, the applicant had to fill in the relevant form. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s thumbprint as well as a photograph stamped by the consulate in addition to one more photograph were required. In case of damage, the original Iraqi nationality certificate had to be attached and in case of loss, a copy of the lost certificate was needed for the application. Also, applicants had to attach a coloured copy of their ID card and pay a fee of 1 250 IQD 557 UNHCR, Iraq: IDPs \u2013 Civil identity and documentation (June - July 2021), 9 September 2021, url, p. 1; UNHCR, Iraq: IDPs - Civil & Identity Documentation (JAN-MAR 2021), 11 May 2021, url, p. 2 558 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 7 October 2021 559 Iraq, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Civil Status ID, n.d., url 560 Iraq, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in Brussels, The Civil Status ID, n.d., url 561 Iraq, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in Berlin, The Civil Status ID, n.d., url 562 Iraq, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in Vienna, The Civil Status ID, n.d., url 563 Iraq, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in Bern, The Civil Status ID, n.d., url 564 Iraq, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nationality Cert, n.d., url ",
        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 64 (EUR 0.73 565 ). For the completion of the legal procedures in Iraq, applicants needed to authorise relatives residing in Iraq who had to go to the Directorate of Citizenship and the Civil Affairs Directorate to follow up with the procedures. 566 The same information was found on the websites of the Iraqi embassies in Brussels 567 , Berlin 568 , Vienna 569 , and Bern 570 among others. 3.3.2 Requirements of ID documents for family members Regarding the issuance of a birth certificate for Iraqi children born outside of Iraq, the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the family had to present a birth certificate, issued by the relevant authorities of the child\u2019s birthplace, and the father\u2019s ID card to the consular section of the embassy. This had to happen within two months from the date of birth. Otherwise, a fine of 10 000 IQD (EUR 5.57 571 ) had to be paid. To make sure the new-born\u2019s father had Iraqi citizenship, either the father himself had to go the consular section of the embassy or a marriage certificate had to be presented to prove paternity of the child and to make sure the father agreed with registering the child under his own name. After having verified that the child\u2019s father was Iraqi, the consular section of the foreign ministry \u2018according to Article V of the Law on registration of births and deaths No. (148) of 1971, registers the birth and issues a birth certificate\u2019. The same procedure applied to the issuance of a death certificate. 572 The source also mentioned a \u2018document of birth\u2019 which was issued by Iraqi Personal Status Courts to \u2018children or people who did not get a certificate from an authorized official during birth because they were not born at an empowered hand to organize birth certificate (for example, inside the hospital or [with the help of an] authorised midwife) or other reasons. However, this document could only be issued by Personal Status Courts and the consul needed authorisation from a personal status judge in order to issue this document. 573 This document was also needed for children born inside Iraq whose parents were \u2018married outside the court\u2019 574 or were late in applying for the issuance of a birth certificate. For this \u2018document of birth\u2019 575 or \u2018proof of birth\u2019 576 , the parents needed to fill out an application form, which was available at the relevant Personal Status Court. Furthermore, the ID cards of the child\u2019s father and mother were required in original and in copy as well as a marriage certificate, the residency card and the presence of two witnesses. Moreover, the child\u2019s age needed to get estimated by a medical committee and a legal fee of 6 000 IQD (EUR 3.53 577 ) had to be paid, before the document for proof of birth was eventually signed by a judge. 578 For married couples residing in Iraq who did not possess a (valid) marriage certificate, it was possible to retroactively register the marriage, as outlined in section 3.1.3 Birth certificate, to get a marriage certificate, update the marital status on the ID card and get a birth certificate for their child. 579 Please refer to the same section for information on the requirements and procedures for obtaining a birth certificate for children born inside Iraq. 565 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 7 October 2021 566 Iraq, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nationality Cert, n.d., url 567 Iraq, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in Brussels, Nationality Cert, n.d., url 568 Iraq, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in Berlin, Nationality Cert, n.d., url 569 Iraq, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in Vienna, Nationality Cert, n.d., url 570 Iraq, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in Bern, Nationality Cert, n.d., url 571 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 7 October 2021 572 Iraq, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Birth certificate, n.d., url 573 Iraq, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Birth certificate, n.d., url 574 Signpost Project, How to obtain a birth certificate, July 2021, url 575 Iraq, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Birth certificate, n.d., url 576 Signpost Project, How to obtain a birth certificate, July 2021, url 577 Exchange rates from European Commission, Wechselkurs (InforEuro), n.d., url, accessed on 7 October 2021 578 Signpost Project, How to obtain a birth certificate, July 2021, url 579 NRC, Barriers from birth: Undocumented children in Iraq sentenced to a life on the margins, April 2019, url, p. 17 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 65 Since administrative requirements for the issuance of civil identification documents were reported to \u2018heavily rely on existence of documentation possessed by the father\u2019 580 , it was often not possible for mothers to obtain civil documentation for their children, such as a birth certificate or a ID card, in case the father of the children was \u2018missing, imprisoned or dead\u2019 and no proof of the event was issued to her by the government. 581 This also applied if she was in possession of a marriage certificate issued by the state. For women in possession of a marriage certificate issued under ISIL rule, it was very difficult to transform the document into a state-approved one, if the father of the child got killed or was missing with no proof confirming this fact. 582 If a woman wanted to legalise such a marriage certificate, she needed a death certificate to prove her husband\u2019s death. In case she did not have a death certificate, she \u2018will have to get her husband\u2019s family to file a claim on his behalf.\u2019 583 Regarding the issuance of ID cards for children of Iraqi citizens living abroad, the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that to obtain one, a prove of marriage and the birth certificate of the new- born were required. The two documents had to undergo a verification procedure before the citizen was able to apply for an ID card for his child at the embassy. 584 For details on the requirements for the application, please see section 3.3.1 Obtaining lost ID documents and for the issue of the civil status card or the unified national card for individuals living in Iraq, please refer to section 3.1.1 Unified national card and 3.1.2 Civil status ID, respectively.

IDPs returning from Baghdad to Al-Anbar province in November 2020 reportedly had to go through four separate security screenings carried out by different military forces, despite carrying security clearance papers issued by the army command in Baghdad. 595 As of October 2020, families of alleged ISIL members needed to pass security clearance both for being able to return and in order to apply for civil documentation. 596 Furthermore, a woman from Mosul who had lost her husband to ISIL shelling, told local media in December 2020 that she needed a security clearance in order to apply for reparation payments given out to victims of terrorism. She declared that the procedure had been put on hold for more than one year, pending security clearance and it was further mentioned that there were thousands of applicants like her who were still waiting to get clearance in order for the procedure to be completed. 597 In September 2021 another source still referred to thousands of procedures for reparation halted in Mosul because of outstanding security clearances. 598 There was no legal basis for security clearance procedures, nor were they officially announced. 599 A broad interpretation of Iraqi counter-terrorism laws was often used by authorities in order to justify security clearance measures and subsequent denial to issue civil documentation. 600 A security clearance was described by Human Rights Watch as a stamp obtained from local security forces. 601 IDPs living in camps needed to make a request for voluntary return to the camp management in order to initiate the return process. Part of this request meant providing a security clearance from the relevant security and intelligence authorities in the IDPs\u2019 area of former residence, upon which camp management would issue an exit document which would in turn facilitate passing through checkpoints. 602 In order to obtain security clearance documentation, 589 GPC, Protection Monitoring System, Report 1, February 2021, url, p. 6 590 GPC, Protection Monitoring System, Report 1, February 2021, url, p. 15, endnote 28 591 Shafaq News, \ufed6\ufee0\ufecc\ufffd \u0649\ufeee\ufee8\u064a\ufee7 \ufec6\ufed3\ufe8e\ufea4\ufee3\u0648 \"\u0626 \u0628 \ufffd\ufe8e\ufed4\ufee3\" \ufede\u0643\ufeb8\ufffd \ufede\ufebb\ufeee\ufee4\ufedf\u0627 \u064a\u0641 \ufffd \ufed2\ufe9c\ufedc\ufee3 \u064a\u0641 \u0626\ufee3\u0623 \u0631\ufe8e\ufeb8\u062a\ufee7\u0627 [Sudden intensive deployment of security forces in Mosul and the governor of Ninawa comments], 28 January 2021, url 592 Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, \u0641 \u064a \u0646\ufef4\ufed7\u0627\ufeae\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \u0641 \u064a \u0646\ufea3\u0632\ufe8e\ufee8\ufedf\u0627 \u0629\u062f\ufeee\ufecb \ufed6\ufe92\ufeb4\ufffd \u064a\u0641 \u0626\ufee3\u0623 \ufed6\ufef4\ufed7\ufeaa\ufe97 :\ufeae\ufea8\ufebc\ufedf\u0627 \u0641\ufeae\ufe9f \ufed2\ufee0\ufee3 \u064a\u0641 \ufffd \ufe94\ufe9f\u0627\ufeae\ufed4\ufee7\u0627 [A breakthrough in the Jurf al-Sakhr file: security check ahead of the return of displaced Iraqis], 4 August 2021, url 593 Baghdad Today, \u0643\ufeee\ufedb\ufeae\ufedb \u064a\u0641 \ufffd \ufee2\ufeec\ufed8\ufec3\ufe8e\ufee8\ufee3 \ufffd\u0627 \ufe94\ufea3\u0632\ufe8e\ufee7 \ufe94\ufee0\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufecb 17 \u0629\u062f\ufeee\ufecb [return of 17 IDP families to their areas in Kirkuk], 17 September 2021, url 594 Shafaq News: \ufffd\ufe8e\ufffd\u062f \u064a\u0641 \ufffd \"\ufe94\ufee8\ufea7\ufe8e\ufeb3\" \ufed6\ufec3\ufe8e\ufee8\ufee3 \ufffd\u0627 \ufe94\ufea3\u0632\ufe8e\ufee7 \u0629\ufffd\u0627 300 \ufee6\ufee3 \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\u0627 \u0629\u062f\ufeee\ufecb [return of more than 300 displaced families to security risk areas in Diyala], 15 February 2021, url 595 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 7 596 International Crisis Group, Exiles in Their Own Country: Dealing with Displacement in Post-ISIS Iraq, 19 October 2020, url, p. 5 597 Al-Quds Al-Arabi: \ufe94\ufee0\ufec4\ufecc\ufee3 \ufe94\ufee0\ufee3\ufe8e\ufecc\ufee3 \u0641\ufefb\u0622 7 \u0648 \ufede\ufebb\ufeee\ufee4\ufedf\u0627 \u064a \ufffd\ufe8e\ufeeb\u0623 \u062f\u0631\ufe8e\ufec4\ufffd \u0633\ufeee\ufe91\ufe8e\u0643 \ufe94\ufffd\ufee8\ufee3\ufef7\u0627 \ufea2\u0640\u0640\u0640\u0640\ufffd\u0631\ufe8e\ufebc\ufe98\ufedf\u0627 : \u064a\u062a \ufffd\u0627\ufeae\ufecb \ufeca\ufed7\ufeee\ufee3 [Iraqi site: security clearances are a nightmare chasing the people of Mosul and 7,000 procedures have been put on hold], 8 December 2020, url 598 Yaqin News, \ufe94\ufedf\u0627\ufeaa\ufecc\ufedf\u0627\u0648 \ufe94\ufedf\u0621\ufe8e\ufeb4 \ufee4\ufedf\u0627 \u0631\u0627\ufeae\ufed7 \ufe90\u0628\ufeb4\ufffd \ufee2\ufeec\ufe97\ufefc\ufee3\ufe8e\ufecc\ufee3 \u0644\ufe8e\ufee4\ufffd\u0625 \ufed2\ufed7\ufeee\ufe97 \u0646\ufeee\ufedc\ufeb8\ufffd \ufede\ufebb\ufeee\ufee4\ufedf\u0627 \u062a\ufe8e\ufec0\ufffd\ufffd\ufecc\ufe97 \u0629\ufeae\ufe8b\u0627\u062f \ufeee\ufecc\ufe9f\u0627\ufeae\ufee3 [Persons consulting the department for reparation in Mosul complain that their transactions have been suspended due to decree on \u201caccountability and justice\u201d], 4 September 2021, url 599 UNHCR, Relevant Country of Origin Information to Assist with the Application of UNHCR\u2019s Country Guidance on Iraq: Ability of Persons Originating from Formerly ISIS-Held or Conflict-Affected Areas to Legally Access and Remain in Proposed Areas of Internal Relocation, 11 January 2021, url, p. 2 600 NRC, Barriers from birth: Undocumented children in Iraq sentenced to a life on the margins, April 2019, url, p.23 601 HRW, Iraq: Inadequate Plans for Camp Closures, 3 June 2021, url 602 AI, Marked for Life - Displaced Iraqis in Cycle of Abuse and Stigmatization, November 2020, url, p. 33 ",

The National Security Service (NSS) was mentioned as also being involved in security clearance procedures needed for return. 603 The process usually also involved the mukhtar , the local community leader in the returnee\u2019s place of original residence. 604 The mukhtar consulting with local residents would be asked by the security services to vouch that the returnee had no affiliation with ISIL. 605 Once the screening process was completed, the returnee was issued a document confirming that a clearance procedure had been undertaken and that the name of the returnee did not match with any names in any security databases. The security clearance documents were issued by the local authorities in the returnee\u2019s area of origin. 606 Only with such clearance documents IDPs were able to return to their former area of residence. 607 If during the security screening the returnee\u2019s name appeared in any of the government databases containing the names of persons with suspected ISIL affiliation, the returnee would be detained and questioned. 608 If the returnee was found to have a family member who was suspected of ISIL affiliation, security clearance was denied. The source, however, does not mention cases of detention. 609 In the eastern and western peripheries of Anbar governorate for example, security clearances for returning IDPs could easily be denied by either the PMU or local tribal entities. 610 Government officials reportedly frequently denied security clearances for displaced families with suspected ties to ISIL, effectively restricting their freedom of movement. 611 It was considered impossible to appeal such a denial. 612 Not being granted security clearance also meant not being able to access many public services such as public health-care and a school education for the children. 613 Undocumented families had no access to food rations distributed through PDS and encountered difficulties when trying to find formal employment, rented housing or applying for compensation or government benefits. 614 For further information on ID documents needed for accessing services, please refer to section 3.2 ID documents and access to services. In case security clearance was denied, returnees felt pressured to undergo either or both of the following two processes called tabriya (tabreea/tabrea) and ikhbar as an alternative way to obtain clearance. 615 The tabriya (disavowal) process involved denouncing the relative with suspected ties to ISIL as well as the crimes this relative was accused of. 616 It meant declaring to sever all ties with this family 603 USDOS, Country reports on human rights practices for 2020 - Iraq, 30 March 2021, url, p. 17; Iraqi News Agency, \u0639\ufe8e\ufed3\ufeaa\ufedf\u0627 \ufe8e\ufffd\ufe91 \u0629\ufeaa\ufecb\ufe8e\ufed7 \ufeda\ufee0\ufe98\ufee4\ufffd \u064a\u0641 \u0626\ufec3\ufeee\ufedf\u0627 \ufee6\ufee3\ufef7\u0627 :\ufe94\ufffd\ufe91\ufe8e\ufffd\ufee8\ufedf\u0627 \u0644\ufeee\ufeec\ufedf\u0627 \ufee2\ufffd\ufea8\ufee3 \ufee6\ufee3 \u0629\ufeaa\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \u062a\ufefc\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \ufeca\ufef4\ufee4\ufea0\ufedf \u062a\ufe8e\ufee7 [Parliamentary defence committee is in possession of a database containing all families returning from Al-Hol camp ], 26 June 2021, url 604 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 13; International Crisis Group, Exiles in Their Own Country: Dealing with Displacement in Post-ISIS Iraq, 19 October 2020, url, p. 5 605 International Crisis Group, Exiles in Their Own Country: Dealing with Displacement in Post-ISIS Iraq, 19 October 2020, url, p. 5 606 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 13 607 International Crisis Group, Exiles in Their Own Country: Dealing with Displacement in Post-ISIS Iraq, 19 October 2020, url, p. 5 608 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 13 609 HRW, Iraq: Inadequate Plans for Camp Closures, 3 June 2021, url; 610 Skelton, M. and Saleem, Z.

A local tribal sheikh in southern Ninawa reportedly asked families to disavow their imprisoned relatives affiliated with ISIL or alternatively to pay blood money to compensate for the tribal members killed at the hands of ISIL. 622 A completion of the tabriya did not guarantee the right to return home or being issued identification documents. 623 Some IDPs having undertaken tabriya were still reported to be living in camps at the end of 2020. 624 Moreover, the person undergoing a tabriya process risked social rejection and potential violent repercussions from relatives of the accused. 625 Ikhbar (denunciation) is a legal complaint made in form of a denunciation in court. 626 It involved reporting a relative with suspected ISIL affiliation to an investigative judge. 627 Ikhbar was described as \u2018well established in the Iraqi legal system\u2019 628 and as being based on Iraqi anti-terrorism law. 629 According to IOM, IDPs were requested by security actors in many areas to undertake this process in order to receive permission to return home and IDPs in camps had to do ikhbar before journeying to their areas of origin. 630 Families faced the dilemma of either undertaking ikhbar and risking that their denunciation might be used in a court procedure against the suspected relative or not undertaking this process and thereby not being able to obtain civil documentation needed to access basic services. 631 IOM mentioned a third possibility of being allowed to return to the former community, namely through tribal sponsorship ( kafala ). In this process, community leaders such as tribal sheikhs sponsored the return of IDPs by officially attesting to security forces involved in return procedures that the returnee in question had not committed an offense despite having suspected ISIL members in the family. 632 617 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 14 618 IOM, Protracted Displacement in Iraq: Revisiting Categories of Return Barriers, 24 January 2021, url, pp. 31-32; CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 14 619 NRC, Broken Home: Women's housing, land and property rights in post-conflict Iraq, 11 May 2020, url, p. 11; NIRIJ, \ufee8\u064a\ufee7 \u064a\u0641 \ufffd \ufee2\ufeec\ufed8\ufec3\ufe8e\ufee8\ufee4\ufedf \u0629\u062f\ufeee\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \ufee6\ufee3 \u0646\ufeee\ufecb\ufeee\ufee8\ufee4\ufee3 \ufeb6\ufecb\u0627\u062f \u062a\ufefc\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufecb ..\ufe8e\ufeec\ufe9f\ufe8e\ufee3\ufeaa\ufee7\u0627 \u0629\u062f\ufe8e\ufecb\ufef9 \u064a \u0641 \ufffd\ufedc\ufe97 \ufefb \ufe8e\ufeeb\ufeaa\ufea3\u0648 \ufe94\ufe8b \u0628 \ufffd\ufe98\ufedf\u0627 \u0649\ufeee [Tabriya alone is not enough for reintegration \u2026 ISIL families are not permitted to return to their areas in Ninawa], 28 November 2020, url 620 Yaqin News, \u0649\ufeee\ufee8\u064a\ufee7 \ufe94\ufec8\ufed3\ufe8e\ufea4\ufee3 \ufffd\u0625 \ufee6\ufef3\ufeaa\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \u0641 \u064a \u0646\ufea3\u0632\ufe8e\ufee8\ufedf\u0627 \ufed6\ufea4\u0628 \u064a \u0641 \ufffd\ufeb4\ufecc\ufe97 \u0621\u0627\ufeae\ufe9f\u0625 \ufe94\ufe8b \u0628 \ufffd\ufe98\ufedf\u0627 \u0628\ufe8e\ufe98\ufedb : \u064a\u062a \ufffd\ufeee\ufed8\ufea3 \ufeb0\ufedb\ufeae\ufee3 [Human rights centre: undertaking tabriya is an arbitrary process that IDPs returning to Ninawa go through], 20 January 2021, url 621 France 24, \u0642\u0627\ufeae\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \u064a\u0641 \ufffd \ufe94\ufee4\ufffd\ufeaa\ufed7 \u062a\ufe8e\ufecb\u0627\ufeb0\ufee7 \ufe94\ufffd\ufed4\ufebc\ufe98\ufedf \ufe8e\ufee7\ufe8e\ufffd\ufea3\u0623 \u0621\ufe8e\ufec4\ufecf \" \u0641 \u064a \u0646\ufef3\u062f\ufe8e\ufeec\ufea0\ufedf\u0627 \ufffd\u0627 \u0621\ufe8e\ufee4\ufe98\ufee7\ufefb\u0627\" \ufe94\ufee4\ufeec\ufe97 [The accusation of belonging to jihadists is sometimes used as an excuse to settle old scores in Iraq], 8 January 2021, url 622 Yaqin News, \u0649\ufeee\ufee8\u064a\ufee7 \ufe94\ufec8\ufed3\ufe8e\ufea4\ufee3 \ufffd\u0625 \ufee6\ufef3\ufeaa\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \u0641 \u064a \u0646\ufea3\u0632\ufe8e\ufee8\ufedf\u0627 \ufed6\ufea4\u0628 \u064a \u0641 \ufffd\ufeb4\ufecc\ufe97 \u0621\u0627\ufeae\ufe9f\u0625 \ufe94\ufe8b \u0628 \ufffd\ufe98\ufedf\u0627 \u0628\ufe8e\ufe98\ufedb : \u064a\u062a \ufffd\ufeee\ufed8\ufea3 \ufeb0\ufedb\ufeae\ufee3 [Human rights centre: undertaking tabriya is an arbitrary process that IDPs returning to Ninawa go through], 20 January 2021, url 623 Just Security, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable Displaced Families Undermines US Stabilization Agenda in Iraq, 18 August 2020, url 624 NIRIJ, \u0649\ufeee\ufee8\u064a\ufee7 \u064a\u0641 \ufffd \ufee2\ufeec\ufed8\ufec3\ufe8e\ufee8\ufee4\ufedf \u0629\u062f\ufeee\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \ufee6\ufee3 \u0646\ufeee\ufecb\ufeee\ufee8\ufee4\ufee3 \ufeb6\ufecb\u0627\u062f \u062a\ufefc\ufe8b\ufe8e\ufecb ..\ufe8e\ufeec\ufe9f\ufe8e\ufee3\ufeaa\ufee7\u0627 \u0629\u062f\ufe8e\ufecb\ufef9 \u064a \u0641 \ufffd\ufedc\ufe97 \ufefb \ufe8e\ufeeb\ufeaa\ufea3\u0648 \ufe94\ufe8b \u0628 \ufffd\ufe98\ufedf\u0627 [Tabriya alone is not enough for reintegration \u2026 ISIL families are not permitted to return to their areas in Ninawa], 28 November 2020, url 625 NRC, Broken Home: Women's housing, land and property rights in post-conflict Iraq, 11 May 2020, url, p. 11 626 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 14 627 IOM, Protracted Displacement in Iraq: Revisiting Categories of Return Barriers, 24 January 2021, url, p. 31 628 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 14 629 IOM, Protracted Displacement in Iraq: Revisiting Categories of Return Barriers, 24 January 2021, url, p. 31 630 IOM, Protracted Displacement in Iraq: Revisiting Categories of Return Barriers, 24 January 2021, url, p. 31 631 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 1 632 IOM, Protracted Displacement in Iraq: Revisiting Categories of Return Barriers, 24 January 2021, url, p. 32 ",
        "Country of origin information report | Iraq: Key Socio-economic Indicators for Baghdad, Basrah, and Sulaymaniyah 69 At the beginning of 2021, there were still about 2 000 displaced families residing in camps in the governorates Diyala, Kirkuk, Salah Al-Din and Anbar for whom a safe return to their homes was impossible due to tribal disputes, societal rejection and outstanding security approvals. 633 3.3.4 Possible risks considering travel to/through formerly ISIL-controlled areas without personal ID documents In order to pass through checkpoints across Iraq, people usually needed to show civil identification such as an ID card, a passport or a nationality certificate. 634 IDPs leaving the camps were often stopped at checkpoints and prevented by security actors from travelling to their area of original residence. 635 According to a woman displaced to Kirkuk, her family was not able to return to their village in Salah Al-Din because they did not possess valid civil documentation in order to pass through checkpoints. 636 IDPs without proper documentation risked harassment and arrests at checkpoints when travelling. 637 Based on interviews carried out with IDPs during fieldwork between November 2018 and October 2020, Amnesty International (AI) reports on cases in which persons were arrested in Ninawa governorate at checkpoints run by Iraqi army, military intelligence, police, Asayish or PMU for not carrying identification documents. Interview partners explained that military and security forces would assume that men and boys leaving ISIL-held areas without documentation must be affiliated with ISIL and were therefore trying to conceal their identity. 638 AI does not disclose when exactly these arrests took place but mentions that thousands of men have disappeared after having been arrested. 639 An IDP residing in the KRI reported Asayish forces confiscating his civil documents and not returning them afterwards. He told AI that he was unable to travel to Mosul to get new identification documents because he feared being arrested by Iraqi forces at a checkpoint if found to be undocumented. 640 A 2019 report similarly noted that displaced people and returnees in Mosul feared arrest or detention when passing through a checkpoint without identification documents. 641 3.4 Impact of COVID-19 at a national level The World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that as of 27 September 2021, Iraq has conducted 15 154 796 tests and confirmed 1 996 214 cases of COVID-19, with 22 142 deaths. 1.9 % of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been health care workers (37 859 cases) and 323 health care personnel have died of the disease until 27 September 2021. 642 According to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), as of 27 September 2021, there have been 328 118 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), with 5 819 confirmed deaths. 643 UNHCR reported that as of 633 Al Jazeera, \u062a\ufe8e\ufee4\ufffd\ufea8\ufee4\ufedf\u0627 \u0642\ufefc\ufecf\u0625 \u0631\u0627\ufeae\ufed7 \ufeaa\ufecc\u0628 \u0642\u0627\ufeae\ufecc\ufedf\u0627 \u064a \u0641 \ufffd \u0641 \u064a \u0646\ufea3\u0632\ufe8e\ufee8\ufedf\u0627 \u062f\u0631\ufe8e\ufec4\ufe97 \ufe94\ufffd\ufe9b\ufefc\ufe9b .. \ufeaa\ufffd \u062b \ufffd\u062a\ufedf\u0627\u0648 \u0639\ufffd\ufea0\ufedf\u0627\u0648 \u0641\ufeee\ufea8\ufedf\u0627 [Fear and hunger and displacement \u2013 three problems chasing Iraqi IDPs following the decision to close the camps], 30 January 2021, url 634 UNHCR, Relevant Country of Origin Information to Assist with the Application of UNHCR\u2019s Country Guidance on Iraq: Ability of Persons Originating from Formerly ISIS-Held or Conflict-Affected Areas to Legally Access and Remain in Proposed Areas of Internal Relocation, 11 January 2021, url, p. 2; see also HRW, Iraq: Inadequate Plans for Camp Closures, 3 June 2021, url 635 CIVIC, Ignoring Iraq\u2019s Most Vulnerable: The Plight of Displaced Persons, April 2021, url, p. 7 636 HRW, Iraq: Inadequate Plans for Camp Closures, 3 June 2021, url 637 AI, Marked for Life - Displaced Iraqis in Cycle of Abuse and Stigmatization, November 2020, url, p. 27 638 AI, Marked for Life - Displaced Iraqis in Cycle of Abuse and Stigmatization, November 2020, url, p. 23 639 AI, Marked for Life - Displaced Iraqis in Cycle of Abuse and Stigmatization, November 2020, url, p. 6 640 AI, Marked for Life - Displaced Iraqis in Cycle of Abuse and Stigmatization, November 2020, url, p. 31 641 NRC et al., Paperless People Of Post-Conflict Iraq, Denied rights, barred from basic services and excluded from reconstruction efforts, 16 September 2019, url, p 17 642 WHO, Iraq, COVID-19 Dynamic Infographic Dashboard Iraq 2020-2021, Situation for 27 September 2021, 28 September 2021, url , pp. 2, 18 643 Iraq, KRG, Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard, as of 27 September 2021, url ",

Malls and markets in federal Iraq and KRI were closed; cafes, restaurants and clubs were only allowed to provide outdoor services. Social gatherings such as funerals were prohibited in homes or small spaces such as alleys and travels between KRI and other governorates were restricted to four days per week. During the period of Ramadan from 12 April to 12 May 2021, the government introduced further restrictions such as a total lockdown on Fridays and Saturdays and a nightly curfew during the business week. Schools had to resume online teaching. 645 A 10-day full lockdown during the Eid al-Fitr festival beginning with 12 May 2021 was announced but later changed to a partial curfew. 646 IOM noted that as of 31 May 2021, only four points of entry into Iraq were fully open. A further 12 points of entry remained partially closed and 11 were open for commercial transit only. 647 In March 2021, authorities lifted a previous partial ban on international travel. Travellers were required to present a negative COVID-19 test not older than 72 hours and to self-isolate at home for seven days unless they provided evidence that they had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 648 According to the KRG, as of 31 August 2021, all travellers entering KRI have to either be fully vaccinated or tested negative within 48 hours prior to departure. 649 On 9 June 2021, the Iraqi government decided on new requirements for attending sessions and courses as of 1 September 2021. All students over the age of 18 years, teaching staff and employees of private and public schools, universities and other institutes had to provide evidence that they were either vaccinated or had recovered from a COVID-19 infection within the previous 90 days or present a weekly negative PCR test. The same requirements were extended to employees at ministries, departments and institutions of the public and private sector as well as to visitors at government departments. Anyone failing to comply with these requirements would be considered absent from work or would not be received as a visitor at government departments until providing the necessary evidence. Moreover, the government decided to make the vaccination of all staff working at companies and institutions that were subject to health checks a prerequisite for the granting or renewal of health licenses. Non-compliance would result in closure of these enterprises on 1 September 2021. With regard to international travel, the government decided that starting from 1st October 2021, all Iraqi nationals travelling abroad would be required to present an international COVID-19 vaccine certificate prior to departure. 650 Authorities advised fully vaccinated persons to have their national vaccination certificates translated and certified at vaccination centres until international documents would be provided through the Ministry of Health. 651 In September 2021, the government announced that they would allow 40 000 foreigners, including 30 000 from 644 UNHCR, Iraq, Fact Sheet September 2021, September 2021, url, p. 3 645 IOM, Iraq, COVID-19 Mobility Restrictions and Public Health Measures. 1 March to 31 May 2021, June 2021, url, p. 2 646 UNSG, Implementation of resolution 2576 (2021), S/2021/700, 3 August 2021, url, para 8; Iraq, Government of Iraq, The Cabinet imposes a complete curfew for 10 days, and takes several measures regarding Iraqis in India, 5 May 2021, url 647 IOM, Iraq, COVID-19 Mobility Restrictions and Public Health Measures. 1 March to 31 May 2021, June 2021, url, p. 6 648 IOM, Iraq, COVID-19 Mobility Restrictions and Public Health Measures. 1 March to 31 May 2021, June 2021, url, p. 2 649 Iraq, KRG, Situation update, n.d., url 650 Iraq, Government of Iraq, The Government will continue to require the vaccination of employees, workers, students and teaching staff, 9 June 2021, url 651 Health Cluster Iraq, Health Cluster Bulletin No. 8, August 2021, 19 September 2021, url, p. 2 ",

In comparison, in 2019, about 14 million foreigners had participated in the pilgrimage. 652 3.4.2 Impact on economy and vulnerable groups In June 2021, UNDP, in partnership with UN-Habitat and IOM, published a study on the effects of COVID-19 and COVID-19-related restrictions on the livelihoods and socioeconomic situation of vulnerable groups. Loss of income was the \u2019most ubiquitously reported change\u2019 among all vulnerable groups nationwide, although the study noted differences between federal Iraq and KRI. While households in Federal Iraq suffered from reduced non-employment income, households in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq experienced greater losses with regard to employment income. The study noted also differences between different population groups such as women and men or IDPs and the local population. Other impacts included rising food costs, an increase in community insecurity and gender-based violence, payment delays, loss of employment opportunities and reduced access to education and health care services, especially for the youth and disabled persons, as well as reduced access to aid for displaced persons due to office closures. 653 3.4.3 Vaccination programme Vaccination in Iraq started in the first days of March 2021. 654 WHO stated in its weekly COVID-19 situation report covering the period 23 to 29 August 2021 that, as of calendar week 34, a total of 4 043 632 vaccine doses have been administered in the country. This number indicated that 11.4 % of the target population have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Reportedly, 2 628 559 people have received their first dose while 1 414 676 have been fully vaccinated.
