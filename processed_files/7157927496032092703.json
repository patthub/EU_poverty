The revision includes Presidency compromise proposals as set out in the fourth column following delegations' comments and contributions as well as proper consideration of the discussions with the European Parliament held at technical level. The compromise proposals concern the following articles: \u2022 Articles 1, 3 - General provisions \u2022 Article 4 - Free choice of electricity supplier \u2022 Article 7 - Direct lines \u2022 Article 10 - Basic contractual rights \u2022 Article 11 - Entitlement to a dynamic electricity price contract \u2022 Article 12 - Right to switch and rules on switching-related fees \u2022 Article 13 \u2013 Aggregation contract ",

The proposed definition is based on the current definition of Directive 2009/72/EG, with the following refinements: - explicit restriction to transmission systems; - exclusion of transmission equipment crossing bidding zones inside a Member State (\u201cinternal interconnectors\u201d); - clarification for network codes and guidelines applying to third countries in article 54 draft Electricity Regulation; see e.g. article 1 of Regulation 2015/1222 (CACM Guideline), article 1 of Regulation 2017/2195 (Balancing Guideline). The Presidency would welcome Member States' opinion on the suggested Presidency compromise texts set out in the fourth column. Based on this document and Member States feedback, the Presidency will prepare the revised mandate to be examined by Coreper on 7 September 2018. As regards the definition of \u201cinterconnector\u201d the Presidency will prepare a proposal and invite Coreper to examine and reach an agreement with a view to establishing a general approach on this issue.
