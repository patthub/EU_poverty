        "11 THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 161 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the assent of the European Parliament ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 2 ), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 3 ), Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors ( 4 ), Whereas: (1) Article 158 of the Treaty provides that, in order to strengthen its economic and social cohesion, the Community is to aim at reducing dispari- ties between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, including rural areas. Article 159 of the Treaty requires this action to be supported by the Structural Funds, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other existing Financial Instruments. (2) Cohesion policy should contribute to increasing growth, competi tiveness and employment by incorporating the Community\u2019s prio rities for sustainable development as defined at the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 and at the G\u00f6teborg European Council of 15 and 16 June 2001. (3) Economic, social and territorial disparities at both regional and national level have increased in the enlarged European Union. Actions for convergence, competitiveness and employment should therefore be increased throughout the Community. ( 1 ) Assent of 4 July 2006 (not yet published in the Official Journal). ( 2 ) OJ C 255, 14.10.2005, p. 79. ( 3 ) OJ C 231, 20.9.2005, p. 1. ( 4 ) OJ C 121, 20.5.2005, p. 14. (4) The increase in the number of the Community\u2019s land and sea borders and the extension of its terri- tory mean that the value added of cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation in the Community should be increased. (5) The Cohesion Fund should be integrated into the programming of structural assistance in the interest of greater coherence in the intervention of the various Funds. (6) The role of the instruments providing aid for rural development, namely the European Agri- cultural Fund for Rural Development pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural devel- opment by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EARDF) ( 5 ), and for the fisheries sector, namely a European Fisheries Fund (EFF), should be specified. Those instru- ments should be integrated into the instruments under the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy and coor dinated with those under the cohesion policy. (7) The Funds providing assistance under the cohe- sion policy are therefore limited to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Euro- pean Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund. The rules applicable to each Fund are to be speci- fied in implementing regulations adopted under Articles 148, 161 and 162 of the Treaty. (8) Under Article 55 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds ( 6 ), the Council is to review that Regulation on the basis of a proposal from the Commission by 31 December 2006 at the latest. In order to imple- ment the reform of the Funds proposed by this Regulation, Regulation (EC) No 1260/99 should be repealed. (9) To increase the value added of Community cohe- sion policy, the work of the Structural Funds and of the Cohesion Fund should be concen- trated and simplified and the objectives set out ( 5 ) OJ L 277, 21.10.2005, p. 1. ( 6 ) OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 173/2005 (OJ L 29, 2.2.2005, p. 3). COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 ",
        "12 in Regu lation (EC) No 1260/1999 redefined accordingly as seeking the convergence of the Member States and the regions, regional compet- itiveness and employment and European territo- rial cooper ation. (10) Within those three objectives, both economic and social charac teristics and territorial char- acteristics should be taken into account in an appropriate fashion. (11) The outermost regions should benefit from specific measures and additional funding to offset the handicaps resulting from the factors referred to in Article 299(2) of the Treaty. (12) The problems of accessibility and remoteness from large markets confronting areas with an extremely low population density, as referred to in Protocol 6 on special provisions for Objective 6 in the framework of the Structural Funds in Finland and Sweden to the 1994 Act of Acces- sion, require appropriate financial treatment to offset the effects of these handicaps. (13) In view of the importance of sustainable urban development and the contribution of towns and cities, particularly medium-sized ones, to regional development, greater account should be taken of them by developing their role in programming to promote urban regeneration. (14) The Funds should take special and complemen- tary action over and above that of the EAFRD and of the EFF to promote the economic diversi- fication of rural areas and of areas dependent on fisheries. (15) Action for areas with a natural handicap, i.e. certain islands, mountainous areas and areas with a low population density, as well as for certain border areas of the Community following enlargement, should be strengthened to cope with their particular development difficulties. (16) Objective criteria for designating eligible regions and areas should be fixed. To this end, the iden- tification of the priority regions and areas at Community level should be based on the common system of classification of the regions established by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the Euro- pean Parliament and the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) ( 7 ). ( 7 ) OJ L 154, 21.6.2003, p. 1. Regulation as amended by Regula- tion (EC) No 1888/2005 (OJ L 309, 25.11.2005, p. 1). (17) A Convergence objective is to cover the Member States and regions whose development is lagging behind. The regions targeted by the Conver- gence objective are those whose per capita gross domestic product (GDP) measured in purchasing power parities is less than 75 % of the Commu- nity average. The regions suffering from the statistical effect linked to the reduction in the Community average following the enlargement of the European Union are to benefit for that reason from substantial transitional aid in order to complete their convergence process. This aid is to end in 2013 and is not to be followed by a further transitional period. The Member States targeted by the Convergence objective whose per capita gross national income (GNI) is less than 90 % of the Community average are to benefit under the Cohesion Fund. (18) A Regional competitiveness and employment objective is to cover the territory of the Commu- nity outside the Convergence objective. The regions eligible are those under Objective 1 in the 2000 to 2006 programming period which no longer satisfy the regional eligibility criteria of the Convergence objective and which therefore benefit from a transitional aid, as well as all the other regions of the Community. (19) A European territorial cooperation objective is to cover regions having land or sea frontiers, the areas for transnational cooper ation being defined with regard to actions promoting integrated terri- torial development and support for interregional cooperation and exchange of experience. (20) The improvement and simplification of coopera- tion along the external borders of the Community entail the use of the instruments of the Commu- nity\u2019s external assistance, in particular a Euro- pean Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assis- tance established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 ( 8 ). (21) The contribution from the ERDF to such coop- eration along the external borders of the Commu- nity assists in redressing the main regional imbal- ances in the Community and thus in strengthening its economic and social cohesion. (22) The activities of the Funds and the operations which they help to finance should be consistent with the other Community policies and comply with Community legislation. ( 8 ) See page 82 of this Official Journal. ",
        "13 (23) Action by the Community should be comple- mentary to that carried out by Member States or seek to contribute to it. The partnership should be strengthened through arrangements for the participation of various types of partner, in particular regional and local authorities, with full regard to the institutional arrangements of the Member States. (24) Multiannual programming should be directed towards achieving the Funds\u2019 objectives by ensuring the availability of the necessary finan- cial resources and the consistency and conti- nuity of joint action by the Community and the Member States. (25) Since the Convergence, Regional competitive- ness and employment, and European territorial cooperation objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the extent of the disparities and the limit on the finan- cial resources of the Member States and regions eligible under the Convergence objective and can therefore be better achieved at Community level through the multiannual guarantee of Commu- nity finance which allows cohesion policy to be concentrated on the Community\u2019s priorities, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsi diarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (24) It is appropriate to set measurable targets for Member States of the European Union as consti- tuted before 1 May 2004 to aim to achieve through expenditure under the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives with a view to promoting competitive- ness and creating jobs. It is necessary to iden- tify appropriate ways to measure and report the attainment of those targets. (25) It is appropriate to strengthen the subsidiarity and proportionality of the intervention of the Struc- tural Funds and of the Cohesion Fund. (28) Under Article 274 of the Treaty, in the context of shared management, the conditions allowing the Commission to exercise its responsibilities for implementation of the general budget of the European Union should be specified and the responsibilities of cooperation by the Member States clarified. Applying these conditions should enable the Commission to satisfy itself that Member States are using the Funds in a legal and regular manner and in accordance with the principle of sound financial management within the meaning of the Financial Regu lation. (29) In order to ensure a genuine economic impact, contributions from the Structural Funds should not replace public expenditure by Member States under the terms of this Regulation. Verification, through partnership, of the principle of addition- ality should concentrate on the regions under the Convergence objective because of the extent of the financial resources allocated to them and may result in a financial correction if additionality is not observed. (30) In the context of its effort in favour of economic and social cohesion, the Community, at all stages of implementation of the Funds, has as its goals to eliminate inequalities and to promote equality between men and women as enshrined in Arti- cles 2 and 3 of the Treaty, as well as combating discrimi nation based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. (31) The Commission should establish the indica- tive annual breakdown of available commitment appropriations using an objective and trans- parent method, taking into account the Commis- sion\u2019s proposal, the conclusions of the European Council of 15 and 16 December 2005 and the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ( 9 ) with a view to achieving a significant concentration on the regions whose development is lagging behind, including those receiving transitional support because of the statistical effect. (32) Financial concentration on the Convergence objective should be increased because of the greater disparities within the enlarged Euro- pean Union, the effort in favour of the Regional competi tiveness and employment objective to improve competitiveness and employment in the rest of the Community should be main tained and the resources for European territorial coopera- tion objective should be increased in view of its particular value added. (33) The annual appropriations allocated to a Member State under the Funds should be limited to a ceiling fixed with regard to its capacity for absorption. ( 9 ) OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p. 1. ",
        "14 (34) Three per cent of the Structural Funds appro- priations allocated to Member States under the Convergence and Regional competi tiveness and employment objectives may be placed in a national reserve for rewarding performance. (35) The appropriations available under the Funds should be indexed on a flat-rate basis for use in programming. (36) To increase the strategic content and promote the transparency of cohesion policy through integra- tion with the Community\u2019s prio rities, the Council should adopt strategic guidelines on a proposal from the Commission. The Council should examine the im plementation of those guide- lines by Member States on the basis of strategic reporting by the Commission. (37) On the basis of the strategic guidelines adopted by the Council, it is appropriate that each Member State prepare, in dialogue with the Commission, a national reference document on its develop ment strategy, which should constitute the framework for preparing operational programmes. On the basis of the national strategy, the Commission should take note of the national strategic refer- ence framework and take a decision on certain of its elements. (38) The programming and management of the Struc- tural Funds should be simplified having regard to their specific features by providing for opera- tional programmes to be financed by either the ERDF or the ESF, with each being able to finance in a comple mentary and limited fashion actions which fall under the scope of the other Fund. (39) With a view to improving complementari- ties and simplifying execution, the assistance of the Cohesion Fund and the ERDF should be jointly programmed in the case of operational programmes on transport and the environment and should have a national geographical coverage. (40) Programming should ensure coordination of the Funds between themselves and with the other existing financial instruments, the EIB and the European Investment Fund (EIF). Such coordina- tion should also cover the preparation of complex financial schemes and public-private partnerships. (41) It is appropriate to ensure that improved access to finance and innovative financial engineering are available primarily to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and for investing in public-private partnerships and other projects included in an integrated plan for sustainable urban development. Member States may decide to set up a holding fund through the award of public contracts pursuant to public procure- ment law, including any dero gation in national law compatible with Community law. In other cases, where Member States are satisfied that public procurement law is not applicable, the definition of tasks of the EIF and the EIB justi- fies that Member States award them a grant that is a direct financial contribution from operational programmes by way of donation. Under the same conditions, national law may provide for the possibility of awarding a grant to other financial institutions without a call for proposal. (42) When appraising major productive investment projects, the Commission should have all neces- sary information to consider whether the finan- cial contribution from the Funds does not result in a substantial loss of jobs in existing locations within the European Union, in order to ensure that Community funding does not support relocation within the European Union (43) The programming period is to last for a single period of seven years in order to maintain the simplification of the management system defined in Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. (44) Member States and managing authorities may organise within the operational programmes co-financed by the ERDF the arrangements for interregional cooperation and may take account of the special features of areas with natural handicaps. (45) In order to address the need for simplification and decentrali sation, programming and financial management should be carried out at the level of the operational programmes and priority axes alone; the Community support framework and the programme complement provided for in Regula- tion (EC) No 1260/1999 should be discontinued. (46) Within the operational programmes co-financed by the ERDF under the Convergence and the Regional competitiveness and employment objectives, Member States, regions and managing authorities may organise sub-delegation to urban authorities in respect of priorities concerning the regeneration of towns and cities. (47) The additional allocation to offset the additional costs faced by the outermost regions should be integrated into the operational programmes financed by the ERDF in those regions. ",
        "15 (48) There should be separate arrangements for imple- mentation of the European territorial cooperation objective financed by the ERDF. (49) The Commission should be able to approve major projects included in operational programmes, if necessary in consultation with the EIB, in order to evaluate their purpose and impact, as well as the arrangements for the planned use of Community resources. (50) It is useful to specify the types of action which the Funds should support as technical assistance. (51) There is a need to ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to assist Member States in project preparation and appraisal. The EIB has a role to play in providing such assistance and could be awarded a grant by the Commission to this end. (52) Similarly it is appropriate to provide that the EIF could be awarded a grant from the Commission to undertake an evaluation of the needs of inno- vative financial engineering instruments available for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. (53) For the same reasons as mentioned above, the EIB and the EIF could be awarded a grant by the Commission to undertake technical assis- tance actions in the area of sustainable urban devel opment or to support restructuring meas- ures for sustainable economic activity in regions significantly affected by economic crisis. (54) The effectiveness of assistance from the Funds also depends on the incorporation of a reliable evaluation into programming and monitoring. The responsibilities of Member States and the Commission in this regard should be specified. (55) Within their national envelope under the Conver- gence and Regional competitiveness and employ- ment objectives, Member States may provide for a small reserve to respond swiftly to unexpected sectoral or local shocks resulting from socio- economic restructuring or the effects of trade agreements. (56) It is appropriate to define what expenditure in a Member State can be assimilated to public expenditure for the purpose of calcu lating the total national public contribution to an operational programme; to this end it is appropriate to refer to the contri bution of the \u2018bodies governed by public law\u2019 as defined in the Community public procure- ment directives since such bodies comprise several types of public or private body established for the specific purpose of meeting needs in the general interest not having an industrial or commercial character and which are controlled by the State, or regional and local authorities. (57) It is necessary to determine the elements for modulating the contribution from the Funds to operational programmes, in particular, to increase the multiplier effect of Community resources. It is also appropriate to establish the maximum ceilings which contributions from the Funds cannot exceed on the basis of the type of Fund and objective. (58) It is also necessary to define the notion of a revenue-generating project and to identify the community principles and rules for calculating the contribution from the Funds; for some invest- ments it is objectively not possible to estimate the revenue in advance and it is therefore neces- sary to define the methodology for ensuring that this revenue is excluded from public funding. (59) The starting and closing dates for the eligi- bility of expenditure should be defined so as to provide a uniform and equitable rule applying to the implementation of the Funds across the Community. In order to facilitate the execution of operational programmes, it is appropriate to establish that the starting date for the eligibility of expenditure may be prior to 1 January 2007 if the Member State concerned submits an opera- tional programme before that date. (60) In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and subject to exceptions provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Regional Development Fund ( 10 ), Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Social Fund ( 11 ) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1084/2006 of 11 July 2006 on the Cohesion Fund ( 12 ), there should be national rules on the elig ibility of expenditure. (61) To ensure the effectiveness, fairness and sustain- able impact of the intervention of the Funds, there should be provisions guaran teeing that investments in businesses are long-lasting and preventing the Funds from being used to intro- duce undue advantage. It is necessary to ensure that investments which benefit from assis- tance under the Funds can be written off over a sufficiently long period. ( 10 ) See page 1 of this Official Journal. ( 11 ) See page 12 of this Official Journal. ( 12 ) See page 79 of this Official Journal. ",
        "16 (62) Member States should adopt adequate meas- ures to guarantee the proper functioning of their management and control systems. To this end, it is necessary to establish the general principles and the necessary functions which the control systems of all operational programmes are to fulfil on the basis of the body of Community law in force for the programming period 2000 to 2006. (63) It is therefore necessary to designate a single managing authority for each operational programme and to clarify its responsibilities as well as the functions of the audit authority. It is also necessary to guarantee uniform quality standards for the certification of expenditures and of payment requests before they are sent to the Commission. It is necessary to clarify the nature and quality of the information on which these requests are based and, to this end, to estab- lish the functions of the certifying authority. (64) Monitoring of operational programmes is neces- sary to ensure the quality of their implementation. To this end, monitoring committees should be set up and their responsibilities defined, together with the information to be transmitted to the Commis- sion and the framework for examining that infor- mation. In order to improve the exchange of information on the im plementation of operational programmes, the principle of exchange of data by electronic means should be established. (65) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and propor tionality, Member States should have the primary responsibility for the implementation and control of the interventions. (66) The obligations on the Member States as regards management and control systems, the certifica- tion of expenditure, and the prevention, detec- tion and correction of irregularities and infrin- gements of Community law should be specified to guarantee the efficient and correct implemen- tation of operational programmes. In particular, concerning management and control, it is neces- sary to establish the procedures by which Member States give the assurance that the systems are in place and function satisfactorily. (67) Without prejudice to the Commission\u2019s powers as regards financial control, cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in this field should be increased and criteria should be established which allow the Commission to determine, in the context of its strategy of control of national systems, the level of assurance it can obtain from national audit bodies. (68) The extent and intensity of Community controls should be proportionate to the extent of the Community\u2019s contribution. Where a Member State is the main provider of the financing for a programme, it is appropriate that there should be an option for that Member State to organise certain elements of the control arrangements according to national rules. In these same circumstances, it is necessary to establish that the Commission differentiates the means by which Member States should fulfil the func- tions of certification of expenditures and of verification of the management and control system and to establish the conditions under which the Commission is entitled to limit its own audit and rely on the assurances provided by national bodies. (69) The payment on account at the start of opera- tional programmes ensures a regular cash flow which facilitate payments to benefi ciaries in the implementation of the operational programme. Therefore, provisions should be made for payments on account for the Structural Funds of 5 % (for Member States of the European Union as constituted before 1 May 2004) and of 7 % (for Member States that acceded to the Euro- pean Union on or after 1 May 2004), and for the Cohesion Fund of 7,5 % (for Member States of the European Union as constituted before 1 May 2004) and of 10,5 % (for Member States that acceded to the European Union on or after 1 May 2004), to help speed up implementation of operational programmes. (70) In addition to the suspension of payments where a serious defi ciency is detected in the management and control systems, there should be measures allowing the authorising officer by delegation to interrupt payments where there is evidence to suggest a significant deficiency in the sound operation of these systems. (71) The rules on automatic decommitment will speed up the im plementation of programmes. To this end, it is appropriate to define the arrangements for their application and the parts of the budgetary commitment which may be excluded from them, notably when delays in implementation result from circumstances which are independent of the party concerned, abnormal or unfor eseeable and whose consequences cannot be avoided despite the diligence shown. (72) The procedures for closure should be simpli- fied by offering the possibility to those Member States which so wish, in accordance with the ",
        "17 schedule which they select, to partially close an opera tional programme in respect of completed operations; the appro priate framework for doing so should be provided. (73) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accord- ance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 13 ). The Commission is to adopt the measures im plementing this Regula- tion for ensuring the transparency and clarifying the provisions applicable to the management of opera tional programmes as regards the catego- risation of expenditure, financial engineering, management and control, electronic exchange of data and publicity after obtaining the opinion of the Coordination Committee of the Funds acting as a management committee. It is appro- priate that the Commission publishes the list of eligible areas for the European territorial coop- eration objective in application of the criteria set out in this Regulation, the indicative guidelines on the cost-benefit analysis necessary for the preparation and submission of major projects and for revenue generating projects, the indicative guidelines on evaluation and the list of actions eligible under technical assistance at the initia- tive of the Commission after consultation of the Coordination Committee of the Funds acting as a consultative committee, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: ( 13 ) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.

        "19 CHAPTER I \u2013 Scope and definitions Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation lays down the general rules governing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) (hereinafter referred to as the Structural Funds) and the Cohesion Fund, without prejudice of the specific provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1080/2006, (EC) No 1081/2006 and (EC) No 1084/2006. This Regulation defines the objectives to which the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund (hereinafter referred to as the Funds) are to contribute, the criteria for Member States and regions to be eligible under those Funds, the financial resources available and the criteria for their allocation. This Regulation defines the context for cohesion policy, including the method for establishing the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion, the national strategic reference framework and the process for examination at Community level. To this end, this Regulation lays down the principles and rules on partnership, programming, evaluation, management, including financial management, moni- toring and control on the basis of responsibilities shared between the Member States and the Commission. Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation, the following terms shall have the meanings assigned to them here: (1) \u2018operational programme\u2019: document submitted by a Member State and adopted by the Commis- sion setting out a development strategy with a coherent set of priorities to be carried out with the aid of a Fund, or, in the case of the Conver- gence objective, with the aid of the Cohesion Fund and the ERDF; (2) \u2018priority axis\u2019: one of the priorities of the strategy in an operational programme comprising a group of operations which are related and have specific measurable goals; (3) \u2018operation\u2019: a project or group of projects selected by the managing authority of the opera- tional programme concerned or under its respon- sibility according to criteria laid down by the monitoring committee and implemented by one or more beneficiaries allowing achievement of the goals of the priority axis to which it relates; (4) \u2018beneficiary\u2019: an operator, body or firm, whether public or private, responsible for initiating or initiating and implementing operations. In the context of aid schemes under Article 87 of the Treaty, bene ficiaries are public or private firms carrying out an individual project and receiving public aid; (5) \u2018public expenditure\u2019: any public contribution to the financing of operations whose origin is the budget of the State, of regional and local authori- ties, of the European Communities related to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and any similar expen diture. Any contribution to the financing of operations whose origin is the budget of public law bodies or associations of one or more regional or local authorities or public law bodies acting in accordance with Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parlia- ment and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordi nation of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts ( 14 ) shall be regarded as similar expenditure; (6) \u2018intermediate body\u2019: any public or private body or service which acts under the responsibility of a managing or certifying authority, or which carries out duties on behalf of such an authority vis-\u00e0-vis beneficiaries implementing operations; (7) \u2018irregularity\u2019: any infringement of a provision of Community law resulting from an act or omission by an economic operator which has, or would have, the effect of prejudicing the general budget of the European Union by charging an unjustified item of expenditure to the general budget. ( 14 ) OJ L 134, 30.04.2004, p. 114. TITLE I OBJECTIVES AND GENERAL RULES ON ASSISTANCE ",
        "20 CHAPTER II \u2013 Objectives and missions Article 3 Objectives 1. The action taken by the Community under Article 158 of the Treaty shall be designed to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of the enlarged European Union in order to promote the harmonious, balanced and sustainable devel- opment of the Community. This action shall be taken with the aid of the Funds, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and other existing finan- cial instruments. It shall be aimed at reducing the economic, social and territorial disparities which have arisen particularly in countries and regions whose development is lagging behind and in connection with economic and social restructuring and the ageing of the population. The action taken under the Funds shall incor- porate, at national and regional level, the Community\u2019s priorities in favour of sustainable devel opment by strengthening growth, competi- tiveness, employment and social inclusion and by protecting and improving the quality of the environment. 2. To that end, the ERDF, the ESF, the Cohesion Fund, the EIB and the other existing Community financial instruments shall each contribute in an appropriate way towards achieving the following three objectives: (a) the Convergence objective, which shall be aimed at speeding up the convergence of the least-developed Member States and regions by improving conditions for growth and employment through the increasing and improvement of the quality of investment in physical and human capital, the develop- ment of innovation and of the knowledge society, adaptability to economic and social changes, the protection and improvement of the environment, and adminis trative effi- ciency. This objective shall constitute the priority of the Funds; (b) the Regional competitiveness and employ- ment objective, which shall, outside the least- developed regions, be aimed at strengthening regions\u2019 competitiveness and attractiveness as well as employment by anticipating economic and social changes, including those linked to the opening of trade, through the increasing and improvement of the quality of invest- ment in human capital, innovation and the promotion of the knowledge society, entre- preneurship, the protection and improvement of the environment, and the improvement of accessibility, adaptability of workers and businesses as well as the development of inclusive job markets; and (c) the European territorial cooperation objective, which shall be aimed at strengthening cross- border cooperation through joint local and regional initiatives, strengthening transnational cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the Community priorities, and strengthening inter- regional cooperation and exchange of experi- ence at the appropriate territorial level. 3. Under the three objectives referred to in para- graph 2, assistance from the Funds shall, according to their nature, take into account specific economic and social features, on the one hand, and specific territorial features, on the other. The assistance shall, in an appropriate manner, support sustainable urban develop- ment particularly as part of regional devel- opment and the renewal of rural areas and of areas dependent on fisheries through economic diversification. The assistance shall also support areas affected by geographical or natural handi- caps which aggravate the problems of develop- ment, particularly in the outermost regions as referred to in Article 299(2) of the Treaty as well as the northern areas with very low popula- tion density, certain islands and island Member States, and mountainous areas. Article 4 Instruments and missions 1. The Funds shall contribute, each in accordance with the specific provisions governing it, towards achieving the three objectives referred to in Article 3(2) as follows: (a) the Convergence objective: the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; (b) the Regional competitiveness and employ- ment objective: the ERDF and the ESF; and (c) the European territorial cooperation objec- tive: the ERDF. 2. The Cohesion Fund shall also intervene in those regions not eligible for support from the Conver- gence objective under the criteria set out in Article 5(1) which belong to: ",
        "21 (a) a Member State eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund under the criteria set out in Article 5(2); and (b) a Member State eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund under the criteria set out in Article 8(3). 3. The Funds shall contribute towards the financing of technical assistance on the initiative of the Member States and the Commission. CHAPTER III \u2013 Geographical eligibility Article 5 Convergence 1. The regions eligible for funding from the Struc- tural Funds under the Convergence objective shall be regions corresponding to level 2 of the common classification of territorial units for statistics (hereinafter NUTS level 2) within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 whose gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, measured in purchasing power parities and calculated on the basis of Community figures for the period 2000 to 2002, is less than 75 % of the average GDP of the EU-25 for the same reference period. 2. The Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund shall be those whose gross national income (GNI) per capita, measured in purchasing power parities and calculated on the basis of Community figures for the period 2001 to 2003, is less than 90 % of the average GNI of the EU-25 and which have a programme for meeting the economic convergence conditions referred to in Article 104 of the Treaty. 3. Immediately following the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall adopt the list of regions fulfilling the criteria under paragraph 1 and of Member States fulfilling the criteria under paragraph 2. This list shall be valid from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. The eligibility of Member States for the Cohe- sion Fund shall be reviewed in 2010 on the basis of Community GNI figures for the EU-25. Article 6 Regional competitiveness and employment The regions eligible for funding from the Struc- tural Funds under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective shall be those not covered by Article 5(1) and Article 8(1) and (2). When presenting the national strategic reference framework referred to in Article 27, each Member State concerned shall indicate the NUTS level 1 or NUTS level 2 regions for which it will present a programme for financing by the ERDF. Article 7 European Territorial Cooperation 1. For the purpose of cross-border cooperation, the NUTS level 3 regions of the Community along all internal and certain external land borders and all NUTS level 3 regions of the Community along maritime borders separated, as a general rule, by a maximum of 150 kilometres shall be eligible for financing taking into account poten- tial adjustments needed to ensure the coherence and continuity of the cooperation action. Immediately following the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 103(2), the list of the eligible regions. This list shall be valid from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. 2. For the purpose of transnational cooperation, the Commission, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 103(2), shall adopt the list of the eligible transnational areas broken down by programme. This list shall be valid from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. 3. For the purpose of interregional cooperation, coop- eration networks and exchange of experience, the entire territory of the Community shall be eligible. Article 8 Transitional support 1. The NUTS level 2 regions which would have been eligible for Convergence objective status under Article 5(1) had the eligibility threshold remained at 75 % of the average GDP of the EU-15, but which lose eligibility because their nominal GDP per capita level will exceed 75 % of the average GDP of the EU-25, measured and calculated according to Article 5(1), shall be eligible, on a transitional and specific basis, for financing by the Structural Funds under the Convergence objective. 2. The NUTS level 2 regions totally covered by Objective 1 in 2006 under Article 3 of Regulation ",
        "22 (EC) No 1260/1999 whose nominal GDP level per capita, measured and calculated according to Article 5(1), will exceed 75 % of the average GDP of the EU15 shall be eligible, on a transitional and specific basis, for financing by the Structural Funds under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective. Recognising that, on the basis of revised figures for the period 1997 to 1999, Cyprus should have been eligible for Objective 1 in 2004 to 2006, Cyprus shall benefit in 2007 to 2013 from the transitional financing applicable to the regions referred to in the first subparagraph. 3. The Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund in 2006 which would have continued to be eligible had the eligibility threshold remained at 90 % of the average GNI of the EU-15, but which lose eligibility because their nominal per capita GNI will exceed 90 % of the average GNI of the EU-25 measured and calculated according to Article 5(2), shall be eligible, on a transitional and specific basis, for financing by the Cohesion Fund under the Convergence objective. 4. Immediately following the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall adopt the list of regions fulfilling the criteria under para- graphs 1 and 2 and of Member States fulfilling the criteria under paragraph 3. This list shall be valid from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. CHAPTER IV \u2013 Principles of assistance Article 9 Complementarity, consistency, coordination and compliance 1. The Funds shall provide assistance which complements national actions, including actions at the regional and local levels, integrating into them the priorities of the Community. 2. The Commission and the Member States shall ensure that assistance from the Funds is consistent with the activities, policies and priorities of the Community and comple- mentary to other financial instruments of the Community. This consistency and comple- mentarity shall be indicated in particular in Community strategic guidelines on cohesion, in the national strategic reference framework and in the oper ational programmes. 3. The assistance co-financed by the Funds shall target the European Union priorities of promoting competitiveness and creating jobs, including meeting the objectives of the Integrated Guide- lines for Growth and Jobs (2005 to 2008) as set out by Council Decision 2005/600/EC of 12 July 2005 ( 15 ). To this end, in accordance with their respective responsibilities, the Commission and the Member States shall ensure that 60 % of expenditure for the Convergence objective and 75 % of expenditure for the Regional competi- tiveness and employment objective for all the Member States of the European Union as consti- tuted before 1 May 2004 is set for the abovemen- tioned priorities. These targets, based on the cate- gories of expenditure in Annex IV, shall apply as an average over the entire programming period. With a view to ensuring that specific national circumstances, including the priorities identi- fied in the national reform programme of each Member State concerned, are taken into account, the Commission and that Member State may decide to complement in an appropriate manner the list of categories of Annex IV. Each Member State concerned shall contribute to these targets.

The partnership shall cover the preparation, imple- mentation, monitoring and evaluation of operational programmes. Member States shall involve, where appropriate, each of the relevant partners, and partic- ularly the regions, in the different stages of program- ming within the time limit set for each stage. 3. Each year the Commission shall consult the organi- sations rep resenting the economic and social partners at European level on assistance from the Funds. Article 12 Territorial level of implementation Implementation of operational programmes referred to in Article 32 shall be the responsibility of Member States at the appropriate territorial level, in accordance with the institutional system specific to each Member State. That responsibility shall be exercised in accord- ance with this Regulation. Article 13 Proportional intervention 1. The financial and administrative resources employed by the Commission and Member States in the implementation of the Funds in relation to: (a) the choice of indicators provided for in Article 37(1)(c); (b) the evaluation under Articles 47 and 48; (c) the general principles of management and control systems referred to in Article 58(e) and (f); (d) the reporting as referred to in Article 67, shall be proportional to the total amount of expend- iture allocated to an operational programme. 2. In addition, specific provisions relating to proportionality in relation to controls are set out in Article 74 of this Regulation. Article 14 Shared management 1.

Article 15 Additionality 1. Contributions from the Structural Funds shall not replace public or equivalent structural expendi- ture by a Member State. 2. For regions covered by the Convergence objec- tive, the Commission and the Member State shall determine the level of public or equivalent struc- tural expenditure which the Member State shall maintain in all the regions concerned during the programming period. The level of expenditure by a Member State shall be one of the items covered by the decision of the Commission on the national strategic reference framework referred to in Article 28(3). The meth- odological paper of the Commission, adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 103(3), shall provide guidance. 3. As a general rule, the level of the expenditure referred to in paragraph 2 shall be at least equal to the amount of average annual expenditure in real terms attained during the previous program- ming period. Furthermore, the level of expenditure shall be determined with reference to the general macro- economic conditions in which the financing is carried out and taking into account certain specific or exceptional economic situations, such as privatisations as well as an exceptional level of public or equivalent structural expenditure by the Member State during the previous program- ming period. 4. The Commission shall, in cooperation with each Member State, verify additionality mid-term in 2011 for the Convergence objective. As part of this mid-term verification, the Commission, in consultation with the Member State, may decide to modify the required level of structural expendi- ture if the economic situation in the Member State concerned has significantly changed from the one existing at the moment of the determination of the level of public or equivalent structural expendi- ture referred to in paragraph 2. The decision of the Commission referred to in Article28(3) shall be amended to reflect this adjustment. The Commission shall, in cooperation with each Member State, verify additionality ex post on 31 December 2016 for the Convergence objective. The Member State shall transmit to the Commis- sion the information required to enable the verification of compliance with the level of public or equivalent structural expenditure determined ex ante . Where necessary, methods of statistical estimation should be used. The Commission shall publish the results by Member State of the verification of the addition- ality, including the methodology and sources of information, after the conclusion of each of the three stages of verification. Article 16 Equality between men and women and non-discrimination The Member States and the Commission shall ensure that equality between men and women and the integra- tion of the gender perspective is promoted during the various stages of implementation of the Funds.

The EIB or the EIF may, upon request of the Member States, take part in technical assistance activities referred to in the first subparagraph. 2. For each of the three objectives, technical assis- tance actions, within the limits set in paragraph 1, shall, in principle, be undertaken within the framework of each operational programme. On a comple mentary basis, however, such actions may be undertaken partially and subject to the overall limits for technical assistance set in paragraph 1, in the form of a specific operational programme. ",
        "36 3. \u25baC2 If the Member State decides to undertake technical assistance actions in the framework of each operational programme, the proportion of the total amount allocated for technical assis- tance in respect of each operational programme shall not exceed the limits set in paragraph 1. In this case, where technical assistance actions are also undertaken in the form of a specific operational programme, the total amount allocated for technical assistance in such a specific programme shall not cause the total proportion of Funds allocated to technical assistance to exceed the limits set in paragraph 1. \u25c4 ",
        "37 CHAPTER I \u2013 Evaluation Article 47 General provisions 1. Evaluations shall aim to improve the quality, effec- tiveness and consistency of the assistance from the Funds and the strategy and im plementation of operational programmes with respect to the specific structural problems affecting the Member States and regions concerned, while taking account of the objective of sustainable devel opment and of the relevant Community legislation concerning environ mental impact and strategic environmental assessment. 2. Evaluations may be of a strategic nature in order to examine the evolution of a programme or group of programmes in relation to Commu- nity and national priorities, or of an operational nature in order to support the monitoring of an operational programme. Evaluations shall be carried out before, during and after the program- ming period. 3. Evaluations shall be carried out under the respon- sibility of the Member State or the Commission, as appropriate, in accordance with the principle of proportionality laid down in Article 13. Evaluations shall be carried out by experts or bodies, internal or external, functionally independent of the authorities referred to in Article 59(b) and (c). The results shall be published according to the applicable rules on access to documents. 4. Evaluations shall be financed from the budget for technical assistance. 5. The Commission shall provide indicative guid- ance on evaluation methods, including quality standards, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 103(2). Article 48 Responsibility of Member States 1. The Member States shall provide the resources necessary for carrying out evaluations, organise the production and gathering of the necessary data and use the various types of information provided by the monitoring system. They may also draw up, where appropriate, under the Convergence objective, in accord- ance with the principle of proportionality set out in Article 13, an evaluation plan presenting the indicative evaluation activities which the Member State intends to carry out in the different phases of the implementation. 2. Member States shall carry out an ex ante evalu- ation for each operational programme separately under the Convergence objective. In duly justified cases, taking into account the proportionality prin- ciple as set out in Article 13 and as agreed between the Commission and the Member State, Member States may carry out a single ex ante evaluation covering more than one operational programme. For the Regional competitiveness and employ- ment objective, Member States shall carry out either an ex ante evaluation covering all the opera- tional programmes or an evaluation for each Fund or an evaluation for each priority or an evaluation for each operational programme. For the European territorial cooperation objective, the Member States shall jointly carry out an ex ante evaluation covering either each oper ational programme or several operational programmes. Ex ante evaluations shall be carried out under the responsibility of the authority responsible for the preparation of the programming documents. Ex ante evaluations shall aim to optimise the allocation of budgetary resources under opera- tional programmes and improve programming quality. They shall identify and appraise the disparities, gaps and potential for development, the goals to be achieved, the results expected, the quantified targets, the coherence, if neces- sary, of the strategy proposed for the region, the Community value-added, the extent to which the Community\u2019s priorities have been taken into account, the lessons drawn from previous programming and the quality of the procedures for implementation, monitoring, evaluation and financial management. 3. During the programming period, Member States shall carry out evaluations linked to the moni- toring of operational programmes in particular where that monitoring reveals a significant TITLE IV EFFECTIVENESS ",
        "38 departure from the goals initially set. Where proposals are made for the revision of opera- tional programmes, as referred to in Article 33, analyses shall be provided on the reasons for the revision, including any implementation difficulties, and the expected impact of the revi- sion, including that on the strategy of the opera- tional programme. The results of such evalua- tions or analyses shall be sent to the monitoring committee for the operational programme and to the Commission. Article 49 Responsibility of the Commission 1. The Commission may carry out strategic evalua- tions. 2. The Commission may carry out, at its initia- tive and in partnership with the Member State concerned, evaluations linked to the monitoring of operational programmes where the monitoring of programmes reveals a significant departure from the goals initially set. The results shall be sent to the monitoring committee for the opera- tional programme. 3. The Commission shall carry out an ex post evalu- ation for each objective in close cooperation with the Member State and managing authorities. Ex post evaluation shall cover all the operational programmes under each objective and examine the extent to which resources were used, the effectiveness and efficiency of Fund programming and the socio- economic impact. It shall be carried out for each of the objectives and shall aim to draw conclusions for the policy on economic and social cohesion. It shall identify the factors contributing to the success or failure of the implementation of operational programmes and identify good practice. Ex post evaluation shall be completed by 31 December 2015. CHAPTER II \u2013 Reserves Article 50 National performance reserve 1. At its own initiative, a Member State may decide to establish a national performance reserve for the Convergence objective and/or the Regional compet- itiveness and employment objective, consisting of 3 % of its total allocation for each one. 2. Where a Member State has decided to establish such a reserve, it shall assess under each of the objectives not later than 30 June 2011 the perfor- mance of its operational programmes. 3. Not later than 31 December 2011, on the basis of proposals from and in close consultation with each Member State concerned, the Commission shall allocate the national performance reserve. Article 51 National contingency reserve At its own initiative, a Member State may reserve an amount of 1 % of the annual Structural Fund contri- bution to the Convergence objective and 3 % of the annual Structural Fund contribution to the Regional competitiveness and employment objective to cover unforeseen local or sectoral crises linked to economic and social restructuring or to the consequences of the opening up of trade. The Member State may allocate the reserve for each objective to a specific national programme or within operational programmes. ",
        "39 CHAPTER I \u2013 Contribution from the funds Article 52 Modulation of the contribution rates The contribution from the Funds may be modulated in the light of the following: (a) the gravity of the specific problems, in partic- ular of an economic, social or territorial nature; (b) the importance of each priority axis for the Community\u2019s priorities as set out in the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion, as well as for national and regional priorities; (c) protection and improvement of the environ- ment, principally through the application of the precautionary principle, the principle of preven- tive action, and the polluter-pays principle; (d) the rate of mobilisation of private financing, in particular under public-private partner- ships, in the fields concerned; (e) the inclusion of interregional cooperation as referred to in Article 37(6)(b) under the Convergence and Regional competi tiveness and employment objectives; (f) under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective, the coverage of areas with a geographical or natural handicap defined as follows: (i) island Member States eligible under the Cohesion Fund, and other islands except those on which the capital of a Member State is situated or which have a fixed link to the mainland; (ii) mountainous areas as defined by the national legislation of the Member State; (iii) sparsely (less than 50 inhabitants per square kilometre) and very sparsely (less than 8 inhabitants per square kilometre) populated areas; (iv) the areas which were external borders of the Community on 30 April 2004 and which ceased to be so on the day after that date. Article 53 Contribution from the Funds 1. The contribution from the Funds, at the level of operational programmes, shall be calculated with reference to: (a) either the total eligible expenditure including public and private expenditure; (b) or the public eligible expenditure. 2. The contribution from the Funds at the level of operational programmes under the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives shall be subject to the ceilings set out in Annex III. 3. For operational programmes under the Euro- pean territorial cooper ation objective in which at least one participant belongs to a Member State whose average GDP per capita for the period 2001 to 2003 was below 85 % of the EU-25 average during the same period, the contri bution from the ERDF shall not be higher than 85 % of the eligible expenditure. For all other operational programmes, the contribu- tion from the ERDF shall not be higher than 75 % of the eligible expenditure co-financed by the ERDF. 4. The contribution from the Funds at the priority axis level shall not be subject to the ceilings set out in paragraph 3 and in Annex III. However, it shall be fixed so as to ensure compliance with the maximum amount of contribution from the Funds and the maximum contribution rate per Fund fixed at the level of the opera- tional programme. 5. For operational programmes co-financed jointly: (a) by the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund; or (b) by the additional allocation for the outermost regions provided for in Annex II, the ERDF and/or the Cohesion Fund, the decision adopting the operational programme shall fix the maximum rate and the maximum amount of the contribution for each Fund and allocation separately. TITLE V FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION FROM THE FUNDS ",
        "40 6. The Commission\u2019s decision adopting an opera- tional programme shall fix the maximum rate and the maximum amount of the contri bution from Fund for each operational programme and for each priority axis. The decision shall show sepa- rately the appropriations for regions receiving transitional support. Article 54 Other provisions 1. The contribution from the Funds for each priority axis shall not be less than 20 % of the eligible public expenditure. 2. Technical assistance measures implemented at the initiative of or on behalf of the Commission may be financed at the rate of 100 %. 3. During the period of eligibility referred to in Article 56(1): (a) a priority axis may receive assistance from only one Fund and one objective at a time; (b) an operation may receive assistance from a Fund under only one operational programme at a time; (c) an operation shall not receive an assistance from a Fund higher than the total public expenditure allocated. 4. For State aid to enterprises within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty, public aid granted under operational programmes shall observe the ceil- ings on State aid. 5. An expenditure co-financed by the Funds shall not receive assistance from another Community financial instrument. CHAPTER II \u2013 Revenue-generating projects Article 55 Revenue-generating projects 1. For the purposes of this Regulation, a revenue-gener- ating project means any operation involving an invest- ment in infrastructure the use of which is subject to charges borne directly by users or any operation involving the sale or rent of land or buildings or any other provision of services against payment. 2. Eligible expenditure on revenue-generating projects shall not exceed the current value of the investment cost less the current value of the net revenue from the investment over a specific reference period for: (a) investments in infrastructure; or (b) other projects where it is possible to objec- tively estimate the revenues in advance. Where not all the investment cost is eligible for co-financing, the net revenue shall be allocated pro rata to the eligible and non-eligible parts of the investment cost. In the calculation, the managing authority shall take account of the reference period appropriate to the category of investment concerned, the category of project, the profitability normally expected of the category of investment concerned, the application of the polluter-pays principle, and, if appropriate, considerations of equity linked to the relative prosperity of the Member State concerned. 3. Where it is objectively not possible to estimate the revenue in advance, the net revenue gener- ated within five years of the completion of an operation shall be deducted from the expenditure declared to the Commission. 4. Where it is established that an operation has generated net revenue that has not been taken into account under paragraphs 2 and 3, such net revenue shall be deducted by the certi- fying authority at the latest on submission of the documents for the operational programme referred to in Article 89(1)(a). The applica- tion for payment of the final balance shall be corrected accordingly. 5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article shall apply only to operations which are co-financed by the ERDF or Cohesion Fund and the total cost of which exceeds EUR 1 000 000. 6. This Article shall not apply to projects subject to the rules on State aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty. ",
        "41 CHAPTER III \u2013 Eligibility of expenditure Article 56 Eligibility of expenditure 1.

Operations must not have been completed before the starting date for eligibility. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, contri- butions in kind, depreciation costs and overheads may be considered as incurred expen diture by beneficiaries for the implementation of opera- tions under the conditions laid down in the third subparagraph of this paragraph. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, contri- butions in kind, as regards financial engineering instruments as defined in Article 78(6), first subparagraph, can be treated as expenditure paid at the constitution of the funds or holding funds or contributing to those funds or holding funds, under the conditions established in the third subparagraph of this paragraph. Expenditure mentioned in the first and second subparagraphs must fulfil the following conditions: (a) the eligibility rules drawn up on the basis of paragraph 4 foresee the eligibility of such expenditure; (b) the amount of the expenditure is duly justified by supporting documents having equivalent probative value to invoices, without prejudice to provisions set out in specific Regulations; (c) in the case of contributions in kind, the co-financing from the Funds does not exceed the total of eligible expenditure, excluding the value of such contribu- tions. 3. Expenditure shall be eligible for a contribution from the Funds only where incurred for opera- tions decided on by the managing authority of the operational programme concerned or under its respon sibility, in accordance with criteria fixed by the monitoring committee. Where a new category of expenditure as referred to in Table 1 of Part A of Annex II to Commission Regu- lation (EC) No 1828/2006 ( 17 ) is added at the time of the revision of an operational programme referred to in Article 33 of this Regulation, any expenditure falling under such category shall be eligible from the date of the submission to the Commission of the request for revision of the operational programme. 4. The rules on the eligibility of expenditure shall be laid down at national level subject to the exceptions provided for in the specific Regula- tions for each Fund. They shall cover the entirety of the expen diture declared under the operational programme. 5. This Article shall be without prejudice to the expenditure referred to in Article 45. CHAPTER IV \u2013 Durability of operations Article 57 Durability of operations 1. The Member State or managing authority shall ensure that an operation comprising invest- ment in infrastructure or productive investment retains the contribution from the Funds only if it does not, within five years from its comple- tion, undergo a substantial modifi cation which is caused by a change in the nature of ownership of an item of infrastructure or the cessation of a productive activity and which affects the nature or the implementation conditions of the opera- tion or gives to a firm or a public body an undue advantage. Actions falling within the scope of assistance from the ESF shall be considered as not having retained the contribution only where they are subject to an obligation for maintenance of investment under the applicable rules on State aid within the meaning of Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and where they undergo a substantial modification as a result of the cessation of productive activity within the period laid down in those rules.

Where the nature of the assistance permits, statis- tics shall be broken down by sex and by the size of the recipient undertakings. 3. Data exchange between the Commission and the Member States for this purpose shall be carried out electronically, in accordance with the imple- menting rules of this Regulation adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 103(3). Article 67 Annual report and final report on implementation 1. For the first time in 2008 and by 30 June each year, the managing authority shall send the Commission an annual report and by 31 March 2017 a final report on the implementation of the operational programme. 2. The reports referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the following information in order to obtain a clear view of the implementation of the operational programme: (a) the progress made in implementing the oper- ational programme and priority axes in rela- tion to their specific, verifiable targets, with a quantification, wherever and whenever they ",

Where appropriate, such information may be provided in summary form. Information referred to in points (d), (g), (h) and (i) shall not be included if there has been no significant modification since the previous report. 3. The reports referred to in paragraph 1 shall be judged admissible where they contain all the appropriate information listed in paragraph 2. The Commission shall inform the Member State on the admissibility of the annual report within 10 working days from the date of its receipt. 4. The Commission shall inform the Member State of its opinion on the content of an admissible annual report on implementation submitted by the managing authority within two months from the date of receipt. For the final report on an operational programme, the time limit shall be a maximum of five months from the date of receipt of an admissible report. If the Commission does not respond within the time limit laid down, the report shall be deemed to be accepted. Article 68 Annual examination of programmes 1. Every year, when the annual report on implemen- tation referred to in Article 67 is submitted, the Commission and the managing authority shall examine the progress made in implementing the operational programme, the principal results achieved over the previous year, the financial implementation and other factors with a view to improving implementation. Any aspects of the operation of the manage- ment and control system raised in the last annual control report, referred to in Article 62(1)(d)(i), may also be examined. ",
        "48 2. After the examination referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission may make comments to the Member State and the managing authority, which shall inform the monitoring committee thereof. The Member State shall inform the Commission of the action taken in response to those comments. 3.

Member States shall be responsible for the manage- ment and control of operational programmes, in particular through the following measures: (a) ensuring that management and control systems for operational programmes are set up in accordance with Articles 58 to 62 and function effectively; (b) preventing, detecting and correcting irregu- larities and recovering amounts unduly paid together with interest on late payments where appropriate. They shall notify these to the Commission and keep the Commission informed of the progress of administrative and legal proceedings. 2. When amounts unduly paid to a beneficiary cannot be recovered, the Member State shall be responsible for reimbursing the amounts lost to the general budget of the European Union, when it is established that the loss has been incurred as a result of fault or negligence on its part. 3. The implementing rules for paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 103(3). Article 71 Setting up of management and control systems 1. Before the submission of the first interim appli- cation for payment or at the latest within twelve months of the approval of each operational programme, the Member States shall submit to the Commission a description of the systems, covering in particular the organisation and proce- dures of: (a) the managing and certifying authorities and intermediate bodies; (b) the audit authority and any other bodies carrying out audits under its responsibility. 2. The description referred to in paragraph 1 shall be accompanied by a report setting out the results of an assessment of the systems set up and giving an opinion on their compliance with Articles 58 to 62. If the opinion contains reser- vations, the report shall indicate the seriousness of the shortcomings and, where the shortcom- ings do not concern the whole programme, the priority axis or axes concerned. The Member State shall inform the Commission of the correc- tive measures to be taken and the timetable for their implementation and subsequently provide confir mation of the implementation of the meas- ures and the withdrawal of the corresponding reservations. The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall be deemed to be accepted, and the first interim payment shall be made, in the following circumstances: ",
        "49 (a) within two months of the date of receipt of the report when the opinion referred to in the first subparagraph is without reservations and in the absence of observations by the Commission; (b) if the opinion contains reservations, upon confirmation to the Commission that correc- tive measures concerning key elements of the systems have been implemented, and the corresponding reser vations withdrawn, and in the absence of observations by the Commission within two months of the date of confirmation. Where the reservations concern only a single priority axis, the first interim payment shall be made as regards the other priority axes of the operational programme for which there is no reservation. 3. The report and the opinion referred to in para- graph 2 shall be drawn up by the audit authority or by a public or private body func tionally inde- pendent of the managing and certifying authori- ties, which shall carry out its work taking account of internationally accepted audit standards. 4. Where a common system applies to several operational programmes, a description of the common system may be notified under para- graph 1 accompanied by a single report and opinion under paragraph 2. 5. The implementing rules for paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 103(3). Section 2 \u2013 Responsibilities of the Commission Article 72 Responsibilities of the Commission 1. The Commission shall satisfy itself in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 71 that the Member States have set up management and control systems that comply with Articles 58 to 62 and, on the basis of the annual control reports and annual opinion of the audit authority and its own audits, that the systems function effectively during the periods of implementation of opera- tional programmes. 2. Without prejudice to audits carried out by Member States, Commission officials or author- ised Commission representatives may carry out on-the-spot audits to verify the effective func- tioning of the management and control systems, which may include audits on operations included in operational programmes, with a minimum of 10 working days\u2019 notice, except in urgent cases. Officials or authorised representatives of the Member State may take part in such audits. The implementing rules of this Regulation concerning the use of data collected during audits shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 103(3). Commission officials or authorised Commission repre- sentatives, duly empowered to carry out on-the-spot audits, shall have access to the books and all other documents, including documents and metadata drawn up or received and recorded on an electronic medium, relating to expenditure financed by the Funds. The aforementioned powers of audit shall not affect the application of national provisions which reserve certain acts for agents specifically designated by national legislation. Authorised Commission represen- tatives shall not take part, inter alia, in home visits or the formal questioning of persons within the frame- work of the national legislation of the Member State concerned. However, they shall have access to infor- mation thus obtained. 3. The Commission may require a Member State to carry out an on-the-spot audit to verify the effec- tive functioning of systems or the correctness of one or more transactions. Commission officials or authorised Commission representatives may take part in such audits. Article 73 Cooperation with the audit authorities of the Member States 1. The Commission shall cooperate with the audit authorities of op erational programmes to coor- dinate their respective audit plans and audit methods and shall immediately exchange the results of audits carried out on management and control systems in order to make the best possible use of resources and to avoid unjustified duplica- tion of work. In order to facilitate this cooperation in cases where a Member State designates several audit authorities, the Member State may designate a coordination body. The Commission and the audit authorities, and the coordination body, where such a body has been designated, shall meet on a regular basis and at least once a year unless otherwise agreed ",
        "50 between them in order to examine together the annual control report and opinion presented under Article 62 and to exchange views on other issues relating to the improvement of the management and control of operational programmes. 2. In determining its own audit strategy, the Commis- sion shall identify those operational programmes for which the opinion on the compliance of systems under Article 71(2) is without reserva- tions, or where reservations have been withdrawn following corrective measures, where the audit strategy of the audit authority is satisfactory and where reasonable assurance has been obtained that the management and control systems function effectively on the basis of the results of audits by the Commission and the Member State. 3. For those programmes, the Commission may conclude that it can rely principally on the opinion referred to in Article 62(1)(d)(ii) with regard to the effective functioning of the systems and that it will carry out its own on-the-spot audits only if there is evidence to suggest short comings in the system affecting expenditure certified to the Commission in a year for which an opinion under Article 62(1) (d)(ii) has been provided which contains no reser- vation in respect of such shortcomings. Where the Commission reaches such a conclu- sion, it shall inform the Member State concerned accordingly. Where there is evidence to suggest shortcomings, it may require the Member State to carry out audits in accordance with Article 72(3) or it may carry out its own audits under Article 72(2). Section 3 \u2013 Proportionality in the control of operational programmes Article 74 Proportional control arrangements 1. For operational programmes for which the total eligible public expenditure does not exceed EUR 750 million and for which the level of Community co-financing does not exceed 40 % of the total public expenditure: (a) the audit authority is not required to present to the Commission an audit strategy under Article 62(1)(c); (b) where the opinion on the compliance of systems under Article 71(2) is without reser- vations, or where reservations have been withdrawn following corrective measures, the Commission may conclude that it can rely principally on the opinion referred to in Article 62(1)(d)(ii) with regard to the effec- tive functioning of the systems and that it will carry out its own on-the-spot audits only if there is evidence to suggest shortcomings in the system affecting expenditure certified to the Commission in a year for which an opinion under Article 62(1)(d)(ii) has been provided which contains no reservation in respect of such shortcomings. Where the Commission reaches such a conclusion, it shall inform the Member State concerned accordingly. Where there is evidence to suggest shortcomings it may require the Member State to carry out audits in accordance with Article 72(3) or it may carry out its own audits under Article 72(2). 2. For the operational programmes referred to in paragraph 1, a Member State may in addition exer- cise the option to establish according to national rules the bodies and procedures for carrying out: (a) the functions of the managing authority in relation to the verifi cation of the co-financed products and services and expenditure declared under Article 60(b); (b) the functions of the certifying authority under Article 61; and (c) the functions of the audit authority under Article 62. Where a Member State exercises this option it need not designate a certifying authority and an audit authority under Article 59(1) (b) and (c). Article 71 shall apply mutatis mutandis . When the Commission adopts implementing rules for Articles 60, 61 and 62, it shall specify the provisions which shall not apply to opera tional programmes for which the option in this paragraph has been exercised by the Member State concerned . ",
        "51 CHAPTER I \u2013 Financial management Section 1 \u2013 Budget commitments Article 75 Budget commitments 1. The Community budget commitments in respect of operational programmes (hereinafter budget commitments) shall be effected annually for each Fund and objective during the period between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2013.

Each subsequent commitment shall be made, as a general rule, by 30 April each year by the Commission on the basis of the decision to grant a contribution from the Funds referred to in Article 32. 2. Where no payment has been made, the Member State may request, by 30 September of the year n at the latest, the transfer of any commitments in respect of operational programmes related to the national contingency reserve referred to in Article 51 to other opera tional programmes. The Member State shall specify in its request the oper- ational programmes benefiting from that transfer. Section 2 \u2013 Common rules for payments Article 76 Common rules for payments 1. Payments by the Commission of the contribution from the Funds shall be made in accordance with the budget appropriations. Each payment shall be posted to the earliest open budget commitments of the Fund concerned. 2. Payments shall take the form of pre-financing, interim payments and payment of the final balance. They shall be made to the body desig- nated by the Member State. 3. At the latest by 30 April each year, Member States shall send the Commission a provisional forecast of their likely applications for payment for the current financial year and the subsequent financial year. 4. All exchanges concerning financial transactions between the Commission and the authorities and bodies designated by the Member States shall be made by electronic means, in accordance with the im plementing rules of this Regulation adopted by the Commission in accordance with the proce- dure referred to in Article 103(3). In cases of force majeure , and in particular of malfunction of the common computerised system or a lack of a lasting connection, Member States may forward statements of expenditure and applications for payment in hard copy. Article 77 Common rules for calculating interim payments and payments of the final balance Interim payments and payments of the final balance shall be calculated by applying the co-financing rate laid down in the decision on the operational programme concerned for each priority axis to the eligible expenditure mentioned under that priority axis in each statement of expenditure certified by the certi- fying authority. However the Community contribution through the interim payments and payments of the final balance shall not be higher than the public contri bution and the maximum amount of assistance from the Funds for each priority axis as laid down in the decision of the Commission approving the operational programme. Article 78 Statement of expenditure 1. All statements of expenditure shall include, for each priority axis, the total amount of eligible expenditure, in accordance with Article 56, paid by beneficiaries in implementing the operations and the corre sponding public contribution paid or due to be paid to the beneficiaries according to the conditions governing the public contribu- tion. Expenditure paid by beneficiaries shall be supported by receipted invoices or accounting documents of equivalent probative value, unless otherwise provided in specific Regulations for each Fund. However, as regards aid schemes within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty only, in addition to the conditions set out in the previous subparagraph, the public contribution corresponding to the expenditure included in a statement of expenditure shall have been paid to the beneficiaries by the body granting the aid. TITLE VII FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ",
        "52 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, as regards State aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty, the statement of expen diture may include advances paid to the beneficiaries by the body granting the aid, under the following cumu- lative conditions: (a) they shall be subject to a guarantee provided by a bank or other financial institution estab- lished in a Member State; Point (b) deleted. (c) they shall be covered by expenditure paid by beneficiaries in im plementing the project and supported by receipted invoices or accounting documents of equivalent proba- tive value at the latest three years after the year of the payment of the advance or on 31 December 2015, whichever earlier; if they are not, the next statement of expenditure shall be corrected accordingly. A facility provided as a guarantee by a public entity or by the Member State itself shall be considered equiva- lent to a guarantee referred to in point (a) in the first subparagraph. 3. Statements of expenditure shall identify, for each operational programme, the elements referred to in paragraph 1 relating to regions receiving tran- sitional assistance. 4. When, in application of Article 41(3), the Commission refuses to make a financial contri- bution to a major project, the expenditure decla- ration following the adoption of the Commission decision must be rectified accordingly. 5. Where the contribution from the Funds is calcu- lated with reference to public expenditure as provided for in Article 53(1), any information on expenditure other than public expenditure shall not affect the amount due as calculated on the basis of the payment request. 6. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, as regards financial engi neering instruments as defined in Article 44, the statement of expen- diture shall include the total expenditure paid in establishing or contri buting to such funds or holding funds. However, at the partial or final closure of the opera- tional programme, eligible expenditure shall be the total of: (a) any payments from urban development funds for investment in public private partnerships or other projects included in an inte grated plan for urban development; or (b) any payments for investment in enterprises from each of the above-mentioned funds; or (c) any guarantees provided including amounts committed as guar antees by guarantee funds; and (d) eligible management costs or fees; and (e) any loans or guarantees for repayable invest- ments from funds or other incentive schemes providing loans, guarantees for repayable investments, or equivalent instruments, for energy efficiency and use of renewable energy in buildings, including in existing housing. The co-financing rate shall be applied to the eligible expenditure paid by the beneficiary. The corresponding statement of expenditure shall be corrected accordingly. 7. Interest generated by payments from operational programmes to funds as defined in Article 44 shall be used to finance any of the following: (a) urban development projects in the case of urban development funds; (b) financial engineering instruments for small and medium-sized enter prises; (c) in the case of funds or other incentive schemes providing loans, guarantees for repayable investments, or equivalent instru- ments, for energy efficiency and use of renewable energy in buildings, including in existing housing. Resources returned to the operation from invest- ments undertaken by funds as defined in Article 44 or left over after all guarantees have been honoured shall be reused by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned for the benefit of urban development projects, of small and medium- sized enterprises or for energy efficiency and use of renewable energy in buildings, including in existing housing. ",
        "53 Article 79 Accumulation of pre-financing and of interim payments 1. The cumulative total of pre-financing and interim payments made shall not exceed 95 % of the contri- bution from the Funds to the oper ational programme. 2. When this ceiling is reached, the certifying authority shall continue transmitting to the Commission any certified statement of expendi- ture on 31 December of year n, as well as the amounts recovered during the year for each Fund, at the latest by the end of February of year n+1. Article 80 \u2013Wholeness of payment to beneficiaries Member States shall satisfy themselves that the bodies responsible for making the payments ensure that the beneficiaries receive the total amount of the public contri- bution as quickly as possible and in full. No amount shall be deducted or withheld and no specific charge or other charge with equivalent effect shall be levied that would reduce these amounts for the beneficiaries. Article 81 Use of the euro 1. Amounts set out in operational programmes submitted by Member States, certified statements of expenditure, applications for payment and expendi- ture mentioned in the annual and final report of implementation shall be denominated in euro. 2. Commission decisions on operational programmes and Commission commitments and payments, shall be denominated and carried out in euro. 3. Member States which have not adopted the euro as their currency on the date of an application for payment shall convert into euro the amounts of expenditure incurred in national currency. This amount shall be converted into euro using the monthly accounting exchange rate of the Commission in the month during which the expenditure was registered in the accounts of the certifying authority of the operational programme concerned. This rate shall be published electroni- cally by the Commission each month. 4. When the euro becomes the currency of a Member State, the conversion procedure set out in paragraph 3 shall continue to apply to all expenditure recorded in the accounts by the certi- fying authority before the date of entry into force of the fixed conversion rate between the national currency and the euro. Section 3 \u2013 Pre-financing Article 82 Payment 1. Following the Commission decision approving a contribution from the Funds to an operational programme, a single pre-financing amount for the 2007 to 2013 period shall be paid by the Commission to the body designated by the Member State.

The total amount paid as pre-financing shall be reim- bursed to the Commission by the body designated by the Member State if no appli cation for payment under the operational programme is sent within 24 months from the date on which the Commission pays the first instalment of the pre-financing amount. The total contribution from the Funds to the operational programme shall not be affected by such reimbursement. For the purpose of applying the criteria referred to in point (f) of the second subparagraph, GDP figures shall be based on Community statistics published in November 2009 ( 19 ). Article 83 Interest Any interest generated by the pre-financing shall be posted to the oper ational programme concerned, being regarded as a resource for the Member State in the form of a national public contribution, and shall be declared to the Commission at the time of the final closure of the operational programme. Article 84 Clearance The amount paid as pre-financing shall be totally cleared from the Commission accounts when the operational programme is closed in accordance with Article 89.

If one or more of the conditions referred to in para- graph 1 are not met, the Member State and the certi- fying authority shall be informed by the Commission within a period of one month so that the necessary steps can be taken to remedy the situation. Article 87 Date of presentation of applications for payment and payment delays 1. The certifying authority shall satisfy itself that requests for interim payments for each opera- tional programme are grouped together and sent to the Commission, as far as possible, on three separate occasions a year. For a payment to be made by the Commission in the current year, the latest date on which a application for payment shall be submitted is 31 October. ",
        "55 2. Subject to available funding, and the absence of a suspension of payments in accordance with Article 92, the Commission shall make the interim payment no later than two months after the date on which a application for payment meeting the conditions referred to in Article 86 is registered with the Commission. Section 5 \u2013 Programme closure and payment of final balance Article 88 Partial closure 1. Partial closure of operational programmes may be made at periods to be determined by the Member State. Partial closure shall relate to operations completed during the period up to 31 December of the previous year. For the purposes of this Regu lation, an operation shall be deemed completed where the activities under it have been actually carried out and for which all expenditure by the beneficiaries and the corresponding public contribution have been paid. 2. Partial closure shall be made on the condition that the Member State sends the following to the Commission by 31 December of a given year: (a) a statement of expenditure relating to the operations referred to in paragraph 1; (b) a declaration for partial closure in accord- ance with Article 62(1)(d)(iii). 3. Any financial corrections made in accordance with Articles 98 and 99 concerning operations subject to partial closure shall be net financial corrections. However, in cases where irregularities in operations which have been subject to a declaration of partial closure are detected by the Member State, Article 98(2) and (3) shall apply. The statement of expenditure referred to in paragraph 2(a) of this Article shall be adjusted accordingly. Article 89 Conditions for the payment of the final balance 1. The Commission shall pay the final balance provided that: (a) the Member State has sent an application for payment comprising the following docu- ments by 31 March 2017: (i) an application for payment of the final balance and a statement of expenditure in accordance with Article 78; (ii) the final implementation report for the operational programme, including the information set out in Article 67; (iii) a closure declaration referred to in Article 62(1)(e); and (b) there is no reasoned opinion by the Commission in respect of an infringement under Article 226 of the Treaty as regards the operation(s) for which the expenditure is declared in the appli- cation for payment in question. 2. Failure to send any of the documents referred to in paragraph 1 to the Commission shall auto- matically result in the decommitment of the final balance, in accordance with Article 93. 3. The Commission shall inform the Member State of its opinion on the content of the closure decla- ration referred to in paragraph 1(a)(iii) within five months of the date of its receipt. The closure declaration shall be deemed to be accepted in the absence of observations by the Commission within that five-month period. 4. Subject to available funding, the Commission shall pay the final balance within no more than 45 days from the later of the following dates: (a) the date on which it accepts the final report in accordance with Article 67(4); and (b) the date on which it accepts the closure declaration referred to in paragraph 1(a)(iii) of this Article. 5. Without prejudice to paragraph 6, the balance of the budgetary commitment shall be decommitted 12 months following the payment. The closure of the operational programme shall be on the date of the earliest of the following three events: (a) the payment of the final balance determined by the Commission on the basis of the docu- ments referred to in paragraph 1; ",
        "56 (b) the sending of a debit note for sums unduly paid by the Commission to the Member State in respect of the operational programme; (c) the decommitment of the final balance of the budgetary commitment. The Commission shall inform the Member State about the date of the closure of the operational programme within a deadline of two months. 6. Notwithstanding the results of any audits performed by the Commission or the European Court of Auditors, the final balance paid by the Commission for the operational programme may be amended within nine months of the date on which it is paid or, where there is a negative balance to be reimbursed by the Member State, within nine months of the date on which the debit note is issued. Such amendment of the balance shall not affect the date of the closure of the opera- tional programme as set out in paragraph 5. Article 90 Availability of documents 1. Without prejudice to the rules governing State aid under Article 87 of the Treaty, the managing authority shall ensure that all the supporting docu- ments regarding expenditure and audits on the opera- tional programme concerned are kept available for the Commission and the Court of Auditors for: (a) \u25baC3 a period of three years following the closure of an operational programme as defined in Article 89(5); \u25c4 (b) a period of three years following the year in which partial closure took place, in the case of documents regarding expenditure and audits on operations referred to in paragraph 2. These periods shall be interrupted either in the case of legal proceedings or at the duly motivated request of the Commission. 2. The managing authority shall make available to the Commission on request a list of completed operations which have been subject to partial closure under Article 88. 3. The documents shall be kept either in the form of the originals or in versions certified to be in conformity with the originals on commonly accepted data carriers. Section 6 \u2013 Interruption of the payment deadline and suspension of payments Article 91 Interruption of the payment deadline 1. The payment deadline may be interrupted by the authorising officer by delegation within the meaning of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 for a maximum period of six months if: (a) in a report of a national or Community audit body there is evidence to suggest a signifi- cant deficiency in the functioning of the management and control systems; (b) the authorising officer by delegation has to carry out additional verifications following information coming to his attention alerting him that expenditure in a certified statement of expenditure is linked to a serious irregu- larity which has not been corrected. 2. The Member State and the certifying authority shall be informed immediately of the reasons for the interruption. The interruption shall be ended as soon as the necessary measures have been taken by the Member State. Article 92 Suspension of payments 1. All or part of the interim payments at the level of priority axes or programmes may be suspended by the Commission where: (a) there is a serious deficiency in the manage- ment and control system of the programme which affects the reliability of the procedure for certification of payments and for which corrective measures have not been taken; or (b) expenditure in a certified statement of expenditure is linked to a serious irregularity which has not been corrected; or (c) there is a serious breach by a Member State of its obligations under Article 70(1) and (2). 2. The Commission may decide to suspend all or part of interim payments after having given the Member State the opportunity to present its observations within a period of two months. 3. The Commission shall end suspension of all or part of interim payments where the Member ",
        "57 State has taken the necessary measures to enable the suspension to be lifted. Where the required measures are not taken by the Member State, the Commission may adopt the decision to cancel all or part of the Community contribution to the oper- ational programme in accordance with Article 99. Section 7 \u2013 Automatic decommitment Article 93 Principles 1. The Commission shall automatically decommit any part of the amount calculated in accordance with the second subparagraph in an operational programme that has not been used for payment of the pre financing or interim payments or for which an application for payment has not been sent in conformity with Article 86 by 31 December of the second year following the year of budget commitment under the programme, with the exception mentioned in paragraph 2. For the purpose of the automatic decommitment, the Commission shall calculate the amount by adding one sixth of the annual budget commit- ment related to the 2007 total annual contribution to each of the 2008 to 2013 budget commitments. 2. \u25baC3 For Member States whose GDP from 2001 to 2003 was below 85 % of the EU-25 average in the same period, as listed in Annex III, the deadline referred to in paragraph 1 shall be 31 December \u25c4 of the third year following the year of the annual budget commitment from 2007 to 2010 under their operational programmes. This deadline shall also apply to the annual budget commitment from 2007 to 2010 in an operational programme falling under the Euro- pean territorial cooperation objective if at least one of the participants is a Member State referred to in the first subparagraph. 2a. By way of derogation from the first subpara- graph of paragraph 1 and from paragraph 2, the deadlines for automatic decommitment shall not apply to the annual budget commitment related to the 2007 total annual contribution. 3. That part of commitments still open on 31 December 2015 shall be automatically decom- mitted if the Commission has not received an acceptable application for payment for it by 31 March 2017. 4. If this Regulation enters into force after 1 January 2007, the period after which the first automatic decommitment as referred to in paragraph 1 may be made shall be extended, for the first commitment, by the number of months between 1 January 2007 and the date of the first budget commitment. Article 94 Period of interruption for major projects and aid schemes 1. Where the Member State submits a major project application which meets all the requirements laid down in Article 40, the amounts potentially concerned by automatic decommitment shall be reduced by the annual amounts concerned by such major projects. Where the Commission takes a decision to authorise an aid scheme, the amounts potentially concerned by automatic decommitment shall be reduced by the annual amounts concerned by such aid schemes. 2. For the annual amounts referred to in paragraph 1, the starting date for the calculation of the automatic decommitment deadlines referred to in Article 93 shall be the date of the subsequent decision necessary in order to authorise such major projects or aid schemes. Article 95 Period of interruption for legal proceedings and administrative appeals The amount potentially concerned by automatic decom- mitment shall be reduced by the amounts that the certifying authority has not been able to declare to the Commission because of operations suspended by a legal proceeding or an administrative appeal having suspen- sory effect, on condition that the Member State sends the Commission information stating the reasons by 31 December of the second or third year following the year of the budget commitment pursuant to Article 93. \u25baC3 For that part of commitments still open on 31 December 2015, the time limit referred to in Article 93(3) \u25c4 shall be interrupted under these same conditions in respect of the amount relating to the oper- ations concerned. The abovementioned reduction may be requested once if the suspension lasted up to one year or several times corresponding to the number of years between the date of the legal or administrative decision suspending the implementation of the operation and the date of the final legal or administrative decision. ",
        "58 Article 96 Exceptions to the automatic decommitment The following shall be disregarded in calculating the automatic decom-mitment: (a) that part of the budget commitment for which a application for payment has been made but whose reimbursement has been inter rupted or suspended by the Commis- sion on 31 December of the second or third year following the year of the budget commitment pursuant to Article 93 and in accordance with Articles 91 and 92. When the problem resulting in the interruption or suspension has been resolved, the automatic decommitment rule shall be applied to that part of the budget commitment which is concerned; (b) that part of the budget commitment for which a application for payment has been made but whose reimbursement has been capped in particular due to a lack of budget resources; (c) that part of the budget commitment for which it has not been possible to make an accept- able application for payment for reasons of force majeure seriously affecting implemen- tation of the operational programme. The national authorities claiming force majeure shall demonstrate its direct consequences on the im plementation of all or part of the operational programme. Article 97 Procedure 1. The Commission shall inform the Member State and the auth orities concerned in good time when- ever there is a risk of application of automatic decommitment under Article 93. The Commis- sion shall inform the Member State and the authorities concerned of the amount of the auto- matic decommitment resulting from the informa- tion in its possession. 2. The Member State shall have two months from the date of receipt of that information to agree to the amount or submit its observations. The Commission shall carry out the automatic decommitment not later than nine months after the deadline referred to in Article 93. 3. The Fund\u2019s contribution to the operational programme shall be reduced, for the year concerned, by the amount automatically decom-mitted. The Member State shall produce within two months of the date of decommitment a revised financing plan reflecting the reduced amount of assistance over one or several priority axes of the opera- tional programme. Failing this, the Commis- sion shall reduce the amounts allocated to each priority axis proportionately. CHAPTER II \u2013 Financial corrections Section 1 \u2013 Financial correction by Member States Article 98 Financial corrections by Member States 1. The Member States shall in the first instance bear the responsi bility for investigating irregulari- ties, acting upon evidence of any major change affecting the nature or the conditions for the implementation or control of operations or oper- ational programmes and making the financial corrections required. 2. The Member State shall make the financial corrections required in connection with the individual or systemic irregularities detected in operations or operational programmes. The corrections made by a Member State shall consist of cancelling all or part of the public contri bution to the operational programme. The Member State shall take into account the nature and gravity of the irregularities and the financial loss to the Funds. The resources from the Funds released in this way may be reused by the Member State until 31 December 2015 for the operational programme concerned in accordance with the provisions referred to in paragraph 3. 3. The contribution cancelled in accordance with paragraph 2 may not be reused for the operation or operations that were the subject of the correc- tion, nor, where a financial correction is made for a systemic irregularity, for existing operations within the whole or part of the priority axis where the systemic irregularity occurred. 4. In the case of a systemic irregularity, the Member State shall extend its enquiries to cover all opera- tions liable to be affected. ",
        "59 Section 2 \u2013 Financial corrections by the Commission Article 99 Criteria for the corrections 1. The Commission may make financial correc- tions by cancelling all or part of the Community contribution to an operational programme where, after carrying out the necessary examination, it concludes that: (a) there is a serious deficiency in the manage- ment and control system of the programme which has put at risk the Community contri- bution already paid to the programme; (b) expenditure contained in a certified state- ment of expenditure is irregular and has not been corrected by the Member State prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph; (c) a Member State has not complied with its obligations under Article 98 prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph. 2. The Commission shall base its financial correc- tions on individual cases of irregularity identi- fied, taking account of the systemic nature of the irregularity to determine whether a flat-rate or extrapolated correction should be applied. 3. The Commission shall, when deciding the amount of a correction, take account of the nature and gravity of the irregularity and the extent and financial implications of the deficiencies found in the operational programme concerned. 4. Where the Commission bases its position on facts established by auditors other than those of its own services, it shall draw its own conclu- sions regarding the financial consequences after examining the measures taken by the Member State concerned under Article 98(2), the reports supplied under Article 70(1)(b), and any replies from the Member State. 5. When a Member State does not comply with its obligations as referred to in Article 15(4), the Commission may, in relation to the degree of non-compliance with these obligations, make a financial correction by cancelling all or part of the Structural Funds contribution to the Member State concerned. The rate applicable to the financial correction referred to in this paragraph shall be laid down in the implementing rules of this Regu lation adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 103(3). Article 100 Procedure 1. Before taking a decision on a financial correc- tion, the Commission shall open the procedure by informing the Member State of its provi sional conclusions and requesting the Member State to submit its comments within two months. Where the Commission proposes a financial correction on the basis of extrapolation or at a flat rate, the Member State shall be given the oppor- tunity to demonstrate, through an examination of the documen tation concerned, that the actual extent of irregularity was less than the Commis- sion\u2019s assessment. In agreement with the Commis- sion, the Member State may limit the scope of this examination to an appropriate proportion or sample of the documentation concerned. Except in duly justified cases, the time allowed for this examination shall not exceed a further period of two months after the two-month period referred to in the first subparagraph. 2. The Commission shall take account of any evidence supplied by the Member State within the time limits mentioned in paragraph 1. 3. Where the Member State does not accept the provisional conclusions of the Commission, the Member State shall be invited to a hearing by the Commission, in which both sides in cooperation based on the partnership shall make efforts to reach an agreement concerning the observations and the conclusions to be drawn from them. 4. In case of an agreement, the Member State may reuse the Community funds concerned in conformity with the second subpara-graph of Article 98(2). 5. In the absence of agreement, the Commission shall take a decision on the financial correction within six months of the date of the hearing taking account of all information and observa- tions submitted during the course of the proce- dure. If no hearing takes place, the six-month period shall begin to run two months after the date of the letter of invitation sent by the Commission. ",
        "60 Article 101 Obligations of Member States A financial correction by the Commission shall not prejudice the Member State\u2019s obligation to pursue recoveries under Article 98(2) of this Regulation and to recover State aid under Article 87 of the Treaty and under Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 88 of the EC Treaty ( 20 ).

Any repayment due to be made to the general budget of the European Union shall be effected before the due date indicated in the order for recovery drawn up in accordance with Article 72 of Regu lation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002. The due date shall be the last day of the second month following the issuing of the order. 2. Any delay in effecting repayment shall give rise to interest on account of late payment, starting on the due date and ending on the date of actual payment. The rate of such interest shall be one- and-a-half percentage points above the rate applied by the European Central Bank in its main refinancing operations on the first working day of the month in which the due date falls.

Each Member State\u2019s allocation is the sum of the allocations for its indi vidual eligible regions, which are calculated on the basis of relative regional and national prosperity and the unem- ployment rate according to the following steps: (a) determination of an absolute amount (in euro) obtained by multiplying the popula- tion of the region concerned by the differ- ence between that region\u2019s GDP per capita, measured in purchasing power parities, and the EU-25 average GDP per capita; (b) application of a percentage to the above absolute amount in order to determine that region\u2019s financial envelope; this percentage is graduated to reflect the relative prosperity, as compared to the EU-25 average, of the Member State in which the eligible region is situated, i.e.: for regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is below 82 % of the Community average: 4,25 % for regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is between 82 % and 99 % of the Community average: 3,36 % for regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is over 99 % of the Community average: 2,67 %; (c) to the amount obtained under step (b) is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 700 per unemployed person, applied to the number of persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unem- ployed if the average unem ployment rate of all the EU convergence regions applied. Allocation method for the Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund under Article 5(2) 2. The total theoretical financial envelope for the Cohesion Fund is obtained by multiplying an average per capita aid intensity of EUR 44,70 by the eligible population. Each eligible Member State\u2019s a priori allocation of the theoretical financial envelope corresponds to a percentage based on its population, surface area and national prosperity and obtained by applying the following steps: (a) calculation of the arithmetical average of that Member State\u2019s population and surface area shares of the total population and surface area of all the eligible Member States; if, however, a Member State\u2019s share of total population exceeds its share of total surface area by a factor of five or more, reflecting an extremely high population density, only the share of total population will be used for this step; (b) adjustment of the percentage figures so obtained by a coefficient rep resenting one third of the percentage by which that Member State\u2019s GNI per capita, measured in purchasing power parities, exceeds or falls below the average GNI per capita of all the eligible Member States (average expressed as 100 %). 3. In order to reflect the significant needs in terms of transport and environment infrastructure of the Member States that acceded to the Union on or after 1 May 2004, the share of the Cohe- sion Fund will be set at one third of their total financial allocation (Structural Funds plus Cohe- sion Fund) on average over the period. For the other Member States, their financial envelope will result directly from the allocation method described in paragraph 2. Allocation method for the Member States and regions eligible under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective referred to in Article 6 4. The share of each Member State concerned is the sum of the shares of its eligible regions, which are determined on the basis of the following criteria, weighted as indicated: total population (weighting 0,5), number of unem ployed people in NUTS level 3 regions with an unemploy- ment rate above the group average (weighting 0,2), number of jobs needed to reach an employ- ment rate of 70 % (weighting 0,15), number of employed people with a low educational level (weighting 0,10), and low population density (weighting 0,05). The shares are then adjusted ANNEX II Financial framework criteria and methodology referred to in Article 18 ",
        "65 according to relative regional prosperity (for each region, increase or decrease of its total share by + 5 %/-5 % according to whether its GDP per capita is below or above the average GDP per capita for the group). The share of each Member State will not however be less than three-quarters of its share in 2006 of combined funding under Objectives 2 and 3. Allocation method for the European territorial coop- eration objective referred to in Article 7 5. The allocation of resources among the benefi- ciary Member States (including the contribution from the ERDF to the European Neighbour- hood and Part nership Instrument and the Instru- ment for Pre-Accession Assistance referred to in Article 21(2)) is determined as follows: (a) for the cross-border component as referred to in Article 7(1), on the basis of the population of the NUTS level 3 regions in terrestrial and maritime border areas, as a share of the total population of all the eligible regions; (b) for the transnational component as referred to in Article 7(2), on the basis of the total population of the Member State, as a share of the total population of all the Member States concerned. Allocation method for the Member States and regions eligible for the transitional support referred to in Article 8 6. The allocations under the transitional support referred to in Article 8 will result from the appli- cation of the following parameters: (a) for the regions defined in Article 8(1), 80 % of their individual 2006 per capita aid inten- sity level in 2007 and a linear reduction thereafter to reach the national average per capita aid intensity level for the Regional competitiveness and employment objective in 2013. To the allocation thus obtained is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 600 per unemployed person, applied to the number of persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unem- ployed if the average unem ployment rate of all the EU convergence regions applied. (b) for the regions defined in Article 8(2), 75 % of their individual 2006 per capita aid inten- sity level in 2007 and a linear reduction thereafter to reach the national average per capita aid intensity level for the Regional competitiveness and employment objective by 2011. To the allocation thus obtained is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 600 per unemployed person, applied to the number of persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unemployed if the average unem ployment rate of all the EU convergence regions applied; (c) for the Member States defined in Article 8(3), the allocation will be degressive over seven years, with the amount in 2007 being EUR 1,2 billion, in 2008 EUR 850 million, in 2009 EUR 500 million, in 2010 EUR 250 million, in 2011 EUR 200 million, in 2012 EUR 150 million and in 2013 EUR 100 million. Maximum level of transfers from funds supporting cohesion 7. In order to contribute to the objectives of adequately concentrating cohesion funding on the least developed regions and Member States and reducing disparities in average per capita aid intensities resulting from capping, the maximum level of transfer from the Funds to each indi- vidual Member State pursuant to this Regulation will be as follows: for Member States whose average 2001 to 2003 GNI per capita (PPS) is under 40 % of the EU-25 average: 3,7893 % of their GDP for Member States whose average 2001 to 2003 GNI per capita (PPS) is equal to or above 40 % and below 50 % of the EU-25 average: 3,7135 % of their GDP for Member States whose average 2001 to 2003 GNI per capita (PPS) is equal to or above 50 % and below 55 % of the EU-25 average: 3,6188 % of their GDP for Member States whose average 2001 to 2003 GNI per capita (PPS) is equal to or above 55 % and below 60 % of the EU-25 average: 3,5240 % of their GDP for Member States whose average 2001 to 2003 GNI per capita (PPS) is equal to or above 60 % and below 65 % of the EU-25 average: 3,4293 % of their GDP ",
        "66 for Member States whose average 2001 to 2003 GNI per capita (PPS) is equal to or above 65 % and below 70 % of the EU-25 average: 3,3346 % of their GDP for Member States whose average 2001 to 2003 GNI per capita (PPS) is equal to or above 70 % and below 75 % of the EU-25 average: 3,2398 % of their GDP \u2014 thereafter, the maximum level of transfer is reduced by 0,09 percentage points of GDP for each increment of 5 percentage points of average 2001 to 2003 per capita GNI (PPS) as compared to the EU-25 average. 8. The ceilings referred to in paragraph 7 above include the contributions from the ERDF to the financing of the cross-border strand of the Euro- pean Neigh bourhood and Partnership Instrument and of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assis- tance, and from the part of the EAFRD origi- nating from the Guidance Section of the Euro- pean Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and from the EFF. 9. Calculations of GDP by the Commission will be based on the statistics published in April 2005. Indi- vidual national growth rates of GDP for 2007 to 2013, as projected by the Commission in April 2005, will be applied for each Member State separately. 10. If it is established in 2010 that any Member State\u2019s cumulated GDP for the years 2007 to 2009 has diverged by more than \u00b15 % from the cumulated GDP estimated in according with paragraph 9 above, including as a conse quence of exchange rate changes, the amounts allocated for that period to that Member State pursuant to paragraph 7 will be adjusted accordingly. The total net effect, whether positive or negative, of these adjustments may not exceed EUR 3 billion. In any event, if the net effect is positive, total additional resources will be limited to the level of under-spending against the ceilings for category 1B set out for the years 2007 to 2010 in the Inter- institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budg- etary discipline and sound financial management. Final adjustments will be spread in equal propor- tions over the years 2011 to 2013. 11. In order to reflect the value of the Polish zloty in the reference period, the result of the application of the maximum level of transfer as defined in paragraph 7 for Poland will be multiplied by a coefficient 1,04 for the period up to the review referred to in paragraph 10 (2007 to 2009). Additional provisions 12. When in a given Member State the phasing-out regions defined in Article 8(1)) represent at least one third of the total population of the regions fully eligible for Objective 1 assistance in 2006, the rates of assistance will be 80 % of their indi- vidual 2006 per capita aid intensity level in 2007, 75 % in 2008, 70 % in 2009, 65 % in 2010, 60 % in 2011, 55 % in 2012 and 50 % in 2013. 13. As far as the transitional arrangements under paragraphs 6(a) and (b) are concerned, the starting point in 2007 for those regions which were not eligible for Objective 1 status in the 2000 to 2006 period, or whose elig ibility started in 2004, will be 90 % of their theoretical 2006 per capita aid intensity level calculated on the basis of the 1999 Berlin allocation method with their regional GDP per capita level being assimilated to 75 % of the EU 15 average. 14. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, the Polish NUTS level 2 regions of Lubelskie, Podkar- packie, Warmihsko-Mazurskie, Podlaskie and \u015awi^tokrzyskie, whose GDP per capita levels (PPS) are the five lowest in the EU-25, will benefit from funding from the ERDF over and above the funding to which they are otherwise eligible. This additional funding will amount to EUR 107 per inhabitant over the period 2007 to 2013 under the Convergence objective. Any upward adjustment of the amounts allocated to Poland pursuant to paragraph 10 will be net of this additional funding. 15. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, the NUTS level 2 region of K\u00f6z\u00e9p-Magyar-orsz\u00e1g will be allocated an additional envelope of EUR 140 million over the period 2007 to 2013. For this region the same regulatory provisions would apply as for the regions referred to in Article 8(1) 16. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, the NUTS level 2 region of Prague will be allocated an additional envelope of EUR 200 million over the period 2007 to 2013 under the Regional competitive- ness and employment objective. 17. Cyprus will benefit in 2007 to 2013 from the transitional arrangements applicable to the regions defined in paragraph 6(b), its starting point in 2007 being established in accordance with paragraph 13. 18. The NUTS level 2 regions of It\u00e4-Suomi and Madeira, while keeping the status of phasing-in ",
        "67 regions, will benefit from the transitional finan- cial arrangements laid down in paragraph 6(a). 19. The NUTS level 2 region of the Canaries will benefit from an additional envelope of EUR 100 million over the period 2007 to 2013 under the transitional support referred to in Article 8(2). 20. The outermost regions identified in Article 299 of the Treaty and the NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the Treaty of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden will, in view of their specific constraints, benefit from additional funding from the ERDF. This funding will amount to EUR 35 per inhabitant per year and will be in addition to any funding for which these regions are otherwise eligible. 21. As far as allocations under the cross-border strand of the European territorial cooperation objective referred to in Article 7(1) are concerned, aid inten- sity for regions along the former external terres- trial borders between the EU-15 and the EU-12 and between the EU-25 and the EU \u2018+2\u2019 will be 50 % higher than for the other regions concerned. 22. In recognition of the special effort for the peace process in Northern Ireland, a total of EUR 200 million will be allocated for the PEACE Programme for the period 2007 to 2013. The PEACE programme will be implemented as a cross-border programme within the meaning of Article 3(2)(c) and, in order to promote social and economic stability in the regions concerned, will include, notably, actions to promote cohe- sion between communities. The eligible area will be the whole of Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland. This programme will be implemented under the European terri torial cooperation objective in full compliance with additionality of structural fund interventions. 23. The Swedish regions falling under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective will be allocated an additional ERDF envelope of EUR 150 million. 24. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which represent single NUTS II regions, will each be allocated additional funding of EUR 35 per inhabitant over the period 2007 to 2013. 25. The Austrian regions falling under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective and situated on the former external borders of the European Union will be allocated an additional ERDF envelope of EUR 150 million. Bavaria will similarly be allocated an additional envelope of EUR 75 million under the Regional competi- tiveness and employment objective. 26. Spain will benefit from an additional allocation of EUR 2,0 billion under the ERDF to enhance research, development and innovation by and for the benefit of enterprises as set out in Articles 4(1) and 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006. The indicative split will be 70 % for the regions eligible under the Convergence objective referred to in Article 5,5 % for the regions eligible for the transi- tional support referred to in Article 8(1), 10 % for the regions eligible under the Regional competi- tiveness and employment objective referred to in Article 6 and 15 % for the regions eligible for the transitional support referred to in Article 8(2). 27. Ceuta and Melilla will be allocated an addi- tional ERDF envelope of EUR 50 million over the period 2007 to 2013 under the transitional support referred to in Article 8(1). 28. Italy will be allocated an additional envelope of EUR 1,4 billion under the Structural Funds as follows: EUR 828 million for the regions eligible under the Convergence objective referred to in Article 5(1), EUR 111 million for the region eligible for the transitional support referred to in Article 8(1), EUR 251 million for the region eligible for the transitional support referred to in Article 8(2) and EUR 210 million for the regions eligible under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective referred to in Article 6. 29. France will receive an additional allocation of EUR 100 million over the period 2007 to 13 under the Regional competitiveness and employ- ment objective in recognition of the particular circumstances of Corsica (EUR 30 million) and French Hainaut (EUR 70 million). 30. An additional allocation of EUR 167 million will be allocated to the eastern L\u00e4nder of Germany which are eligible for support under the Convergence objective referred to in Article 5(1).

        "75 THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 148 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund ( 4 ) estab lishes the framework for action by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and lays down, in particular, the objectives, prin ciples and rules concerning partnership, programming, evaluation and management. It is therefore neces- sary to define the mission of the European Social Fund (ESF) in relation to the tasks prescribed under Article 146 of the Treaty and in the context of the work by Member States and the Commu- nity towards developing a coordinated strategy for employment under Article 125 of the Treaty. (2) Specific provisions concerning the type of activities which may be financed by the ESF under the objectives set out in Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 should be laid down. (3) The ESF should strengthen economic and social cohesion by improving employment opportuni- ties within the framework of the tasks entrusted to the ESF by Article 146 of the Treaty and of ( 1 ) OJ C 234, 22.9.2005, p. 27. ( 2 ) OJ C 164, 5.7.2005, p. 48. ( 3 ) Opinion of the European Parliament of 6 July 2005 (not yet published in the Official Journal), Council Common Position of 12 June 2006 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and Position of the European Parliament of 4 July 2006 (not yet published in the Official Journal). ( 4 ) See p. 25 of this Official Journal. the tasks entrusted to the Structural Funds by Article 159 of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. (4) This is all the more important in the light of the challenges arising from the enlargement of the Union and the phenomenon of economic globali- sation. In this connection, the importance of the European social model and its modernisation should be acknowledged. (5) In accordance with Articles 99 and 128 of the Treaty, and with a view to refocusing the Lisbon strategy on growth and jobs, the Council has adopted an integrated package comprising Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and Employment Guidelines, the latter setting out employment objectives, priori- ties and targets. In this regard, the Brussels Euro- pean Council of 22 and 23 March 2005 called for the mobilisation of all appropriate national and Community resources, including cohesion policy. (6) New lessons have been learnt from the Commu- nity initiative EQUAL, especially in respect of the combination of local, regional, national and European action. These lessons should be integrated into ESF support. Particular atten- tion should be paid to the participation of target groups, the integration of migrants, including those seeking asylum, the identification of policy issues and their subsequent mainstreaming, inno- vation and experimentation techniques, method- ologies for transnational cooperation, outreach to groups marginalised in relation to the labour market, the impact of social issues on the internal market, and access to and management of projects taken on by non governmental organisations. (7) The ESF should support the policies of Member States which are closely in line with the guide- lines and recommendations under the European Employment Strategy and the relevant objectives of the Community in relation to social inclusion, non-discrimination, the promotion of equality, and education and training, in order to better contribute to the implementation of the objec- tives and targets agreed at the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 and at the Gote- borg European Council of 15 and 16 June 2001. (8) The ESF should also act to tackle the relevant dimensions and consequences of demographic REGULATION (EC) No 1081/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 5 July 2006 on the European Social Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1784/1999 ",
        "76 changes in the active population of the Community, in particular through lifelong vocational training. (9) With a view to better anticipating and managing change and increasing economic growth, employment opportunities for both women and men, and quality and productivity at work under the Regional competitiveness and employment and Convergence objectives, assistance from the ESF should focus, in particular, on improving the adaptability of workers and enterprises, enhancing human capital and access to employ- ment and partici pation in the labour market, reinforcing the social inclusion of disadvantaged people, combating discrimination, encouraging economically inactive persons to enter the labour market and promoting partnerships for reform. (10) In addition to these priorities, in the least devel- oped regions and Member States, under the Convergence objective and with a view to increasing economic growth, employment oppor- tunities for both women and men, and quality and productivity at work, it is necessary to expand and improve investment in human capital and to improve institutional, administrative and judicial capacity, in particular to prepare and implement reforms and enforce the acquis. (11) Within the range of these priorities, the selec- tion of ESF inter ventions should be flexible in order to address the specific chal lenges in each Member State, and the types of priority action financed by the ESF should allow for a margin of flexibility to respond to these challenges. (12) The promotion of innovative transnational and interregional activities is an important dimen- sion which should be integrated in the scope of the ESF. In order to foster cooperation, Member States should programme transnational and inter- regional actions using a horizontal approach or through a dedicated priority axis. (13) It is necessary to ensure that the action of the ESF is consistent with the policies provided for under the European Employment Strategy and to concentrate ESF support on the implementation of the guide- lines and recommendations under that strategy. (14) Efficient and effective implementation of actions supported by the ESF depends on good governance and partnership between all relevant territorial and socio-economic actors, and in particular the social partners and other stakeholders, including those at national, regional and local level. The social part- ners have a central role in the broad partnership for change, and their commitment to strength- ening economic and social cohesion by improving employment and job opportunities is essential. In this context, where employers and workers collectively contribute to financially supporting ESF actions, this financial contribution, although private expenditure, would be included for the purposes of calculating ESF co-financing. (15) The ESF should support actions in line with the guidelines and relevant recommendations under the European Employment Strategy. However, changes to the guidelines and recommen dations would require the revision of an operational programme only where a Member State, or the Commission in agreement with a Member State, considered that the operational programme should take account of significant socioeconomic changes or take greater or different account of major changes in Community, national or regional priorities, or in the light of evaluations or following implementation difficulties. (16) The Member States and the Commission are to ensure that the implementation of the priori- ties financed by the ESF under the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives contribute to the promotion of equality and the elim ination of inequalities between women and men. A gender main-streaming approach should be combined with specific action to increase the sustainable participation and progress of women in employment. (17) The ESF should also support technical assis- tance, with a particular focus on encouraging mutual learning through exchanges of experience and dissemination of good practice and on high- lighting the contribution of the ESF to the policy objectives and priorities of the Community in relation to employment and social inclusion. (18) Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 provides that rules on eligibility of expenditure are to be established at national level, with certain exceptions for which it is necessary to lay down specific provisions. Specific provisions should therefore be laid down for the exceptions related to the ESF. (19) In the interest of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 1784/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999 on the European Social Fund ( 5 ) should therefore be repealed, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: ( 5 ) OJ L 213, 13.8.1999, p. 5.

        "77 Article 1 Subject matter 1. This Regulation establishes the tasks of the European Social Fund (ESF), the scope of its assistance, specific provisions and the types of expenditure eligible for assistance. 2. The ESF is governed by Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and by this Regulation. Article 2 Tasks 1. The ESF shall contribute to the priorities of the Community as regards strengthening economic and social cohesion by improving employment and job opportunities, encouraging a high level of employment and more and better jobs. It shall do so by supporting Member States\u2019 policies aiming to achieve full employment and quality and productivity at work, promote social inclusion, including the access of disadvantaged people to employment, and reduce national, regional and local employment disparities. In particular, the ESF shall support actions in line with measures taken by Member States on the basis of the guidelines adopted under the Euro- pean Employment Strategy, as incorporated into the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs, and the accompanying recommen dations. 2. In carrying out the tasks referred to in paragraph 1, the ESF shall support the priorities of the Commu- nity as regards the need to reinforce social cohesion, strengthen productivity and competitiveness, and promote economic growth and sustainable develop- ment. In so doing, the ESF shall take into account the relevant priorities and objectives of the Community in the fields of education and training, increasing the participation of economically inactive people in the labour market, combating social exclusion \u2014 espe- cially that of disadvantaged groups such as people with disabilities \u2014 and promoting equality between women and men and non-discrimination. Article 3 Scope of assistance 1. Within the framework of the Convergence and Regional competi tiveness and employment objectives, the ESF shall support actions in Member States under the priorities listed below: (a) increasing adaptability of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs with a view to improving the anticipation and positive management of economic change, in particular by promoting: (i) lifelong learning and increased invest- ment in human resources by enterprises, especially SMEs, and workers, through the development and implementation of systems and strategies, including appren- ticeships, which ensure improved access to training by, in particular, low-skilled and older workers, the development of quali- fications and competences, the dissemi- nation of information and communica- tion technologies, e-learning, eco-friendly technologies and management skills, and the promotion of entrepreneurship and innovation and business start-ups; (ii) the design and dissemination of innova- tive and more productive forms of work organisation, including better health and safety at work, the identification of future occupational and skills requirements, and the development of specific employment, training and support services, including outplacement, for workers in the context of company and sector restructuring; (b) enhancing access to employment and the sustainable inclusion in the labour market of job seekers and inactive people, preventing unemployment, in particular long-term and youth unemployment, encouraging active ageing and longer working lives, and increasing participation in the labour market, in particular by promoting: (i) the modernisation and strengthening of labour market insti tutions, in particular employment services and other relevant initiatives in the context of the strategies of the European Union and the Member States for full employment; (ii) the implementation of active and preven- tive measures ensuring the early identifica- tion of needs with individual action plans and personalised support, such as tailored training, job search, outplacement and mobility, self-employment and business creation, including cooperative enterprises, incentives to encourage participation in the labour market, flexible measures to keep older workers in employment longer, and measures to reconcile work and private life, such as facilitating access to childcare and care for dependent persons; ",
        "78 (iii) mainstreaming and specific action to improve access to employment, increase the sustainable participation and progress of women in employment and reduce gender- based segregation in the labour market, including by addressing the root causes, direct and indirect, of gender pay gaps; (iv) specific action to increase the partici- pation of migrants in employment and thereby strengthen their social integration and to facilitate geographic and occupa- tional mobility of workers and integra- tion of cross-border labour markets, including through guidance, language training and validation of competences and acquired skills; (c) reinforcing the social inclusion of disadvan- taged people with a view to their sustainable integration in employment and combating all forms of discrimination in the labour market, in particular by promoting: (i) pathways to integration and re-entry into employment for disad-vantaged people, such as people experiencing social exclusion, early school leavers, minori- ties, people with disabilities and people providing care for dependent persons, through employ-ability measures, including in the field of the social economy, access to vocational education and training, and accompanying actions and relevant support, community and care services that improve employment opportunities; (ii) acceptance of diversity in the workplace and the combating of discrimination in accessing and progressing in the labour market, including through awareness- raising, the involvement of local commu- nities and enterprises and the promotion of local employment initiatives; (d) enhancing human capital, in particular by promoting: (i) the design and introduction of reforms in education and training systems in order to develop employability, the improvement of the labour market relevance of initial and vocational education and training and the continual updating of the skills of training personnel with a view to innova- tion and a knowledge-based economy; (ii) networking activities between higher education institutions, research and technological centres and enterprises; (e) promoting partnerships, pacts and initiatives through networking of relevant stakeholders, such as the social partners and non-govern- mental organisations, at the transnational, national, regional and local levels in order to mobilise for reforms in the field of employ- ment and labour market inclusiveness. 2. Within the framework of the Convergence objec- tive, the ESF shall support actions in Member States under the priorities listed below: (a) expanding and improving investment in human capital, in particular by promoting: (i) the implementation of reforms in educa- tion and training systems, especially with a view to raising people\u2019s respon- siveness to the needs of a knowledge- based society and lifelong learning; (ii) increased participation in education and training throughout the life-cycle, including through actions aiming to achieve a reduction in early school leaving and in gender-based segregation of subjects and increased access to and quality of initial, vocational and tertiary education and training; (iii) the development of human potential in research and innovation, notably through post-graduate studies and the training of researchers; (b) strengthening institutional capacity and the efficiency of public administrations and public services at national, regional and local level and, where relevant, of the social partners and non-govern mental organisations, with a view to reforms, better regulation and good governance especially in the economic, employment, education, social, environmental and judicial fields, in particular by promoting: (i) mechanisms to improve good policy and programme design, monitoring and evaluation, including through studies, statistics and expert advice, support for interdepartmental coordination and dialogue between relevant public and private bodies; ",
        "79 (ii) capacity building in the delivery of poli- cies and programmes in the relevant fields, including with regard to the enforce- ment of legislation, especially through continuous managerial and staff training and specific support to key services, inspectorates and socio-economic actors including social and environmental part- ners, relevant non-governmental organ- isations and represen tative professional organisations. 3. Within the priorities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, Member States may concentrate on those which are the most appropriate to address their specific challenges. 4. The ESF may support actions set out in Article 3(2) of this Regu lation throughout the territory of the Member States eligible for support or transitional support under the Cohesion Fund, as determined respec tively in Articles 5(2) and 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. 5. In implementing the objectives and priorities referred to in para graphs 1 and 2, the ESF shall support the promotion and mainstreaming of innovative activities in the Member States. 6. The ESF shall also support transnational and inter- regional actions in particular through the sharing of information, experiences, results and good practices, and through developing complementary approaches and coordinated or joint action. 7. By way of derogation from Article 34(2) of Regu- lation (EC) No 1083/2006, the funding of meas- ures under the social inclusion priority referred to in paragraph 1(c)(i) of this Article and within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Regional Devel- opment Fund ( 6 ) may be raised to 15 % of the priority axis concerned. Article 4 Consistency and concentration of support 1. The Member States shall ensure that the actions supported by the ESF are consistent with and contribute to actions undertaken in pursuance of the European Employment Strategy. In partic- ular, they shall ensure that the strategy set out in the national strategic reference framework and the actions set out in the operational programmes ( 6 ) See p. 1 of this Official Journal. promote the objectives, priorities and targets of the strategy in each Member State within the framework of the national reform programmes and national action plans for social inclusion. The Member States shall also concentrate support, where the ESF can contribute to poli- cies, on the implementation of the relevant employment recommendations made under Article 128(4) of the Treaty and of the relevant employment-related objectives of the Commu- nity in the fields of social inclusion, education, and training. Member States shall do so in a stable programming environment. 2. Within operational programmes, resources shall be directed towards the most important needs and focus on those policy areas where ESF support can have a significant effect in attaining the objec- tives of the programme. To maximise the effi- ciency of ESF support, operational programmes shall, where appropriate, take particular account of the regions and localities facing the most serious problems, such as deprived urban and outermost regions, declining rural and fisheries- dependent areas, and areas particularly adversely affected by business relocations. 3. Where appropriate, a concise section on the contribution of the ESF to promoting the relevant labour market aspects of social inclusion shall be included in Member States\u2019 national reports under the open method of coordination on social protection and social inclusion. 4. The indicators included in the operational programmes co-financed by the ESF shall be stra- tegic in nature and limited in number and shall reflect those used in the implementation of the European Employment Strategy and in the context of the relevant Community objectives in the fields of social inclusion and education and training. 5. Evaluations undertaken in relation to ESF action shall also assess the contribution of the actions supported by the ESF to the implemen tation of the European Employment Strategy and to the Community objectives in the fields of social inclusion, non-discrimination and equality between women and men, and education and training in the Member State concerned. Article 5 Good governance and partnership 1. The ESF shall promote good governance and partnership. Its support shall be designed and ",
        "80 implemented at the appropriate territorial level taking into account the national, regional and local level according to the institutional arrangements specific to each Member State. 2. The Member States shall ensure the involvement of the social partners and adequate consultation and participation of other stake holders, at the appropriate territorial level, in the preparation, implemen tation and monitoring of ESF support. 3. The managing authority of each operational programme shall encourage adequate participa- tion of the social partners in actions funded under Article 3. Under the Convergence objective, an appropriate amount of ESF resources shall be allocated to capacity-building, which shall include training, networking measures, strengthening the social dialogue and activities jointly undertaken by the social partners, in particular as regards adapt- ability of workers and enterprises referred to in Article 3(1)(a). 4. The managing authority of each operational programme shall encourage adequate partici- pation and access by non-governmental orga- nisations to the funded activities, notably in the domains of social inclusion, gender equality and equal opportunities. Article 6 Gender equality and equal opportunities The Member States shall ensure that operational programmes include a description of how gender equality and equal opportunities are promoted in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of operational programmes. Member States shall promote a balanced participation of women and men in the management and implementation of operational programmes at local, regional and national level, as appropriate. Article 7 Innovation In the framework of each operational programme, particular attention shall be paid to the promotion and mainstreaming of innovative activities. The managing authority shall choose the themes for the funding of innovation in the context of partnership and shall define the appropriate implementation arrangements. It shall inform the moni toring committee referred to in Article 63 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of the themes chosen. Article 8 Transnational and interregional actions 1. Where Member States support actions in favour of transnational and/or interregional actions as set out in Article 3(6) of this Regulation as a specific priority axis within an operational programme, the contri bution from the ESF may be increased by 10 % at the priority axis level. This increased contribution shall not be included in the calcu- lation of the ceilings set out in Article 53 of R egulation (EC) No 1083/2006. 2. Member States shall, with the assistance of the Commission where appropriate, ensure that the ESF does not support specific operations being concurrently supported through other Commu- nity transnational programmes, in particular in the field of education and training. Article 9 Technical assistance The Commission shall promote, in particular, exchanges of experience, awareness-raising activities, semi- nars, networking and peer reviews serving to identify and disseminate good practice and encourage mutual learning and transnational and interregional coopera- tion with the aim of enhancing the policy dimension and contribution of the ESF to the Community objectives in relation to employment and social inclusion. Article 10 Reports The annual and final implementation reports referred to in Article 67 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 shall contain, where appropriate, a synthesis of the implementation of: (a) gender mainstreaming as well as of any gender-specific action; (b) action to increase participation of migrants in employment and thereby strengthen their social integration; (c) action to strengthen integration in employ- ment and thereby improve the social inclu- sion of minorities; (d) action to strengthen integration in employment and social inclusion of other disadvantaged groups, including people with disabilities; (e) innovative activities, including a presenta- tion of the themes and their results, dissemi- nation and mainstreaming; (f) transnational and/or interregional actions.

        "87 THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMU- NITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provi- sions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 ( 1 ), and in particular Article 37(1)(d), the third paragraph of Article 44, Articles 59(6), 60(b) and 66(3), Article 67(2) (c), Articles 69(1), 70(3), 71(5), 72(2), 74(2) and 76(4) and the second subparagraph of Article 99 (5) thereof, Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Regional Development Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1783/1999 ( 2 ), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 7(2) and the second paragraph of Article 13 thereof, Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 replaces Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds ( 3 ), and Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 replaces Regulation (EC) No 1783/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999 on the European Regional Develop- ment Fund ( 4 ), both Regulations taking into account new developments in the field of Struc- tural Funds. It is therefore appropriate also to lay down new provisions implementing Regulations (EC) No 1080/2006 and (EC) No 1083/2006. (2) Experience has shown that citizens of the European Union are insufficiently aware of the role played by the Community in funding programmes aimed at reinforcing economic competi tiveness, creating jobs and strengthening internal cohesion. It is there- fore appropriate to provide for the preparation of a commu nication plan which identifies in detail the ( 1 ) OJ L 210, 31.7.2006, p. 25. ( 2 ) OJ L 210, 31.7.2006, p. 1. ( 3 ) OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 173/2005 (OJ L 29, 2.2.2005, p. 3). ( 4 ) OJ L 213, 13.8.1999, p. 1. information and publicity measures necessary to bridge this communication and information gap. For the same purpose, it is also necessary to iden- tify the responsibilities and the roles that should be played by each of the actors involved. (3) In order to guarantee that information on possible funding oppor tunities is disseminated widely to all interested parties and for the sake of transparency, the minimum content of the information measures needed to inform potential beneficiaries about the financing opportunities offered jointly by the Community and the Member States through the Funds should be set out, including an obligation to publicise the steps that a potential beneficiary should take to submit an application for funding and the selection criteria that will be used. (4) In order to enhance transparency regarding use of the Funds, the list of beneficiaries, the names of the operations and the amount of public funding allocated to operations should be published, elec- tronically or otherwise. (5) In order to ensure a better implementation of the information measures and to allow a better exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission on the infor mation and publicity strategies and results, contact persons responsible for the information and publicity measures should be designated and should participate in appropriate Community networks. (6) For the purposes of Articles 37 and 67 of Regula- tion (EC) No 1083/2006, it is necessary to lay down detailed rules and categories to allow the Member States to submit to the Commission uniform infor- mation on the programmed use of the Funds, as well as information on the cumulative allocation of the Funds by categories throughout the life of a programme, and to enable the Commission to inform the other Institutions and the citizens of the European Union in an appropriate manner about the use of the Funds, including the achievement of the targets set out in Article 9(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. (7) With regard to Article 60 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and in the light of the experience gained, it is necessary to lay down the obligations which the managing authorities should have with regard to beneficiaries in the phase leading to the Commission regulation (EC) No 1828/2006 of 8 December 2006 setting out rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund ",
        "88 selection and approval of the operations to be funded, with regard to the aspects which the veri- fications of the expenditure declared by the bene- ficiary should cover, including administrative verifi cations of the applications for reimburse- ment, and on-the-spot verifications of individual operations and with regard to the conditions to be observed when on-the-spot verifications are carried out on a sample basis. (8) It is also necessary to set out in detail the informa- tion which should be included in the accounting records of operations and the information to be kept as data on implementation which the managing authorities should record, store and send to the Commission upon request. (9) In order to ensure that expenditure under opera- tional programmes can be properly audited, it is necessary to set out the criteria with which an audit trail should comply so as to be considered adequate. (10) The audit of operations is carried out under the responsibility of the audit authority. To ensure that the scope and effectiveness of those audits are adequate and that they are carried out according to the same standards in all Member States, it is necessary to set out the conditions which those audits should fulfil. (11) Experience has shown that it is necessary to set out in detail the basis for the sampling of opera- tions to be audited, which the audit authority should observe in establishing or approving the sampling method, including certain technical criteria to be used for a random statistical sample and factors to be taken into account for a comple- mentary sample. (12) In order to simplify and harmonise standards for the preparation and presentation of the audit strategy, the annual control report and the closure declarations for which the audit authority is responsible pursuant to Article 62 of Regula- tion (EC) No 1083/2006, it is necessary to make detailed provision about their content and specify the nature and quality of the information on which they rely. (13) In order to ensure the most effective appli- cation of Article 90 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 with regard to the availability of documents and the right of the Court of Audi- tors and the Commission to have access to all supporting documents regarding expenditure and audits, managing authorities should ensure that information on the identity and location of the bodies holding the supporting documents is readily available and those documents should be readily supplied to a minimum list of persons and bodies. For the same purpose, it is necessary to set out which data carriers can be considered as commonly accepted for the purpose of keeping such documents. To this end, the national author- ities should lay down the procedures necessary to ensure that the documents kept are in conformity with the originals, when this is relevant, and can be relied on for audit purposes. (14) In order to harmonise standards for the certifi- cation of expen diture and for the preparation of applications for payments, the content of such certificates and applications should be laid down and the nature and quality of the information on which they rely specified. Detailed procedures should be set out for keeping, in accordance with Article 61(f) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, an account of amounts recoverable and of amounts withdrawn following cancellation of all or part of the contribution for an operation and for informing the Commission accordingly. (15) Pursuant to Article 71 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, the Member States are, before the submission of the first interim application for payment or at least within twelve months of the approval of each operational programme, to submit to the Commission a description of the management and control systems, a report setting out the results of an assessment of the systems set up and an opinion on their compliance with the provisions of that Regulation on management and control systems. Since those documents are among the principal elements on which the Commission relies, in the context of the shared management of the Community budget, to satisfy itself that the financial assistance concerned is used by the Member States in accordance with the applicable rules and principles necessary for protecting the Community\u2019s financial interests, it is necessary to set out in detail the information that such documents should contain and the basis for the assessment and the opinion. (16) Operational programmes funded under the Euro- pean territorial cooperation objective referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 are presented by two or more Member States and have specific features, which are laid down in Regu- lation (EC) No 1080/2006. It is therefore appro- priate to set out the specific information which the description of the management and control system for those programmes should contain. ",
        "89 (17) Article 74 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 provides, inter alia , that for operational programmes for which the total eligible public expenditure does not exceed EUR 750 million and for which the level of Community co-financing does not exceed 40 % of the total public expendi- ture, a Member State may choose to rely more on national bodies and rules for carrying out certain functions related to the control and audit requirements. It is therefore necessary to set out which verifications, which audits of opera- tions and which obligations can be carried out and executed according to national rules and by national bodies. (18) As part of their management and control obli- gations Member States are required to report and monitor irregularities. Detailed rules to implement that requirement were laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 of 11 July 1994 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the structural policies and the organisation of an information system in this field ( 5 ), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1831/94 of 26 July 1994 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connec- tion with the financing of the Cohesion Fund and the organisation of an information system in this field ( 6 ). It is appro priate, for reasons of clarity and simplification, to incorporate those rules into this Regulation. (19) Provision should be made for the Commission to reimburse judicial costs when it requests a Member State to initiate or continue legal proceedings with a view to recovering amounts unduly paid following an irregularity, and for it to be supplied with information enabling it to decide on the apportionment of the loss from irrecoverable amounts pursuant to Article 70(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. Regular contact should also be provided for between the Commission and the Member States on the subject of irregularities, for the use of the infor- mation supplied for making risk analyses and compiling reports, and for the provision of infor- mation to the relevant committees. (20) In order to limit the administrative burden imposed by the reporting system while safe- guarding the necessary level of infor mation, ( 5 ) OJ L 178, 12.7.1994, p. 43. Regulation as amended by Regu- lation (EC) No 2035/2005 (OJ L 328, 15.12.2005, p. 8). ( 6 ) OJ L 191, 27.7.1994, p. 9. Regulation as amended by Regula- tion (EC) No 2168/2005 (OJ L 345, 28.12.2005, p. 15). Member States should, without prejudice to the obli gations arising directly from Article 61(f) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, not be obliged to report irregularities involving amounts below a certain threshold unless the Commission expressly so requests. (21) In the light of Directive 95/46/EC of the Euro- pean Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( 7 ) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protec- tion of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data ( 8 ), it is necessary to provide, in relation to the information and publicity measures and the audit work pursuant to this Regu lation, that the Commission and the Member States should prevent any unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data, and to specify the purpose for which the Commission and the Member States can process such data. (22) For reasons of legal certainty and of equal treat- ment of all Member States, it is necessary to fix the rate applicable to the financial correc- tion which the Commission may make when a Member State does not comply with its obligation to maintain in all the regions concerned during the programming period an agreed target level of public or equivalent structural expenditure. For reasons of simplification and proportionality, no financial correction should be applied if the difference between the agreed target level and the level achieved is equal to or less than 3 % of the agreed target level ( de minimis threshold); for the same reasons, when the difference between the two levels is higher that 3 % of the agreed target level, the rate should be calculated by subtracting that de minimis threshold. (23) The use of electronic means for the exchange of information and financial data leads to simpli- fication, increased efficiency and transparency and to savings in time. In order to exploit these advantages fully, while preserving the secu- rity of exchanges, a common computer system should be established as well as a list of docu- ments of common interest to the Commission and the Member States. It is therefore neces- ( 7 ) OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. Directive as amended by Regu- lation (EC) No 1882/2003 (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1). ( 8 ) OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1. ",
        "90 sary to specify the format each document should have and to provide a detailed description of the information such documents should contain. For the same reasons, it is necessary to specify how such a computer system functions with regard to the identification of the party responsible for uploading the documents and any updates thereto. (24) In the framework of Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures ( 9 ), taking account of the level of security and confidentiality required for the financial management of the use of the Funds, of the state of the art and of a cost-benefit analysis, it is necessary to require the use of an electronic signature. (25) In order to ensure the quick development and proper functioning of the common computer system, the cost of its development should be financed by the budget of European Communi- ties pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, and the costs of the interface with national, regional, and local computer systems should be eligible for a financial contribution from the funds pursuant to Article 46 of the same Regulation. (26) Building on the experience of the 2000-2006 programming period, it is necessary to set out in detail the conditions which financial engi- neering instruments should fulfil to be funded under an operational programme, it being under- stood that contributions to financial engineering instruments from the operational programme and other public sources, as well as the investments made by financial engineering instruments in individual enter prises, are subject to the rules on State aid including the Community Guidelines on State aid to promote risk capital investments in small and medium- sized enterprises ( 10 ). (27) It is necessary to adopt the list of criteria to be used for iden tifying the areas where expenditure on housing can be eligible for a contribution from the European Regional Development Fund pursuant to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 and the list of eligible interventions. Given the diversity of the situations prevailing in the Member States concerned, it is appro priate to establish a list of criteria for identifying the areas experi encing or threatened by physical ( 9 ) OJ L 13, 19.1.2000, p. 12. ( 10 ) OJ C 194, 18.8.2006, p. 2. deterioration and social exclusion where invest- ment in housing may be eligible for co-financing. It is also appropriate to set out that, in the case of multi-family housing or housing designated for low-income households or people with special needs, the interventions eligible for co-financing should be those aimed at renovating the common parts of multi-family residential buildings or at deli vering modern social housing of good quality through investing in the renovation and change of use of existing buildings owned by public authorities or non-profit operators. (28) Article 56(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 provides that rules on the eligibility of expendi- ture are to be laid down at national level, subject to the exceptions provided in the specific regu- lations for each Fund. With regard to Article 13 of Regu lation (EC) No 1080/2006, common rules on the eligibility of expenditure should be laid down which are applicable to opera tional programmes under the European territorial coop- eration objective in order to ensure consistency between the rules applicable to projects imple- mented in different Member States. Building upon experience with similar programmes in the programming period 2000-2006, it is appropriate to lay down common rules for the categories of expenditure for which national rules are most likely to differ. In order to reduce the adminis- trative burden on beneficiaries and programme authorities, flat rates for overheads should under certain conditions be eligible.

A communication plan, as well as any major amendments to it, shall be drawn up by the managing authority for the operational programme for which it is responsible or by the Member State to cover several or all opera- tional programmes co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Euro- pean Social Fund (ESF) or the Cohesion Fund. 2. The communication plan shall include at least the following: (a) the aims and target groups; (b) the strategy and content of the information and publicity measures to be taken by the Member State or the managing authority, aimed at potential beneficiaries, beneficiaries and the public, having regard to the added value of Community assistance at national, regional and local level; (c) the indicative budget for implementation of the plan; (d) the administrative departments or bodies responsible for implemen tation of the infor- mation and publicity measures; (e) an indication of how the information and publicity measures are to be evaluated in terms of visibility and awareness of opera- tional programmes and of the role played by the Community. Article 3 Examination of compatibility of the communication plan The Member State or the managing authority shall submit the commu nication plan to the Commission within four months of the date of adoption of the opera- tional programme or, where the communication plan covers two or more operational programmes, of the date of adoption of the last of these operational programmes. In the absence of observations made by the Commission within two months of receipt of the communication plan, the plan shall be deemed to comply with Article 2(2). If the Commission sends observations within two months of receipt of the communication plan, the Member State or the managing authority shall within two months send a revised communication plan to the Commission. In the absence of further observations by the Commis- sion within two months of submission of a revised communication plan, it shall be considered that the communication plan may be implemented. The Member State or the managing authority shall commence the infor mation and publicity activities provided for in Articles 5, 6 and 7, where relevant, even in the absence of the final version of the communication plan. Article 4 Implementation and monitoring of the communication plan 1. The managing authority shall inform the moni- toring committee for each operational programme of the following: ",
        "94 (a) the communication plan and progress in its implementation; (b) information and publicity measures carried out; (c) the means of communication used. The managing authority shall provide the monitoring committee with examples of such measures. 2. The annual reports and the final report on implementation of an operational programme, referred to in Article 67 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, shall include: (a) examples of information and publicity meas- ures for the operational programme carried out when implementing the communication plan; (b) the arrangements for the information and publicity measures referred to in Article 7(2) (d) including, where applicable, the elec- tronic address at which such data may be found; (c) the content of any major amendments to the communication plan. The annual implementation report for the year 2010 and the final imple mentation report shall contain a chapter assessing the results of the information and publicity measures in terms of visibility and awareness of operational programmes and of the role played by the Community, as provided for in Article 2(2)(e). 3. The means used for implementing, monitoring and evaluating the communication plan shall be proportional to the information and publicity measures identified in the communication plan. Article 5 Information measures for potential beneficiaries 1. The managing authority shall, in accordance with the communi cation plan, ensure that the opera- tional programme is disseminated widely, with details of the financial contributions from the Funds concerned, and that it is made available to all interested parties. It shall in addition ensure that information on the financing opportu nities offered by joint assis- tance from the Community and the Member State through the operational programme is dissemi- nated as widely as possible. 2. The managing authority shall provide poten- tial beneficiaries with clear and detailed information on at least the following: (a) the conditions of eligibility to be met in order to qualify for financing under an operational programme; (b) a description of the procedures for exam- ining applications for funding and of the time periods involved; (c) the criteria for selecting the operations to be financed; (d) the contacts at national, regional or local level who can provide information on the operational programmes. In addition, the managing authority shall inform potential beneficiaries of the publication provided for in Article 7(2)(d). 3.

Article 6 Information measures for beneficiaries The managing authority shall inform beneficiaries that acceptance of funding is also an acceptance of their inclusion in the list of benefi ciaries published in accordance with Article 7(2)(d). ",
        "95 Article 7 Responsibilities of the managing authority relating to information and publicity measures for the public 1. The managing authority shall ensure that the information and publicity measures are imple- mented in accordance with the communi cation plan and that they aim at the widest possible media coverage using various forms and methods of communication at the appropriate territorial level. 2. The managing authority shall be responsible for organising at least the following information and publicity measures: (a) a major information activity publicising the launch of an operational programme, even in the absence of the final version of the commu nication plan; (b) at least one major information activity a year, as set out in the communication plan, presenting the achievements of the opera- tional programme(s) including, where rele- vant, major projects; (c) flying the flag of the European Union for one week starting 9 May, in front of the premises of each managing authority; (d) the publication, electronically or otherwise, of the list of benefi ciaries, the names of the operations and the amount of public funding allocated to the operations. Participants in an operation of the ESF shall not be named. Article 8 Responsibilities of beneficiaries relating to information and publicity measures for the public 1. The beneficiary shall be responsible for informing the public, by means of the measures laid down in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, about the assistance obtained from the Funds. 2. The beneficiary shall put up a permanent explan- atory plaque that is visible and of significant size no later than six months after completion of an operation that fulfils the following conditions: (a) the total public contribution to the operation exceeds EUR 500 000; (b) the operation consists in the purchase of a physical object or in the financing of infra- structure or of construction operations. The plaque shall state the type and name of the operation, in addition to the information referred to in Article 9. The information referred to in Article 9 shall take up at least 25 % of the plaque. Where it is not possible to place a permanent explanatory plaque on a physical object as referred to in point (b) of the first subpara- graph, other appropriate measures shall be taken in order to publicise the Community contribution. 3. The beneficiary shall, during the implementa- tion of the operation, put up a billboard at the site of each operation which fulfils the following conditions: (a) the total public contribution to the operation exceeds EUR 500 000; (b) the operation consists in the financing of infrastructure or of construction operations. The information referred to in Article 9 shall take up at least 25 % of the billboard. When the operation is completed, the billboard shall be replaced by the permanent explanatory plaque referred to in paragraph 2. 4.

The managing authority, or the relevant control- lers in the case of European territorial coopera- tion objective programmes, shall determine the size of the sample in order to achieve reasonable assurance as to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, having regard to the level of risk identified by the managing authority, or the relevant controllers as appropriate, for the type of beneficiaries and operations concerned. The managing authorities or the relevant control- lers shall review the sampling method each year. 4. The managing authority, or the relevant control- lers in the case of European territorial coop- eration objective programmes, shall establish written standards and procedures for the verifi- cations carried out pursuant to paragraph 2 and shall keep records for each verification, stating the work performed, the date and the results of the verification, and the measures taken in respect of irregularities detected. 5. Where the managing authority is also a benefi- ciary under the operational programme, arrange- ments for the verifications referred to in para- graphs 2, 3 and 4 shall ensure adequate separation of functions in accordance with Article 58(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. Article 14 Accounting records 1. The accounting records of operations and the data on implemen tation referred to in Article 60(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 shall include the information set out in Annex III to this Regulation.

Article 15 Audit trail For the purposes of Article 60(f) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, an audit trail shall be considered adequate where, for the operational programme concerned, it complies with the following criteria: (a) it permits the aggregate amounts certi- fied to the Commission to be reconciled with the detailed accounting records and supporting documents held by the certi- fying authority, managing authority, inter- ",
        "98 mediate bodies and beneficiaries as regards operations co-financed under the operational programme; (b) it permits verification of payment of the public contribution to the beneficiary; (c) it permits verification of application of the selection criteria estab lished by the monitoring committee for the operational programme; (d) it contains in respect of each operation, as appropriate, the technical specifications and financing plan, documents concerning the grant approval, documents relating to public procurement procedures, progress reports and reports on verifications and audits carried out. Article 16 Audits of operations 1. The audits referred to in Article 62(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 shall be carried out each 12-month period from 1 July 2008 on a sample of operations selected by a method established or approved by the audit authority in accordance with Article 17 of this Regulation. The audits shall be carried out on-the-spot on the basis of documen tation and records held by the beneficiary. 2. The audits shall verify that the following condi- tions are fulfilled: (a) the operation meets the selection criteria for the operational programme, has been imple- mented in accordance with the approval decision and fulfils any applicable condi- tions concerning its functionality and use or the objectives to be attained; (b) the expenditure declared corresponds to the accounting records and supporting docu- ments held by the beneficiary; (c) the expenditure declared by the beneficiary is in compliance with Community and national rules; (d) the public contribution has been paid to the beneficiary in accordance with Article 80 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. 3. Where problems detected appear to be systemic in nature and therefore entail a risk for other opera- tions under the operational programme, the audit authority shall ensure that further examination is carried out, including additional audits where necessary, to establish the scale of such problems. The necessary preventive and corrective action shall be taken by the relevant authorities. 4. Only expenditure falling within the scope of an audit carried out pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be counted towards the amount of expen diture audited, for the purposes of reporting in the tables in point 9 of Annex VI and point 9 of Annex VIII. Article 17 Sampling 1. The sample of operations to be audited each year shall in the first instance be based on a random statistical sampling method as set out in para- graphs 2, 3 and 4. Additional operations may be selected as a complementary sample as set out in paragraphs 5 and 6. 2. The method used to select the sample and to draw conclusions from the results shall take account of internationally accepted audit stand- ards and be documented. Having regard to the amount of expen diture, the number and type of operations and other relevant factors, the audit authority shall determine the appropriate statis- tical sampling method to apply. The technical parameters of the sample shall be determined in accordance with Annex IV. 3. The sample to be audited each twelve-month period shall be selected from those operations for which, during the year preceding the year in which the annual control report pursuant to Article 18(2) is communicated to the Commission, expenditure has been declared to the Commission for the oper- ational programme or, where appropriate, for the operational programmes covered by a common management and control system. For the first 12-month period, the audit authority may decide to group the operations for which expenditure has been declared to the Commission in 2007 and 2008 as a basis for the selection of the operations to be audited. 4. The audit authority shall draw conclusions on the basis of the results of the audits relating to expenditure declared to the Commission during the year referred to in paragraph 3 and commu- nicate them to the Commission in the annual control report. In operational programmes for which the projected error rate is above the materiality level, the audit authority shall analyse its significance ",
        "99 and take the necessary actions, including making appropriate recommen dations, which will be communicated in the annual control report. 5. The audit authority shall regularly review the coverage provided by the random sample, having regard in particular to the need to have sufficient audit assurance for the declarations to be provided at partial and final closure for each operational programme. It shall decide on the basis of professional judg- ment whether it is necessary to audit a comple- mentary sample of additional operations in order to take account of specific risk factors identified and to guarantee for each programme sufficient coverage of different types of operation, benefi- ciaries, intermediate bodies and priority axes. 6. The audit authority shall draw conclusions on the basis of the results of the audits of the comple- mentary sample and communicate them to the Commission in the annual control report. Where the number of detected irregularities is high or where systemic irregularities have been detected, the audit authority shall analyse the significance thereof and take the necessary actions, including making appropriate recom- mendations, which shall be communicated in the annual control report. The results of the audits on the complementary sample shall be analysed separately from those of the random sample. In particular, irregularities detected in the complementary sample shall not be taken into account when the error rate of the random sample is calculated. Article 18 Documents presented by the audit authority 1. The audit strategy referred to in Article 62(1) (c) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 shall be established in accordance with the model in Annex V to this Regulation.

The closure declara- tion and final control report shall be drawn up in accordance with the model set out in Annex VIII to this Regulation. For European territorial cooperation objec- tive programmes, the closure declaration and final control report shall cover the whole of the programme and all programme expenditure eligible for contribution from the ERDF. 4. If there is a limitation in the scope of examination or if the level of irregular expenditure detected does not allow the provision of an unqua- lified opinion for the annual opinion referred to in Article 62(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 or in the closure declaration referred to in point (e) of that Article, the audit authority shall give the reasons and estimate the scale of the problem and its financial impact. 5. In the event of partial closure of an operational programme, the declaration relating to the legality and regularity of the transactions covered by the statement of expenditure referred to in Article 88 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 shall be drawn up by the audit authority in accordance with the model in Annex IX to this Regulation and submitted with the opinion referred to in Article 62(1)(d)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.

The Commission may not become a co-financing partner or shareholder in financial engineering instruments. 3. When managing authorities or holding funds select financial engi neering instruments, the financial engineering instruments shall submit a business plan or other appropriate document. The terms and conditions for contributions from operational programmes to financial engineering instruments shall be set out in a funding agree- ment, to be concluded between the duly mandated repre sentative of the financial engineering instru- ment and the Member State or the managing authority, or the holding fund where applicable. The funding agreement shall include at least the following elements: (a) the investment strategy and planning; (b) provisions for monitoring of implementation; (c) an exit policy for the contribution from the operational programme out of the financial engineering instrument; (d) provisions for the winding-up of the financial engineering instrument, including the reutili- sation of resources returned to the financial engineering instrument from investments or left over after all guarantees have been honoured that are attributable to the contri- bution from the operational programme. 4. Management costs may not exceed, on a yearly average, for the duration of the assistance any of the following thresholds, unless a higher percentage proves necessary following a competi- tive tender, in accordance with applicable rules: The thresholds set out in the first subparagraph may be increased by 0,5% for the outermost regions. (a) 2 % of the capital contributed from the oper- ational programme to holding funds, or of the capital contributed from the operational programme or holding fund to the guarantee funds; (b) 3 % of the capital contributed from the oper- ational programme or the holding fund to the financial engineering instrument in all other cases, with the exception of micro-credit instruments directed at micro-enterprises; ",

The funding agreement referred to in paragraph 1 shall, in particular, make provision for: (a) the terms and conditions for contributions from the operational programme to the holding fund; (b) calls for expression of interest addressed to financial engineering instruments in accord- ance with applicable rules; (c) the appraisal and selection of financial engi- neering instruments by the holding fund; (d) the setting up and monitoring of the invest- ment policy or the targeted urban develop- ment plans and actions; (e) reporting by the holding fund to Member States or managing autho rities; (f) monitoring of the implementation of investments; (g) audit requirements; (h) an exit policy for the holding fund out of the financial engineering instruments; (i) the provisions for the winding-up of the holding fund, including the reutilisation of resources returned from investments made or left over after all guarantees have been honoured which are attributable to the contri- bution from the operational programme. In the case of financial engineering instruments supporting enterprises, the provisions on the setting up and monitoring of the investment policy referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph shall comprise at least an indication of the targeted enterprises and the financial engineering products to be supported. Paragraph 3 is deleted. Article 45 Additional provisions applicable to financial engineering instruments other than holding funds and urban development funds Financial engineering instruments other than holding funds and urban development funds shall invest in enterprises, primarily in SMEs. Such investments may be made only at the establishment, in the early stages, including seed capital, or on expansion of those enter- prises, and only in activities which the managers of the financial engineering instruments judge potentially economically viable. They shall not invest in firms in difficulty within the meaning of the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty ( 21 ) as of 10 October 2004.

        "123 1. A random statistical sampling method allows conclusions to be drawn from the results of audits of the sample on the overall expenditure from which the sample was taken, and hence provides evidence to obtain assurance on the functioning of the management and control systems. 2. The assurance provided on the functioning of the systems is determined by the degree of confidence resulting from the conclusions of the system audits and from the audits of operations in the sample selected by a random statistical sampling method. In order to obtain a high level of assurance, that is, a reduced audit risk, the audit authority should combine the results of system audits and audits of operations. The audit authority first evaluates the reliability of the systems (high, average or low) taking into account the results of systems audits, so as to determine the technical parameters of the sampling, in particular the confidence level and the expected error rate. Member States may also use the results of the report on the compliance assessment pursuant to Article 71(2) of Regula- tion (EC) No 1083/2006. The combined level of assurance obtained from the systems audits and the audits of operations should be high. The confi- dence level used for sampling operations should not be less than 60 % with a maximum materiality level of 2 %. For a system evaluated as having low reliability, the confidence level used for sampling operations should not be below 90 %. The audit authority should describe in the annual control report the way assurance has been obtained. 3. The reliability of management and control systems is determined using criteria estab- lished by the audit authority for systems audits, including a quantified assessment of all key elements of the systems and encompassing the main authorities and intermediate bodies partici- pating in the management and control of the operational programme. A record of the assess- ments carried out is kept in the audit file. 4. Where the management and control system is common to a number of similar operational programmes, for example for the same Fund, in accordance with Article 71(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, a single sample guaranteeing the same technical parameters of confidence and materiality levels and taking into account the same expected rate of error, as indicated above, may be selected for all programmes together. 5. Where the number of operations for a given reference year is insufficient to allow the use of a statistical method for the random selection of the sample, a non- statistical method may be used. The method applied must ensure a random selection of the sample. The size of the sample must be determined taking into account the level of assurance provided by the system, and must be sufficient to enable the audit authority to draw valid conclusions (for example low sampling risk) on the effective functioning of the system.

INTRODUCTION I, the undersigned, representing the \u2026 (name of the body designated by Member State), have for the operational programme \u2026 (name of the opera tional programme, CCI code number, period) examined the results of the audit work carried out on this programme by or under the responsibility of the audit authority in accordance with the audit strategy (and have carried out the additional work I judged necessary). The results of the examination and any additional work I have performed are summarised in the attached final control report (which also contains the information required by the annual control report for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016). I have planned and performed this work with a view to obtaining a reasonable assurance as to whether the payment applica- tion for the final balance of the Community contribution to the operational programme is correct and valid and the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are legal and regular. 2. SCOPE OF THE EXAMINATION The examination was carried out in accordance with the audit strategy in respect of this programme and reported in the attached final control report pursuant to Article 62(1)(e) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. Either There were no limitations on the scope of the examination. Or The scope of the examination was limited by the following factors: (a) \u2026 (b) \u2026 (c) etc. (Indicate any limitation on the scope of the examina- tion, for example any systemic problems, weaknesses in the management and control system, lack of supporting documentation, cases under legal proceedings, etc., and estimate the amounts of expenditure and the Commu- nity contribution affected. If the audit authority does not consider that the limitations have an impact on the final expenditure declared, this should be stated.) 3. IRREGULARITIES AND ERROR RATES Either The cases of irregularity and error rates found in the audit work are not such as to preclude an unqualified opinion given the satisfactory way they have been dealt with by the managing authority and the trend in the level of their occurrence over time. Or The cases of irregularity and error rates found in the audit work and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority are such as to preclude an unqualified opinion. A list of these cases is provided in the final control report, together with an indication of their possible systemic character and the scale of the problem. The amounts of total declared expendi- ture and public contribution that could be affected are \u2026 respectively. As a conse quence, the corresponding Community contribution that could be affected is 4. OPINION Either (Unqualified opinion) If there were no limitations on the scope of the exami- nation and the cases of irregularity and error rates and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority do not preclude an unqualified opinion: Based on the examination referred to above, it is my opinion that the final statement of expenditure presents fairly, in all material respects, the expen diture paid under the operational programme, that the application for payment of the final balance of the Community contribution to this programme is valid and that the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are legal and regular. Or (Qualified opinion) If there were limitations on the scope of the examina- tion and/or the cases of irregularity and error rates and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority call for a qualified opinion but do not justify an unfa vourable opinion for all the expenditure concerned: Based on the examination referred to above, it is my opinion that the final statement of expenditure presents ",
        "133 fairly, in all material respects, the expen diture paid under the operational programme, that the applica- tion for payment of the final balance of the Commu- nity contribution to this programme is valid and that the underlying transactions covered by the final state- ment of expenditure are legal and regular, except with regard to the matters referred to at point 2 and/or to the observations at point 3 regarding the error rates and cases of irregularity and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority, the impact of which is quantified above. I estimate the impact of these qualifi- cations to be \u2026 of the total expenditure declared. The Community contribution affected is thus Or (Adverse opinion) If there were major limitations on the scope of the examination error rates and cases of irregularity and the way they have been dealt with by the managing authority such that no conclusion can be reached on the reliability of the final statement of expenditure without considerable further work: Based on the examination referred to above, and in particular in view of the matters referred to at point 2 and/or the error rates and cases of irregularity and the fact that they have not been dealt with satisfactorily by the managing authority as reported at point 3, it is my opinion that the final statement of expenditure does not present fairly, in all material respects, the expenditure paid under the operational programme, that, as a conse- quence, the application for payment of the final balance of the Community contribution to this programme is not valid and that the underlying transactions covered by the final statement of expenditure are not legal and regular.

        "134 To the European Commission, Directorate-General The managing authority for the programme \u2026 (name of operational programme, CCI code number, period) has submitted a statement of expenditure relating to operations (completed as at \u2026 (date up to which opera- tions were completed)/-completed between \u2026 and \u2026 (dates between which operations were completed)) and is applying for partial closure of the programme pursuant to Article 88(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 for these operations. I, the undersigned, representing the \u2026 (name of body designated by the Member State) have examined the results of the audit work carried out on this programme as set out in the annual control reports and annual opinions issued pursuant to Articles 62(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 for the year/ years \u2026, I have planned and performed this work with a view to obtaining a reasonable assurance as to whether the statement of expenditure concerned is correct and valid and the underlying transactions covered by the statement of expenditure are legal and regular. Opinion Based on the examination referred to above, it is my opinion that the statement of expenditure on completed operations submitted by the managing authority for the programme \u2026 (name of operational programme, CCI code number, period) for the purpose of partial closure of the programme in respect of operations (completed as at \u2026/completed between \u2026 and \u2026) presents fairly, in all material respects, the expenditure paid and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular.
