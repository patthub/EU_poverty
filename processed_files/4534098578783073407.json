The component includes measures to facilitate the 5G rollout, further develop the fiber infrastructure in rural and remote areas, and foster connectivity innovation. In addition, substantial reforms and investments aim to digitalise the public sector. The promotion of digital skills is envisaged for children, employees and senior citizen as well as measures to address the shortage of IT employees in the labour market. Furthermore, the component puts forward investment to promote the take-up of advanced digital technologies in the private sector, particularly regarding science-business cooperation for innovative technologies and the digitalisation of the cultural sector. Overall, the component includes five measures (three reforms and two investments). The component addresses the country-specific recommendation to promote investment in the digital transition, in particular the coverage of and take-up of high capacity broadband (Country Specific Recommendation 3 2020). In addition, the component is expected to contribute to boosting productivity growth, including by making public investment more efficient (Country Specific Recommendation 3 2019) as it includes measures to digitalise the public sector which shall have a lasting positive impact on the functioning of the public administration and its productivity.

Reform 2 \u201cEnsuring the effectiveness of data management and open data\u201d The aim of the reform is to ensure the availability of reliable public sector data, the possibility to share it, the possibilities for re-using the data and to create the preconditions for data-driven public policy as well as digital innovation in the private sector. The reform requires direct public investment to develop a model of state data architecture and its management tools in order to increase the publicly available amount of data in the national data lake (NDL), thus creating the preconditions for re-using data in all state information systems and registers, and making this data available to the public, business and science. The integration of information resources into the national data lake involves to following steps: a. Create an interface with the data provider via the data sharing connection; b. Describe the semantic structure, prepare metadata; c. Process the datasets received (transformation, cleaning, anonymisation/encryption, connection, aggregation and other work taking into account the specificities of the data and user needs for opening); d.

COMPONENT 5: H IGHER EDUCATION , A COHERENT FRAMEWORK FOR STIMULATING RESEARCH AND INNOVATION AND HIGH VALUE - ADDED BUSINESS The component of the Lithuanian recovery and resilience plan addresses the key challenges in the higher education system and research and innovation support framework. The key higher education related challenges are the existence of a high number of institutions that do not reflect the demographic developments and the labour market needs, lack resources and a critical mass to deliver good quality education and R&D. The current higher education funding system incentivises higher education institutions to focus on a higher number of students instead of ensuring quality and labour market relevance of studies. Moreover, there is a lack of attractive academic career opportunities, limiting human resources for education, research and innovation. The key innovation- related challenges are low private R&D investment, the fragmentation of the R&D potential and innovation system governance and weak science-business cooperation. The objectives of the component are to reform higher education funding system and the student admission system that would create incentives for the higher education institutions to increase quality and labour market relevance of studies, promote quality R&D, cooperation and consolidation in the sector. The reform is expected to strengthen qualitative standards for colleges and universities. The component also includes a reform of innovation support governance and its framework, under which the currently fragmented innovation support functions shall be consolidated under one single Innovation agency. The reform shall also cover the revision of existing innovation and science-business cooperation support system with a view to make it more coherent. During the implementation of the plan, sectoral support for the design, implementation and evaluation of research and innovation policy reforms shall be available via the Horizon Policy Support Facility. The component addresses the country-specific recommendations to focus investment-related economic policy on innovation, develop a coherent policy framework to support science-business cooperation and consolidate research and innovation implementing agencies (Country Specific Recommendation 3 2019), promote technological innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (Country Specific Recommendation 3 2020) and to improve quality and efficiency at all education and training levels, including adult learning (Country Specific Recommendation 2 2019). It is expected that no measure in this component does significant harm to environmental objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, taking into account the description of the measures and the mitigating steps set out in the recovery and resilience plan in accordance with the DNSH Technical Guidance (2021/C58/01). E.1. Description of the reforms and investments for non-repayable financial support E.1.1.
