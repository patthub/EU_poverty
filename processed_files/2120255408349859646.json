",
        "F. whereas this intergovernmental initiative, carried out in cooperation with academia, has entailed efforts to provide a common European response to serious problems in many countries, but these have been insufficient; G. whereas the real purpose of the Bologna Process is to support mobility and internationalisation, as well as to ensure compatibility and comparability in standards and quality of different higher educational systems while respecting the autonomy of universities and thus contributing to the creation of an authentically democratic European area that offers equal opportunities for citizens; H. whereas an assessment is needed of the progress made over the past 15 years that takes into account both the success story in terms of intraregional cooperation and the persistent problems encountered and the uneven extent of achievement of the stated goals; I. whereas while in most countries the Bologna Process has been guiding and motivating educational reforms, in some countries it might be perceived as a bureaucratic burden owing to miscommunication and a lack of understanding of its true vision; J. whereas it is important to acknowledge the pan-European character of the Bologna Process, as well as the involvement of all its actors, including students, teachers, researchers and non-teaching staff; K. whereas continuous and increased financial support for education, training, including vocational training, knowledge and research is crucial, especially in this period of economic crisis; L. whereas in this ever-changing context there is a need to reaffirm the political commitment underlying the Bologna Process and the involvement in the realisation of the process of the European institutions, national governments and all other relevant stakeholders; Role of the Bologna Process 1. Notes that education and research are one of the main pillars of our society when it comes to promoting skills development, growth and jobs creation; underlines that greater investment in education is crucial to effectively tackling poverty, social inequalities and unemployment, notably youth unemployment, and fostering social inclusion; 2. Notes that the Bologna Process could help to tackle the skills mismatch in the EU if it enabled students to acquire and develop the competences required by the labour market, and that by doing this it could achieve the important goal of enhancing the employability of graduates; 3. Is aware of the role the Bologna Process has in the creation of a Europe of Knowledge; highlights that the dissemination of knowledge, education and research is a key element of the Europe 2020 strategy and contributes to fostering European citizenship; also highlights, however, the need for consultation within the higher education community (teachers, students and non-teaching staff) in order to understand the opposition to reforms linked with the Bologna Process, as well as the need to guarantee public education that is free and accessible to all and that responds to the needs of society; 4. Notes that the Bologna reforms resulted in the launching of a European Higher Education Area (EHEA), and have allowed achievements in the past 15 years in making higher education structures more comparable, increasing mobility, providing quality assurance systems and in the recognition of diplomas, improving the quality of educational systems as well as the attractiveness of higher education in Europe; 5. Notes that there is still much work to be done in the Bologna Process in the area of adjusting educational systems to labour market needs and improving overall employability and competitiveness, as well as the attractiveness of higher education in Europe; notes that the European higher education institutions (HEIs) should be able to react quickly to the economic, cultural, scientific and technological changes in the modern society in order to fully use their potential to encourage growth, employability and social cohesion; 21.9.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 346/5 Tuesday 28 April 2015 ",
        "6. Notes the goals for the coming years, and the national priorities for actions to be taken by 2015, as outlined by the 2012 EHEA Ministerial Conference in Bucharest, as well as its recommendations for the 2020 EHEA mobility strategy, advocating the creation of new observatories, new approaches to the various European university communities, and new systems for integrating the members of those university communities into the reform process for this Plan; Priorities and challenges 7.

Calls on the governments to improve the efficiency of use of public funding in education and to respect the EU headline target of investing 3 % of Union GDP in R&D by 2020; stresses that ambitious funding of education and research is necessary, as they constitute one of the key tools for ensuring access to quality education for all, as well as fighting the economic crisis and unemployment; 17. Notes the potential funding opportunities for higher education, vocational education and training that should be provided by the EFSI; expresses its deep concern at the planned cuts in funds for Horizon 2020 that are directly linked to research and education, in favour of the EFSI; C 346/6 EN Official Journal of the European Union 21.9.2016 Tuesday 28 April 2015 ",
        "18. Warns that any cuts in Horizon 2020 would undoubtedly affect the full implementation of the Bologna Process, and therefore urges the Commission to withdraw any such proposal; 19.
