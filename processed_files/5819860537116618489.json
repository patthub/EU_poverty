        "T R A I N I N G NEW SKILLS HUNGARY Hungary has set itself ambitious tar- gets in its bid to build a strong, com- petitive, dynamic and sustainable economy. Over EUR 4 billion is being invested through ESF programmes to meet the specifi c challenges that the country is facing \u2013 particularly the low percentage of the population in jobs, high long-term unemployment, and persisting inequalities of opportunity between regions and between specifi c sections of the population. THE ESF IN HUNGARY: SOME EXAMPLES Reversing the \u2018brain drain\u2019 In Hungary, young science graduates o(cid:2) en leave the country to look for work in Western Europe where salaries are higher and employment opportunities better. One aim of the ESF programme is to keep talented graduates in the country. The \u2018Semmelweis Bridge Project\u2019 created an innovative working group \u2013 composed of young scientists from both Hungary and abroad, as well as industry representatives \u2013 to carry out vital long-term cardiovascular research. The group provides an opportunity to do crucial research for heart patients, and a chance for both Hungarian and international young scientists to live and work in Hungary. Bridging the education gap The ESF-funded project \u2018Tanoda\u2019 (\u2018The Learnery\u2019) targets the problem of social exclusion. By helping disadvantaged children, particularly Roma children, get a proper education the project is putting an end to the vicious cycle of poverty that these children are born into. \u2018Tanoda\u2019 is bridging the large gap that persists between children elsewhere in Hungary and these youngsters who, it is estimated, are 50 times less likely to complete secondary education. The children are mentored by the project and provided with individual development plans suited to their specifi c individual needs. Schools are also off ered equipment and materials where necessary. In this way, the \u2018Tanoda\u2019 project is providing valuable, continuous and systematic support for those in need.

        "M I C R O - F I N A N C E NET WOR KING A key challenge for Hungary is its very low employment rate which is one of the lowest in the EU at just over 60 %. This is particularly an issue for the low-skilled, the Roma popu- lation, the elderly, the disabled, young people and women with small children. There are also marked regional diff erences in employment rates and opportunities. In response, Hungary is investing in its education and training sys- tem and improving access to lifelong learning in order to give people the skills they need to fi nd a job or improve their career prospects. As part of this eff ort, Hungary has set itself the ambitious target of raising employment levels to 75 % by 2020 while continuing to take signifi cant steps to cut red tape and speed up the implementation of initiatives to reach this goal. Indeed, as part of the Hungarian Work Plan launched in 2011, Hungary plans to create close on a million new jobs by 2020. A further opportunity for Hungary is to improve its education and vocational train- ing systems. Many graduates fi nd that their qualifi cations do not lead to the jobs they expected. By upgrading the education and training choices on off er, and including more work- oriented elements, more young people will fi nd the jobs and careers they want. In addition, by making education more attractive and relevant, Hungary aims to boost the number of graduates in the workforce while reducing the share of early school leavers to 10 % for 18-24-year-olds. Hungary is also targeting help at disadvan- taged groups and promoting secure, skilled jobs as a way of avoiding the risk of poverty. Early pre-school education and better teach- ing will help disadvantaged children, in par- ticular Roma children, to develop their talents for the future and provide a path into further vocational education. Likewise, job and train- ing opportunities are needed for deprived families to avoid subsequent generations falling into the trap of long-term unemploy- ment. By 2020, Hungary aims to reduce pov- erty levels by 20 % and employment is a key instrument in achieving this. ESF spending in Hungary Hungary is receiving EUR 3.6 billion of ESF funds which with national co-funding brings total ESF spending in Hungary to nearly EUR 4.3 billion. Most of this is being spent on the \u2018Social Renewal\u2019 agenda to support growth and employment, while the State Reform programme is focused on improving administrative services. INVESTING IN PEOPLE AND JOBS: THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HUNGARY More people in work A key priority for Hungary\u2019s ESF programme is to increase the number of people in work. ESF funding is improving access to training and jobs for everyone, with particular attention to disadvantaged groups such as the Roma, low- skilled workers, the disabled, older workers and young people. An example of this support is a journalistic and fi lm-making training project in P\u00e9cs for young Roma, which highlighted Roma role models and encouraged better integration and combating stereotypes. Unemployment among women with young children is high, so projects are encouraging women back into the workplace through the better provision of day care, vocational training opportunities and more fl exible working arrangements. An exam- ple is the \u2018One-step-forward\u2019 project to train people, including parents, with low-qualifi ca- tions and care obligations \u2013 over 1 300 passed their exams and many went on into work, with over 300 working from home. Strong regional diff erences in employment opportunities and a reluctance to move to look for a job are major barriers to a higher employment rate. The ESF is supporting greater access to training throughout the country to help people fi nd jobs and encour- age greater mobility. As the economy moves away from traditional sectors such as agri- culture, it is important to help workers adapt to new types of work, such as through a project in the rural Gy\u0151r district that off ered catch-up education courses to Roma which led to jobs as machine operators and assist- ant nurses. Many ESF projects are sup- porting Hungary\u2019s National Social Inclusion Strategy which aims \u2013 among others \u2013 to involve 100 000 disadvantaged Roma in employment and training activities. Building skills for a stronger economy ESF funding is modernising the education and training system to provide the skills that work- ers and companies need, such as a Budapest- based chocolate manufacturer that received lean-manufacturing training for its personnel, boosting competitiveness and safeguarding 300 jobs for the future. ESF actions are also supporting education institutions with training for teachers on new competence-based teach- ing methods. And higher education is being adapted to support the knowledge economy and the capacity for research and develop- ment \u2013 a key component of economic com- petitiveness. An example is the career-tracking system installed by Budapest University of Technology and Economics that follows the careers of its graduates to ensure its teaching and curricula are off ering better job prospects.
