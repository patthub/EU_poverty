Asks the Council to consult Parliament again if it intends to amend the Commission proposal substantially; 5. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council and the Commission. TEXT PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION AMENDMENTS BY PARLIAMENT Amendment 1 Recital 5a (new) (5a) Aquaculture is not the only source of potential dissemi- nation of alien species in the aquatic medium. Other activities, such as, inter alia, the use of ballast water and trade in orna- mental fish, are possibly more significant in terms of environ- mental risk and require special management measures. Com- prehensive strategies should be developed to deal with the problem of alien species in an integrated fashion. However, until such a strategy is implemented, it is appropriate to adopt sectoral measures such as the ones proposed in this Regulation. Amendment 2 Recital 5b (new) (5b) Specific strategies should be developed to counter the introduction of genetically modified species into the EU's fish farming sector and to control the movement of fertilised eggs.

        "Amendment 3 Recital 8a (new) (8a) It should be taken into account that movements of alien or locally absent species to be held in closed aquaculture facil- ities which are secure and which present a very low risk of escape should not normally be subject to any prior environ- mental risk assessment. Amendment 4 Recital 9a (new) (9a) Some alien species have commonly been used in aqua- culture for a long time and experience has shown that the associated environmental risk is minimal. The activities con- nected therewith should therefore benefit from a differential treatment facilitating their development without any addi- tional administrative burden. Amendment 5 Recital 9b (new) (9b) There should be an adequate transition period between the entry into force and the application of this Regulation, in view of the financial and institutional implications for the parties concerned. Amendment 6 Article 2, paragraph 4a (new) 4a. When this Regulation is applied the fact that closed aquaculture facilities, as defined in Article 3, point 3, present a lower risk of escape should be taken into account. Amendment 7 Article 2, paragraph 5a (new) 5a. This Regulation, except for Articles 3 and 4, shall not apply to species which have commonly been used in aquacul- ture for more than 30 years and for which escape to the wild has been proven not to represent an environmental hazard. The Commission, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 and on the basis of scientific knowledge, shall establish the list of such species before the entry into force of this Regulation.

        "Whereas: (1) The marine environment is a precious heritage that must be protected, restored and treated as such with the ultimate aim of providing biologically diverse and dynamic oceans and seas that are safe, clean, healthy and productive. (2) Europe is surrounded by four seas \u2014 the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the North Sea and the Black Sea \u2014 and by two oceans \u2014 the Atlantic and the Arctic. (3) The Community's land territory effectively constitutes a peninsula with a coastline thousands of kilometres long, and the Community's marine territory is larger than its land territory. (4) It is evident that the demand on natural marine resources and marine ecological services, such as waste absorption, is too high and that the Community needs to reduce its footprint on the marine waters within and beyond Community territory. (5) In view of the particular sensitivities of the Baltic Sea ecosystem, due to its enclosed and brackish nature, Member States surrounding the Baltic should seek to address as a matter of urgency the particular threats to the Baltic Sea, such as eutrophication, the introduction of invasive species and overfishing. (6) In line with Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme ( 1 ) , a thematic strategy for the protection and conservation of the marine environment was to be developed, within three years of the adoption of that Programme, with the overall aims of promoting sustainable use of the seas and conserving marine ecosystems. (7) The thematic strategy on the marine environment \u2014 based on an integrated approach \u2014 should include, as appropriate, qualitative and quantitative objectives and time schedules that will make it possible to compare and evaluate the measures provided for. Actions geared to the implementation of the strategy should comply with the subsidiarity principle. Consideration should also be given to increased involvement of interested parties and to better use of the various Community financing instruments directly or indirectly linked to the protection of the marine environment. (8) The development and implementation of the strategy should be geared to the conservation of the ecosystem. This approach should consider bio-geographic areas to be protected, as well as human activities that have an impact on the marine environment. (9) It is necessary to continue to set biological and environmental targets and reference frameworks taking account of the objectives laid down in Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora ( 2 ) (the Habitats Directive), Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy ( 3 ) , and other internationally agreed objectives. (10) In order to promote sustainable use of the seas and to conserve marine ecosystems, priority should be given to achieving good environmental status in the Community's marine environment, to continuing the protection and preservation of that environment, and to ensuring that subsequent deterioration is prevented. (11) In order to achieve those objectives, a transparent and coherent legislative framework is required , which includes a definition of good environmental status and is linked to the principles of the Common Fisheries Policy, to provide an overall framework for action and to enable the action taken to be coordinated, and consistent, and properly integrated with action under other Community legisla- tion as well as international agreements.

        "(12) The diverse conditions, problems and needs of the various Marine Regions making up the marine environment in the Community require different and specific solutions. That diversity should be taken into account in the preparation, planning and execution of measures to achieve good environ- mental status in the Community's marine environment in the framework of Marine Regions and Sub- Regions. (13) It is therefore appropriate that Member States sharing a Marine Region should ensure that a single, joint Marine Strategy is produced per Region or Sub-Region for the waters falling under their sovereignty or jurisdiction. Each Member State should develop a Marine Strategy for its European waters which, while being specific to its own waters, reflects the overall perspective of the Marine Region concerned. Marine Strategies should culminate in the execution of programmes of measures designed to achieve good environmental status. (14) By reason of the transboundary nature of the marine environment, the development of Marine Stra- tegies should be coordinated for each Marine Region. Since Marine Regions are shared both with other Member States and with third countries, Member States should endeavour to ensure the closest poss- ible coordination with all the Member States and other countries concerned. Where practical and appropriate, existing institutional structures established in Marine Regions should be used to ensure such coordination. (15) Since action at international level is indispensable for the attainment of those objectives, this Directive should enhance the effectiveness of the Community's contribution under international agreements. (16) Due to the interaction of interests of shipping and fishing nations and their vessels and activities in the marine environment, it is imperative to coordinate efforts to protect the marine environment from risks associated with the operation of these vessels in the Marine Region with flag states. Where third-country vessels operate in the Marine Region, Member States should coordinate their efforts to protect the marine environment within the framework of existing bodies and institutions. (17) The Community and Member States are a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) , approved by Council Decision 98/392/EC ( 1 ). The obligations of the Community and Member States under those agreements should therefore be fully taken into account in this Directive. (18) This Directive should also support the strong position taken by the Community, in the context of the Convention on Biological Diversity, approved by Council Decision 93/626/EC ( 2 ), on halting biodiversity loss, ensuring the conservational and sustainable use of marine biodiversity and on the creation of a global network of marine protected areas by 2012. Additionally, it should contribute to the achieve- ment of the objectives of the Seventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD/COP7), which adopted an elaborate programme of work on marine and coastal biodi- versity with a number of goals, targets and activities aimed at halting the loss of biological diversity nationally, regionally and globally and at securing the capacity of the marine ecosystem to support the provision of goods and services, and a programme of work on protected areas with the objective of establishing and maintaining ecologically representative national and regional systems of marine pro- tected areas by 2012. The obligation for Member States to designate Natura 2000 sites under the Habitats Directive will make an important contribution to this process. (19) A rational approach should be defined for the full implementation of the Natura 2000 network in the marine environment. This approach should include proposals for adapting the annexes to the Habitats Directive relating to marine habitats and species, and should apply and adjust the necess- ary technical and financial instrumentation measures. (20) Ensuring the integration of conservation objectives, management measures and monitoring and assessment activities set up for marine protected areas into Marine Strategies is crucial to achieving the objectives of this Directive.

        "(21) This Directive should contribute to the fulfilment of the obligations of the Community and the Mem- ber States under several other relevant international agreements under which they have entered into important commitments relating to the protection of the marine environment from pollution: the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, approved by Council Decision 94/157/ EC ( 1 ) , the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North- East Atlantic, approved by Council Decision 98/249/ EC ( 2 ) , and its new Annex V on the Protection and Conservation of the Ecosystems and Biological Diversity of the Maritime Area and the corresponding Appendix 3 , approved by Council Decision 2000/340/ EC ( 3 ) , and the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, approved by Council Decision 77/585/ EEC ( 4 ), and its amendments from 1995, approved by Council Decision 1999/802/EC ( 5 ) , as well as its Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea Against Pollution from Land-Based Sources, approved by Council Decision 83/101/ EEC ( 6 ). (22) It is necessary to invite neighbouring countries to participate in this process and develop partner- ships with them, particularly in the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, taking account, inter alia, of the partnership initiatives launched in the context of the 2002 United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development. (23) Account should also be taken of biodiversity and the potential for marine research associated with deep-water environments off the outermost regions and support should be given, under specific programmes, for the drawing-up of scientific studies with a view to the improved characterisation of deep-water ecosystems. (24) For an effective protection of the marine environment, Member States should create frameworks and platforms that allow for cross-sectored processing of marine affairs. The development of the status of marine waters should therefore not be considered only from the environmental point of view, but should combine the natural science with the economic, social and administrative develop- ment of the area. (25) Since the programmes of measures executed under Marine Strategies will be effective and as cost- effective as possible only if they are devised on the basis of a sound scientific knowledge of the state of the marine environment in a particular area and tailored as closely as possible to the needs of the waters concerned in the case of each Member State and within the general perspective of the Marine Region concerned, it is necessary to provide for the preparation at national level of an appro- priate framework , including marine research and monitoring operations, for informed policy-making. (26) As a first step in that preparation, Member States across a Marine Region should undertake analyses of the characteristics and functions of their marine waters, identifying the predominant pressures and impacts on those waters, their economic and social use and the cost of degradation of the marine environment. (27) On the basis of such analyses, Member States should then determine for the European waters a set of characteristics for good environmental status. For those purposes, it is appropriate to make provision for generic qualitative descriptors, detailed criteria and standards to be developed in the near future by the Commission with the involvement of all interested parties. (28) The Community should create the necessary conditions to enable the Member States to benefit from the quality of research and the body of knowledge produced in universities dedicated to the study of marine sciences. The scientific and technical information required for the implementation of the various stages created by this Directive should thus be obtained from reliable sources and the sustainability of coastal areas where such teaching centres are normally located should be guaran- teed. (29) Support for research into the marine environment should be enshrined in the Seventh Framework Programme on research and development (2007-2013). ( 1 ) OJ L 73, 16.3.1994, p. 19.

        "(30) The next step towards achieving good environmental status should be the establishment of environ- mental targets and monitoring programmes for ongoing assessment, enabling the state of the waters concerned to be evaluated on a regular basis. (31) On the basis of those frameworks, Member States should establish and implement programmes of measures which are designed to achieve good environmental status in the waters concerned, while accommodating existing Community and international requirements and the needs of the Marine Region concerned. (32) Although it is appropriate, given the precision of focus needed, that those steps be undertaken by the Member States, it is essential, in order to ensure the cohesion of action across the Community as a whole and in relation to commitments at global level, to make both the preparatory framework and the programmes of measures subject to the approval of the Commission. (33) The planning, implementation and management of the programmes of measures may require con- siderable expenditure. Bearing in mind that the programmes of measures are the means of achiev- ing the objectives of this Directive, the Community should contribute to Member States' expenditure during the preparation, implementation and coordination of those programmes. (34) For reasons of fairness and feasibility, it is appropriate to make provision for cases where it would be impossible for a Member State to achieve the level of ambition of the environmental targets set. (35) In that context, it is necessary to make provision for two types of special case. The first concerns a situation where it is impossible for the Member State to meet its environmental targets because of action or inaction on the part of another country, natural causes or force majeure, or because of actions which that Member State has itself taken for reasons of public interest which were held to outweigh the negative impact on the environment. It is appropriate to allow Member States to take ad hoc measures in such cases in lieu of measures integrated in its programme of measures. Ad hoc measures should be designed to prevent further deterioration in the status of the marine waters affected and to mitigate the adverse impact within the Marine Region concerned. (36) The second type of special case is that where a Member State identifies an issue which has an impact on the environmental status of its European marine waters, even perhaps of the entire Marine Region concerned, but cannot be tackled by measures taken at national level. In such cases, provision should be made for the Commission to be informed in the framework of submission of programmes of measures. (37) However, it is necessary that the flexibility introduced for special cases be subject to control at Com- munity level. As regards the first type of case, it is therefore appropriate that, in the course of the assessment to be made by the Commission before approving the programme of measures, due con- sideration be given to the efficacy of any ad hoc measures taken. Moreover, in cases where the Member State refers to action taken for overriding reasons of public interest, the Commission should ensure that any modifications or alterations made to the marine environment as a consequence do not per- manently exclude or compromise the achievement of good environmental status in the Marine Region concerned. (38) As regards the second type of special case, the Commission should, before approving the programme of measures, consider the validity of the view taken by the Member State concerned, that is to say, that measures taken at national level would not suffice, hence that action at Community level is necessary. (39) In view of the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems and of their natural variability, and of the fact that the pressures and impacts on them will vary with the evolvement of different patterns of human activity and the impact of climate change, it is essential to recognise that the definition of good environmental status is dynamic and flexible and must be adapted over time. Accordingly, it is appro- priate that protection of the marine environment be flexible and adaptive. It is necessary, therefore, to provide for the updating of Marine Strategies on a regular basis. (40) It is also necessary to provide for the publication of programmes of measures and updates thereof, and for interim reports to be presented to the Commission, describing progress in the implementation of the programme. C 314 E/90 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "(41) To ensure the active involvement of the general public in the establishment, implementation and updating of Marine Strategies, it is necessary to provide proper information on the different elements of Marine Strategies, or their related updates, as well as, upon request, relevant background documents and information used for the development of the Marine Strategies. (42) It is appropriate that the Commission should present a first evaluation report on the implementation of this Directive within two years of receiving all programmes of measures and, in any case, by 2017 at the latest. Subsequent Commission reports should be published every six years thereafter. (43) Provision should be made for the adoption of adaptations of standards for the assessment of the status of the marine environment, monitoring, environmental targets and of technical formats for the pur- poses of transmission and processing of data in order to be compatible with Directive 2007/ \u2026 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (Inspire) ( 1 ). (44) Measures regulating fisheries management can be taken , inter alia, in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy, as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy ( 2 ), based on scientific advice, and are therefore also addressed by this Directive. The control of discharges and emissions resulting from the use of radioactive material is regulated by Articles 30 and 31 of the Euratom Treaty and is therefore not addressed by this Directive. (45) Future reform of the Common Fisheries Policy should take into account the environmental impacts of fishing and the objectives of this Directive. (46) Since the objectives of the action to be taken cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (47) Action by Member States should be based on the precautionary principle and an ecosystem-geared approach. (48) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, it seeks to promote the integration into Community policies of a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of environmental quality in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. (49) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 3 ), HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Chapter I General provisions Article 1 Subject-matter This Directive establishes a framework within which Member States shall achieve good environmental status in the marine environment by the year 2017 at the latest and take measures which: (a) protect and preserve the marine environment or allow its recovery or, where practicable, restore the structure, function and processes of marine biodiversity and marine ecosystems ; ( 1 ) OJ \u2026 ( 2 ) OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59.

        "(b) prevent and phase out pollution in the marine environment so as to ensure that there are no significant impacts on or risks to marine biodiversity, marine ecosystems, human health or legit- imate uses of the sea; (c) contain the use of marine services and goods and other activities in the marine environment to levels that are sustainable and that do not compromise uses and activities of future generations nor the capacity of marine ecosystems to respond to natural and human-induced changes. Article 2 Scope This Directive is applicable to all European marine waters and takes account of the need to ensure the quality of the marine environment of associated and applicant States . Article 3 Existing obligations, commitments and initiatives This Directive shall be without prejudice to: (a) existing obligations, commitments and initiatives of Member States, or the Community, at Com- munity or international level regarding environmental protection in European marine waters; and (b) the competence of Member States in existing international institutional structures. Article 4 Definitions For the purposes of this Directive: (1) \u2018 European marine waters \u2019 shall mean: \u2014 all European waters on the seaward side of the baseline from which the extent of the territorial waters is measured, extending to the outmost reach of the area covered by the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Member States, including the bed of those waters and its subsoil; and \u2014 all tidal waters \u2014 either in or adjacent to the Member States \u2014 from which the distance of the territorial waters is measured, and any land or seabed covered continuously or intermittently by those waters; (2) \u2018 environmental status \u2019 shall mean the overall status of the environment of the waters in question, taking into account: (a) the structure, function and processes of the constituent marine ecosystems; and (b) the components, conditions and factors, whether acoustic, biological, chemical, climatic, geo- graphic, geological, physical or physiographic, which interact and determine the condition, pro- ductivity, quality and state of the marine ecosystems referred to in point (a). The components, conditions and factors referred to in point (b) include those arising as a result of human activities, irrespective of whether such activities occur within or outside the European marine waters in question; (3) \u2018 good environmental status \u2019 shall mean the state of the environment when: (a) the structure, function and processes of the constituent marine ecosystems enable these ecosys- tems to function in their natural self-maintaining manner. The marine ecosystems retain their natural resilience to broader environmental change; C 314 E/92 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "(b) all human activities within and outside the area in question are managed in a manner that makes their collective pressure on the marine ecosystems compatible with good environmental status. Human activities in the marine environment do not exceed levels that are sustainable at the geographical scale appropriate for assessment purposes. The potential for uses and activ- ities of future generations in the marine environment is maintained; (c) marine biodiversity and ecosystems are protected, their deterioration is avoided, recovery is possible and, where possible, their structure, function and processes are restored; (d) pollution and energy, including noise, in the marine environment are steadily reduced so as to ensure that the impact on or risks for marine biodiversity and marine ecosystems, human health or legitimate uses of the sea are minimised; and (e) all the conditions listed in Annex I are met; (4) \u2018 pollution \u2019 shall mean the direct or indirect introduction, as a result of human activity, of sub- stances or energy, including noise, into the marine environment which results or may result in such deleterious effects as harm to marine biodiversity and marine ecosystems, hazards to human health and hindrance to legitimate uses of the sea; (5) \u2018 marine protected areas \u2019 shall mean areas in which activities identified as exerting an important pressure and/or impact on the marine environment shall be limited or forbidden. Marine protected areas are identified by Member States during the preparation phase of the Marine Strategy, and belong to a system of marine spatial planning which is consistent at Community, regional and sub- regional level, and in line with international commitments to which the Community is party. Article 5 Marine Regions and Sub-Regions 1. Member States shall implement this Directive with reference to the following Marine Regions: (a) the Baltic Sea; (b) the North East Atlantic Ocean; (c) the Mediterranean Sea; (d) the Black Sea. 2.

Member States shall inform the Commission of any subdivision by the date specified in the first subpara- graph of Article 30 (1). 3. For each Marine Region, the Member States concerned shall achieve good environmental status in the European marine waters within that Region by 2017 at the latest, by establishing and implementing a single Marine Strategy for that Region in accordance with the provisions of this Directive. Member States shall define appropriate management units in their European marine waters in respect of each Marine Region or Sub-Region. The management units shall, where appropriate, take into account existing management, monitoring and reference units, and shall be identified by coordinates in the rele- vant Marine Strategy. Member States shall inform the Commission of any defined management unit by the date specified in the first subparagraph of Article 30(1). Article 6 Marine Strategies 1. Member States shall achieve good environmental status by establishing and implementing Marine Strategies. 2. Member States sharing a Marine Region shall ensure that a single, joint Marine Strategy is pro- duced per region or sub-region for the waters falling under their sovereignty or jurisdiction within that region. Each Member State shall, in respect of each Marine Region concerned, develop a Marine Strategy for its European marine waters in accordance with the following plan of action: (a) Preparation: (i) an initial assessment, to be completed by \u2026 ( * ) , of the current environmental status of the waters concerned and the environmental impact of human activities thereon, in accordance with Article 10; (ii) a determination, to be established by \u2026 ( * ) , of good environmental status for the waters con- cerned, in accordance with Article 11 (1); (iii) establishment, by \u2026 ( ** ) , of a series of environmental targets, in accordance with Article 12 (1); (iv) establishment and implementation, by \u2026 ( ** ) except where otherwise specified in the relevant Com- munity legislation, of a monitoring programme for ongoing assessment and regular updating of targets, in accordance with Article 13 (1); (b) Programmes of measures: (i) development, by 2012 at the latest, of a programme of measures designed to achieve good envir- onment status, in accordance with Article 16 (1), (3) and (5) ; (ii) entry into operation of the programme provided for in point (i), by 2014 at the latest, in accor- dance with Article 16(8).

        "3. Where Member States sharing a particular Marine Region or Sub-Region agree on implementing the steps outlined in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 more swiftly than indicated, they shall inform the Commission of their revised timetable and proceed accordingly. Those Member States shall receive appropriate support from the European Union for their greater efforts to improve the environment by making the area a pilot area. The provisions in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 shall not prevent any Member State from maintain- ing or introducing more stringent protective measures. 4. Member States shall establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the steps outlined in para- graph 2 with respect to Articles 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16 are developed and implemented in compliance with Article 8 and in a manner that delivers a single, joint Marine Strategy per Region and joint reporting on the components specified under these Articles. For each Marine Region, the Member State or the competent authority shall, within three months, for- ward the report to the Commission and the Member States concerned. 5. The Baltic Sea Marine Region could be a pilot area to implement the marine strategy. The forth- coming Baltic Sea Action Plan from the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) could be a useful resource in using the Baltic Sea for that purpose. A common programme of measures for the Baltic Sea Marine Region in accordance with Article 16(1)(a) and (b) shall be developed by Member States in the region, by 2010 at the latest, to achieve good environmental status in the Baltic Sea Marine Region. Article 7 Marine protected areas 1. In their strategies, Member States shall lay down measures for the protection of areas, by Region and Sub-Region, designated as \u2018 marine protected areas \u2019 . As part of their strategies per region and sub-region, Member States shall, if necessary, also take mea- sures to establish closed marine nature reserves with the aim of protecting and preserving the most vulnerable marine ecosystems and biodiversity. 2. A Member State establishing a programme of measures shall include amongst the measures in its programme the use of spatial protection measures, including but not limited to the use of special areas of conservation pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC, the use of special protection areas pursuant to Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds ( 1 ) (the Birds Directive), and marine protected areas as agreed in Decision VII/5 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as those stemming from any other international or regional agreements to which the Community is a party. 3. Member States shall ensure that these areas contribute to a coherent and representative network of marine protected areas by 2012 at the latest. The network shall include areas of sufficient size to be fully protected from all extractive uses, in order to safeguard, inter alia, spawning, nursery and feeding grounds and to enable the integrity, structure and functioning of ecosystems to be maintained or recov- ered. 4. Member States shall establish one or more registers for such marine protected areas, which shall be finalised at the latest by \u2026 ( * ). 5. The public shall have access to the information contained in the register(s). 6. The marine protected area register(s) for each Marine Region or Sub-Region shall be reviewed and updated.

For the purposes of this Directive, Member States with marine waters within the same Marine Region or Sub-Region shall cooperate and coordinate their actions. Where practical and appropriate, Member States shall use existing institutional structures established in that Marine Region or Sub-Region and, as far as possible, the programmes and activities adopted there, to which suitable adjustments shall be made, particularly with a view to bringing them into line with Article 22 . 2. For the purpose of establishing and implementing a Marine Strategy, Member States shall make every effort to coordinate their actions with: (a) third countries having sovereignty or jurisdiction over maritime zones in the Marine Region in ques- tion; (b) third countries whose flag vessels operate in the Marine Region in question; and (c) third countries that are land-locked but have on their territories point or diffuse sources of pollu- tion that is transferred to the Marine Region in question by means of rivers or the atmosphere. In that context, Member States shall, as far as possible, build upon existing programmes and activities developed in the framework of structures stemming from international agreements. In the context of international and regional agreements which the Community has concluded with orga- nisations and third countries which have sovereignty or jurisdiction over \u2014 waters bordering on European marine waters, \u2014 vessels operating in European marine waters, and \u2014 land which may cause pollution of European marine waters, Member States and the Commission shall promote the adoption of measures and programmes for marine strategies in accordance with the provisions of Chapters II and III. 3. The Commission shall, by 2007, establish a regulatory framework, focusing on environmental cri- teria, so as to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are being consulted prior to major infrastructure projects in the marine environment. 4. Support from the European Union, for instance under the Common Agricultural Policy, may be allocated only to stakeholders who can show that their activities exhibit a balance in terms of nutrients, i.e. that they are not beset by large-scale nutrient leakage to water recipients. Article 9 Competent national authorities 1. Member States shall, by the date specified in the first subparagraph of Article 30 (1), designate for each Marine Region concerned the competent authority for the implementation of this Directive with respect to their European marine waters. Within six months of that date, Member States shall provide the Commission with a list of the competent authorities designated, together with the items of information listed in Annex II. At the same time, Member States shall send the Commission a list of the national competent authorities of all the relevant international bodies in which they participate. 2. Member States shall inform the Commission of any changes to the information provided pursuant to paragraph 1 within three months of such a change coming into effect.

Chapter III Marine Strategies: Programmes of measures Article 16 Programmes of measures 1. Member States shall, in respect of each Marine Region concerned, identify the measures which need to be taken in order to achieve good environmental status, as determined pursuant to Article 11 (1), in all of their European marine waters. Those measures shall be devised on the basis of the initial assessment made pursuant to Article 10 (1) and by reference to the environmental targets established pursuant to Article 12(1), taking into consideration the types of measure listed in Annex VI , relevant transboundary impacts and features, and shall be based on the following environmental principles: (a) the precautionary principle and the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environ- mental damage should, as a priority, be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay; (b) an ecosystem-geared approach. Member States shall decide on the measures which must be taken pursuant to Article 14 concerning the traceability and detectability of marine pollution. 2. Member States' programmes of measures shall include spatial protection measures. These measures shall include but not be limited to the use of special areas of conservation pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC, special protection areas pursuant to Directive 79/409/EEC, and marine protected areas as agreed in Decision VII/5 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as those stemming from any other international or regional agreements to which the Community is a party. Member States shall ensure that these areas contribute to a coherent and representative network of marine protected areas by 2012 at the latest. The network shall include areas of sufficient size to be fully protected from all extractive uses, in order to safeguard, inter alia, spawning, nursery and feeding grounds, and to enable the integrity, structure and functioning of ecosystems to be maintained or recovered. 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/99 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",

        "P6_TC1-COD(2006)0018 Position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading on 14 November 2006 with a view to the adoption of Directive 2006/ \u2026 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) The Commission communication of 28 January 2005 on the Community strategy concerning mercury , which considered all uses of mercury, concluded that it would be appropriate to introduce Commun- ity-level marketing restrictions on certain non-electrical or non- electronic measuring and control equipment containing mercury, which is the main mercury product group not covered by Community action so far. (2) There would be benefits for the environment, and in the long term for human health, by preventing mercury from entering the waste stream, if limitations on the marketing of measuring devices contain- ing mercury were introduced. (3) Taking into account technical and economic feasibility, available evidence concerning measuring and control devices indicates that immediate restrictive measures should cover only those measuring devices intended for sale to the general public and all fever thermometers . (4) Import of mercury-containing measuring devices that are more than 50 years old concerns either antiques, or cultural goods as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92 of 9 December 1992 on the export of cultural goods ( 3 ). Such trade is limited in extent and seems to pose no risk to human health or the environment. Such trade should therefore not be restricted. (5) With the aim of minimising the release of mercury to the environment and to ensure the phase-out of the remaining measuring instruments containing mercury in professional and industrial use, especially sphygmomanometers in healthcare, the Commission should carry out a review of the availability of safer alternative solutions that are technically and economically feasible. In the case of sphygmomanometers in healthcare, medical experts should be consulted to ensure that the needs in terms of diagnosis and treatment of specific medical conditions are adequately addressed. (6) This Directive is intended to restrict only the placing on the market of new measuring devices. This restriction should therefore not apply to devices that are already in use, or those which have already been placed on the market .

        "(7) The disparities between the laws or administrative measures adopted by Member States as regards restriction on mercury in various measuring and control devices could create barriers to trade, distort competition in the Community and may thereby have a direct impact on the establishment and func- tioning of the internal market. It therefore appears necessary to approximate the laws of Member States in the field of measuring and control devices by introducing harmonised provisions with regard to those products containing mercury thus preserving the internal market whilst ensuring a high level of protection of human health and the environment. (8) Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations ( 1 ) should be amended accordingly. (9) This Directive should apply without prejudice to Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers contained in Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work ( 2 ) and individual directives based thereon, in particular Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work ( 3 ). (10) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making ( 4 ), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.

        "Macroeconomic policy 1. Welcomes the presentation by the Commission of its first annual report on the euro area, which reflects the evolution of the euro area economies in 2006 and is a useful contribution to the debate on the shared economic policy challenges facing euro-area members; 2. Considers that clear and transparent rules on how the two main pillars \u2014 money supply on the one hand, and all other relevant information on future inflation developments on the other \u2014 affect the opera- tional decisions of monetary policy could make it more predictable and effective; considers also that min- utes of the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB should be published, containing a clear statement of the arguments for and against the decisions taken and the reasons why they were taken; considers such transparency to be important because in this way the market will be able to gain a clearer picture of the ECB's monetary policy; 3. Taking into account that the monetary stimulus given in recent years is gradually being withdrawn; calls on the Commission to adhere to a strict interpretation of the renewed Stability and Growth Pact and on Member States to pursue an annual improvement in their cyclically adjusted budget deficits of 0,5 % of GDP as a benchmark, which will help to dampen inflationary pressures and keep interest rates down at levels that do not endanger the current economic recovery; recalls in this context the added value of better fiscal, especially budgetary, coordination among Member States towards a more coherent macroeconomic policy balance, as compared to the well-developed monetary policy of the EMU; 4. Considers that, without questioning the principle of subsidiarity in fiscal policy and respecting the prerogatives of national governments in determining their structural and budgetary policies, it is important that all Member States, at least those belonging to the euro area, coordinate their different national fiscal calendars and base their budgetary projections on similar criteria in order to avoid disparities caused by the use of different macroeconomic forecasts (global growth, EU growth, price per barrel of oil, interest rates) and other parameters; believes that the Commission can provide an important contribution to achieve this mission; 5. Calls on Member States to allocate a substantial share of additional fiscal revenues obtained from the current economic growth to reduce public debt which will free resources to be invested in education, voca- tional training, infrastructure, and research and innovation in line with the objectives set by the Lisbon- G\u00f6teborg Strategy and to face the challenges presented by an ageing population and climate change; 6. Reminds the Commission that in its above-mentioned resolution of 4 April 2006, the Parliament asked for a general review of the Member States' fiscal systems, which is a key method to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy and the sustainability of public finances; 7. Invites the Commission to prepare a study on the benefits for the euro area and for the Union as a whole of a better functioning of the economic pillar of the EMU applied to the euro area in terms of growth and employment; Economic reforms 8. Recalls in this context the importance of the active and urgent implementation of the Lisbon Strategy equally at all levels and in all policy fields concerned by a multi-supportive policy mix of economic, employ- ment, environment and social policy reforms; 9. Realises that the euro area economy adjusted to world growth recovery only very sluggishly, mainly due to the weakness in domestic demand and that economic reforms in product, labour and capital markets will help prices and wages to respond more rapidly to changing economic circumstances, this being essen- tial for raising the potential for growth, dealing with unwarranted disparities in growth and inflation among Member States in the euro area, and adjusting to potentially adverse global developments; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/127 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "10. Takes into account that some Member States have shown commitment in their national reform programmes (NRPs), but realises that this is not sufficient and urges the Member States to undertake action; recalls that economic performance would be furthered by the approval of a code of conduct allowing for mutual monitoring by Member States of NRPs, through the exchange of best practices and the publication by the Commission of an annual \u2018 league table \u2019 showing the best and worst-performing countries, as pro- posed in the report of November 2004 by the Commission's High Level Group chaired by Wim Kok entitled \u2018 Facing the Challenge \u2014 The Lisbon strategy for growth and employment \u2019 ; 11. Considers that the euro-area Member States should continue to progress simultaneously as regards the three principles of the Lisbon-G\u00f6teborg model (economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection) and also emphasises the potential of \u2018 flexicurity \u2019 (flexibility and security) for increasing labour market participation, in particular that of women, older workers, young people, the long-term unemployed, and immigrants; 12. Recalls its conviction that the objective of introducing a common consolidated corporate tax base in Europe could also be achieved through the mechanism of enhanced cooperation if Member States were unable to reach unanimous agreement; underlines that the mechanism of enhanced cooperation \u2014 though less desirable than a unanimous agreement of the Member States \u2014 would allow the great majority of Member States to progress in the field of a common framework for company taxation in the internal market while allowing the non-participating Member States the possibility to join at a later stage; believes that this issue is ever more relevant for the euro area and urges the Member States of the euro area to step up their efforts in order to make progress in this field; Internal market 13. Considers that the completion of the internal market, especially in services, is crucial to fostering economic growth and job creation within the EMU; therefore calls for further and better implementation of directives; condemns the policies adopted by some Member States to protect their key industries and ser- vices from cross-border competition and renews its commitment to the principles of free movement of persons, goods, services and capital; 14. Agrees with the Commission on the necessity of removing barriers for the creation of a Single European Payment Area and of taking further action to open up the fragmented retail financial services markets (savings plans, mortgages, insurance and pensions) while ensuring the protection of consumers; underlines the importance of developing a pan-European approach to financial market regulation and super- vision and recalls that it is necessary to review the rules on insurance solvency (Solvency II) as well of those concerning the discretionary powers of regulators in the case of cross-border mergers to avoid conflicts between the supervisors in the home and host Member States; 15. Believes that an ambitious EU innovation policy is one of the main cornerstones of sustainable development and job creation and should be included as a top priority in the framework of an improved economic coordination approach; regrets that research and development expenditures in the euro area stand at around 2 % of GDP, and thus fall significantly short of the EU-wide objective of 3 %; calls on the Com- mission to table concrete proposals regarding the financing of R&D within the EU and an efficient frame- work of intellectual property rights; calls on Member States to allocate more resources to research and innovation and to establish tax incentives for businesses and universities investing in R&D, knowing that, compared with direct subsidies, such incentives are a better guarantee that public resources will be used to support successful ventures; 16. Considers that labour markets should be made more flexible and those aspects of the legislation on permanent employment that may act as a barrier to labour market adjustment should be removed; admits that in the long term, real wages and productivity should grow simultaneously; regrets that many of the C 314 E/128 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "proposals made by the Parliament have not been taken into account, especially those referring to the improvement of child-care facilities, the achievement of a better work-life balance, the setting up of incen- tives to encourage workers to delay voluntary retirement, and the establishment of policies aimed at inte- grating legal immigrants into the labour market and combating illegal immigration; 17. Regrets that the current levels of education and lifelong learning, which should be included as top priorities in the framework of an improved economic coordination approach, are clearly insufficient and agrees with most of the measures proposed by the Commission; regrets, however, that some of the propo- sals approved by the Parliament have not been taken on board especially those with the objective of improving the knowledge of foreign languages, mathematics and sciences in primary and secondary educa- tion, to achieve an integrated model of professional training, to attract more students to scientific careers, to strengthen cooperation between universities and the industrial and commercial sectors, to encourage educa- tional provision that takes into account labour market demand, to guarantee access to tertiary education for all, to promote lifelong learning and address long-term and youth unemployment accordingly, and to ensure the better communication, dissemination and application of the outcomes of research; 18. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to include within their top priorities the achieve- ment of an internal market for energy, improved R&D policy on alternative energy sources and more environmentally friendly and cleaner energy, including a push towards the increased use of renewable ener- gies, an increased commitment to energy savings and efficiency, as well as the reinforcement of political and economic links with as many supplier countries as possible in order to diversify energy sources and deal better with shortages of supply; A functioning EMU 19. Agrees with the Commission that the disparities in growth and inflation rates within the euro area, with differences of up to 4,5 % in growth and up to 2,7 % in inflation in 2005, is increasingly due to structural reasons; regrets that dispersion in inflation rates among Member States with higher inflation rates has a negative effect on the competitiveness and monetary stability of the euro area as a whole; notes that these differences are sometimes part of a positive process of convergence in revenues and price level, due to the \u2018 catch up \u2019 process; calls once more on Member States of the euro area to strengthen their efforts towards effective coordination of economic and monetary policies notably through the reinforcement of their common strategies within the Eurogroup, in order to improve the real convergence of economies and to limit the risks of asymmetric shock in the EMU; 20. Welcomes Slovenia to the euro area on 1st January 2007; calls on new Member States to undertake the necessary actions to fulfil the Maastricht convergence criteria and draws attention to the fact that the ECB and the Commission must apply the price stability criterium as set out in the EC Treaty, which differs from that applied by the ECB when conducting its monetary policy, and suggests that the ECB and the Commission evaluate whether it is justified to retain such a difference in approach; 21. Recognises that according to the Maastricht convergence criteria, the rate of inflation must not exceed by more than 1,5 % that of the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability; points out that both the definition of the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability as well as the method of calculating the reference value need to be carefully examined to reflect the fact that there are now twelve Member States participating in the EMU, using a single currency, which is managed by a common monetary policy, and that the differentials in their individual inflation performance reflect struc- tural factors rather than differences in macroeconomic policy stances; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/129 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "22. Calls on the Commission and Eurostat to increase the quality of statistical macro data (especially budgetary deficit and state debt) and to use all their tools to avoid fiscal imbalances in any of the Member States; calls for a further increase of the Commission's powers to verify the quality of the transmitted data; 23. Invites the Commission to pay closer attention to the impact of the behaviour of the financial mar- kets on the macroeconomic situation of the euro area; 24. Urges the competent supervisors to step up their efforts in order to assess the activities of hedge funds more efficiently with regard to the systemic risks which they may create and invites the Eurogroup to examine this issue; External representation 25. Welcomes the agreement reached within the Council to speak with one voice at the annual meeting of the Bretton Woods institutions in Singapore of 19 to 20 September 2006; insist that the positions of the Member States' representations within the IMF must be better coordinated; calls on the Member States once again to work towards a single voting constituency, possibly starting as a euro constituency, with a view, in the longer term, to securing consistent EU representation, involving the Ecofin Council Presidency and the Commission, subject to Parliament's scrutiny; Coordination 26. Welcomes the re-election of Jean-Claude Juncker as chair of the Eurogroup; believes the Eurogroup should agree on a roadmap on the objectives of the euro area for the next two years; 27. Points out that the Treaty does not clarify how the Council must exercise its responsibility for exchange rate policy; invites the Eurogroup, the Council and the ECB to step up the coordination of their action in the area of exchange rate policy; 28. Highlights the necessity of underpinning cooperation in the euro area in order to strengthen eco- nomic governance and the process of European integration so that global economic challenges can be tackled; calls on the Commission, therefore, to ensure that the annual report on the euro area provides, in the future, a more concrete set of tools, which would enable a deeper dialogue between the different EU institutions concerned with improving economic governance of the Union; invites the Commission to pro- vide strong support for the activities of the Eurogroup and its president; 29. Considers that it would be beneficial to all parties involved, if a more regular and structured dialogue on macroeconomic issues between the Eurogroup, the Commission and Parliament, similar to the monetary dialogue between Parliament and the ECB, were established to take place at least quarterly, in order to deepen the existing frameworks and debate challenges facing the euro area economy and ways to tackle them; 30. Believes that the regular meetings of the Parliament and national parliaments could clearly play a significant role in helping develop a better ownership by national parliaments of the required economic policy coordination; * * * 31. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the president of the Eurogroup, the Council, the Commission, and the European Central Bank.

        "2. Believes in the leadership role of the EU in this process and therefore calls for a strong EU policy on marine protection, preventing further loss of biodiversity and deterioration of the marine environment and fostering the restoration of marine biodiversity; 3. Calls for the inclusion in the Marine Strategy Directive of a common EU-wide definition of good environmental status (GES), understood as the environmental status when all the marine ecosystems within a given Marine Region are managed in ways which allow them to function in a balanced, self-sustaining way in the face of environmental change, supporting both biodiversity and human activities; considers that this would make for greater effectiveness in the implementation of the Marine Strategy Directive; 4. Notes that good environmental status of European regional seas can only be achieved by strong and coordinated action at regional level rather than by Member States acting individually, and therefore asks for the Marine Strategy Directive to include a legal obligation for Member States to achieve GES; considers, furthermore, that the strategy must result in binding supranational obligations which may also involve common commitments in third countries; 5. Calls, furthermore, for the inclusion of a list of generic qualitative descriptors, criteria and standards for the recognition of GES, namely an existing list generally accepted by marine stakeholders, without excluding further improvements and development of the list; 6. Considers it important that the objectives, measures, language and concepts used in the Marine Strat- egy Directive and other directives concerning the marine environment, such as the Water Framework Direc- tive and the Habitats Directive ( 1 ), are harmonised to achieve greater clarity and facilitate coordination between those directives; 7. Considers that measures to improve water quality must be taken swiftly and is, therefore, concerned at the extended timetable put forward in the proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive; considers that it would be better to bring the timetable into line with the timetable for the Water Framework Directive; 8. Notes that the timetable for the Water Framework Directive, whereby good ecological status is to be achieved in coastal waters by 2015, has already been implemented in the Member States; considers that it is not logical or appropriate simultaneously to propose a less ambitious target for partly overlapping and adjoining marine areas; stresses that it will not be possible to achieve good environmental status in several areas of coastal water unless there is correspondingly good environmental status in the adjoining marine areas; Synergies with EU policies 9. Welcomes the Green Paper \u2018 Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union \u2019 (COM(2006)0275) which foresees a holistic approach to the sustainable development of the oceans, but warns against too great an emphasis on an economic approach and urges that a balance be struck between the economic and ecologi- cal angles; expects the Marine Strategy Directive, its environmental pillar, to provide the legal framework for the preservation and integrity of the marine environment and thus the legal framework for the appropriate management units \u2014 the Marine Regions and Strategies \u2014 for marine planning and decisions; 10. Believes that there must be clarification of the implications for the Member States if the targets and measures in respect of marine environment protection are not sufficiently far-reaching, i.e. that considera- tion must be given to how to ensure that the objective of the Marine Strategy Directive \u2014 good environ- mental status \u2014 can actually be achieved; 11. Notes that Member States have delayed complying with the existing marine components of the Natura 2000 network; encourages Member States to identify Marine Protected Areas of specific scientific or biodiversity interest, or subject to intense pressures, in accordance with the Habitats and Birds ( 2 ) Direc- tives; ( 1 ) Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7). ( 2 ) OJ L 103, 25.4.1979, p. 1. 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/133 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "12. Prefers long-term efforts to integrate environmental objectives into the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and thereby meet the requirements for sustainable development but insists that the Member States should have the opportunity to adopt more urgent and short-term measures, e.g. the establishment of no-go areas (Marine Reserves), or marine sanctuaries, to protect the most vulnerable marine ecosystems; 13. Deplores the lack of reference by the Commission, in both the Communication and the Marine Strategy Directive, to the marine waters of the French overseas departments, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, bearing in mind the conditions laid down in Article 299 of the EC Treaty, and to the marine waters of the Overseas Countries and Territories listed in Annex II of the Treaty; Budgetary concerns 14. Expresses its concern over the lack of financial commitment for the implementation of the Marine Strategies; asks the Commission and the Member States to identify the measures that could be co-financed through Life+ due to their particular importance for the achievement of GES in the European marine waters; 15. Considers that coordination between economic and environmental interests should, where possible, take place at local level in order to safeguard the subsidiarity principle and the participation of local stake- holders, but that it should also take place at higher levels (regional, EU and international) when appropriate and necessary; 16. Points out that different marine regions within the EU are distinct from each other and have different needs for protection; considers, therefore, that further-reaching financial measures may be required at EU level for some regions compared with others in order to achieve good environmental status and sustain- ability; 17. Believes that the optimum benefits from coordination with existing programmes can be gained by coordinating the timetable for the marine strategy with important programmes at EU level; believes that coordination with the next programming period for the EU's agricultural fund (from 2014) is of particular importance for those regions in which agriculture accounts for a substantial proportion of the discharges into the marine area; 18. Believes that consideration should be given in all sectors to financial incentives, such as \u2014 to take an example working in the Baltic Sea \u2014 environmentally differentiated port and fairway dues; takes the view that further-reaching measures may also be required in this respect in certain regions; Data sharing 19. Recommends a new approach to marine assessment and monitoring, based upon existing institutions and programmes including the Data Collection Regulation under the CFP, and tailored to ensure full con- sistency and integration with relevant new Commission initiatives on spatial data infrastructure and GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security), in particular the marine services; 20. Recalls the mandate of the EEA to develop regular pan-European assessments of the marine environ- ment, based on existing indicators and other nationally available data and information; stresses that it is necessary to further improve national reporting, including through specific data exchange protocols on, for example, data flows to support the development of the Agency's core set of indicators; 21. Considers it essential to adopt traceability and detectability measures and programmes in order to identify pollution and locate its source so as to deal with it effectively; 22. Considers it essential to cooperate with decentralised agencies (European Environment Agency, Euro- pean Maritime Safety Agency, etc.) and with the European Research Centre in order to produce data on the quality of marine waters and to identify, locate and combat pollution; C 314 E/134 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "Relations with Conventions and third countries 23. Welcomes the excellent contributions to marine protection of a number of regional marine conven- tions, through their scientific and technical competence and ability to act as a bridge with non-EU countries, and expects them to become a key partner in delivering the Marine Strategy Directive; calls for the inclusion of explicit commitments to promote international cooperation with third countries and organisations with a view to their adopting marine strategies to cover regions or sub-regions with European marine waters; 24. In order to avoid a double bureaucratic burden on the effective delivery of the Marine Strategy Directive, asks the Commission and Member States to ensure either that the regional marine conventions have the relevant legal and administrative capacities or that mechanisms for joint implementation of the Strategy are developed between the different regional bodies operating within the same marine region; considers that in either case this must include the widest possible cross-sectoral and stakeholder involvement; 25. Calls on the Commission to study the possibility of making the Baltic Sea into a pilot area, in view of the fact that it is an especially sensitive sea area and the Member States surrounding it are likely to agree on faster implementation of the plans and actions through the work within the Helskinki Commission and other bodies; notes that the forthcoming Baltic Sea Action Plan from the Helsinki Convention could act as a pilot programme to implement the Strategy objectives in the Baltic Sea Marine Region; 26. Considers that the current international rules must be reviewed so that international waters (more than 12 nautical miles from the coast) may no longer be used for the discharging of latrines; 27. Notes that the protection of the Mediterranean sea lacks either the necessary environmental legisla- tion or, where such legislation does exist, the political willingness to enforce it; points out that the objectives of the Barcelona Convention to promote the integrated management of the coastal zones have to face a two-speed development of Regions, namely the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries on the one hand and the northern Mediterranean countries on the other; 28. Notes that, due to low water temperature and low water exchange rate, the Baltic Sea ecosystems are highly vulnerable to pollution and that the marine ecology of the Baltic region is estimated to have suffered near-irretrievable damage; therefore urges the Member States and the Commission to introduce special mea- sures, among others under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), in order to improve the environmental status of the Baltic Sea; considers moreover that cooperation between the EU and Russia has to be enhanced; believes, in this context, that the environmental partnership programme fund of the EU's North- ern Dimension Programme is an essential necessity to improve water protection in the Baltic Sea; 29. Calls on the Commission to propose relevant measures for the protection of the Arctic waters, an extremely fragile ecosystem under constant and emerging threats, and to develop and support programmes and projects that address the rights and needs of indigenous peoples in tackling sustainable use of the Arctic's natural resources; 30. Calls on the Commission to study the prerequisites for establishing the Arctic as a protected area, similar to the Antarctic, and designated as a \u2018 natural reserve devoted to peace and science \u2019 , and to report back to Parliament and the Council in 2008 at the latest; 31. Calls on the Member States and the Commission, in the context of EU international and regional agreements with third countries which have sovereignty or jurisdiction over waters bordering European marine waters, to promote the adoption of measures and programmes in accordance with the Marine Strategy Directive, which is in the process of being adopted; 32. Recommends the inclusion of the Black Sea as one of the Marine Regions to be covered by the Marine Strategy Directive; points out that this important marine region is bordered by Bulgaria and Roma- nia, countries that will join the EU in 2007 and are already participating in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive \u2014 as part of the work led by the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River \u2014 , and by Turkey, with whom accession negotiations are underway; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/135 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "33. Regrets the lack of environmental guarantee in connection with the construction of the North Euro- pean gas pipeline to prevent a potential environmental disaster in the Baltic Sea region; calls on the Com- mission to draw up an environmental impact assessment for the planned project and to postpone any decisions on the co-financing of the project; 34. Calls for prior consultation, in all cases, of adjoining countries and other countries concerned where projects may have an impact on the common environment, even when the project is carried out in inter- national waters; notes that experience shows that environmental impact assessments often have shortcom- ings and that they are not carried out in consultation with other States; calls on the Commission, therefore, to propose a mandatory negotiating mechanism between Member States, and urges the Council to act at international level to develop mandatory environmental impact assessments in relations between the EU and third countries; * * * 35.

        "M. whereas mortgage brokers can play an important role, drawing on their expertise with mortgage pro- ducts on their domestic market but also in markets across Member States, supporting cross-border activity and acting as a bridge between consumers and both foreign and local financial institutions, N. whereas significant variations in the range and characteristics of products, distribution structures, loan durations, and funding mechanisms exist between Member States, due to differing legal, fiscal, regula- tory, and consumer protection conditions, O. whereas mortgage credit markets display an extremely high degree of complexity; whereas legal systems and financing cultures, property law and land register systems, law of rights in rem, law governing credit agreements, valuation issues, forced sales procedures, refinancing markets, etc., differ considerably between one country and another while at the same time an internal coherence exists among the various fields, P. whereas there still exist tax obstacles of a discriminatory nature which impede the exploitation of a single market for mortgage credit and may in some cases even contravene EC legislation, Q. whereas there is a direct link between the mortgage market and macroeconomic policy and the conduct of monetary policy in particular, R. whereas mortgage market volatility can affect housing and economic cycles and thus cause systemic risk, S. whereas, in order to bring more efficiency and competitiveness to the EU mortgage credit market, it may be preferable to look first at the implementation and effectiveness of the Commission Recommen- dation 2001/193/EC of 1 March 2001 on pre-contractual information to be given to consumers by lenders offering home loans ( 1 ) (Code of Conduct) and the use of the European Standardised Informa- tion Sheet (ESIS), aiming to ensure that consumers obtain transparent and comparable information on housing loans, T. whereas the above-mentioned Code of Conduct appears to have been implemented with varying degrees of success across Member States, yet without solving the overall problem of a lack of a com- mon legal framework, Introduction 1. Recognises the consumer benefits that would be brought by further well-focused integration of the EU mortgage market; 2. Considers that any action at EU level regarding the European mortgage credit market must, first and foremost, benefit the public directly as mortgage borrowers and that the mortgage credit market should be accessible to a larger number of potential borrowers, including those with a low or incomplete credit profile, workers with fixed term contracts and first-time buyers; 3. Welcomes the Commission's wide consultation and insists that any specific proposals should be pre- ceded by thorough economic and social impact assessments; 4. Welcomes the Commission's efforts to date to comply with better regulation requirements; however, reminds the Commission that any conclusions reached should always be the result of an extensive consulta- tion process; 5. Notes the numerous obstacles to a single EU retail market for mortgage credit highlighted in the Green Paper and urges the Commission to focus on targeted measures offering the greatest benefits, encouraging market-led initiatives wherever possible; ( 1 ) OJ L 69, 10.3.2001, p. 25.

        "6. Cautions the Commission that attempts to harmonise products themselves might lead to legal incon- sistencies and thus produce a negative impact on the sector; 7. Insists that any EU action should not hamper competition and innovation, in particular regarding products, ancillary services and funding techniques; Code of Conduct and pre-contractual information 8. Calls for moves towards the harmonisation of provisions on pre-contractual information, which are necessary to enable borrowers to take informed decisions on potential mortgage contracts; 9. Insists that such pre-contractual information must be accurate and comprehensible to allow an informed choice, and that it should give the consumer as comprehensible and global a picture as possible in the light of the available information on which the mortgage contract is based; stresses that, in the event that the lender takes the initiative of offering a credit in another Member State, such information must be supplied to the borrower as quickly as possible in the official languages recognised in the borrower's Mem- ber State of residence; 10. Considers the Code of Conduct and the ESIS to be important yet insufficient instruments for the protecting the economic interests of citizens moving between Member States and likely to acquire property in other Member States; encourages the Commission to assess progress and consider making the Code of Conduct, which is currently voluntary, mandatory if early compliance is not forthcoming; Funding 11. Considers that the development of a single, open and compatible funding market is a first priority as it will boost efficiency, allow international diversification of credit risk, optimise funding conditions and capital allocation, and reduce borrowing costs; recognises the importance of and the potential for integrat- ing market-led initiatives in this area; 12. Points out that the creation of a single secondary market for mortgages can not be achieved without a gradual convergence of national contract rules; 13. Welcomes the setting up of the Mortgage Funding Expert Group and calls for an in-depth analysis of variations in national regulatory and legal practices affecting mortgages; 14. Considers that provisions in the Capital Requirements Directive on covered bonds and mortgage- backed securities offer important funding options; 15. Suggests that the Commission consider how best to create a central database as a depositary of information about the different national mortgage markets and transnational pools of mortgage securities (such as default probabilities, losses from default and prepayments), which would enable investors to evalu- ate and price adequately mortgage pools; 16. Suggests that a range of standardised packages of European mortgages could be traded on the capital markets with credit ratings according to their characteristics, thereby enhancing secondary markets in securi- tised mortgages; 17. Calls on the Commission to consider the growing market of mortgages compliant with sharia law and to ensure that any legislation does not exclude the requirements of that market; 18. Recognises the important role of mortgage insurance in reducing the risk exposure of lenders and allowing access for a wider range of borrowers; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/139 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "Retail 19. Calls on the Commission to investigate barriers which impede lenders' rights to free provision of services or freedom of establishment in other Member States and whether the \u2018 general good \u2019 clause is being used to discourage cross-border activity; 20. Supports Commission action to facilitate cross-border mergers and acquisitions in financial services, while ensuring that distribution networks take into account the requirements of regional situations and smaller markets, but notes that cross-border mergers and acquisitions alone will not promote integration of the market in this area; 21. Considers that opening up the mortgage credit market to non-credit institutions, with an equivalent supervisory regime, will increase competition and the range of products; 22. Recognises the beneficial role that credit intermediaries, such as mortgage brokers, can play in help- ing customers access competitive mortgage credit from domestic and non-domestic lenders and supports the Commission's commitment to consult on an appropriate regulatory environment for such operators; 23. Calls on the Commission to investigate impediments to the transfer of loans across borders, and to explore further the potential of the Euromortgage as a collateral instrument, including consideration of: \u2014 the accompanying guarantees necessary for its set up and use, particularly as regards verifying the collateral, public access to the deeds and effects vis-\u00e0-vis third parties; \u2014 the status that it would be given in relation to other charges secured on land; \u2014 the link between the credit and the collateral; and \u2014 the legal consequences of a partial or full discharge of the guaranteed credit, a change in its assessment basis or its transfer, whether vis-\u00e0-vis creditors or third parties; 24. Considers that any proposals to this effect should, if necessary, be accompanied by an impact assess- ment, including legal aspects, with detailed studies of comparative law, as well as economic and social aspects in line with the approach advocated under the guide to impact assessment approved by the Compe- titiveness Council on 29 May 2006; 25. Calls on the Commission to encourage the development of mechanisms for rechargeable mortgages and life annuity mortgage loans with full guarantees in terms of public information, with due regard to issues of confidentiality and effects vis-\u00e0-vis third parties; 26. Considers that lenders are more likely to enter a market if national rules allow them to offer early repayment terms at a price proportionate to costs or to vary interest rates in line with market conditions and risk and that restrictions in these aspects are likely to impair the development of the market in terms of funding, new products and lending to higher-risk borrowers; 27. Considers that an EU standard, defining the scope and method of calculating the annual percentage rates charged, should combine all charges to be levied by the lender and should ensure comparability among products with the same maturity offered in other Member States; believes that borrowers should also be informed in advance of any other charges related to the transaction and the borrower's legal obligations, including items levied by third parties such as legal fees, registration and administration fees and the costs of any valuations, or estimates of such costs if a precise figure is not available; 28. Believes that in addition to providing exact information on the annual percentage rate, the lender must provide information on any other types of charges or costs likely to arise from its activities, for example the expenses incurred in examining applications, commitment fees, penalties for early full or part repayment; 29. Recognises the potential of the Internet as a means for mortgage credit marketing, and recommends that the Commission study this further; C 314 E/140 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",
        "Legal, fiscal and operational barriers 30. Urges the Commission to examine legal and regulatory barriers hindering a market-led development of a pan-European funding market for mortgage credit; 31. Calls on the Commission to define the scope of its future proposals and to restrict it to mortgage contracts and their guarantees (fixed charges on real estate), so as to avoid any overlapping with COM(2005)0483; 32. Calls on the Commission to take steps to ensure the smooth running of the secondary mortgage market and establish a legal framework for conducting effective portfolio trading, in particular by identifying the factors preventing the available legal refinancing facilities from meeting the desired objective and allow- ing for the differing legal traditions and the different models for collateral security in land; 33. Agrees with the Commission that the issue of the law applicable to mortgage credit contracts should be addressed within the context of the revision of the 1980 Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations ; but supports the Mortgage Credit Forum Group's view that the law applicable to mortgage credit contracts does not have to be aligned with the law applicable to mortgage deeds and that, in the case of mortgage deeds, lex rei sitae applies; 34. Stresses the importance of comprehensive and reliable client credit databases and urges the Commis- sion to promote the development of a process of transition to a consistent format in all Member States; 35. Urges the Commission to facilitate cross-border access to client credit databases on a non-discrimi- natory basis as a priority for encouraging lenders to enter new markets; 36. Recognises that, subject to justifiable privacy protection, access to both positive and negative credit data is desirable; 37. Welcomes efforts to bring about improvements and adjustments in the law governing forced sales procedures; 38. Supports the Commission's proposal of a scoreboard for the length and cost of forced sales procedures; 39. Suggests that valuers' professional bodies should collaborate to adopt common EU property valua- tion standards of high quality and comparability; 40. Stresses the importance to lenders of easy access to full and accurate information on mortgage collateral and ownership rights; 41. Favours encouraging access to land registers, where this is not prevented by existing legislation, and supports all efforts to harmonise the informative value of these registers by means of national measures and encourages the enhancement of the current European Land Information Service (EULIS) system; 42. Supports action to abolish tax obstacles of a discriminatory nature, such as differential fiscal treat- ment of local and foreign lenders and government fees; 43. Urges the Commission to consider, in the case of cross-border mortgages, how to reconcile the varying approaches to the tax deduction of mortgage interest across the EU; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/141 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 14 November 2006 ",

Welcomes the Commission's commitment, and particularly the new Framework Strategy, to foster the knowledge of languages and take cultural and socio-economic advantage of it; 2. Considers that, in order to achieve the objectives set by the Lisbon strategy, it is essential to improve the quality, effectiveness and accessibility of the education and training systems in the European Union by promoting foreign language learning; 3. Acknowledges the strategic importance of European World Languages as a communication vehicle and as a means of solidarity, cooperation, and economic investment and, therefore, as one of the main political guidelines of European policy on multilingualism; 4. Welcomes the Commission's long-term objective to improve individual language skills, referring to the target set in 2002 by the Barcelona European Council whereby citizens should learn at least two foreign languages in addition to their mother tongue; 5. Reminds the EU Member States, to that end, that it is necessary to take appropriate measures to promote a genuine policy of learning foreign language skills; furthermore, re-affirms that the early learning of languages is of considerable importance, and should be based on effective methods according to the best available techniques; 6. Considers that there is a lack of detailed and reliable data and appropriate indicators related to the current situation of foreign language competence in the Member States and therefore welcomes the proposal for a European Indicator of Language Competence; that indicator should include all official EU languages and could, if feasible from a procedural point of view, be extended beyond the five widely-spoken languages to include the other EU languages, in order to gain a true picture of language competence; C 314 E/208 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "7. Believes that proposals for multilingualism should not be limited to the main official/ Member State languages; 8. Welcomes the Commission's commitment to give citizens access to EU legislation, procedures and information in their own languages; however this should include as many as possible of the languages of Member States used by EU citizens; in this way the Commission's statement to the effect that citizens have a right to access the EU in their own language without any barriers would become a reality; this would be an important step in closing the gap between the EU and many of its citizens, which is the main aim of Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate; 9. Calls on the Commission and the other European institutions to make the best possible use of new digital and technological translation tools on their Internet sites so as to enable European citizens to have access to, and obtain from the Internet, information about Europe in their own languages; 10. Considers that the widest opportunities should be provided for migrants to learn the language or languages of host countries, as defined by the legislation of those countries, with a view to their social and cultural integration in so far as is necessary, using methods which have proved effective in language learning and for the integration of migrant citizens and to enable them to be taught in their mother tongue as a way of preserving their ties with their country of origin; 11. Welcomes the idea of encouraging Member States to establish National Plans, because it recognises the need for language planning at Member State level; this will act to enhance many of the less widely used languages and raise awareness of the importance of linguistic diversity; suggests that Member State Plans should include the lesser-used languages within each Member State and examine the possibility for interested adults to learn these languages, and include these projects as examples of best practice; 12. Supports action for better teacher training, also for non-language and vocational teachers, and adds that the number of languages taught both within and outside school should be broadened to enable future teachers to learn, and subsequently teach, a greater diversity of languages under the same conditions, pro- vided that there is an expression of interest in this direction; recalls, in this connection, that language training is essential to promote and facilitate mobility not only for students but also for all workers seeking to carry on an occupation in one of the Member States; 13. Urges that particular attention be given to promoting language learning for people in disadvantaged and difficult circumstances and for people with disabilities; 14. Considers that language acquisition should be an essential element in the lifelong learning programme; 15. Welcomes the greater use of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), where pupils learn a subject through the medium of a foreign language, and calls on the Member States to form a network of best practices, in particular by analysing the results obtained from immersion courses in multilingual countries; 16. Welcomes the fact that higher education institutions play a more active role in promoting multi- lingualism not only amongst students and staff, but also amongst the wider local community, and therefore believes that linkages should be encouraged between universities and national, local and regional authorities; 17. Welcomes the focus on research and technological development activities on language-related infor- mation technologies within the 7th Framework Research Programme in order to enhance multilingualism through new IT; 18. Supports the proposals for multilingualism in the information society and the creation and circula- tion of multilingual content and knowledge; there is an increasing array of technologies that will help a greater use of all languages, including those less widely used; technology offers the greatest potential for ensuring social linguistic space for all of Europe's languages; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/209 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "19. Supports the proposals to develop language-related professions and industries; all European lan- guages will need new technologies such as speech processing, voice recognition and so on, as well work on terminology, developing language teaching, certification and testing; otherwise lesser-used languages will be left behind with their linguistic social space taken over by the more widely spoken languages; 20. Welcomes the proposal for greater transparency in language teaching, testing and certification by publishing an inventory of the systems currently available; Proposed Measures 21. Calls on the European institutions and bodies to improve their communication with citizens in their own national language, regardless of whether the language in question has official status at Member State or EU level; 22. Calls on the European institutions and bodies to cooperate closely with the Council of Europe in the promotion and protection of linguistic diversity and language learning, and to build on its experience in the area of language policy (such as the European Language Portfolio or the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages); 23. Encourages the Commission to continue implementing the proposals set out in its above-mentioned resolution of 4 September 2003 in so far as they are feasible, and to notify Parliament regularly of the results; 24. Calls on the European Ombudsman to pay particular attention to guaranteeing respect for the lin- guistic rights of European citizens, and to provide more ways of resolving EU language conflict situations; 25. Calls on the Commission to facilitate and promote access to information and funding for applicant bodies seeking to promote multilingualism through networks and/or projects funded by the Commission from 2007 onwards; * * * 26.

        "A. whereas the special incentive arrangements for vulnerable countries which meet objective criteria for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) involve granting preferential access to European markets for goods originating in developing countries that implement certain international standards in human and labour rights, environmental protection, the fight against drugs and good governance, B. whereas the criteria for obtaining tariff preferences under GSP+ include ratification and effective imple- mentation of core UN and ILO conventions as well as conventions related to the environment and governance principles, as listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 980/2005, C. whereas, in Decision 2005/924/EC, the Commission granted special incentive arrangements to Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Sri Lanka, Republic of Moldova, Mon- golia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, El Salvador and Venezuela, D. whereas the new GSP+ scheme should act as an incentive for beneficiary countries to attain develop- ment objectives, including the setting up of appropriate institutions to comply fully with the rights enshrined in the UN and ILO conventions, E. whereas the effectiveness of the implementation of the relevant UN and ILO conventions should be assessed on the basis of the conclusions of relevant monitoring bodies, including the annual ILO \u2018 Report of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations \u2019 , and with due regard to the opinion of the European Parliament, F. whereas, under Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 980/2005, safeguard clauses and temporary withdra- wals can be applied to countries that commit serious and systematic violations of the principles laid down in the international conventions listed in Part A of Annex III to the Regulation, 1. Notes the decision by the Commission to grant preferences under the GSP+ scheme to the countries listed in Decision 2005/924/EC; 2. Notes that the economic development and integration into the world trade system of GSP+ beneficiary countries is crucial to achieving sustainable development objectives, including stability and good govern- ance; 3. Calls on the Commission, in cooperation with GSP+ beneficiary countries, to strengthen its commit- ment to promoting and ensuring effective implementation in those countries of the core human and labour rights of UN and ILO conventions, as well as of the conventions related to the environment and governance principles; calls on the Commission to extend the commitment to respecting the ILO and UN rules also to GSP beneficiary countries, particularly as regards child and forced labour; believes that, as a general rule, granting preferential access to countries which do not respect human rights and international labour con- ventions tends to weaken the incentive for countries to comply with ILO standards; 4. Notes that, despite their ratification of the relevant ILO conventions, repeated infringements of work- ers' rights have been reported in several GSP+ beneficiary countries and that if these infringements are found to constitute serious and systematic violation of the ILO's core labour rights they could, as laid down in Article 16 of the Regulation, provide grounds for the temporary withdrawal of GSP+ preferences; 5. Calls on the Commission to strengthen its monitoring of the implementation of ILO conventions in GSP+ beneficiary countries, as well as of the conventions related to the environment and governance prin- ciples, and, in particular, to carry out its obligations under Article 18 of the Regulation, namely to inform the Generalised Preferences Committee of reported infringements of labour rights and to consult on whether an investigation should be carried out into the existence of serious and systematic violations of the ILO's core labour rights conventions, particularly as regards child and forced labour; 6. Stresses particularly the need to cooperate effectively in this field with the ILO and other relevant local bodies; requests the Commission to make recommendations to the governments of beneficiary countries 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/211 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "and to stress that their failure to demonstrate progress towards effective implementation should lead to the temporary withdrawal of GSP+ privileges; 7. Asks the Commission to keep Parliament regularly informed of the results of its monitoring of the implementation of the UN and ILO conventions and of the level of compliance by GSP+ beneficiary coun- tries, especially in the areas of freedom of association, collective bargaining, non-discrimination in employ- ment and the elimination of child and forced labour, and, in particular, to specify whether there are cases of serious and systematic violation of the principles laid down in human rights and international labour con- ventions and environmental agreements in any of the current GSP+ beneficiary countries; 8. Calls on the Commission to inform Parliament at an early stage of any recommendation for the temporary withdrawal of preferences in accordance with Article 16 of the Regulation; stresses that a Com- mission decision to apply a temporary withdrawal of preferences in the event of serious violations of principles laid down in the ILO conventions should be based on the findings of the appropriate monitoring institutions, and that due regard should be had to the opinion of the European Parliament; 9. Calls on the Commission to carry out a mid-term review of the GSP instrument; insists that an assessment of the effectiveness of implementation of the GSP+ requirements must be carried out before any renewal of GSP+ preferences is granted on the expiry of the current Regulation in 2008; calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure that Parliament's views on the extension of the GSP+ scheme to specific countries and on any renewal of the current Regulation in 2008 are taken into account; 10. Asks the Commission to produce a comprehensive, annual, country-by-country report not only detailing the situation in the beneficiary countries but also indicating the actions undertaken by the Commission; 11.

        "P6_TC2-COD(2004)0001 Position of the European Parliament adopted at second reading on 15 November 2006 with a view to the adoption of Directive 2006/ \u2026 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on services in the internal market THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first and third sentence of Article 47(2) and Article 55 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ), Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 3 ), Whereas: (1) The European Community is seeking to forge ever closer links between the States and peoples of Europe and to ensure economic and social progress. In accordance with Article 14(2) of the Treaty, the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of services is ensured. In accordance with Article 43 of the Treaty the freedom of establishment is ensured. Article 49 of the Treaty establishes the right to provide services within the Community. The elimination of barriers to the development of service activities between Member States is essen- tial in order to strengthen the integration of the peoples of Europe and to promote balanced and sustainable economic and social progress. In eliminating such barriers it is essential to ensure that the development of service activities contributes to the fulfilment of the task laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty of promoting throughout the Community a harmonious, balanced and sustainable develop- ment of economic activities, a high level of employment and of social protection, equality between men and women, sustainable and non-inflationary growth, a high degree of competitiveness and convergence of economic performance, a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, the raising of the standard of living and quality of life and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among Member States. (2) A competitive market in services is essential in order to promote economic growth and create jobs in the European Union. At present numerous barriers within the internal market prevent providers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), from extending their operations beyond their national borders and from taking full advantage of the internal market. This weakens the world- wide competitiveness of European Union providers. A free market which compels the Member States to eliminate restrictions on cross-border provision of services while at the same time increasing transparency and information for consumers would give consumers wider choice and better services at lower prices. (3) The report from the Commission on \u2018 The State of the Internal Market for Services \u2019 drew up an inventory of a large number of barriers which are preventing or slowing down the development of services between Member States, in particular those provided by SMEs, which are predominant in the field of services. The report concludes that a decade after the envisaged completion of the internal market, there is still a huge gap between the vision of an integrated European Union economy and the reality as experienced by European citizens and providers. The barriers affect a wide variety of service activities across all stages of the provider's activity and have a number of common features, including the fact that they often arise from administrative burdens, the legal uncertainty associated with cross-border activity and the lack of mutual trust between Member States. ( 1 ) OJ C 221, 8.9.2005, p. 113. ( 2 ) OJ C 43, 18.2.2005, p. 18. ( 3 ) Position of the European Parliament of 16 February 2006 (not yet published in the Official Journal), Council Com- mon Position of 24 July 2006 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and Position of the European Parliament of 15 November 2006 . 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/213 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "(4) Since services constitute the engine of economic growth and account for 70 % of GDP and employ- ment in most Member States, this fragmentation of the internal market has a negative impact on the entire European economy, in particular on the competitiveness of SMEs and the movement of work- ers, and prevents consumers from gaining access to a greater variety of competitively priced services. It is important to point out that the services sector is a key employment sector for women in particular, and that they therefore stand to benefit greatly from new opportunities offered by the completion of the internal market for services. The European Parliament and the Council have emphasised that the removal of legal barriers to the establishment of a genuine internal market is a matter of priority for achieving the goal set by the European Council in Lisbon of 23 and 24 March 2000 of improving employment and social cohesion and achieving sustainable economic growth so as to make the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, with more and better jobs. Removing those barriers, while ensuring an advanced European social model, is thus a basic condition for overcoming the difficulties encountered in imple- menting the Lisbon Strategy and for reviving the European economy, particularly in terms of employ- ment and investment. It is therefore important to achieve an internal market for services, with the right balance between market opening and preserving public services and social and consumer rights. (5) It is therefore necessary to remove barriers to the freedom of establishment for providers in Member States and barriers to the free movement of services as between Member States and to guarantee recipients and providers the legal certainty necessary for the exercise in practice of those two funda- mental freedoms of the Treaty. Since the barriers in the internal market for services affect operators who wish to become established in other Member States as well as those who provide a service in another Member State without being established there, it is necessary to enable providers to develop their service activities within the internal market either by becoming established in a Member State or by making use of the free movement of services. Providers should be able to choose between those two freedoms, depending on their strategy for growth in each Member State. (6) Those barriers cannot be removed solely by relying on direct application of Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty, since, on the one hand, addressing them on a case-by-case basis through infringement proce- dures against the Member States concerned would, especially following enlargement, be extremely complicated for national and Community institutions, and, on the other hand, the lifting of many barriers requires prior coordination of national legal schemes, including the setting up of adminis- trative cooperation. As the European Parliament and the Council have recognised, a Community legislative instrument makes it possible to achieve a genuine internal market for services. (7) This Directive establishes a general legal framework which benefits a wide variety of services while taking into account the distinctive features of each type of activity or profession and its system of regulation. That framework is based on a dynamic and selective approach consisting in the removal, as a matter of priority, of barriers which may be dismantled quickly and, for the others, the launching of a process of evaluation, consultation and complementary harmonisation of specific issues, which will make possible the progressive and coordinated modernisation of national regulatory systems for service activities which is vital in order to achieve a genuine internal market for services by 2010. Provision should be made for a balanced mix of measures involving targeted harmonisation, admin- istrative cooperation, the provision on the freedom to provide services and encouragement of the development of codes of conduct on certain issues. That coordination of national legislative regimes should ensure a high degree of Community legal integration and a high level of protection of general interest objectives, especially protection of consumers, which is vital in order to establish trust between Member States. This Directive also takes into account other general interest objectives, including the protection of the environment, public security and public health as well as the need to comply with labour law. (8) It is appropriate that the provisions of this Directive concerning the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services should apply only to the extent that the activities in question are open to competition, so that they do not oblige Member States either to liberalise services of general economic interest or to privatise public entities which provide such services or to abolish existing monopolies for other activities or certain distribution services. C 314 E/214 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "(9) This Directive applies only to requirements which affect the access to, or the exercise of, a service activity. Therefore, it does not apply to requirements, such as road traffic rules, rules concerning the development or use of land, town and country planning, building standards as well as administrative penalties imposed for non-compliance with such rules which do not specifically regulate or specifi- cally affect the service activity but have to be respected by providers in the course of carrying out their economic activity in the same way as by individuals acting in their private capacity. (10) This Directive does not concern requirements governing access to public funds for certain providers. Such requirements include notably those laying down conditions under which providers are entitled to receive public funding, including specific contractual conditions, and in particular quality standards which need to be observed as a condition for receiving public funds, for example for social services. (11) This Directive does not interfere with measures taken by Member States, in accordance with Com- munity law, in relation to the protection or promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity and media pluralism, including the funding thereof. This Directive does not prevent Member States from apply- ing their fundamental rules and principles relating to the freedom of press and freedom of expres- sion. This Directive does not affect Member State laws prohibiting discrimination on grounds of nationality or on grounds such as those set out in Article 13 of the Treaty. (12) This Directive aims at creating a legal framework to ensure the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services between the Member States and does not harmonise or prejudice criminal law. However, Member States should not be able to restrict the freedom to provide services by applying criminal law provisions which specifically affect the access to or the exercise of a service activity in circumvention of the rules laid down in this Directive. (13) It is equally important that this Directive fully respect Community initiatives based on Article 137 of the Treaty with a view to achieving the objectives of Article 136 thereof concerning the promotion of employment and improved living and working conditions. (14) This Directive does not affect terms and conditions of employment, including maximum work peri- ods and minimum rest periods, minimum paid annual holidays, minimum rates of pay as well as health, safety and hygiene at work, which Member States apply in compliance with Community law, nor does it affect relations between social partners, including the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements, the right to strike and to take industrial action in accordance with national law and practices which respect Community law, nor does it apply to services provided by temporary work agencies. This Directive does not affect Member States' social security legislation. (15) This Directive respects the exercise of fundamental rights applicable in the Member States and as recognised in the Charter of fundamental Rights of the European Union and the accompanying explanations, reconciling them with the fundamental freedoms laid down in Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty. Those fundamental rights include the right to take industrial action in accordance with national law and practices which respect Community law. (16) This Directive concerns only providers established in a Member State and does not cover external aspects. It does not concern negotiations within international organisations on trade in services, in particular in the framework of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). (17) This Directive covers only services which are performed for an economic consideration. Services of general interest are not covered by the definition in Article 50 of the Treaty and therefore do not fall within the scope of this Directive. Services of general economic interest are services that are performed for an economic consideration and therefore do fall within the scope of this Directive. However, certain services of general economic interest, such as those that may exist in the field of 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/215 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "transport, are excluded from the scope of this Directive and certain other services of general eco- nomic interest, for example, those that may exist in the area of postal services, are the subject of a derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services set out in this Directive. This Directive does not deal with the funding of services of general economic interest and does not apply to systems of aids granted by Member States, in particular in the social field, in accordance with Community rules on competition. This Directive does not deal with the follow-up to the Commission White Paper on Services of General Interest. (18) Financial services should be excluded from the scope of this Directive since these activities are the subject of specific Community legislation aimed, as is this Directive, at achieving a genuine internal market for services. Consequently, this exclusion should cover all financial services such as banking, credit, insurance, including reinsurance, occupational or personal pensions, securities, investment funds, payments and investment advice, including the services listed in Annex I to Directive 2006/ 48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions ( 1 ). (19) In view of the adoption in 2002 of a package of legislative instruments relating to electronic com- munications networks and services, as well as to associated resources and services, which has estab- lished a regulatory framework facilitating access to those activities within the internal market, notably through the elimination of most individual authorisation schemes, it is necessary to exclude issues dealt with by those instruments from the scope of this Directive. (20) The exclusion from the scope of this Directive as regards matters of electronic communications services as covered by Directives 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and asso- ciated facilities (Access Directive) ( 2 ), 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisa- tion Directive) ( 3 ), 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) ( 4 ), 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on uni- versal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) ( 5 ) and 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic commu- nications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) ( 6 ) should apply not only to questions specifically dealt with in these Directives but also to matters for which the Directives explicitly leave to Member States the possibility of adopting certain measures at national level. (21) Transport services, including urban transport, taxis and ambulances as well as port services, should be excluded from the scope of this Directive. (22) The exclusion of healthcare from the scope of this Directive should cover healthcare and pharmaceu- tical services provided by health professionals to patients to assess, maintain or restore their state of health where those activities are reserved to a regulated health profession in the Member State in which the services are provided. (23) This Directive does not affect the reimbursement of healthcare provided in a Member State other than that in which the recipient of the care is resident. This issue has been addressed by the Court of Justice on numerous occasions, and the Court has recognised patients' rights. It is important to address this issue in another Community legal instrument in order to achieve greater legal certainty and clarity to the extent that this issue is not already addressed in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community ( 7 ).

        "(24) Audiovisual services, whatever their mode of transmission, including within cinemas, should also be excluded from the scope of this Directive. Furthermore, this Directive should not apply to aids granted by Member States in the audiovisual sector which are covered by Community rules on com- petition. (25) Gambling activities, including lottery and betting transactions, should be excluded from the scope of this Directive in view of the specific nature of these activities, which entail implementation by Mem- ber States of policies relating to public policy and consumer protection. (26) This Directive is without prejudice to the application of Article 45 of the Treaty. (27) This Directive should not cover those social services in the areas of housing, childcare and support to families and persons in need which are provided by the State at national, regional or local level by providers mandated by the State or by charities recognised as such by the State with the objective of ensuring support for those who are permanently or temporarily in a particular state of need because of their insufficient family income or total or partial lack of independence and for those who risk being marginalised. These services are essential in order to guarantee the fundamental right to human dignity and integrity and are a manifestation of the principles of social cohesion and solidarity and should not be affected by this Directive. (28) This Directive does not deal with the funding of, or the system of aids linked to, social services. Nor does it affect the criteria or conditions set by Member States to ensure that social services effectively carry out a function to the benefit of the public interest and social cohesion. In addition, this Direc- tive should not affect the principle of universal service in Member States' social services. (29) Given that the Treaty provides specific legal bases for taxation matters and given the Community instruments already adopted in that field, it is necessary to exclude the field of taxation from the scope of this Directive. (30) There is already a considerable body of Community law on service activities. This Directive builds on, and thus complements, the Community acquis. Conflicts between this Directive and other Commun- ity instruments have been identified and are addressed by this Directive, including by means of derogations. However, it is necessary to provide a rule for any residual and exceptional cases where there is a conflict between a provision of this Directive and a provision of another Community instrument. The existence of such a conflict should be determined in compliance with the rules of the Treaty on the right of establishment and the free movement of services. (31) This Directive is consistent with and does not affect Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parlia- ment and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications ( 1 ). It deals with questions other than those relating to professional qualifications, for example professional liability insurance, commercial communications, multidisciplinary activities and administrative simpli- fication. With regard to temporary cross-border service provision, a derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services in this Directive ensures that Title II on the free provision of services of Directive 2005/36/EC is not affected. Therefore, none of the measures applicable under that Directive in the Member State where the service is provided is affected by the provision on the free- dom to provide services. (32) This Directive is consistent with Community legislation on consumer protection, such as Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive) ( 2 ) and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation) ( 3 ).

        "(33) The services covered by this Directive concern a wide variety of ever-changing activities, including business services such as management consultancy, certification and testing; facilities management, including office maintenance; advertising; recruitment services; and the services of commercial agents. The services covered are also services provided both to businesses and to consumers, such as legal or fiscal advice; real estate services such as estate agencies; construction, including the services of archi- tects; distributive trades; the organisation of trade fairs; car rental; and travel agencies. Consumer services are also covered, such as those in the field of tourism, including tour guides; leisure services, sports centres and amusement parks; and, to the extent that they are not excluded from the scope of application of the Directive, household support services, such as help for the elderly. Those activities may involve services requiring the proximity of provider and recipient, services requiring travel by the recipient or the provider and services which may be provided at a distance, including via the Internet. (34) According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the assessment of whether certain activities, in particular activities which are publicly funded or provided by public entities, constitute a \u2018 service \u2019 has to be carried out on a case by case basis in the light of all their characteristics, in particular the way they are provided, organised and financed in the Member State concerned. The Court of Justice has held that the essential characteristic of remuneration lies in the fact that it constitutes considera- tion for the services in question and has recognised that the characteristic of remuneration is absent in the case of activities performed, for no consideration, by the State or on behalf of the State in the context of its duties in the social, cultural, educational and judicial fields, such as courses provided under the national education system, or the management of social security schemes which do not engage in economic activity. The payment of a fee by recipients, for example, a tuition or enrolment fee paid by students in order to make a certain contribution to the operating expenses of a system, does not in itself constitute remuneration because the service is still essentially financed by public funds. These activities are, therefore, not covered by the definition of service in Article 50 of the Treaty and do not therefore fall within the scope of this Directive. (35) Non-profit making amateur sporting activities are of considerable social importance. They often pur- sue wholly social or recreational objectives. Thus, they might not constitute economic activities within the meaning of Community law and should fall outside the scope of this Directive. (36) The concept of \u2018 provider \u2019 should cover any natural person who is a national of a Member State or any legal person engaged in a service activity in a Member State, in exercise either of the freedom of establishment or of the free movement of services. The concept of provider should thus not be limited solely to cross-border service provision within the framework of the free movement of ser- vices but should also cover cases in which an operator establishes itself in a Member State in order to develop its service activities there. On the other hand, the concept of a provider should not cover the case of branches in a Member State of companies from third countries because, under Article 48 of the Treaty, the freedom of establishment and free movement of services may benefit only companies constituted in accordance with the laws of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the Community. The concept of \u2018 recipient \u2019 should also cover third country nationals who already benefit from rights conferred upon them by Com- munity acts such as Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, Council Directive 2003/109/EC of 25 November 2003 concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents ( 1 ), Council Regulation (EC) No 859/2003 of 14 May 2003 extending the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 to nationals of third countries who are not already covered by those provisions solely on the ground of their nationality ( 2 ) and Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States ( 3 ). Furthermore, Member States may extend the concept of recipient to other third country nationals that are present within their territory. ( 1 ) OJ L 16, 23.1.2004, p. 44. ( 2 ) OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 1. ( 3 ) OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 77. C 314 E/218 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "(37) The place at which a provider is established should be determined in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice according to which the concept of establishment involves the actual pursuit of an economic activity through a fixed establishment for an indefinite period. This requirement may also be fulfilled where a company is constituted for a given period or where it rents the building or installation through which it pursues its activity. It may also be fulfilled where a Member State grants authorisations for a limited duration only in relation to particular services. An establishment does not need to take the form of a subsidiary, branch or agency, but may consist of an office managed by a provider's own staff or by a person who is independent but authorised to act on a permanent basis for the undertaking, as would be the case with an agency. According to this definition, which requires the actual pursuit of an economic activity at the place of establishment of the provider, a mere letter box does not constitute an establishment. Where a provider has several places of establishment, it is important to determine the place of establishment from which the actual service concerned is pro- vided. Where it is difficult to determine from which of several places of establishment a given service is provided, the location of the provider's centre of activities relating to this particular service should be that place of establishment. (38) The concept of \u2018 legal persons \u2019 , according to the Treaty provisions on establishment, leaves operators free to choose the legal form which they deem suitable for carrying out their activity. Accordingly, \u2018 legal persons \u2019 , within the meaning of the Treaty, means all entities constituted under, or governed by, the law of a Member State, irrespective of their legal form. (39) The concept of \u2018 authorisation scheme \u2019 should cover, inter alia, the administrative procedures for granting authorisations, licences, approvals or concessions, and also the obligation, in order to be eligible to exercise the activity, to be registered as a member of a profession or entered in a register, roll or database, to be officially appointed to a body or to obtain a card attesting to membership of a particular profession. Authorisation may be granted not only by a formal decision but also by an implicit decision arising, for example, from the silence of the competent authority or from the fact that the interested party must await acknowledgement of receipt of a declaration in order to com- mence the activity in question or for the latter to become lawful. (40) The concept of \u2018 overriding reasons relating to the public interest \u2019 to which reference is made in certain provisions of this Directive has been developed by the Court of Justice in its case law in relation to Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty and may continue to evolve. The notion as recognised in the case law of the Court of Justice covers at least the following grounds: public policy, public security and public health, within the meaning of Articles 46 and 55 of the Treaty; the maintenance of order in society; social policy objectives; the protection of the recipients of services; consumer protection; the protection of workers, including the social protection of workers; animal welfare; the preservation of the financial balance of the social security system; the prevention of fraud; the pre- vention of unfair competition; the protection of the environment and the urban environment, includ- ing town and country planning; the protection of creditors; safeguarding the sound administration of justice; road safety; the protection of intellectual property; cultural policy objectives, including safe- guarding the freedom of expression of various elements, in particular social, cultural, religious and philosophical values of society; the need to ensure a high level of education, the maintenance of press diversity and the promotion of the national language; the preservation of national historical and artistic heritage; and veterinary policy. (41) The concept of \u2018 public policy \u2019 , as interpreted by the Court of Justice, covers the protection against a genuine and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society and may include, in particular, issues relating to human dignity, the protection of minors and vulnerable adults and animal welfare. Similarly, the concept of public security includes issues of public safety. (42) The rules relating to administrative procedures should not aim at harmonising administrative proce- dures but at removing overly burdensome authorisation schemes, procedures and formalities that hinder the freedom of establishment and the creation of new service undertakings therefrom. (43) One of the fundamental difficulties faced, in particular by SMEs, in accessing service activities and exercising them is the complexity, length and legal uncertainty of administrative procedures. For this reason, following the example of certain modernising and good administrative practice initiatives 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/219 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "undertaken at Community and national level, it is necessary to establish principles of administrative simplification, inter alia through the limitation of the obligation of prior authorisation to cases in which it is essential and the introduction of the principle of tacit authorisation by the competent authorities after a certain period of time elapsed. Such modernising action, while maintaining the requirements on transparency and the updating of information relating to operators, is intended to eliminate the delays, costs and dissuasive effects which arise, for example, from unnecessary or exces- sively complex and burdensome procedures, the duplication of procedures, the \u2018 red tape \u2019 involved in submitting documents, the arbitrary use of powers by the competent authorities, indeterminate or excessively long periods before a response is given, the limited duration of validity of authorisations granted and disproportionate fees and penalties. Such practices have particularly significant dissuasive effects on providers wishing to develop their activities in other Member States and require coordi- nated modernisation within an enlarged internal market of twenty-five Member States. (44) Member States should introduce, where appropriate, forms harmonised at Community level, as estab- lished by the Commission, which will serve as an equivalent to certificates, attestations or any other document in relation to establishment. (45) In order to examine the need for simplifying procedures and formalities, Member States should be able, in particular, to take into account their necessity, number, possible duplication, cost, clarity and accessibility, as well as the delay and practical difficulties to which they could give rise for the provi- der concerned. (46) In order to facilitate access to service activities and the exercise thereof in the internal market, it is necessary to establish an objective, common to all Member States, of administrative simplification and to lay down provisions concerning, inter alia, the right to information, procedures by electronic means and the establishment of a framework for authorisation schemes. Other measures adopted at national level to meet that objective could involve reduction of the number of procedures and form- alities applicable to service activities and the restriction of such procedures and formalities to those which are essential in order to achieve a general interest objective and which do not duplicate each other in terms of content or purpose. (47) With the aim of administrative simplification, general formal requirements, such as presentation of original documents, certified copies or a certified translation, should not be imposed, except where objectively justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest, such as the protection of workers, public health, the protection of the environment or the protection of consumers. It is also necessary to ensure that an authorisation as a general rule permits access to, or exercise of, a service activity throughout the national territory, unless a new authorisation for each establishment, for example for each new hypermarket, or an authorisation that is restricted to a specific part of the national territory is objectively justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest. (48) In order to further simplify administrative procedures, it is appropriate to ensure that each provider has a single point through which he can complete all procedures and formalities (hereinafter referred to as \u2018 points of single contact \u2019 ). The number of points of single contact per Member State may vary according to regional or local competencies or according to the activities concerned. The creation of points of single contact should not interfere with the allocation of functions among competent authorities within each national system. Where several authorities at regional or local level are com- petent, one of them may assume the role of point of single contact and coordinator. Points of single contact may be set up not only by administrative authorities but also by chambers of commerce or crafts, or by the professional organisations or private bodies to which a Member State decides to entrust that function. Points of single contact have an important role to play in providing assistance to providers either as the authority directly competent to issue the documents necessary to access a service activity or as an intermediary between the provider and the authorities which are directly competent. (49) The fee which may be charged by points of single contact should be proportionate to the cost of the procedures and formalities with which they deal. This should not prevent Member States from entrusting the points of single contact with the collection of other administrative fees, such as the fee of supervisory bodies. C 314 E/220 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "(50) It is necessary for providers and recipients of services to have easy access to certain types of informa- tion It should be for each Member State to determine, within the framework of this Directive, the way in which providers and recipients are provided with information. In particular, the obligation on Member States to ensure that relevant information is easily accessible to providers and recipients and that it can be accessed by the public without obstacle could be fulfilled by making this information accessible through a website. Any information given should be provided in a clear and unambiguous manner. (51) The information provided to providers and recipients of services should include, in particular, infor- mation on procedures and formalities, contact details of the competent authorities, conditions for access to public registers and data bases and information concerning available remedies and the contact details of associations and organisations from which providers or recipients can obtain prac- tical assistance. The obligation on competent authorities to assist providers and recipients should not include the provision of legal advice in individual cases. Nevertheless, general information on the way in which requirements are usually interpreted or applied should be given. Issues such as liability for providing incorrect or misleading information should be determined by Member States. (52) The setting up, in the reasonably near future, of electronic means of completing procedures and formalities will be vital for administrative simplification in the field of service activities, for the ben- efit of providers, recipients and competent authorities. In order to meet that obligation as to results, national laws and other rules applicable to services may need to be adapted. This obligation should not prevent Member States from providing other means of completing such procedures and formal- ities, in addition to electronic means. The fact that it must be possible to complete those procedures and formalities at a distance means, in particular, that Member States must ensure that they may be completed across borders. The obligation as to results does not cover procedures or formalities which by their very nature are impossible to complete at a distance. Furthermore, this does not interfere with Member States' legislation on the use of languages. (53) The granting of licences for certain service activities may require an interview with the applicant by the competent authority in order to assess the applicant's personal integrity and suitability for carry- ing out the service in question. In such cases, the completion of formalities by electronic means may not be appropriate. (54) The possibility of gaining access to a service activity should be made subject to authorisation by the competent authorities only if that decision satisfies the criteria of non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality. That means, in particular, that authorisation schemes should be permissible only where an a posteriori inspection would not be effective because of the impossibility of ascertaining the defects of the services concerned a posteriori, due account being taken of the risks and dangers which could arise in the absence of a prior inspection. However, the provision to that effect made by this Directive cannot be relied upon in order to justify authorisation schemes which are prohibited by other Community instruments such as Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures ( 1 ), or Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the internal market (Directive on electronic commerce) ( 2 ). The results of the process of mutual evaluation will make it possible to determine, at Community level, the types of activity for which authorisation schemes should be eliminated. (55) This Directive should be without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to withdraw author- isations after they have been issued, if the conditions for the granting of the authorisation are no longer fulfilled. (56) According to the case law of the Court of Justice, public health, consumer protection, animal health and the protection of the urban environment constitute overriding reasons relating to the public interest. Such overriding reasons may justify the application of authorisation schemes and other restrictions. However, no such authorisation scheme or restriction should discriminate on grounds of nationality. Further, the principles of necessity and proportionality should always be respected. ( 1 ) OJ L 13, 19.1.2000, p. 12. ( 2 ) OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1. 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/221 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "(57) The provisions of this Directive relating to authorisation schemes should concern cases where the access to or exercise of a service activity by operators requires a decision by a competent authority. This concerns neither decisions by competent authorities to set up a public or private entity for the provision of a particular service nor the conclusion of contracts by competent authorities for the provision of a particular service which is governed by rules on public procurement, since this Directive does not deal with rules on public procurement. (58) In order to facilitate access to and exercise of service activities, it is important to evaluate and report on authorisation schemes and their justification. This reporting obligation concerns only the existence of authorisation schemes and not the criteria and conditions for the granting of an author- isation. (59) The authorisation should as a general rule enable the provider to have access to the service activity, or to exercise that activity, throughout the national territory, unless a territorial limit is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest. For example, environmental protection may justify the requirement to obtain an individual authorisation for each installation on the national territory. This provision should not affect regional or local competences for the granting of authorisations within the Member States. (60) This Directive, and in particular the provisions concerning authorisation schemes and the territorial scope of an authorisation, should not interfere with the division of regional or local competences within the Member States, including regional and local self-government and the use of official languages. (61) The provision relating to the non-duplication of conditions for the granting of an authorisation should not prevent Member States from applying their own conditions as specified in the authorisa- tion scheme. It should only require that competent authorities, when considering whether these con- ditions are met by the applicant, take into account the equivalent conditions which have already been satisfied by the applicant in another Member State. This provision should not require the application of the conditions for the granting of an authorisation provided for in the authorisation scheme of another Member State. (62) Where the number of authorisations available for an activity is limited because of scarcity of natural resources or technical capacity, a procedure for selection from among several potential candidates should be adopted with the aim of developing through open competition the quality and conditions for supply of services available to users. Such a procedure should provide guarantees of transparency and impartiality and the authorisation thus granted should not have an excessive duration, be subject to automatic renewal or confer any advantage on the provider whose authorisation has just expired. In particular, the duration of the authorisation granted should be fixed in such a way that it does not restrict or limit free competition beyond what is necessary in order to enable the provider to recoup the cost of investment and to make a fair return on the capital invested. This provision should not prevent Member States from limiting the number of authorisations for reasons other than scarcity of natural resources or technical capacity. These authorisations should remain in any case subject to the other provisions of this Directive relating to authorisation schemes. (63) In the absence of different arrangements, failing a response within a time period, an authorisation should be deemed to have been granted. However, different arrangements may be put in place in respect of certain activities, where objectively justified by overriding reasons relating to the public interest, including a legitimate interest of third parties. Such different arrangements could include national rules according to which, in the absence of a response of the competent authority, the application is deemed to have been rejected, this rejection being open to challenge before the courts. (64) In order to establish a genuine internal market for services, it is necessary to abolish any restrictions on the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services which are still enshrined in the laws of certain Member States and which are incompatible with Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty respectively. The restrictions to be prohibited particularly affect the internal market for services and should be systematically dismantled as soon as possible. C 314 E/222 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "(65) Freedom of establishment is predicated, in particular, upon the principle of equal treatment, which entails the prohibition not only of any discrimination on grounds of nationality but also of any indirect discrimination based on other grounds but capable of producing the same result. Thus, access to a service activity or the exercise thereof in a Member State, either as a principal or second- ary activity, should not be made subject to criteria such as place of establishment, residence, domicile or principal provision of the service activity. However, these criteria should not include requirements according to which a provider or one of his employees or a representative must be present during the exercise of the activity when this is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest. Furthermore, a Member State should not restrict the legal capacity or the right of companies, incor- porated in accordance with the law of another Member State on whose territory they have their primary establishment, to bring legal proceedings. Moreover, a Member State should not be able to confer any advantages on providers having a particular national or local socio-economic link; nor should it be able to restrict, on grounds of place of establishment, the provider's freedom to acquire, exploit or dispose of rights and goods or to access different forms of credit or accommodation in so far as those choices are useful for access to his activity or for the effective exercise thereof. (66) Access to or the exercise of a service activity in the territory of a Member State should not be subject to an economic test. The prohibition of economic tests as a prerequisite for the grant of authorisation should cover economic tests as such, but not requirements which are objectively justified by over- riding reasons relating to the public interest, such as the protection of the urban environment, social policy or public health. The prohibition should not affect the exercise of the powers of the authorities responsible for applying competition law. (67) With respect to financial guarantees or insurance, the prohibition of requirements should concern only the obligation that the requested financial guarantees or insurance must be obtained from a financial institution established in the Member State concerned. (68) With respect to pre-registration, the prohibition of requirements should concern only the obligation that the provider, prior to the establishment, be pre-registered for a given period in a register held in the Member State concerned. (69) In order to coordinate the modernisation of national rules and regulations in a manner consistent with the requirements of the internal market, it is necessary to evaluate certain non-discriminatory national requirements which, by their very nature, could severely restrict or even prevent access to an activity or the exercise thereof under the freedom of establishment. This evaluation process should be limited to the compatibility of these requirements with the criteria already established by the Court of Justice on the freedom of establishment. It should not concern the application of Community com- petition law. Where such requirements are discriminatory or not objectively justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest, or where they are disproportionate, they must be abolished or amended. The outcome of this assessment will be different according to the nature of the activity and the public interest concerned. In particular, such requirements could be fully justified when they pursue social policy objectives. (70) For the purposes of this Directive, and without prejudice to Article 16 of the Treaty, services may be considered to be services of general economic interest only if they are provided in application of a special task in the public interest entrusted to the provider by the Member State concerned. This assignment should be made by way of one or more acts, the form of which is determined by the Member State concerned, and should specify the precise nature of the special task. (71) The mutual evaluation process provided for in this Directive should not affect the freedom of Mem- ber States to set in their legislation a high level of protection of the public interest, in particular in relation to social policy objectives. Furthermore, it is necessary that the mutual evaluation process take fully into account the specificity of services of general economic interest and of the particular tasks assigned to them. This may justify certain restrictions on the freedom of establishment, in particular where such restrictions pursue the protection of public health and social policy objectives and where they satisfy the conditions set out in Article 15(3)(a), (b) and (c). For example, with regard to the obligation to take a specific legal form in order to exercise certain services in the social field, the Court of Justice has already recognised that it may be justified to subject the provider to a requirement to be non-profit making. 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/223 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "(72) Services of a general economic interest are entrusted with important tasks relating to social and territorial cohesion. The performance of these tasks should not be obstructed as a result of the evaluation process provided for in this Directive. Requirements which are necessary for the fulfilment of such tasks should not be affected by this process while, at the same time, unjustified restrictions on the freedom of establishment should be addressed. (73) The requirements to be examined include national rules which, on grounds other than those relating to professional qualifications, reserve access to certain activities to particular providers. These require- ments also include obligations on a provider to take a specific legal form, in particular to be a legal person, to be a company with individual ownership, to be a non-profit making organisation or a company owned exclusively by natural persons, and requirements which relate to the shareholding of a company, in particular obligations to hold a minimum amount of capital for certain service activ- ities or to have a specific qualification in order to hold share capital in or to manage certain com- panies. The evaluation of the compatibility of fixed minimum and/or maximum tariffs with the free- dom of establishment concerns only tariffs imposed by competent authorities specifically for the provision of certain services and not, for example, general rules on price determination, such as for the renting of houses. (74) The mutual evaluation process means that during the transposition period Member States will first have to conduct a screening of their legislation in order to ascertain whether any of the above mentioned requirements exists in their legal systems. At the latest by the end of the transposition period, Member States should draw up a report on the results of this screening. Each report will be submitted to all other Member States and interested parties. Member States will then have six months in which to submit their observations on these reports. At the latest by one year after the date of transposition of this Directive, the Commission should draw up a summary report, accompanied where appropriate by proposals for further initiatives. If necessary the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, could assist them to design a common method. (75) The fact that this Directive specifies a number of requirements to be abolished or evaluated by the Member States during the transposition period is without prejudice to any infringement proceedings against a Member State for failure to fulfil its obligations under Articles 43 or 49 of the Treaty. (76) This Directive does not concern the application of Articles 28 to 30 of the Treaty relating to the free movement of goods. The restrictions prohibited pursuant to the provision on the freedom to provide services cover the requirements applicable to access to service activities or to the exercise thereof and not those applicable to goods as such. (77) Where an operator travels to another Member State to exercise a service activity there, a distinction should be made between situations covered by the freedom of establishment and those covered, due to the temporary nature of the activities concerned, by the free movement of services. As regards the distinction between the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, according to the case law of the Court of Justice the key element is whether or not the operator is established in the Member State where it provides the service concerned. If the operator is established in the Mem- ber State where it provides its services, it should come under the scope of application of the freedom of establishment. If, by contrast, the operator is not established in the Member State where the service is provided, its activities should be covered by the free movement of services. The Court of Justice has consistently held that the temporary nature of the activities in question should be determined in the light not only of the duration of the provision of the service, but also of its regularity, periodical nature or continuity. The fact that the activity is temporary should not mean that the provider may not equip itself with some forms of infrastructure in the Member State where the service is provided, such as an office, chambers or consulting rooms, in so far as such infrastructure is necessary for the purposes of providing the service in question. (78) In order to secure effective implementation of the free movement of services and to ensure that recipients and providers can benefit from and supply services throughout the Community regardless of borders, it is necessary to clarify the extent to which requirements of the Member State where the service is provided can be imposed. It is indispensable to provide that the provision on the freedom to provide services does not prevent the Member State where the service is provided from imposing, in compliance with the principles set out in Article 16(1)(a) to (c), its specific requirements for rea- sons of public policy or public security or for the protection of public health or the environment. C 314 E/224 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "(79) The Court of Justice has consistently held that Member States retain the right to take measures in order to prevent providers from abusively taking advantage of the internal market principles. Abuse by a provider should be established on a case by case basis. (80) It is necessary to ensure that providers are able to take equipment which is integral to the provision of their service with them when they travel to provide services in another Member State. In particu- lar, it is important to avoid cases in which the service could not be provided without the equipment or situations in which providers incur additional costs, for example, by hiring or purchasing different equipment to that which they habitually use or by needing to deviate significantly from the way they habitually carry out their activity. (81) The concept of equipment does not refer to physical objects which are either supplied by the provi- der to the client or become part of a physical object as a result of the service activity, such as building materials or spare parts, or which are consumed or left in situ in the course of the service provision, such as combustible fuels, explosives, fireworks, pesticides, poisons or medicines. (82) The provisions of this Directive should not preclude the application by a Member State of rules on employment conditions. Rules laid down by law, regulation or administrative provisions should, in accordance with the Treaty, be justified for reasons relating to the protection of workers and be non- discriminatory, necessary, and proportionate, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, and comply with other relevant Community law. (83) It is necessary to ensure that the provision on the freedom to provide services may be departed from only in the areas covered by derogations. Those derogations are necessary in order to take into account the level of integration of the internal market or certain Community instruments relating to services pursuant to which a provider is subject to the application of a law other than that of the Member State of establishment. Moreover, by way of exception, measures against a given provider should also be adopted in certain individual cases and under certain strict procedural and substantive conditions. In addition, any restriction of the free movement of services should be permitted, by way of exception, only if it is consistent with fundamental rights which form an integral part of the general principles of law enshrined in the Community legal order. (84) The derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services concerning postal services should cover both activities reserved to the universal service provider and other postal services. (85) The derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services relating to the judicial recovery of debts and the reference to a possible future harmonisation instrument should concern only the access to and the exercise of activities which consist, notably, in bringing actions before a court relating to the recovery of debts. (86) This Directive should not affect terms and conditions of employment which, pursuant to Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services ( 1 ), apply to workers posted to provide a service in the territory of another Member State. In such cases, Directive 96/71/EC stipu- lates that providers have to comply with terms and conditions of employment in a listed number of areas applicable in the Member State where the service is provided. These are: maximum work peri- ods and minimum rest periods, minimum paid annual holidays, minimum rates of pay, including overtime rates, the conditions of hiring out of workers, in particular the protection of workers hired out by temporary employment undertakings, health, safety and hygiene at work, protective measures with regard to the terms and conditions of employment of pregnant women or women who have recently given birth and of children and young people and equality of treatment between men and women and other provisions on non-discrimination. This not only concerns terms and conditions of employment which are laid down by law but also those laid down in collective agree- ments or arbitration awards that are officially declared or de facto universally applicable within the meaning of Directive 96/71/EC. Moreover, this Directive should not prevent Member States from applying terms and conditions of employment on matters other than those listed in Article 3(1) of Directive 96/71/EC on the grounds of public policy. ( 1 ) OJ L 18, 21.1.1997, p. 1. 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/225 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "(87) Neither should this Directive affect terms and conditions of employment in cases where the worker employed for the provision of a cross-border service is recruited in the Member State where the service is provided. Furthermore, this Directive should not affect the right for the Member State where the service is provided to determine the existence of an employment relationship and the distinction between self-employed persons and employed persons, including \u2018 false self-employed per- sons \u2019 . In that respect the essential characteristic of an employment relationship within the meaning of Article 39 of the Treaty should be the fact that for a certain period of time a person provides services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration. Any activity which a person performs outside a relationship of subordination must be classified as an activity pursued in a self-employed capacity for the purposes of Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty. (88) The provision on the freedom to provide services should not apply in cases where, in conformity with Community law, an activity is reserved in a Member State to a particular profession, for example requirements which reserve the provision of legal advice to lawyers. (89) The derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services concerning matters relating to the registration of vehicles leased in a Member State other than that in which they are used follows from the case law of the Court of Justice, which has recognised that a Member State may impose such an obligation, in accordance with proportionate conditions, in the case of vehicles used on its territory. That exclusion does not cover occasional or temporary rental. (90) Contractual relations between the provider and the client as well as between an employer and employee should not be subject to this Directive. The applicable law regarding the contractual or non contractual obligations of the provider should be determined by the rules of private international law. (91) It is necessary to afford Member States the possibility, exceptionally and on a case-by-case basis, of taking measures which derogate from the provision on the freedom to provide services in respect of a provider established in another Member State on grounds of the safety of services. However, it should be possible to take such measures only in the absence of harmonisation at Community level. (92) Restrictions on the free movement of services, contrary to this Directive, may arise not only from measures applied to providers, but also from the many barriers to the use of services by recipients, especially consumers. This Directive mentions, by way of illustration, certain types of restriction applied to a recipient wishing to use a service performed by a provider established in another Mem- ber State. This also includes cases where recipients of a service are under an obligation to obtain authorisation from or to make a declaration to their competent authorities in order to receive a service from a provider established in another Member State. This does not concern general author- isation schemes which also apply to the use of a service supplied by a provider established in the same Member State. (93) The concept of financial assistance provided for the use of a particular service should not apply to systems of aids granted by Member States, in particular in the social field or in the cultural sector, which are covered by Community rules on competition, nor to general financial assistance not linked to the use of a particular service, for example grants or loans to students. (94) In accordance with the Treaty rules on the free movement of services, discrimination on grounds of the nationality of the recipient or national or local residence is prohibited. Such discrimination could take the form of an obligation, imposed only on nationals of another Member State, to supply original documents, certified copies, a certificate of nationality or official translations of documents in order to benefit from a service or from more advantageous terms or prices. However, the prohibi- tion of discriminatory requirements should not preclude the reservation of advantages, especially as regards tariffs, to certain recipients, if such reservation is based on legitimate and objective criteria. (95) The principle of non-discrimination within the internal market means that access by a recipient, and especially by a consumer, to a service on offer to the public may not be denied or restricted by application of a criterion, included in general conditions made available to the public, relating to the recipient's nationality or place of residence. It does not follow that it will be unlawful discrimina- tion if provision were made in such general conditions for different tariffs and conditions to apply to C 314 E/226 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "the provision of a service, where those tariffs, prices and conditions are justified for objective reasons that can vary from country to country, such as additional costs incurred because of the distance involved or the technical characteristics of the provision of the service, or different market conditions, such as higher or lower demand influenced by seasonality, different vacation periods in the Member States and pricing by different competitors, or extra risks linked to rules differing from those of the Member State of establishment. Neither does it follow that the non-provision of a service to a con- sumer for lack of the required intellectual property rights in a particular territory would constitute unlawful discrimination. (96) It is appropriate to provide that, as one of the means by which the provider may make the informa- tion which he is obliged to supply easily accessible to the recipient, he supply his electronic address, including that of his website. Furthermore, the obligation to make available certain information in the provider's information documents which present his services in detail should not cover commercial communications of a general nature, such as advertising, but rather documents giving a detailed description of the services proposed, including documents on a website. (97) It is necessary to provide in this Directive for certain rules on high quality of services, ensuring in particular information and transparency requirements. These rules should apply both in cases of cross border provision of services between Member States and in cases of services provided in a Member State by a provider established there, without imposing unnecessary burdens on SMEs. They should not in any way prevent Member States from applying, in conformity with this Directive and other Community law, additional or different quality requirements. (98) Any operator providing services involving a direct and particular health, safety or financial risk for the recipient or a third person should, in principle, be covered by appropriate professional liability insurance, or by another form of guarantee which is equivalent or comparable, which means, in particular, that such an operator should as a general rule have adequate insurance cover for services provided in one or more Member States other than the Member State of establishment. (99) The insurance or guarantee should be appropriate to the nature and extent of the risk. Therefore it should be necessary for the provider to have cross-border cover only if that provider actually pro- vides services in other Member States. Member States should not lay down more detailed rules con- cerning the insurance cover and fix for example minimum thresholds for the insured sum or limits on exclusions from the insurance cover. Providers and insurance companies should maintain the necessary flexibility to negotiate insurance policies precisely targeted to the nature and extent of the risk. Furthermore, it is not necessary for an obligation of appropriate insurance to be laid down by law. It should be sufficient if an insurance obligation is part of the ethical rules laid down by profes- sional bodies. Finally, there should be no obligation for insurance companies to provide insurance cover. (100) It is necessary to put an end to total prohibitions on commercial communications by the regulated professions, not by removing bans on the content of a commercial communication but rather by removing those bans which, in a general way and for a given profession, forbid one or more forms of commercial communication, such as a ban on all advertising in one or more given media. As regards the content and methods of commercial communication, it is necessary to encourage professionals to draw up, in accordance with Community law, codes of conduct at Community level. (101) It is necessary and in the interest of recipients, in particular consumers, to ensure that it is possible for providers to offer multidisciplinary services and that restrictions in this regard be limited to what is necessary to ensure the impartiality, independence and integrity of the regulated professions. This does not affect restrictions or prohibitions on carrying out particular activities which aim at ensuring independence in cases in which a Member State entrusts a provider with a particular task, notably in the area of urban development, nor should it affect the application of competition rules. (102) In order to increase transparency and promote assessments based on comparable criteria with regard to the quality of the services offered and supplied to recipients, it is important that information on the meaning of quality labels and other distinctive marks relating to these services be easily accessi- 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/227 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "ble. That obligation of transparency is particularly important in areas such as tourism, especially the hotel business, in which the use of a system of classification is widespread. Moreover, it is appropriate to examine the extent to which European standardisation could facilitate compatibility and quality of services. European standards are drawn up by the European standards-setting bodies, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (Cenelec) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Where appropriate, the Commission may, in accordance with the procedures laid down in Directive 98/34/EC of the Euro- pean Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services ( 1 ), issue a mandate for the drawing up of specific European standards. (103) In order to solve potential problems with compliance with judicial decisions, it is appropriate to provide that Member States recognise equivalent guarantees lodged with institutions or bodies such as banks, insurance providers or other financial services providers established in another Member State. (104) The development of a network of Member States' consumer protection authorities, which is the subject of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004, complements the cooperation provided for in this Direc- tive. The application of consumer protection legislation in cross-border cases, in particular with regard to new marketing and selling practices, as well as the need to remove certain specific obstacles to cooperation in this field, necessitates a greater degree of cooperation between Member States. In particular, it is necessary in this area to ensure that Member States require the cessation of illegal practices by operators in their territory who target consumers in another Member State. (105) Administrative cooperation is essential to make the internal market in services function properly. Lack of cooperation between Member States results in proliferation of rules applicable to providers or duplication of controls for cross-border activities, and can also be used by rogue traders to avoid supervision or to circumvent applicable national rules on services. It is, therefore, essential to provide for clear, legally binding obligations for Member States to cooperate effectively. (106) For the purposes of the Chapter on administrative cooperation, \u2018 supervision \u2019 should cover activities such as monitoring and fact finding, problem solving, enforcement and imposition of sanctions and subsequent follow-up activities. (107) In normal circumstances mutual assistance should take place directly between competent authorities. The liaison points designated by Member States should be required to facilitate this process only in the event of difficulties being encountered, for instance if assistance is required to identify the relevant competent authority. (108) Certain obligations of mutual assistance should apply to all matters covered by this Directive, includ- ing those relating to cases where a provider establishes in another Member State. Other obligations of mutual assistance should apply only in cases of cross-border provision of services, where the provi- sion on the freedom to provide services applies. A further set of obligations should apply in all cases of cross-border provision of services, including areas not covered by the provision on the freedom to provide services. Cross-border provision of services should include cases where services are provided at a distance and where the recipient travels to the Member State of establishment of the provider in order to receive services.

        "(109) In cases where a provider moves temporarily to a Member State other than the Member State of establishment, it is necessary to provide for mutual assistance between those two Member States so that the former can carry out checks, inspections and enquiries at the request of the Member State of establishment or carry out such checks on its own initiative if these are merely factual checks. (110) It should not be possible for Member States to circumvent the rules laid down in this Directive, including the provision on the freedom to provide services, by conducting checks, inspections or investigations which are discriminatory or disproportionate. (111) The provisions of this Directive concerning exchange of information regarding the good repute of providers should not pre-empt initiatives in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, in particular on the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities of the Member States and on criminal records. (112) Cooperation between Member States requires a well-functioning electronic information system in order to allow competent authorities easily to identify their relevant interlocutors in other Member States and to communicate in an efficient way. (113) It is necessary to provide that the Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, are to encourage interested parties to draw up codes of conduct at Community level, aimed, in particular, at promoting the quality of services and taking into account the specific nature of each profession. Those codes of conduct should comply with Community law, especially competition law. They should be compatible with legally binding rules governing professional ethics and conduct in the Member States. (114) Member States should encourage the setting up of codes of conduct, in particular, by professional bodies, organisations and associations at Community level. These codes of conduct should include, as appropriate to the specific nature of each profession, rules for commercial communications relating to the regulated professions and rules of professional ethics and conduct of the regulated professions which aim, in particular, at ensuring independence, impartiality and professional secrecy. In addition, the conditions to which the activities of estate agents are subject should be included in such codes of conduct. Member States should take accompanying measures to encourage professional bodies, organisations and associations to implement at national level the codes of conduct adopted at Community level. (115) Codes of conduct at Community level are intended to set minimum standards of conduct and are complementary to Member States' legal requirements. They do not preclude Member States, in accor- dance with Community law, from taking more stringent measures in law or national professional bodies from providing for greater protection in their national codes of conduct. (116) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely the elimination of barriers to the freedom of establish- ment for providers in the Member States and to the free provision of services between Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (117) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 1 ). (118) In accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making ( 2 ), Mem- ber States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between the Directive and the transposi- tion measures, and to make them public, ( 1 ) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.

        "HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Chapter I General provisions Article 1 Subject matter 1. This Directive establishes general provisions facilitating the exercise of the freedom of establishment for service providers and the free movement of services, while maintaining a high quality of services. 2. This Directive does not deal with the liberalisation of services of general economic interest, reserved to public or private entities, nor with the privatisation of public entities providing services. 3. This Directive does not deal with the abolition of monopolies providing services nor with aids granted by Member States which are covered by Community rules on competition. This Directive does not affect the freedom of Member States to define, in conformity with Community law, what they consider to be services of general economic interest, how those services should be organised and financed, in compliance with the State aid rules, and what specific obligations they should be subject to. 4. This Directive does not affect measures taken at Community level or at national level, in conformity with Community law, to protect or promote cultural or linguistic diversity or media pluralism. 5. This Directive does not affect Member States' rules of criminal law. However, Member States may not restrict the freedom to provide services by applying criminal law provisions which specifically regulate or affect access to or exercise of a service activity in circumvention of the rules laid down in this Directive. 6. This Directive does not affect labour law, that is any legal or contractual provision concerning employ- ment conditions, working conditions, including health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers, which Member States apply in accordance with national law which respects Com- munity law. Equally, this Directive does not affect the social security legislation of the Member States. 7. This Directive does not affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and by Community law. Nor does it affect the right to negotiate, conclude and enforce collective agreements and to take industrial action in accordance with national law and practices which respect Community law. Article 2 Scope 1. This Directive shall apply to services supplied by providers established in a Member State. 2. This Directive shall not apply to the following activities: (a) non-economic services of general interest; (b) financial services, such as banking, credit, insurance and re-insurance, occupational or personal pen- sions, securities, investment funds, payment and investment advice, including the services listed in Annex I to Directive 2006/48/EC; C 314 E/230 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",

This Directive shall not apply to the field of taxation. Article 3 Relationship with other provisions of Community law 1. If the provisions of this Directive conflict with a provision of another Community act governing specific aspects of access to or exercise of a service activity in specific sectors or for specific professions, the provision of the other Community act shall prevail and shall apply to those specific sectors or profes- sions. These include: (a) Directive 96/71/EC; (b) Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71; (c) Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broad- casting activities ( 1 ); (d) Directive 2005/36/EC. 2. This Directive does not concern rules of private international law, in particular rules governing the law applicable to contractual and non contractual obligations, including those which guarantee that consumers benefit from the protection granted to them by the consumer protection rules laid down in the consumer legislation in force in their Member State. 3. Member States shall apply the provisions of this Directive in compliance with the rules of the Treaty on the right of establishment and the free movement of services.

The Commission may introduce harmonised forms at Community level, in accordance with the pro- cedure referred to in Article 40(2). These forms shall be equivalent to certificates, attestations and any other documents required of a provider. 3. Where Member States require a provider or recipient to supply a certificate, attestation or any other document proving that a requirement has been satisfied, they shall accept any document from another Member State which serves an equivalent purpose or from which it is clear that the requirement in question has been satisfied. They may not require a document from another Member State to be produced in its original form, or as a certified copy or as a certified translation, save in the cases provided for in other Community instruments or where such a requirement is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest, including public order and security. The first subparagraph shall not affect the right of Member States to require non-certified translations of documents in one of their official languages. 4. Paragraph 3 shall not apply to the documents referred to in Article 7(2) and 50 of Directive 2005/36/ EC, in Articles 45(3), 46, 49 and 50 of Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts ( 1 ), in Article 3(2) of Directive 98/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a Member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained ( 2 ), in the First Council Directive 68/151/EEC of 9 March 1968 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community ( 3 ) and in the Eleventh Council Directive 89/666/EEC of 21 December 1989 concerning disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State ( 4 ).

        "Article 7 Right to information 1. Member States shall ensure that the following information is easily accessible to providers and recipi- ents through the points of single contact: (a) requirements applicable to providers established in their territory, in particular those requirements con- cerning the procedures and formalities to be completed in order to access and to exercise service activities; (b) the contact details of the competent authorities enabling the latter to be contacted directly, including the details of those authorities responsible for matters concerning the exercise of service activities; (c) the means of, and conditions for, accessing public registers and databases on providers and services; (d) the means of redress which are generally available in the event of dispute between the competent authorities and the provider or the recipient, or between a provider and a recipient or between provi- ders; (e) the contact details of the associations or organisations, other than the competent authorities, from which providers or recipients may obtain practical assistance. 2. Member States shall ensure that it is possible for providers and recipients to receive, at their request, assistance from the competent authorities, consisting in information on the way in which the requirements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 are generally interpreted and applied. Where appropriate, such advice shall include a simple step-by-step guide. The information shall be provided in plain and intelligible lan- guage. 3. Member States shall ensure that the information and assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are provided in a clear and unambiguous manner, that they are easily accessible at a distance and by electronic means and that they are kept up to date. 4. Member States shall ensure that the points of single contact and the competent authorities respond as quickly as possible to any request for information or assistance as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and, in cases where the request is faulty or unfounded, inform the applicant accordingly without delay. 5. Member States and the Commission shall take accompanying measures in order to encourage points of single contact to make the information provided for in this Article available in other Community lan- guages. This does not interfere with Member States' legislation on the use of languages. 6. The obligation for competent authorities to assist providers and recipients does not require those authorities to provide legal advice in individual cases but concerns only general information on the way in which requirements are usually interpreted or applied. Article 8 Procedures by electronic means 1. Member States shall ensure that all procedures and formalities relating to access to a service activity and to the exercise thereof may be easily completed, at a distance and by electronic means, through the relevant point of single contact and with the relevant competent authorities. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to the inspection of premises on which the service is provided or of equipment used by the provider or to physical examination of the capability or of the personal integrity of the provider or of his responsible staff. 3. The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 40(2), adopt detailed rules for the implementation of paragraph 1 of this Article with a view to facilitating the interoperability of information systems and use of procedures by electronic means between Member States, taking into account common standards developed at Community level.

        "Chapter III Freedom of establishment for providers SECTION 1 Authorisations Article 9 Authorisation schemes 1. Member States shall not make access to a service activity or the exercise thereof subject to an author- isation scheme unless the following conditions are satisfied: (a) the authorisation scheme does not discriminate against the provider in question; (b) the need for an authorisation scheme is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest; (c) the objective pursued cannot be attained by means of a less restrictive measure, in particular because an a posteriori inspection would take place too late to be genuinely effective. 2. In the report referred to in Article 39(1), Member States shall identify their authorisation schemes and give reasons showing their compatibility with paragraph 1 of this Article. 3. This section shall not apply to those aspects of authorisation schemes which are governed directly or indirectly by other Community instruments. Article 10 Conditions for the granting of authorisation 1. Authorisation schemes shall be based on criteria which preclude the competent authorities from exer- cising their power of assessment in an arbitrary manner. 2. The criteria referred to in paragraph 1 shall be: (a) non-discriminatory; (b) justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest; (c) proportionate to that public interest objective; (d) clear and unambiguous; (e) objective; (f) made public in advance; (g) transparent and accessible. 3. The conditions for granting authorisation for a new establishment shall not duplicate requirements and controls which are equivalent or essentially comparable as regards their purpose to which the provider is already subject in another Member State or in the same Member State. The liaison points referred to in Article 28(2) and the provider shall assist the competent authority by providing any necessary information regarding those requirements. 4. The authorisation shall enable the provider to have access to the service activity, or to exercise that activity, throughout the national territory, including by means of setting up agencies, subsidiaries, branches or offices, except where an authorisation for each individual establishment or a limitation of the authorisa- tion to a certain part of the territory is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest. 5. The authorisation shall be granted as soon as it is established, in the light of an appropriate examina- tion, that the conditions for authorisation have been met. 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/235 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 15 November 2006 ",
        "6. Except in the case of the granting of an authorisation, any decision from the competent authorities, including refusal or withdrawal of an authorisation, shall be fully reasoned and shall be open to challenge before the courts or other instances of appeal. 7. This Article shall not call into question the allocation of the competences, at local or regional level, of the Member States' authorities granting authorisations. Article 11 Duration of authorisation 1. An authorisation granted to a provider shall not be for a limited period, except where: (a) the authorisation is being automatically renewed or is subject only to the continued fulfilment of requirements; (b) the number of available authorisations is limited by an overriding reason relating to the public interest; or (c) a limited authorisation period can be justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not concern the maximum period before the end of which the provider must actu- ally commence his activity after receiving authorisation. 3. Member States shall require a provider to inform the relevant point of single contact provided for in Article 6 of the following changes: (a) the creation of subsidiaries whose activities fall within the scope of the authorisation scheme, (b) changes in his situation which result in the conditions for authorisation no longer being met. 4. This Article shall be without prejudice to the Member States' ability to revoke authorisations, when the conditions for authorisation are no longer met. Article 12 Selection from among several candidates 1. Where the number of authorisations available for a given activity is limited because of the scarcity of available natural resources or technical capacity, Member States shall apply a selection procedure to potential candidates which provides full guarantees of impartiality and transparency, including, in particular, adequate publicity about the launch, conduct and completion of the procedure. 2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1, authorisation shall be granted for an appropriate limited period and may not be open to automatic renewal nor confer any other advantage on the provider whose author- isation has just expired or on any person having any particular links with that provider. 3. Subject to paragraph 1 and to Articles 9 and 10, Member States may take into account, in establishing the rules for the selection procedure, considerations of public health, social policy objectives, the health and safety of employees or self-employed persons, the protection of the environment, the preservation of cul- tural heritage and other overriding reasons relating to the public interest, in conformity with Community law.

Authorisation procedures and formalities shall be clear, made public in advance and be such as to provide the applicants with a guarantee that their application will be dealt with objectively and impartially. 2. Authorisation procedures and formalities shall not be dissuasive and shall not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service. They shall be easily accessible and any charges which the applicants may incur from their application shall be reasonable and proportionate to the cost of the authorisation proce- dures in question and shall not exceed the cost of the procedures. 3. Authorisation procedures and formalities shall provide applicants with a guarantee that their applica- tion will be processed as quickly as possible and, in any event, within a reasonable period which is fixed and made public in advance. The period shall run only from the time when all documentation has been sub- mitted. When justified by the complexity of the issue, the time period may be extended once, by the competent authority, for a limited time. The extension and its duration shall be duly motivated and shall be notified to the applicant before the original period has expired. 4. Failing a response within the time period set or extended in accordance with paragraph 3, authorisa- tion shall be deemed to have been granted. Different arrangements may nevertheless be put in place, where justified by overriding reasons relating to the public interest, including a legitimate interest of third parties. 5. All applications for authorisation shall be acknowledged as quickly as possible. The acknowledgement must specify the following: (a) the period referred to in paragraph 3; (b) the available means of redress; (c) where applicable, a statement that in the absence of a response within the period specified, the author- isation shall be deemed to have been granted. 6. In the case of an incomplete application, the applicant shall be informed as quickly as possible of the need to supply any additional documentation, as well as of any possible effects on the period referred to in paragraph 3. 7. When a request is rejected because it fails to comply with the required procedures or formalities, the applicant shall be informed of the rejection as quickly as possible.

This shall not affect the possibility for Member States to require insurance or financial guarantees as such, nor shall it affect requirements relating to the participation in a collective compensation fund, for instance for members of professional bodies or organisations; (8) an obligation to have been pre-registered, for a given period, in the registers held in their territory or to have previously exercised the activity for a given period in their territory. Article 15 Requirements to be evaluated 1. Member States shall examine whether, under their legal system, any of the requirements listed in paragraph 2 are imposed and shall ensure that any such requirements are compatible with the conditions laid down in paragraph 3. Member States shall adapt their laws, regulations or administrative provisions so as to make them compatible with those conditions. 2. Member States shall examine whether their legal system makes access to a service activity or the exercise of it subject to compliance with any of the following non-discriminatory requirements: (a) quantitative or territorial restrictions, in particular in the form of limits fixed according to population or of a minimum geographical distance between providers; (b) an obligation on a provider to take a specific legal form; (c) requirements which relate to the shareholding of a company; (d) requirements, other than those concerning matters covered by Directive 2005/36/EC or provided for in other Community instruments, which reserve access to the service activity in question to particular providers by virtue of the specific nature of the activity; (e) a ban on having more than one establishment in the territory of the same State; (f) requirements fixing a minimum number of employees; (g) fixed minimum and/or maximum tariffs with which the provider must comply; (h) an obligation on the provider to supply other specific services jointly with his service.

Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply to legislation in the field of services of general economic interest only insofar as the application of these paragraphs does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular task assigned to them. 5. In the mutual evaluation report provided for in Article 39(1), Member States shall specify the follow- ing: (a) the requirements that they intend to maintain and the reasons why they consider that those require- ments comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 3; (b) the requirements which have been abolished or made less stringent. 6. From \u2026 ( * ), Member States shall not introduce any new requirement of a kind listed in paragraph 2, unless that requirement satisfies the conditions laid down in paragraph 3. 7. Member States shall notify the Commission of any new laws, regulations or administrative provisions which set requirements as referred to in paragraph 6, together with the reasons for those requirements. The Commission shall communicate the provisions concerned to the other Member States. Such notification shall not prevent Member States from adopting the provisions in question. Within a period of 3 months from the date of receipt of the notification, the Commission shall examine the compatibility of any new requirements with Community law and, where appropriate, shall adopt a decision requesting the Member State in question to refrain from adopting them or to abolish them. The notification of a draft national law in accordance with Directive 98/34/EC shall fulfil the obligation of notification provided for in this Directive.

When a provider establishes himself in their territory, Member States may not require professional liability insurance or a guarantee from the provider where he is already covered by a guarantee which is equivalent, or essentially comparable as regards its purpose and the cover it provides in terms of the insured risk, the insured sum or a ceiling for the guarantee and possible exclusions from the cover, in another Member State in which the provider is already established. Where equivalence is only partial, Member States may require a supplementary guarantee to cover those aspects not already covered. When a Member State requires a provider established in its territory to subscribe to professional liability insurance or to provide another guarantee, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence attestations of such insurance cover issued by credit institutions and insurers established in other Member States. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not affect professional insurance or guarantee arrangements provided for in other Community instruments. 4.

Expresses its deepest condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims of the recent bombing in Beit Hanun and to all other innocent casualties; 2. Expresses its deep indignation at the Israeli military operation carried out in Beit Hanun and in the Gaza Strip, and condemns the Israeli army's use of disproportionate action, which is undermining attempts to initiate the peace process; 3. Calls on the Israeli government to halt its military operations in the Gaza Strip immediately, and reaffirms that there is no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; 4. Calls on the Palestinian militias to bring to an end the firing of rockets into Israeli territory, which is indiscriminate and deliberately targets civilians, to respect the truce and to refrain from further escalating the conflict; condemns the recent rocket attack in Sderot and the killing of innocent Israeli civilians; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/325 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "5. Expresses its deep concern about the possible grave consequences of the current crisis, including further military and terrorist attacks, undermining the fragile political situation in the region as a whole; 6. Notes the blocking in the UN Security Council of a draft resolution on the situation in the Gaza Strip by a US veto, and regrets the lack of a strong and clear stance by the international community on the current crisis; 7. Calls on the US Government to reassess its role in the Quartet and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a view to supporting an end to the violence and a new and genuine dialogue between the parties; 8. Calls on the Council and the Member States to adopt a common position pursuant to Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union, in order to make an appropriate assessment of the current situation and to promote a serious attempt to halt the violence and bring the parties concerned to the negotiating table; 9. Invites the Quartet to act urgently for the resumption of negotiations with and between the parties concerned and for the full implementation of all parts of the Roadmap; declares once again, at this particu- lar stage, that a solution to the Middle East conflict will only be possible through the negotiation of a firm and final peace agreement as set out in the Roadmap, without prior conditions, based on the existence of two democratic, sovereign and viable states, living peacefully side by side within secure and recognised international borders, and that the continuing loss of civilian lives is intolerable; 10. Reiterates its suggestion that the presence of a multinational force in Lebanon could be taken as an exemplary model to be followed in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, in order to protect the civilian population on both sides; invites the Council, in the meantime, to launch an initiative to dispatch interna- tional military observers to the Gaza Strip, and calls on all parties to endorse and fully cooperate with such a proposal; 11. Calls on the Council urgently to convene the EU-Israel Association Council in order to express the position of the European Union after the Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip, with regard, in particular, to full compliance with Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement ( 1 ); 12.

Calls on the Council and the Commission to continue to guarantee, together with the international community, essential humanitarian aid for the Palestinian population; demands that the TIM be reinforced and extended in terms of duration and resources; calls on the Israeli government urgently to resume the transfer of withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues; 18. Calls on Israel to lift its economic blockade of the Gaza Strip, to facilitate trade between the Palesti- nian territories, Israel and the world as a whole, to promote economic development in the Gaza Strip for the benefit of both Palestinians and Israelis, and to permit the movement of people at Rafah, in compliance with the Agreement on Movement and Access and the EU Border Assistance Mission, as well as at Karni and at other border crossings in the Gaza Strip; calls on the EU to face its full responsibility on the imple- mentation of this agreement; 19. Reiterates its call for the immediate release of the Palestinian ministers and legislators in Israeli custody and of the abducted Israeli soldier; 20. Calls on the Council to make every effort to convene an international peace conference \u2014 along the lines of the 1991 Madrid Conference \u2014 in order to find a comprehensive, lasting and viable solution to the problems in the area, based on the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and considers that a unilateral approach by any of the parties concerned must be rejected; 21. Considers the involvement of the League of Arab States to be essential in this context; considers the League's 2002 \u2018 Beirut Plan \u2019 , as well as the 2003 Geneva Initiative, to be important contributions to the negotiations, which should be duly taken into account; 22.

        "\u2014 having regard to Council Common Position 2006/242/CFSP of 20 March 2006 relating to the 2006 Review Conference of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) ( 1 ), the objectives which are to strengthen further the BTWC and promote a successful outcome to the Sixth Review Conference, \u2014 having regard to the European Security Strategy and the EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weap- ons of Mass Destruction, adopted at the Brussels European Council of 12 to 13 December 2003, and its resolution of 17 November 2005 on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction: a role for the European Parliament ( 2 ), \u2014 having regard to Rule 103(4) of its Rules of Procedure, A. whereas the BTWC, which was opened for signature in 1972 and entered into force in 1975, is the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning an entire category of weapons, and whereas it currently has 155 States Parties, with a further 16 having signed but not yet ratified the Convention, B. whereas the Sixth Review Conference, which will take place in Geneva from 20 November to 8 Decem- ber 2006, will be the first opportunity for States Parties to examine the operation of the Convention since the Fifth Review Conference ended in 2002, and whereas it will provide the States Parties with the opportunity to reconfirm their commitment to the complete prohibition of biological weapons and to address any problems or shortcomings in the operation of the Convention, C. whereas the first part of the Fifth Review Conference ended in failure, largely owing to the US Admin- istration's withdrawal from the negotiations on devising a legally-binding compliance-strengthening mechanism, D. whereas, although the number of signatories is steadily growing (100 to the introductory framework agreement in January 2006), the CCW is far from universal and whereas the number of signatories is substantially lower for its five protocols which contain the practical implementing provisions of the Convention, 1. Stresses that the objective of the European Union should be to build on the success of the BTWC regime, to further strengthen the BTWC and to promote a successful outcome to the Sixth Review Conference; 2. Welcomes the Council and Commission's continuous diplomatic action to keep alive international efforts to strengthen the BTWC and recognises the EU's role in promoting the exploration of voluntary non-binding inspections as \u2018 confidence-building measures \u2019 and the strengthening of national legislation in the run-up to the Review Conference; 3. Attaches, therefore, great importance to a thorough and full review of the operation of the BTWC in order to identify, discuss and agree on the measures to be taken to further strengthen the Convention; 4. Calls on the Council and Member States to promote the accession of all States to the BTWC, including by calling on all States not party thereto to accede to the BTWC without further delay and working towards a declaration that the ban on biological and toxin weapons is a universally binding rule of international law; 5. Encourages the EU, therefore, to take up this issue in the transatlantic fora, in particular NATO, and to persuade the US administration to move away from its unilateral point of view and to contribute to the relaunch and enhancement of the multilateral framework; 6. Calls on the Council and Commission to promote full compliance with the obligations under the BTWC and, where necessary, the strengthening of national implementation measures, including penal legis- lation and control over pathogenic micro-organisms and toxins in the framework of the BTWC; 7. Calls on the Council and Member States to contribute to the improvement of the mechanisms for verifying compliance by the States Parties by promoting efforts to enhance transparency through increased exchange of information among States Parties, including identifying measures to assess and enhance the country coverage and the usefulness of the Confidence Building Measures mechanism; ( 1 ) OJ L 88, 25.3.2006, p. 65.

Calls on the Council and Member States to promote compliance with obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1540, in particular to eliminate the risk of biological or toxin weapons being acquired or used for terrorist purposes, including possible terrorist access to materials, equipment and knowledge that could be used in the development and production of biological and toxin weapons; 9. Calls on the Council and Member States to promote consideration of, and decisions on further action on, the work undertaken to date under the intersessional programme during the period 2003 to 2005 and the efforts to discuss and promote common understanding and effective action in particular on: enhancing international capabilities for responding to, investigating and mitigating the effects of cases of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons or suspicious outbreaks of disease; strengthening and broadening national and international institutional efforts and existing mechanisms for the surveillance, detection, diagnosis and combating of infectious diseases affecting humans, animals and plants; the content, promulgation and adop- tion of codes of conduct for scientists in the field relevant to the BTWC in order to raise awareness of the BTWC and to help relevant actors to comply with their legal, regulatory and professional obligations and ethical principles; 10. Calls on the Council and Member States to support a further intersessional work programme during the period between the Sixth and Seventh Review Conferences, to identify specific areas and procedures for further progress under this work programme and to promote the convening of a Seventh Review Confer- ence of the BTWC to be held no later than 2011; 11. Calls upon the EU and its Member States to work hard to ensure that the scope of Protocol III to the CCW on Incendiary Weapons is expanded in order to prevent the further use of white phosphorus shells against military and civilian targets and to stop the use of (depleted) uranium warheads; 12. Welcomes the fact that Protocol V to the CCW on Explosive Remnants of War entered into force on 12 November 2006 and has therefore become binding international law; stresses that this means that States must clear their territories of unexploded ordnance to reduce the number of civilian casualties following conflicts; also stresses that this Protocol obliges those parties responsible for the remnants to assist in their clearance, even if the territory concerned is not under their control; insists that this Protocol applies to all types of unexploded ordnance, including cluster munitions; 13. Is nevertheless convinced that many more States should sign and ratify the CCW and its five Proto- cols, and calls upon the Council and the Commission to do everything possible to ensure that all Member States duly sign and ratify Protocol V and that all countries receiving disarmament assistance sign and ratify the protocol as well, even if so far they have not acceded to the CCW (e.g. Lebanon); 14. Calls upon the EU and the Member States to demand \u2014 in the spirit of the CCW's aim of establish- ing protocols on relevant weapon-systems when the need arises and pending a specific Convention on this issue \u2014 the creation of a specific Protocol VI to unambiguously ban the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of all types of cluster munitions (fragmentation bombs); 15. In this light, welcomes in particular the positive response by a coalition of more than 30 States (amongst them many Member States, including Belgium, Sweden, Germany, France, Austria, Denmark, Spain and the Czech Republic) to the call made by both Kofi Annan and Jan Egeland at the beginning of the CCW Review Conference for negotiations to start without delay to establish a comprehensive and effective convention to ban cluster munitions worldwide, in the same way as has been done for anti-per- sonnel mines; calls on the EU and all Member States to support this initiative as actively as possible; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/329 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "16. Calls upon all Member States, the Council and the Commission to work hard to ensure that, within the foreseeable future, both the BTWC and the CCW are equipped with a permanent secretariat to oversee their successful implementation, along the lines of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weap- ons, which was created for that purpose under the Chemical Weapons Convention; 17. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the parliaments and governments of the Member States, the parliaments and governments of the States Parties to the BTWC and CCW and the appropriate specialised NGOs.

        "C. whereas the Baltic Sea region is a historically significant gateway area uniting the West and the East and should, as such, be at the core of the new Northern Dimension policy, D. whereas the Baltic Sea has almost become an internal sea, a mare nostrum , of the European Union following the 2004 enlargement, and whereas the Baltic Sea Strategy may serve as a substantial con- tribution to the reappraisal of the scope and activities of the Northern Dimension to reflect the changes since that enlargement, E. whereas the Baltic Sea Strategy could make an important contribution to the achievement of better coordination between the regional bodies operating in the Baltic Sea region, Aim of this resolution 1. Aspires, by means of this resolution, to: (a) support the Northern Dimension policy by defining the Baltic Sea region as one of the main priority areas, thereby promoting deeper regional integration in the Baltic Sea region, which is a viable and dynamic part of a wider European economic and political area; underlines its ongoing support for work in other areas, specifically the Barents and Arctic regions, in cooperation with the partner coun- tries Norway, Iceland and the Russian Federation; (b) make the most of the opportunities offered by the dynamic economies of the Baltic Sea region and systematically create a brand for the region as one of the most attractive and competitive areas in the world; (c) help to improve the ecological status of the Baltic Sea, which is currently one of the most polluted sea areas in the world; reduce pollution and eutrophication and prevent further releases of oil and other toxic and harmful substances; Against that background, makes the following proposals: 2. Urges the Commission to come up with a proposal for an EU Baltic Sea Strategy in order to reinforce the internal pillar of the Northern Dimension, cover horizontally different aspects of regional cooperation, promote synergies and avoid overlapping between different regional bodies and organisations; invites the Commission and the Member States to adjust the responsibilities of their administrations in order for them to be able to employ a horizontal approach when devising and implementing the Northern Dimension policy; 3. Supports the work of the Council of the Baltic Sea States; proposes an annual Baltic Sea Summit to be held before the Summer European Council; supports the work of the Baltic Sea Parliamentary Conference, the yearly meeting of the national parliaments' Speakers from the region and the upcoming Northern Dimension Parliamentary Forum; 4. Underlines that the Baltic Sea Strategy includes both measures to be implemented by the European Union and its Member States alone and measures to be implemented in cooperation with the Russian Federation; 5. Recalls the need to establish a full-scale regional bureau of the European Investment Bank in the Baltic Sea region; 6. With a view to achieving transparency and coherence, calls for an own EU budget line for the Baltic Sea Strategy, possibly under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, supplementing the current funding of the Northern Dimension by the European Union, Member States, third countries, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Nordic Investment Bank and others; stresses that the Strategy must receive adequate funding from all relevant budget lines in order to be able to fulfil its objectives; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/331 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "7. Notes that the responsibility for the pollution of the Baltic Sea lies with both the Russian Federation and the Member States; stresses that protecting the marine environment with regard, in particular, to the reduction of eutrophication is one of the most important aspects to be considered in the implementation of the Union's agricultural and structural programmes in the region; notes with satisfaction that most of the Baltic Sea region has been granted the status of a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) by the International Maritime Organization (IMO); proposes the establishment of a network of ecologically representative and valuable off-shore and coastal protected areas; 8. Points out that a major oil disaster caused either by transportation or by exploration and exploitation could effectively kill most of the marine life in the Baltic Sea; calls for greater coordination to prevent such accidents and, should one nonetheless take place, to agree on joint mechanism to combat its effects; is of the opinion that the norms for classification of oil tankers must take account of conditions in the region, such as the thickness of the ice during winter-time; 9. Underlines the need to protect and strengthen the fish stocks in the Baltic Sea region; asks the Com- mission to prepare a comprehensive plan for conserving and restoring the natural salmon stocks in the Baltic Sea water system by utilising all the spawning rivers; 10. Stresses the need to reduce the region's dependency on Russian energy and encourages the Member States in the region to examine the possibility of a common energy market; calls on the Commission, the Member States and the partners to promote joint projects on energy efficiency and renewable energy resources, in the light of the region's potential as a source of bio-energy, and to encourage the usage of biomass, solar, wind and hydro energy; supports the work of the Baltic Sea Region Energy Cooperation; 11. Calls for an approach based on fairness and shared responsibility in the implementation of energy policy at national level, so that strategic decisions such as the construction of new energy networks are taken after consulting those partners among EU Member States which might be affected by those decisions; 12. Underlines that proper environmental impact assessments should be a prerequisite for all energy- related infrastructure projects, in order to guarantee that international standards of environment protection are met; calls in this regard on the Russian Federation to ratify the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context; 13. Stresses the importance of respecting the internationally recognised principles of sustainable devel- opment, good governance, transparency and participation, gender equality, the rights of minorities, and the protection of indigenous peoples, and of the adoption of mutually reinforcing economic, employment and social policies by all partners involved, in line with the Lisbon Strategy; 14. Recalls the role of the Baltic Sea as a uniting factor in the region; suggests a new programme, to be entitled \u2018 Borderless Baltic Sea \u2019 , designed to facilitate smooth border crossing in the region, including between the Member States and the Russian Federation; supports the establishment of a \u2018 Baltic Sea motorway \u2019 linking the Baltic Sea region with Member States in central and western Europe by 2010; 15. Takes the view that, in order to fulfil their responsibility to lessen the pollution of the Baltic Sea, Member States should have the right to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures than those proposed by the EU; 16. Recognises the increase in maritime traffic, mainly due to the strong economic growth of the Russian Federation; regards maritime safety as one of the most pressing concerns of the region; proposes the gradual expansion of the joint Vessel Traffic Management and Information Systems (VTMIS) to cover the whole of the Baltic Sea instead of just the Gulf of Finland; underlines the need for a common commitment to rapid implementation of the classification of the Baltic Sea by the IMO as a PSSA, including a ban on single-hull oil transports; C 314 E/332 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",

Suggests that the Trans-European Network (TEN) Nordic Triangle be enlarged to cover the whole region and inclusion of the road and railway routes of the Barents Corridor and the Bothnian Corridor within the TEN system; calls for the realisation of the Rail Baltica project; envisages a high-speed train connection linking up the whole region; 18. Calls for the realisation of the Via Baltica highway by 2013 as a priority project linking the Baltic Sea region with Member States in central and western Europe; stresses the importance of European funding for the realisation of the project; 19. Recognises that most national markets in the region are relatively small, which has in many cases resulted in a low level of competition; points out the exceptional economic interdependence of the Member States in the region; calls for full implementation of the four basic freedoms (freedom of movement of persons, freedom of movement of goods, freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital) as between the EU Member States located in the region; 20. Notes that the status of the Kaliningrad Oblast enclave surrounded by the European Union calls for genuine cooperation between the regional authorities, the Russian Federation and the European Union; urges the Russian Federation and the European Union to examine the possibility of developing the Kalinin- grad Oblast into a more open and less militarised pilot region with improved access to the internal market; stresses the need for full implementation of freedom of navigation in the Baltic Sea, including the Vistula Lagoon and Kaliningradzkij Zaliv, and free passage through the Pilava Strait/Baltijskij Proliv; 21. Points out that the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Wellbeing (NDPHS) should become more practical in combating major diseases as well as enhancing and promoting health and socially rewarding lifestyles; calls on the Russian Federation and the EU to examine the possibilities of practically engaging the Kaliningrad Oblast in NDPHS activities; 22. Stresses that the Kaliningrad Oblast is still an enclave plagued with many social, economic and ecological problems, such as the significant ecological risk posed by the presence of the military bases and weapons in the region, the substantial health risk and the high levels of organised crime and drug addiction; 23. Calls on the Baltic Sea Region to actively support programmes aimed at generating new forms of art and communication and fostering multinational mobility and cultural exchange programmes; 24. Supports student exchanges within the region; suggests that the universities in the region form net- works and agree on a division of labour in order to foster centres of excellence capable of competing at international level; 25. Is concerned that the region's Eastern border is serving as a conduit for a significant level of orga- nised crime, with trafficking in humans and drugs giving cause for particular concern; urges a strengthened European Police Office (Europol) involvement and reinforced cooperation at both EU and intergovernmental levels on these issues; 26. Stresses the need to redouble efforts to improve the efficiency of border controls on the Eastern border, in particular as regards upgrading the existing infrastructure and promoting legal border crossing, and calls for sufficient funds to be earmarked from the proposed European External Borders Fund; * * * 27.

Recognises that the ESS of December 2003, based on an initiative by the Greek presidency, contains an excellent analysis of the threats to the modern world and states the fundamental principles of the EU's foreign policy; emphasises, however, the need to monitor its implementation on a regular basis, in order to be able to react to geopolitical developments; ( 1 ) OJ C 33 E, 9.2.2006, p. 580.

        "2. Notes that, as stated in the ESS, international terrorism, the proliferation of WMD, regional conflicts, state failure and organised crime represent nowadays the main threats facing the European Union and its citizens; emphasises that the increasing worldwide competition for sources of water and energy, as well as natural disasters and the security of the Union's external borders, must be included as a strategic objective in the further development of the ESS; is concerned about the prospect of renewed arms races at global and regional levels and the ongoing proliferation of conventional arms; 3. Recognises that the fight against international terrorism cannot, however, be pursued by military means alone, and that the prevention and repression of terrorism require a whole range of non-military measures such as intelligence-sharing and police and judicial cooperation, for which full interinstitutional and inter-pillar cooperation is needed, and that the building of democratic institutions, infrastructure and civil society in failed or failing states is required; stresses that one of the greatest contributions of the European Union to preventing international terrorism is its capacity to be effective in the building or rebuilding of democratic institutions, social and economic infrastructure, good governance and civil society and in successfully combating racism and xenophobia; 4. Points out that the task of the CFSP is to protect the citizens of the EU from those threats, defend the justified interests of the EU and promote the objectives of the United Nations Charter by acting as a global responsible actor for worldwide peace and democracy; strongly supports the idea of the ESS that the best means of attaining these objectives is \u2018 effective multilateralism \u2019 , meaning international institutions and inter- national law; 5. Reiterates its position that the EU, through the ESDP, must fulfil its tasks by civil and peaceful means in the first place and by military means only if all avenues for negotiation have been thoroughly explored and found to be a dead end; in carrying out these legitimate tasks, the primary consideration should be unequivocal respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of citizens within and outside the EU's borders; 6. Considers that the geopolitical challenges have evolved considerably since the adoption of the ESS in 2003, making its revision necessary in 2008 at the latest; is of the opinion that the ESS should be revised every 5 years and that it should be debated in the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States; 7. Points out that it is of the utmost importance to effectively coordinate the civilian and military ele- ments of the international community's response to a crisis; 8. Urges the Member States to support the parliamentary dimension of the ESDP in which developments at the institutional and financial level go hand in hand with an extension of parliamentary rights of control; recalls that responsibility for parliamentary monitoring of the ESDP is shared between the parliaments of the Member States and the European Parliament on the basis of their respective rights and duties under relevant treaties and constitutions; 9. Advocates initiatives for closer relations and an intensified exchange of information between the par- liaments of the Member States and the European Parliament in relation to questions concerning the ESDP, in order to make more structured and regular dialogue between the parliaments possible; 10. Stresses that the European Union must be in a position to make a major contribution, in order to: (a) defend itself against any real and unequivocal threat to its security; (b) secure peace and stability first and foremost in its geographical neighbourhood and in other parts of the world, in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter; (c) carry out humanitarian interventions and rescue operations; (d) prevent and manage conflicts and promote democracy and respect for human rights; (e) promote regional and global disarmament; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/335 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",

Emphasises that, in the event of an attack by the armed forces of a third country on the territory of the EU, NATO remains the guarantor of collective defence, but that the EU is expected to act in solidarity and to provide the Member State attacked with all necessary assistance in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter; welcomes NATO's increasing capability of playing a role in out-of-theatre operations; also regards NATO as the appropriate forum for transatlantic dialogue on security issues; 12. Recognises that the capabilities of the Member States' armed forces and their availability to the EU are influenced by the fact that most Member States are members of both the EU and NATO and maintain one set of armed forces at the disposal of both organisations; demands, therefore, that the EU should continue to work intensively with NATO, especially in the area of capabilities development; 13. Stresses the \u2018 strategic autonomy \u2019 inherent in the ESS, namely the ability to carry out operations within its scope independently of other actors, which requires interoperability and a more sustainable and reliable supply chain based on mutual support and assistance, avoiding duplication and suboptimal use of scarce resources at European level or between Member States; warns against unnecessary duplication of effort between NATO and the EU, and between the Member States of the EU; 14. Considers that the ESDP currently has at its disposal limited resources for civilian and military opera- tions; therefore demands that the EU \u2014 in order to develop its credibility as a global actor \u2014 concentrate its capabilities on its geographical neighbourhood, particularly the Balkans; envisages at the same time the development of further capabilities to enable the EU to make an active contribution to conflict resolution in other parts of the world as well, in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter; Integrated civil-military cooperation 15. Welcomes the EU's emphasis upon strengthening civil and military cooperation in crisis management and recognises that the development of civilian crisis management capabilities has been a distinct feature which provides added value in the development of the ESDP and across the spectrum of responses to conflict prevention, humanitarian intervention, post-conflict reconstruction and peace-building; underlines the need to involve specialised international and local NGOs and their networks; urges the EU to further strive for the implementation of a coherent policy concerning conflict prevention in the spirit of the con- clusions of the G\u00f6teborg European Council held on 15 and 16 June 2001; 16. Is encouraged by recent attempts under the Civilian Headline Goal 2008 to redress the previous lack of emphasis on developing civilian capacities and capabilities; is further encouraged by the potential for the Civilian and Military Cell and the Operations Centre to play an important role in developing the EU's approach to integrated civil-military cooperation and coordination; recommends, therefore, that the Civilian and Military Cell and the Operations Centre be upgraded to become a European Headquarters for carrying out civil-military missions; 17. Recognises that the key enabling capabilities in the area of satellite-based and airborne intelligence systems, integrated telecommunications systems and strategic sea and airlift are essential to both civilian and military crisis management operations; calls for integrated research and development processes to be initiated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) together with the Commission in areas that reinforce integrated and coordinated civil-military approaches, and in particular in the areas of satellite-based and airborne intelligence systems and integrated telecommunications systems; Crisis management 18. Welcomes the setting-up of the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System, which has been funded by the Commission in close cooperation with the United Nations; points out that this system should considerably improve the EU's capacity to react; C 314 E/336 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "19. Notes the activities of the Health Emergency Operations Facility set up by the Commission; stresses the importance of this facility with regard to both its stock of information and data and its ability to provide warnings about pandemics and epidemics, and also biological and chemical threats; therefore calls on the Council and the Commission to make the requisite arrangements whereby the Commission will be involved in coordinating measures in the event of health emergencies and cross-border bio-terrorist attacks; 20. Welcomes the Commission's efforts to set up a Community procedure for disaster protection, includ- ing in the case of a serious terrorist attack; notes that this procedure is based primarily on the information in a database which holds details about national resources available to provide help; notes that the time- saving effect of this database, which also promotes synergies, could be substantially improved if it took over the content of the database set up by the EU Military Staff, which contains details of all the resources available for crisis management; therefore calls on the Council and the Commission to hold the necessary talks and adopt the requisite measures to enable this take-over to take place; 21. Welcomes the Council's efforts to ensure the speedy and effective deployment of the many ESDP resources available in the event of a disaster; in this connection, stresses how urgent it is to fill the gaps with regard to strategic transport coordination; therefore urges the Member States to make the funding needed to resolve this problem available as soon as possible; also calls on the Council to examine very seriously the proposals made in the above-mentioned report presented by Michel Barnier, including in particular the creation of an informal European Civilian Security Council, an integrated European approach to anticipate crises, the pooling of existing national resources and the setting-up of European consulates to assist EU citizens abroad; and asks the Council and the Commission to work together to gradually implement these proposals; 22. Considers that the development of the ESDP has contributed to the emergence of \u2018 grey areas \u2019 regard- ing the powers of the Council and the Commission relating to the performance of primarily civilian mis- sions; expects that the adoption of the Stability Instrument will provide some clarification, without this having a negative effect on the flexibility in crisis management which has been demonstrated to date in practice; 23. Welcomes the progress made in connection with the Civilian Headline Goal 2008 and, in particular, the development of the plans for the use of civilian response teams and integrated police groups; also notes the development of expertise relating to the fight against organised crime and human trafficking; likewise welcomes the setting-up of a crisis platform at the Commission, which has set itself the goal of speeding up the start-up phase of on-the-spot ESDP missions; calls on the Council and the Commission to coordinate their efforts and therefore proposes that a joint training programme be set up for all staff who work on planning missions; Homeland security 24. Points out that the first task of any security policy is to secure one's own territory; acknowledges that Europe's citizens expect from a European defence policy, first and foremost, a major contribution to the protection of their personal security, accompanied by respect for their fundamental human rights; 25. Points out that the EU has to secure its external borders, protect its vital infrastructures, eliminate international terrorist funding networks and fight against organised crime; in this regard, calls on the Com- mission and the Member States to develop a system of integrated management of the EU's external borders, without limiting respect for human and fundamental rights, as well as humanitarian law, especially with regard to refugees and asylum seekers; 26. Points out that the EU has to: \u2014 secure the free flow of supplies for industry and individual consumers, and of hydrocarbons in particu- lar, which entails the security of shipping, flights and pipelines; \u2014 defend itself against a cyber attack which may disrupt vital communications, financial or energy sys- tems; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/337 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "Rapid action on the basis of the UN Charter 27. Endorses the fact that the ESS, while assuming that the EU, in the light of new threats, must be ready to act before crises break out and take early preventive action to deal with conflicts and threats, bases itself in doing so unreservedly on the UN Charter, as the fundamental framework for international relations; Rules of conduct/training 28. Greatly welcomes the fact that the behaviour of personnel in all ESDP operations is governed by a range of guidelines and general rules of conduct which are set out in documents; welcomes the initial signs in these guidelines and rules of their observance of human rights standards and rules; insists that compli- ance with such rules should be totally mandatory and that field commanders should be made accountable for the discipline and conduct of their personnel, even under conditions of extreme stress in war situations; also takes favourable note of the efforts to ensure that the gender dimension will enjoy a higher profile in the various ESDP policies, programmes and initiatives in future; 29. Takes note of the Council's efforts to develop further the targeted ESDP training programmes \u2014 both strategic and operational \u2014 for diplomatic, military and civilian personnel; expects it to be made possible for European Parliament experts to participate in these programmes; endorses the approach of establishing minimum standards for the training of personnel on on-the-spot ESDP missions, and calls on the Council to work together with the Commission and the Member States towards standardising all train- ing measures at all levels; 30. Is of the opinion that soldiers will be exposed to unnecessary risks if their chain of command, equipment or armaments do not meet the requirements of the operation; considers it particularly impor- tant, therefore, to ensure that the units to be placed under EU command are adequately equipped; 31. Is of the opinion that the effective use of military capabilities will not be possible without serious enhancement of European's power projection capacity, including air and sea lift; in this context, acknowl- edges the efforts of different countries to increase their air transport and amphibious capabilities as well as plans to acquire more aircraft carriers; 32. Takes note that, in multinational operations, the use of different \u2014 and often incompatible \u2014 equip- ment and armaments by the participating units leads to extra costs and reduced efficiency; therefore con- siders that the EU should promote measures to harmonise equipment and armaments with a view to opti- mising resources and the effectiveness of multinational operations; Intelligence 33. Criticises the particularly serious fact that the battle groups currently under development do not all have the same access to airborne and space-based intelligence, and regrets that the output of the national satellite intelligence-gathering systems Helios, SAR-Lupe and Cosmo-Skymed are not available to all Member States on a common basis; 34. In order to meet these shortfalls: (a) strongly requests that the battle groups under development receive common or at least compatible equipment in the fields of intelligence and telecommunications; (b) demands that the next generation of satellite intelligence-gathering systems be integrated into a Euro- pean system whose output would be available for military, police and disaster management purposes using the satellite centre in Torrej\u00f3n; 35. Points out that NATO is currently developing the airborne intelligence-gathering system Airborne Ground Surveillance (AGS) in addition to the national systems that already exist or are under development; insists that this system be made available for all EU Member States, especially in the EU battle groups context; C 314 E/338 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "36. Considers that, in the telecommunications field, it is necessary to develop a joint system for the command of multinational units; therefore expresses the view that the equipment used by the military, police and emergency services should comply with the same technical standards, as is the case, for example, in Finland; Border surveillance 37. Stresses the importance of enhancing the EU's collective capacity to protect its external borders; remains particularly concerned about the incompatibility and quality of border surveillance equipment and underlines the need for new technology to remedy this situation; Transportation 38. Considers that, since transportation, in particular strategic lift, is an essential shortfall in any EU crisis management action, a European self-standing arrangement ensuring access to conventional civil multi-modal transport, building on an integrated civilian/military approach and ensuring economies of scale for all Euro- pean actors in crisis management for both ESDP and disaster relief purposes, would be of great interest; Weaknesses in the ESDP decision-making procedure 39. Considers that the political decision-making procedure preceding the decision to carry out an ESDP mission displays a number of weaknesses, as was seen in the case of the mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo; therefore calls on the Council to review the various stages of that procedure and, if appropriate, to take steps to eliminate those weaknesses; in this connection, reminds the Council and, in particular, its Political and Security Committee, of its obligation to consult the Parliament; 40. Reaffirms its demand for unrestricted involvement and also its right to be consulted annually, in advance, on forthcoming aspects of and options for the CFSP, as provided for in the existing Treaties; calls emphatically on the Council to pursue a much more open and transparent information policy, vis-\u00e0-vis Parliament, with regard to the CFSP and the ESDP; in this connection, criticises the current procedure for access by Parliament to the Council's \u2018 confidential documents \u2019 , which in most cases contain only very general information; 41. Reaffirms its position that no military mission in which the EU is involved should start before the European Parliament has been appropriately informed and consulted; 42. Demands that expenditure on military equipment and armaments be adopted in budgets which are subject to parliamentary control; is therefore of the opinion that parallel budgets and mechanisms, which cannot be effectively supervised either by national parliaments or by the European Parliament, should be avoided; 43. Notes that the European Union budget contains various headings with security aspects such as appropriations for crisis management, the security of external borders and vital infrastructures, security research and implementation of the Galileo and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programmes; 44. Urges, in particular, that the budget available for crisis management missions, external border secur- ity, security research and Galileo be further increased; in the long term, the area of security research should be geared to the funding requirements determined by the High-Level Group on Security Research; 45. Demands also that military crisis-management operations be financed from the EU budget and that, for that purpose, additional EU resources be made available by the Member States; 46. Criticises the fact that, due to the Athena mechanism and other ad hoc mechanisms financed by the Member States or even the European Development Fund, the European Parliament is not in a position to exercise any budgetary scrutiny over ESDP military operations; points out that there is also a need for transparency in civil-military operations (such as police missions) which fall within a grey area between ad hoc arrangements and CFSP budget financing; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/339 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "47. Consequently, calls for a new budgetary methodology to enhance transparency in ESDP spending and to support the development of the military and civilian capabilities needed to fulfil the aims of the ESS: (a) in an initial phase, which should start in 2007 and not exceed two years in duration, the Council should draw up a budgetary document reflecting the commitments made by the Member States to fulfil the Civilian Headline Goal 2008 and the Military Headline Goal 2010 and based on the existing cata- logues (requirements catalogue, force catalogue and progress catalogue); (b) in a second phase, the Member States should commit themselves to the ESDP through a virtual \u2018 budget \u2019 in which they would commit funds on a multi-annual basis to finance the equipment and personnel needed for ESDP operations. This document, whilst not legally binding, would nevertheless become an important political document next to the EU budget, and would indicate what the Member States are prepared to spend on the ESDP. It should facilitate \u2018 burden sharing \u2019 between the Member States by securing greater transparency as regards military spending, and should be jointly debated by the Euro- pean Parliament and the parliaments of Member States on an annual basis; (c) final decisions about the rationalisation of the budget for the CFSP and the ESDP, including the accounting of national expenditure at EU level in the security and defence dimension, should form a part of the revised financial system of the Union envisaged for 2008-09; European defence equipment market and cooperative research 48. Emphasises that the ESS presupposes a strong and independent European defence industry and autonomous technology research and development capacities that are capable of adequately protecting the essential security interests of the EU and the Member States; concludes from the public debate that in order to foster the competitiveness of the European defence industry and develop an autonomous industrial base providing the necessary defence capabilities it is necessary to adopt internal market rules for defence-related products which are adapted to the specificities of this sector; underlines that such rules must facilitate industrial cooperation and trade within the Community; recalls that the derogation provided for in Article 296 of the EC Treaty leaves intact the duty of the Community institutions to legislate on the development of the internal market for defence-related equipment and services, provided such legislation protects the essential security interests of the Member States and of the EU; claims that a high level of protection needs to be achieved; 49. Looks forward therefore to the Commission's interpretative communication on the application of Article 296, to the Commission proposal for a specific directive on defence procurement, and to the crea- tion of a binding legal instrument on the facilitation of intra-Community transfers of defence-related pro- ducts that will substitute a simplified common system in place of the existing national export licences; holds that this system should protect the essential security interests of the EU and of the Member States by defining principles of a European export policy on the basis of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports; 50. Recalls that rules such as Article XXIII of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement recog- nise the possibility of protecting essential security interests related to defence procurement; emphasises that, in order to ensure the protection of those interests of the EU and of the Member States, the common rules to be adopted should grant preference to defence-related products of European origin over those originating from third countries, give full effect to the principle of reciprocity in trade relations, and favour the use of technology protected by European industrial property rights; 51. Welcomes the EDA's Code of Conduct on defence procurement and calls on all Member States to subscribe to it; insists that the practice of offsets and \u2018 juste retour \u2019 should be abolished; considers it necess- ary that the work of the EDA be stepped up in the context of the ESDP; 52. Recognises the importance of cooperative research for the competitiveness of the European industry; demands, therefore, greater complementarities between the work of the Commission and the EDA, through more effective dialogue on civilian, security and defence-related research in Europe; emphasises that the C 314 E/340 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "provision of dual-use technologies and multifunctional capacities, and also overcoming the division separat- ing research for civilian and defence purposes, should be aims and objectives of the EU; considers it necess- ary, given the diversity of company structures in this sector by comparison with other areas of research, to adjust the definition of small and medium-sized businesses in the area of European security research; 53. Calls for the 1998 Code of Conduct on Arms Exports to be given the force of law and to be correctly applied and implemented in all Member States; is of the opinion that the decision as to which countries of destination meet the criteria of the Code of Conduct should be taken on a common basis; WMD/Iran 54. Realises that there can be no guarantee of success with the attempts to stop Iran producing weapons- grade enriched uranium; considers, however, that the joint negotiating offer made by the EU Three, the United States, Russia and China represents the most promising course; welcomes the multilateral approach underpinning this offer; is pleased to note Europe's part in bringing it into being; welcomes the willingness of the United States to take part in the same negotiations with Iran; regrets that the talks between the EU High Representative and the EU Three on the one side and Iran on the other have so far not achieved satisfying results; therefore accepts as a consequence that the matter be dealt with at the level of the UN Security Council; underlines that negotiations can be resumed at any time provided that there are indica- tions from the Iranian side that they can be successful; would welcome the willingness of the United States to join in such negotiations with Iran; Towards a Security and Defence Union 55. Points out that the EU is on the way to developing into a Security and Defence Union as well, covering external security as well as various aspects of internal security, combating terrorism in all its forms and natural disaster management with the following elements: (a) the commitment of the Member States to be able to: \u2014 deploy 60 000 soldiers within 60 days and sustain them for one year for peacekeeping and peace- making operations as decided at the Helsinki European Council, and to build up 13 battle groups deployable at short notice, with two permanently on standby from 2007; \u2014 develop capabilities for civilian crisis management in the area of police operations, the rule of law, civilian administration and civil protection, as decided at the Santa Maria da Feira European Coun- cil on 19-20 June 2000; (b) a European structure of command consisting of a Political and Security Committee, a Military Commit- tee, a Military Staff (all of which have been operational since 2001) and a Civilian and Military Cell with a nascent Operations Centre; (c) the European Gendarmerie Force with its Headquarters in Vicenza, which should be used for the future police mission in Kosovo; (d) the EDA proposed by the European Council, which has been operational since 2004; (e) Europol and the European arrest warrant; (f) common rules for arms procurement and arms exports; (g) European security research as a free-standing thematic priority under the 7th Framework Research Programme; 56. Is of the opinion that this process should be strengthened by means of the following elements: (a) the establishment of a common market in the field of defence, as a means of creating a truly integrated European defence technological base in accordance with the principles of interdependence and specia- lisation among EU Member States; (b) a common system of satellite and airborne intelligence and common telecommunications standards, to be at the disposal of the military, the police and the disaster management services; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/341 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "(c) the setting up of a European standing naval force including a coastguard service, active in the Mediter- ranean sea in order to demonstrate a European presence and enhance the EU's crisis management potential in this region of utmost importance for its security interests; (d) a European budget covering not only the civil but also the military aspects of security; (e) a European deputy foreign minister in charge of security and defence policy; (f) more frequent meetings of the EU's Defence Ministers; (g) a European civil protection force as proposed in the above-mentioned report of Michel Barnier, as well as a European Civil Peace Corps and the Peace Building Partnership; (h) an available European capability for air and sea transport in cases of disaster relief, rescue operations and defence operations (multimodal transport combining the most appropriate assets); (i) adequate parliamentary scrutiny by the parliaments of the Member States and the European Parliament; 57. Stresses the importance of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which will bring about major progress towards a Security and Defence Union, in particular through: (a) the office of a European Foreign Minister who is at the same time Vice-President of the Commission; (b) the solidarity clause, for cases in which a Member State is affected by a terrorist attack, a natural disaster or a man-made disaster; (c) a clause on mutual assistance between Member States in the event of armed aggression against a Member State's territory; * * * 58. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Governments and Parliaments of the Member States and the Secretaries-General of the United Nations, NATO, the OSCE and the Council of Europe.

        "A. whereas, according to the report drawn up in 2002 by the Deutsches Notarinstitut at the Commission's request, between 50 000 and 100 000 transnational successions are opened every year in the European Union, B. whereas this estimate will obviously have to be revised upwards in the light of the recent accession of ten new Member States to the European Union and its forthcoming further enlargement, C. whereas at present there are significant differences between the Member States' systems of private international law and their respective substantive law on succession and wills, D. whereas those differences, in so far as they are capable of making it difficult and expensive for heirs to take possession of the estate, could create obstacles to the exercise of the freedom of movement and the freedom of establishment referred to in Articles 39 and 43 of the EC Treaty and the enjoyment of the right to own property, which is a general principle of Community law ( 1 ), E. whereas it would be advisable to draw up a Community legal instrument relating to private interna- tional law on successions and wills, as already called for in the 1998 Vienna action plan ( 2 ), the pro- gramme of measures for implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters ( 3 ), adopted by the Council and the Commission in 2000, the Hague Programme of 4 November 2004 for strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union, and the Council and Commission Action Plan implementing the Hague Programme on strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union ( 4 ), F. whereas the adoption of legislative initiatives dealing with succession and wills would appear to be consistent with the objectives of Community law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality and aims to foster the social integration of all individuals whose principal residence and centre of interests is situated in one of the Member States, regardless of their nationality, G. whereas, while the harmonisation of the Member States' substantive law on succession and wills falls outside the scope of the European Community's competence, the Community is competent, under point (b) of Article 65 of the EC Treaty, to adopt measures \u2018 promoting the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction \u2019 , H. whereas, pursuant to the second indent of Article 67(5) of the EC Treaty, any Community act dealing with succession and wills should be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Arti- cle 251 of the EC Treaty, I. whereas, when dealing with the subject of succession and wills, it is essential to uphold certain funda- mental tenets of public policy which impose limits on testamentary freedom for the benefit of a testa- tor's family or other dependants, 1. Calls on the Commission to submit to Parliament during the course of 2007 a legislative proposal under Article 65, point (b), and Article 67(5), second indent, of the EC Treaty in order to deal with succes- sion and wills; calls for that proposal to be drawn up in the light of interinstitutional discussion and in keeping with the detailed recommendations set out in the annex hereto; 2. Calls on the Commission, in the context of the current deliberations on the Civil Justice Funding Programme 2007-2013, to launch a call for proposals for an information campaign regarding cross-border wills and succession matters, targeted at legal practitioners in the field; 3.

Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Council and the Commission, and to the parliaments and governments of the Member States. ANNEX DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE SUBSTANCE OF THE REQUESTED PROPOSAL Recommendation 1 (on the form and minimum content of the instrument to be adopted) The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should aim to regulate succession exhaustively in private international law and at the same time: \u2014 harmonise the rules concerning jurisdiction, the applicable law (the \u2018 conflict rules \u2019 ) and the recognition and enforcement of judgments and public instruments issued abroad, except for the material substan- tive law and procedural law of the Member States; \u2014 introduce a \u2018 European Certificate of Inheritance \u2019 . Recommendation 2 (on the criteria for establishing jurisdiction and the objective connecting factor) The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should in principle ensure that \u2018 forum \u2019 and \u2018 ius \u2019 coincide and thus make it less difficult to apply foreign law. For those reasons, the European Parliament tends to prefer the habitual place of residence as the criterion for establishing both principal jurisdiction and the connecting factor, where habitual residence means either: (a) the habitual residence of the deceased at the time of his death, provided that it was his habitual place of residence for at least two years before his death, or, where it was not, (b) the place where the deceased had his main centre of interests at the time of his death. Recommendation 3 (on the freedom of choice to be accorded to individuals) The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should allow a degree of freedom of choice, in particular by permitting: \u2014 the parties concerned to choose, subject to certain conditions, the competent court, along the lines laid down in Articles 23 and 24 of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdic- tion and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( 1 ), \u2014 the testator to choose which law should govern the succession, the law of the country of which he is a national or the law of the country of his habitual residence at the time the choice is made; this choice should be indicated in a statement taking the form of a testamentary clause. Recommendation 4 (on the law applicable to the form of wills) The European Parliament is of the opinion that the legislative act to be adopted should lay down specific rules concerning the law applicable to the form of testamentary clauses \u2014 which clauses are to be regarded as valid if they are considered as such by the law of the State in which the testator drew them up, or by the law of the State in which the testator had his habitual residence at the time when he drew up the will or died, or by the law of one of the States of which the testator was a national at the time when he drew up the will or died. ( 1 ) OJ L 12, 16.1.2001, p. 1. C 314 E/344 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "Recommendation 5 (on the law applicable to agreements as to future successions) The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should lay down specific rules concerning the law applicable to agreements as to future successions, which should be regulated: (a) in the case of one individual's succession, by the law of the State in which that person has his habitual residence at the time the agreement is concluded; (b) in the case of several persons' succession, by the laws of each of the States in which each of those persons has his habitual residence at the time the agreement is concluded. For agreements as to future successions the legislative act to be adopted should also allow some scope for freedom of choice, permitting the parties to agree, by means of an explicit statement, that the agreement as to future successions is to be made subject to the law of the State in which the person or one of the persons involved has his habitual residence at the time when the agreement is concluded or of which he is a national at that time. Recommendation 6 (on general issues regarding the applicable law) The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should also deal with general issues regarding the applicable law. In particular, the European Parliament considers that: \u2014 the law specified in the legislative act to be adopted should be competent to cover, regardless of the nature and location of the estate, the whole succession, from the beginning of the procedure to the transmission of the inheritance to the persons entitled; \u2014 the legislative act to be adopted should be erga omnes, that is to say, applicable even if the designated law is the law of a third country; \u2014 for the purposes of coordinating the Community system of conflict rules governing succession with those of third countries, the legislative act to be adopted should lay down specific rules concerning renvoi, establishing that, where the law applicable to the succession is the law of a third country and that country's conflict rules designate the law of a Member State or the law of another third country which, according to the system of international private law, could also apply its own law to the case in question, the law of that other Member State or, if appropriate, of that other third country, should apply; \u2014 the legislative act to be adopted should specify the ways and means by which the authorities required to apply a foreign law are to ascertain its content, as well as the remedies in the event of failure to ascertain that content; \u2014 the legislative act to be adopted should make the settlement of a preliminary issue subject to the law designated by the relevant conflict rules of the law applicable to the succession, making it clear that the solution will be valid only as regards the proceedings in which the preliminary issue arises; \u2014 the legislative act to be adopted should specify that application of a provision of the applicable law may be ruled out if such application would produce an effect manifestly contrary to the public policy of the forum; \u2014 the legislative act to be adopted should specify that, where a State has two or more systems of law or sets of rules concerning succession and wills applicable in different territorial units, each territorial unit is to be considered as a country for the purposes of identifying the law applicable to the succession. Furthermore, the legislative act to be adopted should specify, with regard to such a State, that: (a) any reference to habitual residence in that State is to be construed as a reference to habitual residence in a territorial unit; (b) any reference to nationality is to be construed as a reference to the territorial unit designated by the law of that State. In the absence of such rules, the reference shall be construed as a reference to the legal system with which the person in question had the closest connection. 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/345 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "Recommendation 7 (on the European certificate of inheritance) The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted must aim to simplify the proce- dures to be followed by heirs and legatees in order to gain possession of the property comprising the estate, particularly by: \u2014 providing for rules of private international law to ensure effective coordination between legal systems with regard to the administration, liquidation and transmission of estates, as well as identification of heirs, with provisions stating: that these aspects of succession, subject to exceptions due to the nature or location of certain assets, are to be regulated by the law applicable to the succession; that if that law provides for the intervention of an authority indicated by the law itself, or appointed pursuant to it, that authority's powers shall be recognised in all the Member States; that, if the law applicable to the succession is the law of a Member State, the powers of such authorities are to extend, unless otherwise specified by the testator, to the whole estate, wherever it may be situated, even if, according to the law applicable to the succession, those powers are confined to movable property; that the measures relating to the activity of those authorities prescribed by the law applicable to the succession may be requested from the courts of the Member State the law of which is applicable to the succession or on the territory of which the deceased person had his habitual residence at the time of his death, or on the territory of which the property comprised in the estate is located; \u2014 introducing a \u2018 European certificate of inheritance \u2019 indicating, with binding effect, the law applicable to the succession, the beneficiaries of the estate, the persons responsible for administering the estate and their powers and the property comprising the estate, to be issued by an authority empowered to issue or authenticate official documents under the relevant national legislation. The certificate, which is to specify the law applicable to the succession, shall be drawn up in accordance with a standard model to be laid down in the legislative act to be adopted and shall constitute appropriate title on the basis of which the acquisition of the property inherited may be entered in a public register of the Member State in which the property is located, without prejudice to compliance with the rules of that Member State on the functioning of such registers and the effects resulting from the information contained therein. Furthermore, the legislative act to be adopted should ensure protection for third parties acting in good faith who, for valuable consideration, have entered into a contract with the person who appears to be entitled to dispose of the property comprised in the estate on the basis of the certificate, thereby safeguarding the acquisition thereof, unless that person knows that the details given in the certificate are inaccurate or the competent authority has taken steps to revoke or amend the certificate. Recommendation 8 (on the \u2018 lex loci rei sitae \u2019 and the \u2018 reserved portion \u2019 principle) The European Parliament considers that the legislative act to be adopted should: \u2014 ensure the coordination of the law applicable to the succession with the law of the place in which the property is situated, so as to make the latter applicable in particular as regards the procedures for acquiring the property comprised in the estate and any other tangible entitlements thereto, accepting or refusing the succession and the relevant formalities concerning publicity; \u2014 ensure that the law applicable to the succession does not affect the application of any provision of the State where certain immovable property, enterprises or other special categories of assets are located and whose rules institute a particular inheritance regime in respect of such assets on account of economic, family or social considerations; \u2014 ensure that the ability to choose the law applicable does not contravene the fundamental principles of reserving a proportion of the estate for the deceased person's closest relatives laid down by the law objectively applicable to the succession. Recommendation 9 (on trusts) The European Parliament points out that the rules on property ownership come under the competence of the Member States, pursuant to Article 295 of the Treaty, and therefore requests that the legislative act to be adopted should not apply to trusts. However, that act should specify that, when a trust is created as a result of death, the fact that the law specified by the instrument in question applies to the succession does not prevent another law from being applicable to management of the trust and that, by the same token, the fact that the law governing the trust applies to it should not prevent the law governing the succession by virtue of the legislative act to be adopted from being applicable to it.

        "Recommendation 10 (on \u2018 exequatur \u2019 ) The European Parliament suggests to the Commission that the legislative act to be adopted should, with regard to the recognition and enforcement of decisions, reproduce the system established by Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, which requires \u2018 exequatur \u2019 only in the event of a ruling made by the courts in one Member State having to be enforced on the basis of enforcement proceedings in another Member State. However, if a decision is to be entered in public registers, provision should be made, in view of the widely differing rules in the various Member States, for that decision to be accompanied by a \u2018 certificate of con- formity \u2019 with public policy and the imperatives of the Member State addressed, issued \u2014 in accordance with a standard form \u2014 by a local judicial authority. Recommendation 11 (on public instruments) The European Parliament considers that it is appropriate to regulate similar effects for public instruments relating to succession, which, in particular, should be recognised in all the Member States, by means of proof of the facts and of declarations by issuing authorities that the instruments were drawn up in their presence, where the law of the Member State of origin so provides. In accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, the document must meet all the require- ments of authenticity laid down in the Member State of origin, and will not be recognised if its recognition would produce an effect manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State addressed. Furthermore, when a public instrument is to be entered in public registers it should be specified, as stated in the case of judicial decisions, that the document has to be accompanied by a \u2018 certificate of conformity \u2019 with public policy and the imperatives of the Member State addressed, issued \u2014 in accordance with a standard form \u2014 by the authority competent to draw up the instrument in that country. Recommendation 12 (on the European network of registers of wills) The European Parliament hopes that, eventually, a European network of national registers of wills will be set up by linking up existing national registers, to simplify the task of finding and ascertaining the content of a deceased person's will.

Addresses the following recommendations to the Council: Legal framework and law enforcement (a) trafficking in human beings must be tackled by means of a coherent policy approach (migration, gender, employment, social, development, external, neighbourhood and visa policy) and consequent criminalisation, at least reaching the standards of EU legislation in accordance with Framework Deci- sion 2002/629/JHA; (b) calls upon the European Community to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings as soon as possible; urges the Commission to initiate without further delay the internal procedure making it possible for the European Community to sign and ratify this Convention; likewise asks the Council to take the decision to sign and ratify the Conven- tion, (c) the Commission and Member States should adopt a strategy for implementing the Action Plan, (d) the Council and Member States should strengthen the human rights-based, gender-equality and vic- tim-centred approach in implementing the Action Plan, (e) considers that an anti-discrimination approach to trafficking is required in addition to a human rights approach and that, therefore, references to equality and non-discrimination are critical, (f) Member States should, if they have not already done so, ratify and implement all relevant interna- tional Conventions, including the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, its supple- mentary Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children and the Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and their Families, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, International Labour Organisation Conventions and core labour standards, in particular No 29 con- cerning forced labour, No 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, and those relating to freedom of association, labour inspection and employment agencies, ( 1 ) Gabal, I.

        "A. whereas the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2005 was formally submitted to the President of Parliament on 13 March 2006 and the Ombudsman, Nikiforos Diamandouros, pre- sented his report on 3 May 2006 to its Committee on Petitions, B. whereas the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was proclaimed at the Nice Euro- pean Council on 7 December 2000 and whereas the political will exists to give it binding force in law, C. whereas Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights provides that \u2018 Every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union \u2019 , D. whereas Article 195 of the EC Treaty and Article 43 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights provide that \u2018 any citizen of the Union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State has the right to refer to the Ombudsman of the Union cases of maladministration in the activities of the Community institutions or bodies, with the exception of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance acting in their judicial role \u2019 , E. whereas it is essential that the Community institutions and bodies be equipped with the necessary budgetary resources in order to fulfil their obligations to ensure that citizens receive prompt and sub- stantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions, F. whereas the Ombudsman has advocated that all Community institutions and bodies pursue a common approach with regard to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and its resolution of 6 September 2001 ( 1 ) thereon, G. whereas 2005 saw the highest number of complaints to the European Ombudsman received so far ( 2 ), and whereas in 2005 the Ombudsman provided effective assistance in over 75 % of all cases referred to him, including inadmissible complaints, either by opening an inquiry into the case, transferring it to a competent body, or giving advice on where to turn for a prompt and effective solution to the problem; H. whereas, however, almost 70 % of all complaints received still fall outside the terms of reference of the Ombudsman and, in 93,7 % of cases, this is due to the fact that, in terms of content, they do not fall within those terms of reference since they are not directed against a Community institution or a Com- munity body, I. whereas the activities of the Ombudsman and its Committee on Petitions may overlap, in particular, where the Ombudsman is examining whether the conduct by the Commission of infringement pro- ceedings against a Member States has complied with general principles of EC law and good administra- tion, and its Committee on Petitions, at the same time, is examining petitions that allege infringements of Community law by that Member State on the same subject, J. whereas in 2005 the Ombudsman dealt with a total of 627 inquiries; and whereas the findings of the completed inquiries show that in 114 cases no maladministration could be ascertained; whereas 89 cases were settled by the institution or body itself following a complaint to the Ombudsman and 22 friendly solutions were proposed; K. whereas the Ombudsman's inquiries often produce positive results for complainants and help to improve the quality of administration through the adoption and implementation of suitable measures by the institutions and bodies concerned, L. whereas the Ombudsman submitted to Parliament three special reports in 2005; whereas submitting a special report to Parliament represents a valuable means by which the Ombudsman can seek the pol- itical support of Parliament and its Committee on Petitions in order to bring satisfaction to citizens whose rights have been infringed, and promotes the improvement of standards of European adminis- tration, M. whereas the largest number of inquiries into complaints concerned alleged lack of transparency; and whereas this is a matter of concern with respect to the democratic accountability of the Union; ( 1 ) OJ C 72 E, 21.3.2002, p. 331. ( 2 ) A total of 3920 or an increase of 5% over the previous year. However, 335 concerned the same subject and were dealt with in a single joint inquiry. C 314 E/366 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "N. whereas 68 % of the Ombudsman's inquiries concerned the Commission; whereas the Commission adopted new internal procedures on 4 October 2005 for responding to the Ombudsman's inquiries, O. whereas in 2005 the Ombudsman continued to build constructive working relations with other Com- munity institutions and bodies through meetings and joint events; whereas in 2005 the Ombudsman continued to extend and energise the European Network of Ombudsmen by developing information exchanges and the sharing of best practice; whereas its Committee on Petitions participates in this Network; P. whereas in 2005, the institution of the Ombudsman marked its tenth anniversary; whereas the Ombudsman's communication activities on the occasion of that anniversary had the objective of raising citizens' awareness of their rights and of how to exercise those rights and of the terms of reference of the Ombudsman, 1. Considers that the Ombudsman has continued successfully to pursue the objectives of enhancing the effectiveness of his institution towards promoting good administration and respect for the rule of law and human rights; 2. Regards the role of the Ombudsman in enhancing openness and accountability in the decision-making processes and administration of the European Union as an essential contribution towards a Union in which decisions are taken \u2018 as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen \u2019 , as provided for by Article 1(2) of the Treaty on European Union; 3. Would welcome a tightening up of internal parliamentary procedures in order to guarantee in future swifter processing of the Ombudsman's annual report by its Committee on Petitions; 4. Calls upon all Community institutions and bodies to be equipped with the necessary budgetary resources in order to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions; 5. Repeats its call as expressed in previous resolutions for all Community institutions and bodies to adopt a common approach with regard to a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour on the basis of its above- mentioned resolution of 6 September 2001; 6. Agrees with the Ombudsman that the manner and method by which an administration responds to legitimate complaints are the yardstick for the degree of proximity to the citizen of the institutions and bodies and that there is still much room for improvement; 7. Welcomes the fact that, even in cases where no maladministration could be ascertained, the complai- nants were provided with assistance and the inquiry was at the same time used as an opportunity to improve the quality of administration; 8. Declares its satisfaction with the public profile of the Ombudsman, whose aim is to provide the public with information, and considers that information of quality may help to reduce the number of complaints which do not fall within the Ombudsman's terms of reference; at the same time, calls on the Ombudsman to forward immediately those complaints which do not fall within his terms of reference by way of the most appropriate network, from the subsidiarity point of view, at national and local level; 9. Welcomes the generally constructive cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Community insti- tutions and bodies and endorses him in his role of external control mechanism and, in addition, as a valuable source of ongoing improvement to European administration; 10. Notes that the Ombudsman has submitted three special reports, two of which have already been considered by Parliament, while consideration of the remaining report can now commence on the conclu- sion of judicial procedures; 11. Is convinced that the necessary adaptation of the Ombudsman's Statute of 9 March 1994, as already called for in its Committee on Petitions' last report on the Ombudsman's annual report for 2004, should be carried out as soon as possible; welcomes the Ombudsman's submission to the President of Parliament of a substantive proposal for such adaptation on 11 July 2006; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/367 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "12. Appreciates the Ombudsman's good cooperation with its Committee on Petitions; 13. Stresses the need, however, for a clear definition and demarcation of the role of the European Ombudsman vis-\u00e0-vis the role of its Committee on Petitions and urges the Ombudsman to continue to remain within his terms of reference when seeking to assist citizens; 14. Considers, nevertheless, that when the Ombudsman and its Committee on Petitions, acting within their respective mandates and competences, investigate overlapping issues, such as, respectively, the manner in which the Commission has conducted infringement proceedings and the alleged infringement itself, they can achieve useful synergy through close cooperation; 15. Calls on the European Ombudsman to exercise ex officio his powers of scrutiny with a view to ensuring transparency and the proper functioning of all recruitment procedures, whether carried out through the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) or directly through a European body, including the Ombudsman's own personnel service; 16. Welcomes the special report on the openness of meetings of the Council when acting in its legisla- tive capacity and calls on the Council to comply with its abovementioned resolution of 4 April 2006 and, in future, for all the meetings in which it acts in its legislative capacity to be open and accessible to the public; 17. Calls on future Council presidencies, as part of the efforts to boost transparency, to do their best to provide Internet pages in all the official languages of the EU (in accordance with Annex I to the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Brussels on 15-16 June 2006) in order to allow and facilitate access to its activities for as many citizens as possible; 18. Proposes also, as part of the efforts to achieve greater proximity to the citizen, that the entry portal http://europa.eu be established as the uniform entry page for all Community institutions in order to ensure a better overview for citizens of institutional arrangements, allocation of responsibilities and decision-mak- ing procedures within the European Union through as clear and simple a structure as possible and to avoid unnecessary confusion from sites existing in parallel; 19. Welcomes the introduction of new internal procedures at the Commission as the main body con- cerned with answering inquiries from the Ombudsman, whereby individual Commissioners assume sponsor- ship for a specific case, and calls on the Commission to introduce this kind of procedure for the processing of petitions as well; 20. Welcomes the European Network of Ombudsmen and the collaboration between the European Ombudsman and ombudsmen and similar bodies at national, regional and local levels in the Member States and urges further strengthening of the exchange of best practice; 21. Calls on the Ombudsman to inform its Committee on Petitions at regular intervals about his activ- ities in the Member States and his contacts with the national Ombudsmen; 22. Welcomes, in particular, the special written procedure whereby national or regional ombudsmen receive written answers to queries about Community law and its interpretation via the European Ombuds- man as a valuable contribution towards better transposition and application of Community law; 23. Encourages the European Ombudsman to continue to place great emphasis on events involving citizens and, hence, potential complainants, since clearly the demarcation of responsibilities and decision- making processes between the European, national and regional levels are still too hard to grasp for many citizens and businesses; 24. Acknowledges the efforts of the Ombudsman to enhance the citizens' awareness of their rights to lodge a complaint with the Ombudsman; however, urges him in the light of the large number of complaints falling outside his terms of reference to intensify his efforts to provide clear information about those terms of reference on a more regular basis; C 314 E/368 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "25. Welcomes the increasing participation of the media in publicising the work of the Ombudsman; 26. Approves the annual report for 2005 presented by the European Ombudsman and appreciates, in particular, the detailed breakdown of complaints by procedure adopted, nature of alleged maladministration, institution concerned, etc; 27. Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the report of its Committee on Petitions to the Council, the Commission, the European Ombudsman, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and their ombudsmen or similar competent bodies.

        "A. whereas communication is an important element of both representative and participatory democracy, B. whereas, for this reason, one of the strengths of the democratic elements of the EU is connected to communication structures at the European level which link the institutions with citizens, C. whereas the right to information and freedom of expression should be at the heart of democracy in Europe and underpin the political systems at European and national levels and thus, insofar as possible, information should be made available to the public, D. whereas the experience of European elections and referenda is that those who were aware and inter- ested in EU issues were more likely to participate, whereas those lacking information were less likely to do so, E. whereas there is no consolidated European public sphere at present but very lively national public spheres; whereas those national public spheres reveal deep variations as regards the range and content of the debate on European issues, F. whereas it would be an important improvement if in the national public spheres European issues were more prominent, G. whereas in order to create a European public sphere, a first step would be to overcome the isolation of national spheres through European communicative action; whereas this is closely related to pan-Euro- pean or at least transnational media structures, H. whereas there is clear evidence of under-information of citizens on European issues, as reflected in the results of various Eurobarometer polls, I. whereas communication is also linked to the issue of transparency, simplified procedures, citizenship and shared values, J. whereas European issues and the added value of Community legislation are rarely acknowledged during national debates, with national politicians often taking credit for European success stories while, con- versely, being quick to criticise the EU, often for failures in policy that arise at national level, K. whereas the Brussels European Council of 16 and 17 June 2006 put the issue of institutional reform back on the agenda, L. whereas the aim of a \u2018 period of reflection \u2019 is to make the Union more democratic and effective and to \u2018 reconnect \u2019 it with its citizens, Communication policy and the European public sphere 1. Welcomes the presentation of the White Paper and endorses the Commission's intentions to make communication policy a policy in its own right; 2. Sees the need to improve communication between the EU and its citizens; therefore supports the attempt to overhaul the way communication with citizens is organised; stresses that better communication cannot compensate for inadequate policies but can improve the understanding of the policies conducted; 3. Welcomes the Commission's recognition of the fact that communication can never be divorced from what is being communicated and that it should be a two-way process that involves listening to citizens, but regrets that these principles, asserted at the beginning of the White Paper, do not find any practical expres- sion; calls on the Commission, therefore, to specify how it intends to take into account citizens' views and suggests, to this end, that possible initiatives launched by other institutions, such as \u2018 Agora \u2019 , a body that Parliament has decided to set up for the purpose of consultation with civil society representatives, are incorporated; C 314 E/370 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "4. Urges the Commission to support the creation of a European public sphere, primarily structured through national, local and regional media, though without losing sight of the important role played by quality national and regional newspapers and television news in dedicating sufficient coverage to European affairs; and to that end, calls on the Member States to encourage the national public audiovisual channels adequately to inform the citizens about the policies conducted at European level; 5. Notes that the aim of a European communication policy should not be the creation of a communica- tion sphere that competes with the national public spheres, but rather a close alignment of national debates with the debates at EU level; 6. Urges the Commission to take into consideration the concrete proposals set out in its above-men- tioned resolution of 12 May 2005 when designing a communication policy; Definition of common principles 7. Supports the idea of setting up a two-way communication between the EU and its citizens, which is able and willing to listen more closely to what citizens wish to say about Europe; points out, however, that the idea of citizens becoming drivers of participation and dialogue does not seem reasonable, since it is not citizens who should seek out information, but rather information that should seek out the citizens; 8. Does not consider it appropriate to submit Parliament to a code of conduct that regulates its commu- nication with EU citizens; 9. Asks the Commission to propose a draft interinstitutional agreement defining the common principles that could channel cooperation between the European institutions as regards communication; 10. Urges the Commission to explore the possibility of launching of a genuine Community programme, for information and communication on Europe, in order to improve existing interinstitutional partnership mechanisms in this field; states that should the Commission come forward with a corresponding proposal, Parliament will be fully involved in defining and framing the precise content and scope of the programme; 11. Is of the opinion that stronger reference be made to the principles and values enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights in order to determine the scope of a European communication policy; 12. Stresses that the Charter of Fundamental Rights already lays down citizens' rights regarding informa- tion and that any new instrument should respect the prerogatives of Parliament as an elected assembly, in particular its power to freely address citizens from across the Union; calls for its Committee on Constitu- tional Affairs to examine the possible form and content of an interinstitutional instrument of this kind; 13. Points to the importance of a Constitution for Europe to make the Union more political and demo- cratic and capable of attracting citizens; points out that Parliament, the Council, and the Commission have a political responsibility to support this process; Reinforcing the role of citizens 14. Welcomes the desire shown by the Commission to take Europe to all levels, in other words, to communicate European issues to national, regional and local level in order to decentralise the message, and insists on the need for such communication to take place on a very regular basis; welcomes the Com- mission's Action Plan and expects its prompt implementation; 15. Considers that the development of a local European administration, able to support the numerous existing European Union information points, would help to form strong direct links between the Union and its citizens, in particular by improving citizens' access to the European initiatives and programmes that affect 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/371 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "them; believes that the Commission's and Parliament's information offices in the Member States play an important role in this connection; sees a need in this connection for a thoroughgoing review and rethink of the work carried out to date in the Member States by these information offices, since their public rela- tions activities do not appeal to citizens and the resources earmarked for them could be used far more efficiently; feels, therefore, that they should be more political and less bureaucratic; 16. Welcomes the transparency initiative launched by the Commission in November 2005, which stres- ses that high standards of transparency are part of the legitimacy of any modern administration; the Euro- pean public is entitled to expect efficient, accountable and service-minded public institutions; 17. Sees regions and cities as the most suitable platforms for promoting the idea of Europe among citizens and calls for the involvement of the Committee of the Regions in the implementation of a future communication policy; 18. Supports the idea of enhancing debates in national and regional parliaments; 19. Encourages the national parliaments to enhance the scrutiny role of their governments when they act at the Council, thus raising awareness and thereby the democratic accountability of the EU institutions; 20. Stresses that national parliaments should strive to pay more attention to European legislative projects much earlier in the decision-making process; 21. Draws attention to the Presidency Conclusions of the Conference of the Speakers of European Union Parliaments (Budapest, 6 and 7 May 2005), which called upon the national parliaments to hold an annual debate, preferably in plenary session, on the Commission's annual legislative and work programme; 22. Points to the importance of convening interparliamentary forums on the future of Europe, one of which will be meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome; calls, as far as European communication policy is concerned, for the discussions among the representatives of the European people to be taken into account; 23. Underlines the importance of civic education on EU integration; considers that having a certain level of understanding about Europe is a prerequisite for successful interactive communication with the EU, and for contributing to a sense of European citizenship; 24. Regrets that support for sectoral programmes with a strong multiplier effect such as Leonardo da Vinci, Socrates and Erasmus has been cut, since they accentuate the European dimension and facilitate the establishment of transnational networks; 25. Is of the opinion that in order to reach the citizen, it is important to communicate better and show the relevance and impact of EU decisions for daily life through cooperation with regional and local institu- tions; suggests that emphasis be placed on communicating regularly to the citizens about relevant regional and local projects in which the EU has participated, with the objective of favouring a common European project; 26. Considers that the debate should take into account the specific needs and activities of disabled people and minority groups as well as national and local audiences and specific target groups; points out that more attention should be paid to channelling relevant, as well as regionalised information, to defined target audiences, thereby connecting European issues with citizens' daily lives; 27. Welcomes the initiatives taken by certain Commission representations and by national administra- tions so as to collaborate on EU-related information campaigns; points out that such collaboration could contribute to the creation of a more direct link between citizens and institutions; C 314 E/372 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "28. Calls on the Commission to ensure consultation with stakeholders and the public at an early stage of policy shaping; considers that key proposals could be accompanied by an additional section in the impact assessment specifying how citizens' concerns have been taken into account when drafting the proposal; points out that the impact of public consultations on the EU's decision-making process should be clarified; 29. Calls on the Commission to develop a dynamic and reactive communication policy, which, instead of mostly reporting the final consensus achieved, is more focused on reporting the evolution of decisions that are adopted at different stages in the decision-making process; considers that the aim of the Union's com- munication policy is to give citizens a clear understanding of how European law is made; Working with the media and new technologies 30. Stresses the importance of the media as intermediaries, opinion formers, and carriers of messages to the citizen in the European public sphere which the Commission is aiming to develop; in that context, urges the Commission to support concrete initiatives such as discussion forums on European cultural and political issues where materials would be available in several languages so that many European citizens could interact and exchange; 31. Emphasises that the informed citizen is the basis of a functioning participatory democratic system; 32. Asks the Commission to define, with the greatest precision possible, which role it would like to assign to the media and stresses the need to find a formula that involves national, regional and local media more closely in communication policy, for which the use of alternative media as a communication channel should also be considered; 33. Takes the view that cross-border cooperation on European policy projects between regional and local media must be stepped up; believes that European cooperation between media and journalists benefits reporting on the European Union, and asks the Commission to set up, as part of the budget, a European Fund for (Investigative) Journalism that supports projects in which journalists from several Member States together explore a European subject in depth and apply it to the differences in local and regional situations; 34. Welcomes the withdrawal of the proposal on the creation of an EU news agency; 35. Recommends that the Commission use clear and concise language when communicating with the media and citizens, and that it does so systematically in the official languages of their Member State of origin or residence; believes that EU jargon increases rather than closes the gap between the EU institutions and citizens; 36. Recommends the creation of regular exchanges of views on European communication matters between the European institutions, particularly Parliament, and the media; 37. Sees it as the responsibility of the Commission in general, and the Member States in particular, to provide objective, reliable and impartial information on European policies as a basis for well-informed debate; accordingly calls on the latter to improve efforts to inform the Member States' civil servants about policies conducted at European level; 38. Welcomes the fact that with respect to the new technologies, the White Paper is in line with Parlia- ment's last report on the EU information and communication strategy; 39. Welcomes the Commission's proposals for a better use of new communication technologies, but calls for measures to be taken to prevent the \u2018 digital divide \u2019 making access to information about the Union even more difficult for a section of the population; underlines the need, in the interests of ensuring a coherent approach, to incorporate the means of communication peculiar to each institution, such as Parliament's planned \u2018 Web TV \u2019 , while respecting its autonomy; maintains also that the traditional mass media, such as television, must be turned to account; 21.12.2006 EN C 314 E/373 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "Understanding European public opinion 40. Asks the Commission to inform Parliament about the assessment of the consultation it has under- taken; 41. Sees as questionable the establishment of an Observatory for European Public Opinion in the short term and considers that before such a task is carried out, more coordinated use should be made of the data and resources already available; 42. Notes that no satisfactory communication policy is possible without exact knowledge of the gaps in the information which Union citizens have, whether relating to the substance of Community action or to the institutions and procedures that serve to implement it; calls, therefore for Eurobarometer personnel to be instructed to carry out an exhaustive specific opinion survey in order to gauge exactly how well informed Community citizens are, distinguishing them according to their country of origin, socio-profes- sional category, and political leanings; Collaboration 43. Asks the Commission to draw up concrete proposals for the implementation of the communication policy and to evaluate its legal and financial implications; 44. Considers that the work of the Interinstitutional Group on Information (IGI) should be analysed to see if improvements are possible; 45. Stresses the need for closer involvement of pan-European political parties in dialogue with their constituencies on EU matters; 46. Attaches special importance to the role of political parties in sustaining parliamentary democracy at all levels; regrets that the potential of the transnational political parties remains unfulfilled; deplores the reluctance of many national political parties to embrace the European dimension in a coherent or convin- cing way; urges political parties to address EU politics in their policy-making and electoral campaigning, and to promote on behalf of the citizen real political choices about the future of Europe; 47. Emphasises that a communication policy must take into account the \u2018 pace \u2019 of European affairs, which is often far removed from that of national political agendas, and cannot really develop separately from the specific Union policies and measures, which each have their own particular timetable; considers that the Commission, the Council, and Parliament should agree on a timetable for the key issues likely to be of more direct interest to the different sections of European public opinion in order to channel their communication efforts into these subjects; 48. Calls on the institutions to examine the possibility of setting up a second-level coordination group, on which the competent DGs of the various institutions and representatives of Parliament's committees are represented, to coordinate the specific activities implementing the guidelines laid down by the IGI; 49. Reiterates that the European Union is often viewed as a single whole by citizens, who are not thought to understand the finer distinctions between the institutions, and that the respective communication policies of each institution should therefore be coordinated in a joint approach, while respecting the respon- sibilities and autonomy of each of them; repeats its call for a large-scale annual interinstitutional debate to be held in plenary for the purpose of adopting a joint declaration on the objectives and means of imple- menting this policy; 50. Endorses the strengthening of dialogue, and jointly organised public debates, among the European institutions and national and regional bodies; stresses the importance of basing communication on initia- tives promoted through popular communication channels such as cultural programmes (literary or film prizes), sporting events etc.; considers that communication should not lose sight of the strategic need to be aimed at \u2018 target audiences \u2019 such as universities, local and regional authorities, or professional associations; C 314 E/374 EN 21.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 16 November 2006 ",
        "51. Supports the strengthening of the role of the European Ombudsman in giving greater credibility to transparency; 52. Points out that the Prince Programme has traditionally been based on a partnership between the Commission and the Member States; in its most recent report on the EU's communication strategy Parlia- ment underlined the need for parliamentary involvement in establishing the Prince Programme's priorities, and therefore takes the view that its Members should be fully involved in the events organised under the programme's auspices; 53. Recommends increasing the appropriations allocated to existing funding programmes for the pur- pose of better communication of European integration, such as Lifelong Learning, Youth, Europe for Citi- zens, Media, and Culture, provided that the objectives of the individual programmes are fully respected; 54. Supports replacing the five budgetary lines for the Prince Programme that exist at present with a single programme run by the Directorate-General for Communication, as this would bring greater flexibility and a central interlocutor; 55. Maintains that the financial support granted by Union needs to be made as visible as possible and hence that every institution, association, or scheme subsidised under a Union programme should be obliged to publicise the aid received; 56. Stresses that for successful communication, the active involvement of the Member States is essential and therefore invites them to find the technical and financial means for contributing to the joint commu- nicative efforts of the EU; 57. Urges the Member States to transpose Community legislation appropriately and promptly in order to ensure that all EU citizens enjoy the same level of rights as conferred by Community legislation; calls on the Commission to ensure more actively that provisions of Community legislation are applied; encourages the Commission to work in partnership with Member States' governments to inform citizens of their right of access to justice and redress should their rights be infringed; 58. Calls on the Commission to prioritise better its communication partnerships by pursuing special relationships with partners with a \u2018 transnational mission \u2019 , such as the organisations representing the emer- ging European civil society, European political parties and journalists; affirms the importance of including media aimed at young people, with a view to consolidating a European citizenship area; 59. Points to the need to adapt and further the strategies and substantive areas set out in the White Paper, taking into account the ongoing debates in European society and among the Member States; * * * 60.
