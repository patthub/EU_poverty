        "1 Summary: Performance in research and innovation The indicators in the table below present a synthesis of research and innovation (R&I) performance in Switzerland. They relate knowledge investment and input to performance and economic output throughout the innovation cycle. They show thematic strengths in key technologies and also the high-tech and medium-tech contribution to the trade balance. The indicator on excellence in science and technology takes into consideration the quality of scientific production as well as technological development. The Innovation Output Indicator covers technological innovation, skills in knowledge-intensive activities, the competitiveness of knowledge-intensive goods and services, and the innovativeness of fast-growing enterprises, focusing on innovation output. The indicator on knowledge-intensity of the economy focuses on the economy\u2019s sectoral composition and specialisation and shows the evolution of the weight of knowledge-intensive sectors and products. Switzerland The challenge of structural change maintaining a leading competitive economy Switzerland\u2019s level of economic development is amongst the highest in Europe. Swiss research policy is characterised by continuity and stability and the country performs better in R&D than both the EU (average) and the United States. Switzerland had an R&D intensity of 2.87 % in 2008 (the latest available year) with an R&D intensity average annual growth rate of 1.9 % in the period 2000-2008, both of which are higher than the corresponding values for the EU (2.03 % and 0.8 %) and the US (2.75 % and 0.2 %). The high level of R&D performance is accompanied by a high level of S&T excellence with Switzerland performing at a level twice the EU average. It is one of the most advanced countries in terms of the knowledge-intensity of its economy, and made even further progress over the years 2007-2012. The country performs well in all indicators relating to the size of the knowledge economy. There is also a high performance on the cumulative inward and outward FDI stock as a share of GDP, relative specialisation in the exports of medium-high-tech and high-tech products (Revealed Competitive Advantage) and the share of value added in knowledge-intensive activities within the country\u2019s total value added. The contribution of high-tech (HT) and medium- high-tech (MT) products to the country\u2019s trade balance is much higher than the corresponding contributions in the EU as a whole and the US. It is based on a very good performance by the knowledge-intensive sectors of the economy and includes sectors such as medicaments and vaccines, watches, and orthopaedic appliances. 1 Composite indicator that includes PCT per population, ERC grants per public R&D, top universities and research institutes per GERD and highly cited publications per total publications. 2 Composite indicator that includes R&D, skills, sectoral specialisation, international specialisation and internationalisation sub-indicators.

        "2 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Investing in knowledge The Swiss research system is of high quality and based on a clear-cut separation between the public sector, which is centred on very-research-intensive universities, and the private sector, which is focused on the large research units within multinational companies. The main priority for Swiss national R&I policies is to provide excellent framework conditions by fostering basic as well as applied research and technology transfer. Switzerland has one of the highest R&D intensities both in Europe and in the world, with a value of 2.87 % in 2008. Over the last decade, R&D intensity grew at an average annual rate of 1.9 %, well above the EU rate of 0.8 % and, if this trend continues, will reach 3.60 % in 2020. Almost 74 % of R&D is performed by the private sector. This is due to the specific structure of the Swiss economy which is dominated by large multinational companies with their own global strategies. Swiss research policy focuses mainly on the quality of the public research sector and on the training of skilled researchers. An important trend in public R&D expenditure is the increasing R&D expenditure for universities. As a result, over the period 2000-2010, total higher education expenditure on R&D increased in real terms at an average annual rate of 5 %. In 2008, higher education expenditure on R&D as a percentage of total expenditure on R&D in Switzerland was approximately the same as the EU average (CH: 24.2 % vs. EU: 23.0 %). The share of new doctoral graduates per thousand population aged 25-34 years increased from 2.7 % in 2002 to 3.5 % in 2011, a value which is more than twice the EU average. Switzerland\u2019s competitive R&I system is maintained by intensive and successful scientific activity, as shown by a high share of scientific publications within the 10 % most-cited scientific publication worldwide (16.4 % in 2009), a high number of international scientific co-publications per million population (2894 in 2012), a high level of PCT patent applications per billion GDP (7.9 in 2010) and a high level of licensing and patent revenues from abroad as a % of GDP (3.24 % in 2012). Switzerland has a good tradition of participating in international research programmes at the European level. Its success rate for participants in the EU\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) was 25 %. The successful participants received a total financial contribution from the EU of EUR 1.7 billion.

        "3 An effective research and innovation system building on the European Research Area The graph below illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of Switzerland\u2019s R&I system. Reading clockwise, it provides information on human resources, scientific production, technology valorisation and innovation. Average annual growth rates from 2007 to the latest available year (2012) are given in brackets. The Swiss R&I system is characterised by very strong scientific and technological production that outperforms the EU on almost all the indicators analysed in the graph above, making Switzerland an innovation leader. One weakness in Switzerland\u2019s R&I system, compared to the group of reference countries, is in the field of researchers employed by business enterprises. However, this number has increased significantly in recent years. However, the number of graduates in the fields of science and engineering per thousand population aged 25-34 years has declined over the period 2007-2012, creating a growing gap in the supply of graduates in these fields. Another challenge facing the Swiss R&I system is improving the curricula for education and training in relation Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: DG Research and Innovation, Eurostat, OECD, Science-Metrix/Scopus (Elsevier), Innovation Union Scoreboard.

Although business expenditure on R&D (BERD) as a percentage of total expenditure on R&D is very high in Switzerland (73.5 %), the share of business expenditure financed from abroad is lower than both the EU average and Switzerland\u2019s reference group of countries, probably as a result of the abundance of financial resources within the country. Switzerland outperforms both the EU and its reference group of countries in terms of production of scientific publications, public-private scientific co-publications, share of foreign doctoral students among all doctoral students, and its share of employment in knowledge-intensive activities in total employment aged 15-64 years.

Both the specialisation index (SI, based on the number of publications) and the revealed technological advantage (RTA, based on the number of patents) measure the country\u2019s scientific (SI) and technological (RTA) capacity compared to that at the world level. For each specialisation field it provides information on the growth rate in the number of publications and patents. As illustrated in the graph above, there is a notable difference in performance between scientific production (publications) and technological production (patents) in Switzerland. As regards publications, the country shows specialisation in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnologies, environment, and health. With reference to revealed technological advantage as measured by patents (technological output), Switzerland has obvious strengths in health and food and, to a lesser extent, biotechnology, materials, new production technologies, and other transport technologies. 0 1.2 0.2 1.4 0.4 1.6 0.6 0.8 1.8 1 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Science-Metrix Canada; Bocconi University, Italy Notes: ( 1 ) Values over 1 show specialisation; values under 1 show a lack of specialisation.

        "6 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Switzerland is a very good performer in the European innovation indicator. This is the result of a good performance in all components except knowledge-intensive service exports. However, recently its performance has not improved further. Good performance in patents is explained by the above-average share of patent-intensive industries (pharmaceuticals, medical technology, biotechnology, ICT) and the relatively high number of large manufacturing companies headquartered in Switzerland and carrying out research and patenting in the country as a result of a well- performing research system. Switzerland\u2019s good performance in knowledge- intensive activities is explained by the importance of its financial, insurance, and legal and accounting services, as well as activities performed by head offices, consultancies and other professional, scientific and technical activities in its economy. As a result of strong exports of pharmaceutical products, watches and machinery, Switzerland performs above the EU average as regards the share of medium-high and/high-tech goods in total goods exports. Figures for services exports are incomplete and the Swiss performance in this area must be analysed carefully. Switzerland has high financial and insurance services exports, but also has a high share of trade-related services, royalties and licence fees, which are classified as non-KIS. Innovation Output Indicator The Innovation Output Indicator, launched by the European Commission in 2013, was developed at the request of the European Council to benchmark national innovation policies and to monitor the EU\u2019s performance against its main trading partners. It measures the extent to which ideas stemming from innovative sectors are capable of reaching the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. The indicator focuses on four policy axes: growth via technology \u2013 (patents); jobs (knowledge- intensive employment); long-term global competitiveness (trade in mid-/high-tech commodities); and future business opportunities (jobs in innovative fast-growing firms). The graph below enables a comprehensive comparison of Switzerland\u2019s position regarding the indicator\u2019s different components. 2012 2010 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Eurostat, OECD, Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014, DG JRC Notes: All data refer to 2012 except PCT data, which refer to 2010.
