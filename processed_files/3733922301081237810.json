        "7 E XECUTIVE SUMMARY In the second RCM report on Ireland, published in 2018 , the Irish State\u2019s acknowledgement, in March 2017, of the distinct ethnic status of the Traveller community was positively assessed. 1 It was hoped that recognition would serve as the impetus to give a renewed focus to addressing key inequalities for this community, most notably in the areas of accommodation and health. Regrettably, the situation in regard to homelessness in the Traveller community and health outcomes for Travellers, particularly in the area of mental health, appear to have worsened in this period. The worsening homelessness and housing crisis in Ireland continues to dominate public and policy discourse. The most recent official homeless figures available indicate that 1,733 families, encompassing 3,826 children, were homeless during the week of 21-27 October 2019. 2 It is estimated that the number of homeless families has increased by 380 percent since 2014. 3 Travellers are significantly overrepresented in the homeless population, as evidenced in Census 2016. Census data, however, do not capture the additional numbers of Travellers and the number of Roma who are the hidden homeless. These include: Travellers and Roma living in overcrowded accommodation; and Travellers living in unserviced halting sites or in caravans on the side of the road. Local authorities, with responsibility for delivering Traveller Accommodation Programmes (TAPs), continue to significantly underspend on their ring-fenced budgets for these developments, such that, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, in June 2019, announced its intention to issue notice to each of the thirty-one county and city councils to undertake an equality review of their provision under the TAPs. The implementation of the NTRIS is piecemeal and based on small scale projects or pilots. In addition, progress is dependent on individual champions and on one government department. While it is showing some signs of progress, for example, in relation to a forthcoming National Traveller Health Action Plan, and funding for a Roma Primary Health Care Programme, the challenge will be to mainstream issues at the same time as developing targeted approaches. However, in the absence of targets, indicators, outcomes, timeframes or associated budget lines, progress has been hampered. In addition, there are key gaps in the NTRIS, notably: the absence of actions to address accommodation and housing issues for Roma; and the absence of strategic education actions, such as a commitment to develop a national Traveller education strategy. The lack of progress to develop targeted national policies to address Traveller education and health inequalities, despite a wealth of data providing evidence of such inequalities, points to two evident failures. The first is a failure, at government cross-departmental level, to prioritise the development of targeted strategies for socially excluded minority ethnic groups. The second is a systemic failure, whereby responsibility for leading the development of such targeted strategies is devolved or, in the case of the Department of Education and Skills, where, aside from some small scale, but welcome, actions underway, 1 The first annual cycle of the Roma Civil Monitor was focused on the horizontal precondition of the Roma inclusion \u2013 governance, fight against antigypsyism and anti-discrimination. The second cycle concerned the four key policy fields \u2013 education, employment, healthcare and housing.

It should be noted that official homeless figures are a underrepresentation of the actual number of individuals and families who are homeless, as these figures do not include: people sharing and couch-surfing, people who are rough sleeping, or women in crisis refuge accommodation. 3 Focus Ireland: website briefing: why are so many becoming homeless.

        "C IVIL SOCIETY MONITORING REPORT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE N ATIONAL T RAVELLER AND R OMA I NCLUSION S TRATEGY in Ireland 8 there is no apparent appetite to develop a national Traveller education strategy, and it appears that responsibility for addressing Roma and Traveller education issues has been transferred, from the Department of Education and Skills, to the Department of Justice and Equality, under the auspices of a NTRIS education sub-committee. The lack of national disaggregated ethnicity data continues to hamper the development of evidence-based national strategies, legislation, policies and services. Some welcome progress has been made: from 2021, the population Census will include Roma as a distinct ethnic group. 4 In addition, some government departments and agencies have shown leadership in working in partnership with Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre to implement ethnic equality monitoring, including primary schools, prisons, some health services, homeless services and social inclusion and equality programmes. 5 Aside from these examples, however, ethnic equality monitoring in Ireland remains the exception rather than the norm and as a result, policy, planning and national strategies continue to be developed in the absence of evidence regarding the situation and experience of Travellers and Roma. The focus of this third RCM report on Ireland centres on the following three thematic areas: Travellers\u2019 and Roma\u2019s homelessness In the context of a worsening national housing, accommodation and homelessness crisis, Travellers and Roma are specifically vulnerable to homelessness. The persistent failure of local authorities to develop Traveller-specific accommodation in their geographical areas and consequently, their significant underspend in this regard, is a key barrier to addressing homelessness and accommodation insecurity for Travellers. The findings and recommendations of a Government appointed expert group on the operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, and their related recommendations, need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. 6 There are a number of key recommendations, proposed in the expert group report, that, if implemented, would have a significant impact in regard to addressing failures, at local authority-level, for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation. In regard to housing and accommodation issues for Roma, the NTRIS needs to be amended to include specific actions in the area of accommodation and housing for Roma. Lack of needed targeted policies The Government \u2019s departments responsible of strategic national responses to address the significant equality gap between the Traveller and Roma communities on one hand, and the majority population on the other hand, have failed over an extended period of time, to develop and complete needed targeted policies in key domains. In this regard, we specifically examine the areas of health policy and education policy. The evidence, collected over the last decade, conclusively attests to the significant health and education equality gap between the Traveller community and the majority population. In the area of health, the evidence points to a crisis, with higher than average suicide 4 Since 2006 the Census has included Travellers as a distinct group. 5 Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre (2015) Policy and Practice in Ethnic Data Collection and Monitoring: Counting Us In, Human Rights Count.

        "E XECUTIVE SUMMARY 9 rates among the Traveller community. Despite this mounting evidence there are two crucial issues evident: \u2022 a failure to prioritise and respond: whereby, despite mounting evidence of health and education inequality, there is an absence of proportionate, appropriate and targeted responses from the Department of Education and Skills across virtually all levels of education 7 , and in regard to health, while the HSE is moving towards a NTHAP strategy, 8 there is an urgent need for stronger leadership in the Department of Health, at a policy level, to drive the NTHAP, and \u2022 a systemic failure, involving a shifting of responsibility from the Department of Health to the HSE, and from the Department of Education and Skills to other agencies or government departments. In the area of education, this systemic failure is also evident in regard to inadequate specifications, within the NTRIS, to commit the Department of Education and Skills to develop a Traveller and Roma education strategy and implementation plan. The Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills must take a leadership role in developing and implementing targeted Traveller and Roma specific policies and ensure that such policies are mainstreamed within the work of the Departments and fully reflected in mainstream policy initiatives. The National Traveller Health Action Plan must be published as a matter of urgency, and with the establishment of an institutional mechanism created within the HSE and Department of Health to drive its delivery and implementation. The plan must include clear targets, indicators, outcomes, timeframes and budget lines. It is imperative that there is political oversight and accountability for the implementation of the plan, with annual progress reporting to the national parliament. 9 The Department of Education and Skills needs to take a lead role in developing a Traveller education strategy as a matter of urgency. Lack of data The lack of robust data sets across key policy areas, disaggregated on the basis of ethnicity and gender is a significant gap, resulting in critical knowledge deficits about the situation and experience of Travellers and Roma in Ireland, and a consequent lack of evidence- based policymaking and planning. There is an urgent need for key statutory agencies to collect disaggregated data on the basis of ethnicity and gender, for without such data, policy, legislation and national strategies are being developed in an evidence vacuum. In addition, the issues raised in this report suggest that in tandem with efforts to get state agencies to adapt data systems to collect disaggregated data, there is a need for a parallel awareness-raising across these agencies. This is needed to ensure that statutory bodies understand why disaggregated data is so vital, and to fully comprehend the links between robust data collection and enhanced decision-making and resource allocation. This awareness-raising must be conducted in partnership with Traveller organisations and in line with human rights standards. Awareness-raising measures are also necessary in regard to applying a human rights framework to data collection, in particular regarding the collection and use of sensitive 7 With the exception of the area of higher education where there are some initiatives being developed. 8 A draft NTHAP has been produced. 9 Watt, P. and Kavanagh, L.

        "11 I NTRODUCTION Although we recognise Roma as an umbrella term, throughout this report we refer to \u2018Travellers\u2019 and \u2018Roma\u2019, to clearly identify the distinct situation, identity, and experience of the Roma and Traveller communities in Ireland. Census 2016 enumerated 30,987 Travellers living in Ireland. 10 This, however, is lower than the figure of 36,244 from a national Traveller health study, conducted in 2010. 11 There are between 4,000 and 5,000 people living in Ireland who identify as Roma. 12 The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 (NTRIS) is the cross- government national strategy for Roma and Traveller inclusion and the first national policy framework to explicitly include Roma as a key focus. 13 NTRIS strategic objectives fall within the remit of a number of government departments, with overall implementation driven by the Department of Justice and Equality and chaired by the Minister of State for Equality, Immigration, and Integration. The strategy has the primary aim to improve the lives of Travellers and Roma and encompasses ten themes, comprising a total of 149 specific actions, covering the domains of: cultural identity; education; employment and the Traveller economy; children and youth; health; gender equality; anti-discrimination and equality; accommodation; Traveller and Roma communities; and public services. The steering group to drive implementation of the NTRIS comprises: ten government departments, five state agencies, and eleven NGOs. The strategy is ambitious and holds significant potential to improve the situation and experience of Travellers and Roma in Ireland. As noted in the first and the second RCM reports on Ireland, the current NTRIS contains no targets, indicators, outcomes, timeframes or associated budget lines against which progress could be measured. 14 In fact, very little additional resources have been put towards implementing the Strategy and progress has been slow. This is regrettable, as actions with potential for positive outcomes although only in embryonic form are a direct result of NTRIS as a driver (e.g. the establishment of a Roma Primary Health Care Project, the development of a National Traveller Health Action Plan, commitments to improved conditions for Traveller Community Health Workers, etc.). In the second RCM report (2018), the Irish State\u2019s acknowledgement, in March 2017, of the distinct ethnic status of the Traveller community was positively assessed. 15 It was hoped that this recognition would serve as the impetus to give a renewed focus to addressing key inequalities for this community, most notably in the areas of accommodation and health. It is the case, however, that any such renewed focus is sporadic and dependent on individuals or on one government department. Regrettably, the situation in regard to homelessness in the Traveller community and health outcomes for Travellers, particularly in the area of mental health, appear to have worsened in this 10 Census 2016, Profile 8: Irish Travellers, Ethnicity and Religion.

For example, the number of Traveller families having to share accommodation with extended family members has increased by almost 30 percent since 2014. 16 In its latest report on Ireland, published in June 2019, ECRI notes that the lack of secure, adequate, culturally-appropriate accommodation is a key concern for the Traveller community and that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d in this regard, since its previous monitoring report on Ireland. 17 ECRI also notes that while the NTRIS has potential to address a number of key issues, the Strategy, nonetheless, has a number of significant gaps, notably in the areas of: housing and accommodation for Roma; 18 local authority responsibilities for Traveller accommodation; and key education issues for Travellers. 19 ECRI recommends that more emphasis should be placed in implementation of the NTRIS. 20 For the first time, the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG) 2017-2020 contains actions related to Traveller and Roma women. While this is welcome, the actions rely solely on the implementation of actions in the NTRIS, under the theme of gender. With the NTRIS having no clear implementation plan, the actions related to Traveller and Roma women in the NSWG have not been progressed. In 2019, the Advisory Committee on the FCPNM urged the State to implement the NTRIS and NSWG in a coordinated and consistent way. 21 A number of other international human rights bodies have called the State to adopt a clear implementation plan and budget lines for the NTRIS. 22 In June 2019, the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, immigration and integration, announced the establishment of a new anti-racism committee to review and make recommendations on strengthening the State\u2019s approach to combating racism. 23 However, given that historically, Travellers have been not included in anti-racism initiatives, it appears that Travellers may be excluded from the scope of the new anti- racism committee. In acknowledging the restructuring of the Department of Justice and Equality, under the Departmental Transformation Programme, this issue was raised by Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre at the most recent NTRIS Steering Group meeting in October 2019: The Department of Justice and Equality provided verbal assurance that this would not be the case. The focus of this third RCM report centers on three thematic areas: 1. The specific and increased vulnerability of Travellers and Roma to homelessness in the context of a worsening national housing, accommodation and homelessness crisis. 2. The persistent failure of key government departments to implement existing policy and/or to develop targeted strategic national policy responses to address the significant equality gap between the Traveller and Roma communities, and the 16 Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre (November 2019).

The lack of robust data sets across key policy areas, disaggregated on the basis of ethnicity and gender is a significant gap resulting in an absence of knowledge about the situation and experience of Travellers and Roma in Ireland and a consequent lack of evidence-based policymaking and planning. This monitoring report is based on data from the most up-to-date sources available, including the NTRIS Progress Reports, 2019 Report of the Expert Group on Traveller Accommodation, HSE NTHAP consultation report, 24 Draft NTHAP 25 and response to the Plan, 26 Draft 2019-2024 Traveller Accommodation Programme (TAP) reports from 31 local authorities, and the 2017 National Needs Assessment of Roma in Ireland. Consultations to inform this report included a number of questions, on the three thematic areas, were developed. The questions were specifically designed to augment available national data, and asked consultees to provide information on: \u2022 key issues noted regarding the worsening impact of the housing, accommodation and homelessness crisis on Traveller and Roma communities, \u2022 any targeted policies/measures to address the specific health challenges facing Roma, \u2022 perceived strengths/gaps/limitations in the draft National Traveller Health Action Plan, \u2022 perceived impact of the absence of a Traveller and Roma specific education strategy impact on your work, \u2022 views on the need for an oversight mechanism to drive the development and implementation of a Traveller education strategy, \u2022 views on the impact on your work, to address issues for Travellers and Roma, of the lack of available data, disaggregated by ethnicity. Consultation questions were disseminated, via email, to over 30 local and national organisations and locally-based NGOs working to provide services for and/or advocate for Traveller and/or Roma equality. In addition, a small number of key non-governmental organisations with specific expertise in the thematic areas being examined, were invited to provide written information for this report. Relevant thematic questions were discussed at meetings of the following national and regional Traveller or Roma networks: the National Traveller Health Network; 27 the Eastern Region Traveller Health Network, the National Traveller Drugs and Alcohol Network, and the national Roma NGO network convened by Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre. 28 Thematic areas and their related questions were the focus for discussions at these network meetings.

        "15 T RAVELLERS \u2019 AND R OMA \u2019 S HOMELESSNESS The specific and increased vulnerability of Travellers and Roma to homelessness in the context of a worsening national housing, accommodation and homelessness crisis. Despite constituting just under one percent of the total population, Travellers are significantly overrepresented in the homeless figures: Census 2016 data, for example, indicate that Travellers comprised 9 percent of the homeless population on Census night. 29 This figure, however, does not include what is often referred to as, the \u2018hidden homeless\u2019, in the case of Travellers, this includes, people living in overcrowded accommodation; 30 and people living in caravans on the side of the road or on unauthorised halting sites (therefore without any basic amenities). Census data, for example, looks at households where the number of persons exceeded the number of rooms, as a measure of overcrowding. Census 2016 data found that 39 percent of Traveller households had more persons that rooms (compared with less than six percent of all households). 31 Census data is not sufficiently disaggregated to provide information on the situation of the Roma community, however, data from the Roma needs assessment indicate a similar picture in regard to overcrowding: 24 percent of Roma were living in households of eight people or more; and 45 percent said there were insufficient number of beds in their accommodation. In addition, 6.6 percent of Roma indicated they were homeless. 32 It is possible to get a broader and more accurate picture, in regard to Traveller homelessness, including hidden homelessness, by examining current data held by the thirty-one local authorities, each of which is required to prepare a five-year TAP to meet the existing and projected accommodation needs of Travellers in their geographical areas. As part of this process each local authority must undertake an assessment of need for their catchment area; this includes an annual count of the number of Traveller families in their area and their current living situation. The draft 2019-2024 TAPs, for the thirty-one local authorities, were examined for this report. 33 The available complete data (for twenty- four local authority areas) indicate the following: \u2022 Of a total of 8,102 Traveller families, across the 24 local authority areas with complete data, 1,332 families (16.44%) are on the homeless continuum, that is, in emergency homeless accommodation, living in overcrowded accommodation, or living on the side of the road or on an unauthorised site. \u2022 In seven local authority areas, the overall percentage of Traveller families on the homeless continuum is greater than 20 percent of the total number of Traveller 29 Grotti, R.

In addition to the above, consultees for this report note a number of recent or pending forced evictions of Traveller families, from halting sites that local authorities are seeking to decommission: approximately ten in total. 34 In such instances, families often are evicted into homelessness. Background and cause of the problem The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 is the main legislative framework governing the provision of accommodation to the Traveller community. In 2018 the Minister of State for Housing and Urban Renewal established an expert group to review the 1998 Act. The report of the expert group 35 concludes that while the provisions of the Act have facilitated the delivery of significant amounts of accommodation for Travellers, t hey have \u201cfailed to meet the full scale of accommodation need among this community\u201d evidencing: the over-representation of Traveller in the homeless figures; the increase in numbers of Travellers living in overcrowded conditions; and the uneven delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation among local authorities and approved housing bodies, as proof of this failure. The review report recommends a complete overhaul of the 1998 Act, and other relevant legislation and policies which impact on accommodation provision for Travellers, and presents thirty-two recommendations for action in this regard. There are a number of issues that are contributing to homelessness and accommodation insecurity in the Traveller and Roma communities. Key issues in this regard are: \u2022 the persistent failure of local authorities to develop Traveller-specific accommodation in their geographical areas and consequently, their significant underspend in this regard. Between 2000 and 2017, this expenditure fell from 135.2 million EUR, to 20.8 million EUR, 36 \u2022 health and safety concerns being used as a justification, by local authorities to evict Traveller families from overcrowded halting sites, and by private landlords to evict Roma families from private rented accommodation, 37 \u2022 high levels of discrimination against Travellers and Roma in attempting to access private rented accommodation, 38 \u2022 the lack of available private rented housing that can accommodate larger families and that are within the allowable amount provided under government housing allowances, 39 34 Groups consulted for this report evictions in: Dublin (2), Clare, Wicklow (3), and Limerick (4-5 pending). 35 Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (July 2019).

This issue has been raised consistently by national, European and international equality and human rights bodies. 42 In its latest report on Ireland, ECRI noted it was \u201cshocked\u201d at the amount of available money that was returned unspent, \u201cwhile many Travellers continue to live in squalor and deprivation\u201d, conclu ding that without the imposition of dissuasive sanctions, on local authorities, there was no accountability for delivery under this budget programme. 43 Figures obtained, for 2018, indicate the following: a 48 percent underspend by local authorities on their TAP budget; ten local authorities (representing 30 percent of all local authorities) failed to spend any of their allocated TAP budget; fourteen significantly underspent; and only six spent their full allocation. 44 In July 2019, in response to a parliamentary question, it was noted that only 18 percent of the 2019 budget allocation for Traveller accommodation had been drawn down by the end of the second quarter and fifteen local authorities had failed to draw down any of their allocated budget. 45 In June 2019, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) 46 announced its intention to issue notice to each of the thirty-one local authorities to undertake an equality review of their provision under the TAPs, due to their failure to draw down and/or spend their ring-fenced capital budget for the provision of Traveller accommodation. The Commission advised that it had taken this \u201csignificant step, having consistently, since its establishment, questioned local authority drawdown and use of the funds.\u201d A key purpose of the equality reviews was, the Commission noted, to \u201coblige councils to examine specifically whether any such failings may be due to discriminatory practices or policies under the Housing Act and the Equal Status Acts.\u201d 47 Two state-commissioned reports into Traveller accommodation examined the reasons behind the failure of local authorities to spend their allocated TAP budgets.

This was highlighted by the Department\u2019s review which identified objections from local \u201csettled\u201d residents and political pressure exerted by elected representatives in approving planning. This has a direct impact on the achievement of targets, as developments face extensive delays, hence, the opportunity to utilise funding is lost.\u201d 49 Other issues of relevance are: arrangements for the disbursement of funding, between local authorities and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; 50 ineffective assessment of need processes at local level (which are underestimating the accommodation needs of Travellers); the lack of an independent body driving Traveller accommodation planning at national level; and ineffective local drivers. Organisations consulted for this report noted also, the lack of engagement between their local authority and the local Traveller groups as a key issue. Policy answers to the problem The findings and recommendations of the expert group on the operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, and their related recommendations, need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. There are a number of key recommendations, proposed in the expert group report, that, if implemented, would have a significant impact in regard to addressing failures, at local authority-level, for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation. Key recommendations in this regard are: 51 Planning: \u2022 Legislative provisions should be put in place to suspend (for a period of five years) the reserved function of elected representatives for approval of Part 8 proposals for Traveller-specific accommodation, and to suspend the reserved function relating to the agreement to dispose of land for the purposes of developing Traveller accommodation and provide these as executive functions. \u2022 In the immediate term, local authority chief executives should use emergency powers, where necessary, to bypass problems with decision-making by elected members regarding Traveller accommodation. Governance: \u2022 The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC) should be reconfigured as the National Traveller Accommodation Authority, with a stronger governance role than is currently the case. 52 This role would include: o overseeing the annual Social Housing Needs Assessment process insofar as it relates to Travellers, 48 Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (July 2019).

The NTRIS contains six specific actions on housing and accommodation regarding the Traveller community. None of these actions refer to the Roma community: a significant gap in the strategy that must be addressed without further delay. This issue was raised in the second RCM report, yet no further progress has been made in regard to addressing Roma accommodation and housing needs within NTRIS actions. In a recent positive development, however, the Minister responsible for the implementation of the NTRIS confirmed, on 15 October 2019, that housing and accommodation actions related Roma would be included in the NTRIS. At a subsequent follow-up meeting in late October, with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, attended by Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, it was agreed that draft actions will be developed and submitted to the NTRIS Steering Group for approval.

        "20 L ACK OF NEEDED TARGETED POLICIES The lack, over an extended period of time, of development and completion by the Government departments responsible, of targeted strategic national responses to address the significant equality gap between the Traveller and Roma communities, and the majority population, in key domains. In this regard, we specifically examine the areas of health policy and education policy. a. Health Background and cause of the problem The significant equality gap between Travellers and Roma and the majority population, is starkly evident in the key domains of education and health, where outcomes for members of the Traveller and Roma lag significantly behind those of the majority population. 53 Since the publication of the second RCM report on Ireland , the issue of Traveller health inequalities has been the focus of parliamentary and national media attention. 54 Traveller representative organisations note that the situation regarding the health of Traveller community, represents a crisis. The suicide rate amongst members of the community is noted as a particular concern. The All-Ireland Traveller Health Study, 2010, found the suicide rate amongst Travellers to be six times that of the majority population. 55 Traveller organisations are concerned that this rate is rising, and there is particular concern at the rise in suicides amongst Traveller women and girls, some as young as fourteen years. A recently published Oireachtas (Parliamentary) report on mental health recommended a national consistent approach with targeted funding to address Traveller suicide. 56 In regard to the Roma community, key issues are the lack of access to state supports, such as a medical card. In responses to the consultation for this report, an organisation providing primary health care for disadvantaged communities, noted that many Roma families visiting them for years still did not have medical cards, yet were undoubtedly eligible to obtain them. Issues such as: language barriers, lack of information, difficulty proving right of residency, and mistrust, were cited as key barriers in this regard. 57 Against this backdrop there is an unacceptable lack of impetus in regard to the development of a Traveller health strategy, although recent developments may offer hope of a new impetus for change. It is almost a decade since the publication of the All-Ireland Traveller Health Study, which laid bare the stark health inequalities between Traveller community and their settled counterparts. The urgency for a Traveller health strategy was acknowledged at that point, yet, almost a decade has passed without the publication of a strategy and with concerns that Traveller health inequalities have widened in the context 53 For specific data regarding Traveller and Roma outcomes in these domains, see: Civil Society Monitoring Report on the Implementation of the National Roma Integration Strategy in Ireland: Assessing the Progress in Four Key Policy Areas of the Strategy.

Policy answers to the problem Action 73 in the NTRIS commits the Health Service Executive (HSE) to develop a National Traveller Health Action Plan (NTHAP) employing a social determinants of health approach. As a precursor to the development of the NTHAP, the HSE National Social Inclusion Office commissioned a consultant to undertake this work on their behalf. A draft framework was developed by the consultant which formed the basis for discussions at four regional consultation forums. 60 Stakeholders welcomed and endorsed key elements in this proposed framework, in particular, the proposal to establish a new Planning Advisory body for Traveller Health (PATH). 61 In May 2018, a report was issued detailing the outcomes from the consultation process which included a number of key recommendations from Traveller representatives, in regard to the planning and governance structures needed to drive a NTHAP. 62 The report noted a widespread concern, among Traveller representatives, that the NTHAP must be progressed urgently, particularly in the context of the stalling of the key statutory drivers for Traveller health. 63 In November 2018 a draft NTHAP was submitted to the HSE, however, it wasn\u2019t until March 2019 that the HSE circulated a heavily edited version of this draft. The March 2019 draft contains none of the priority recommendations arising from the 2018 consultation process. While it referenced the issue of addressing the social determinants of health and noted a commitment to such an approach, in the NTRIS Action 73, the draft is silent in regard to how a social determinants of health approach will be addressed. In response to concerns expressed on this gap, by Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre to the HSE, the HSE noted that the November 2018 draft \u201cwas very bro ad in its scope highlighting the full range of potential actions across government departments and agencies and indeed was far more extensive in its reach than the responsibilities of the HSE.\u201d 64 This would suggest that the necessary cross-government approach to the NTHAP is no longer now envisaged. However, the HSE, in its most recent progress report on its action areas in the NTRIS, notes that \u201cin the context of the most recent feedback (on the draft NTHAP) it is clear that 58 For example, since the publication of the 2010 study, the percentage of Traveller lone parents has increased from 11.7 percent (in census 2011) to 17.9 percent (in Census 2016). 59 See for example, a tweet by the Minister for Health, Simon Harris T.D., November 17, 2017 https://twitter.com/simonharristd/status/931573233190612994 60 These forums were attended by 211 stakeholders, including representatives from local and national Traveller and Roma organisations, Traveller Health Units, health stakeholders, and stakeholders in the areas of: accommodation; children and youth; and education. 61 Stakeholders attending the consultations made a number of recommendations for ensuring the proposed PATH could have local, as well as national, operation. 62 National Traveller Health Action Plan: Summary Report of Regional Consultative Meetings.

While this development is a welcome positive step, there is a deep concern that the direction of travel with regard to the NTHAP is one of adopting a siloed approach within an already overburdened and under-resourced HSE National Office for Social Inclusion, and without a mainstreamed approach across the HSE or with any senior level leadership from the DoH. Giving evidence to an Oireachtas Committee, in October 2019, the Principal Officer in the DoH, with responsibility for Traveller health issues, noted that the development of the NTHAP was being driven by the HSE \u201cbecause they (the HSE) are in charge of health services\u201d. 66 This appeared to absolve the DoH, as the parent Department of the HSE, of assuming any responsibility for leading or taking ownership of the NTHAP, something which needs to be addressed going forward. b. Education Background and cause of the problem The entrenched education equality gap between Traveller children and their settled peers is such, that a 2017 ESRI report noted: \u201c The depth of educational disadvantage experienced by Travellers means that specific, targeted additional supports will be required in order for them to participate in mainstream education on equa l terms.\u201d 67 Census 2016 data indicate that: 13.3 per cent of Traveller women are educated to upper secondary or above compared with 69.1 per cent of the general population; and 57.2 per cent of Traveller men are educated to at most primary level, compared to 13.6 per cent of the general population. 68 The situation regarding the Roma community indicates that while children attend primary and post-primary school in over 70 percent of households, significant challenges to their participation in education were identified. Key barriers cited are: poverty (57.5 percent of families could not afford books and school uniforms, and in 25 percent of households, it was reported that children have gone to school hungry); discrimination; and inadequate language and literacy supports. 69 The explicit targeting of Traveller participation in the current Equity of Access to Higher Education Access Plan and the results, albeit small in scale, achieved thus far are welcome but considerably more progress is needed. Much of this is only possible if higher education access is grounded in direct and targeted action at first and second levels and also incorporates a lifelong learning dimension which explicitly targets and creates opportunities for mature student women and men, previously denied education opportunities. Within the context of an historically entrenched education equality gap, the impact of cuts to Traveller-specific educational supports, in 2011, coupled with evidence of recent 65 HSE Progress Update to the NITRIS Steering Group.

In regard to the former, the impact of cuts to Traveller education supports are now becoming evident with schools struggling to support Traveller pupils that need the extra supports. 70 In regard to the latter, an emerging issue of concern is the school practice of reducing timetables (school hours) for certain students, in particular Traveller students. A report issued in June 2019, by the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills, on the use of reduced timetables in schools, highlighted that this practice was particularly being used as a behavioural management tool. 71 The report notes an absence of any official reporting on, or monitoring of the extent or impact of the use of the practice of reducing school hours, by the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and has recommended that the DES undertake an audit of this practice 72 as recommended in the second RCM report on Ireland. In its most recent (combined 5 th to 9 th ) report under Article 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Irish Government reports that assistance is provided towards Traveller and Roma specific educational supports: a pupil capitation grant for Travellers and Roma is cited as an example. 73 It is the case, however, that Traveller specific education supports were cut by 86.6 percent following budget 2011, 74 and have not been restored in subsequent budgets. In addition, the capitation grant referred to is the lowest out of all the other qualifying categories: schools must have an approved special class in order to receive the increased capitation grant and the funds are assigned to the school, not to an individual Traveller pupil. In addition, Roma are not a category in the capitation grants. 75 The impact of these cuts was noted as a key barrier to addressing unequal education outcomes for Travellers, by groups consulted for this report. One group noted: \u201c As part of our Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme we provide targeted homework supports to DEIS 76 schools in Co. Clare. The majority of the children referred for support are Traveller and Roma children.\u201d 77 Despite the overwhelming evidence of the stark education equality gap between Travellers and the majority population, an overall national Traveller education strategy has yet to be developed by the DES. Policy answers to the problem In 2006 the government published a comprehensive set of recommendations towards a Traveller education strategy. 78 Underpinned by the core principles of inclusion, interculturalism and integration, the report identified clear goals and objectives to drive equality of access, participation and outcome for Travellers across all levels of the formal 70 Respondent to consultation for this report. 71 Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills Interim Report on the Committee\u2019s Examination on the Current Use of Reduced Timetables.

However, a plan to monitor the implementation of recommendations was never developed. Despite assurances, by the Traveller Education Advisory Consultative Forum (TEACF), that such a plan would be developed as a priority by 2013, this has not been the case. In addition, the TEACF itself, has not met since 2015, having been dismantled in favour of a NTRIS Education Sub- Committee. The NTRIS contains fourteen actions in the area of education; these are limited actions, none of which commit the DES to develop a Traveller and Roma education strategy. In its response to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee of the FCPNM, to develop a Traveller and Roma education strategy, 79 the Irish Government made no specific reference to the development of a Traveller and Roma education strategy, referring solely to the work of the NTRIS Education Sub-committee. It remains the responsibility of the DES to drive and lead the development of a Traveller and Roma education strategy and to reinstate the Traveller Education Advisory Consultative Forum or an equivalent body. Action 11 in the NTRIS commits the DES to review the 2006 Report but is silent regarding to what end the report is to be reviewed. In 2019 the DES produced a desk review of the 2006 Report, for discussion at the NTRIS Education Sub-Committee. 80 This desk review aimed to map the recommendations of the 2006 Report to current actions contained in other strategies and education policy documents. 81 The desk review makes reference, without analysis, to a range of policies, plans and strategies 82 that are suggested as reflecting the relevant recommendation. In addition, the review considers that thirty, of fifty-seven, recommendations from the 2006 Report, are dealt with through the NTRIS and is silent with regard to the remaining twenty-seven recommendations. Conclusion The evidence, collected over the last decade, conclusively attests to the significant health and education equality gap between the Traveller community and the majority population. In the area of health, the evidence points to a crisis, with rates of Traveller suicide at alarming levels. Despite this mounting evidence, there are two issues evident: \u2022 a lack of prioritisation, whereby, despite mounting evidence of health and education inequality, appropriate and targeted responses are not being pursued by the DES and DoH, \u2022 a systemic failure, involving a shifting of responsibility by the DoH and DES, to other agencies or government departments. In the area of education, this systemic failure is evident in regard to inadequate specifications within the NTRIS to commit the DES to develop Traveller and Roma education strategy, and \u2022 the devolution of the responsibility of government departments, to the Department of Justice and Equality, under the guise of NTRIS, to account for all policy areas related to Travellers and Roma, rather than institutional mechanism within their own departments. 79 Advisory Committee on the Implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (10 October 2018).

        "26 L ACK OF DATA The lack of robust data sets across key policy areas, disaggregated on the basis of ethnicity and gender is a significant gap, resulting in critical knowledge deficits about the situation and experience of Travellers and Roma in Ireland, and a consequent lack of evidence-based policymaking and planning. For a number of decades there have been repeated calls, from Traveller representative organisations, national equality watchdogs, and European and international human rights monitoring bodies for the collection of disaggregated data on the basis of ethnicity and gender. 83 Aside from a few isolated examples the lack of national disaggregated ethnic data continues to hamper the development of evidence-based national strategies, legislation and policies. A key example is the recently published report of the expert group on Traveller accommodation. 84 In its report, the expert review group note the following issues regarding the lack of disaggregated data and the inconsistencies in terms of data that are available: \u2022 a lack of reliable national data on the number of Traveller families in Ireland: Census 2016 data putting the figure at 8,717 families and the 2017 annual count. (undertaken by local authorities) putting the figure at 11,116 families, \u2022 a lack of consistency, across the thirty-one local authorities, in regard to how their annual count of Travellers is undertaken each year. This count is the basis for assessing Traveller accommodation needs for the following four years, and \u2022 the absence of an ethnic identifier in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection data systems, resulting in no available data on the number of Travellers accessing private-rented accommodation state allowances. 85 The expert review report notes that \u201cDue to these data shortcomings, there is a lack of clarity regard ing the scale of Travellers\u2019 need for government -supported housing, and also regarding their preference for standard social housing, Traveller-specific social housing, and private-rented housing. This was reflected in the lack of consensus on this issue in submissions made to the Expert Review Group about the scale and nature of Traveller housing need.\u201d 86 Policy answers to the problem Some welcome progress has been made: a key achievement is government approval of Roma as a named ethnic group in the revised ethnic question for the next population census. 87 In addition, there are examples of good practice emerging, such as the Irish Prison Services and some health service providers taking leadership in collecting and using ethnic data, as well as the national Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme 83 Such as the Irish Equality Authority.

        "L ACK OF DATA 27 (SICAP), which collects data on the ethnic and cultural background of programme beneficiaries, with Roma and Travellers identified as distinct minority ethnic groups. 88 Where steps have been taken, by some state agencies, to disaggregate data by ethnicity and gender this is a welcome step forward, however, the adherence to human rights standards for data collection would bolster such approaches. For instance, a small number of health service providers have introduced ethnic identifiers, however, ethnic categories are not standardised, with the result that ethnic identity is often ascribed to Travellers and Roma by using proxies such as name or looks, and the data are not disaggregated, analysed or provided to stakeholders within an appropriate timeframe. 89 The NTRIS contains four actions on the theme of ethnically disaggregated data. A central action is the convening of a working group with representatives from a number of government departments and from Traveller and Roma organisations. This working group was established in October 2017. Three meetings have taken place since that time. In May 2018 the working group was suspended pending the production of a report, commissioned by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, on the availability of data for the purposes of monitoring integration of migrants. This report, while usefully setting out which statutory bodies were collecting data on nationality and ethnicity, regrettably, does not add any value to the existing literature on collecting ethnicity data. 90 The Department of Justice and Equality has advised that the NTRIS data working group will be reconvened in 2020. In addition to the commitment towards ethnic equality monitoring in the NTRIS, two other national strategies, the Migrant Integration Strategy and the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (NSDSGBV) include commitments to progress equality data collection on the basis of gender and ethnicity. As part of the NSDSGBV monitoring process, a report was requested to provide a summary of key issues blocking the progression of the collection of disaggregated data on the basis of ethnicity. 91 This informati on was sought to inform the NSDSGBV development of a \u201cgold standard\u201d for data collection, across relevant state agencies. The report notes a number of cited barriers, from state agencies, that appear to reflect a lack of understanding of the reasons why the collection of disaggregated data might be important. For example, it was noted that the Irish Courts Service stated that it does not require data on ethnicity to carry out its functions and, therefore, has no legal basis to collect such data; the Garda\u00ed (Police) made a similar point. 92 Citing these issues has, it would appear, resulted in these state agencies lowering the bar in regard to what sort of disaggregated data they are willing to collect, as part of the promised \u201cgold standard\u201d for data collecti on. The proposed actions for the NSDSGBV, for example, notes that the Court Service and An Garda S\u00edochana will collect disaggregated data on the basis of age and sex, but not on the basis of ethnicity. On the 88 The government department with responsibility for the SICAP worked closely with Traveller and Roma representative organisations to develop good practice guidelines on ethnic data collection to support SICAP programme implementers who have responsibility for collecting these data: Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Pobal, Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre (2016) SICAP- Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme : Ethnic Data Collection Good Practice for SICAP Programme Implementers. 89 Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre (2016).

Without such data, policy, legislation and national strategies are being developed in an evidence vacuum. In addition, the issues raised in this report suggest that in tandem with efforts to get state agencies to adapt data systems to collect disaggregated data, there is a need for a parallel awareness-raising across these agencies. This is necessary to ensure that statutory bodies understand why disaggregated data is necessary and the links between robust data collection and enhanced planning, decision-making and resource allocation. Awareness- raising measures are also necessary in regard to data collectors understanding the importance of applying a human rights framework to data collection, in particular regarding the collection of sensitive data such information on cultural background and ethnicity. 94 93 Proposed Actions for Second National Strategy on Domestic Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016- 2021.
