        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies iii Executive summary The concept of social investment in social policy design has gained progressive traction in scholarly debates and policy-making environments from the mid-1990s onwards. Building on the pioneering work of the Dutch Presidency of the European Union (EU) in 1997, calling attention to \u2018social policy as a productive factor\u2019, social investment ideas became foundational for the Lisbon Agenda, launched in 2000, with the ambition to turn Europe into the \u2018most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth and more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\u2019 (European Council, 2000). It is generally recognized that European welfare states have, with varying degrees of success, upgraded their social investment impetus the most in the decade before the onslaught of the global financial crisis (Bonoli, 2013; Hemerijck, 2013). Alongside retrenchments, there have been deliberate attempts to rebuild social programs and institutions and thereby accommodate welfare policy repertoires to the new economic and social realities of the knowledge-based economy in times of adverse demography. The most recent assertive embrace of social investment came with the launch of the Social Investment Package for Growth and Social Cohesion (henceforth SIP), by the European Commission in February 2013, urging EU Member States to advance post-crisis welfare reform strategies that help \u2018prepare\u2019 individuals, families and societies to respond to the new risks of a competitive knowledge economy, rather than pursue policies that simply \u2018repair\u2019 damages after moments of economic or personal crisis (EC, 2013). Like any notion of \u2018investment\u2019, the concept of social investment connotes the possibility of measurable \u2018returns on investment\u2019 or a social investment \u2018discount rate\u2019. Fundamental to social investment returns is the importance of composite or synergy effects of complementary policy interventions, supported by social security safety nets under variegated economic and socio-demographic conditions, and relating to diverse aspects of wellbeing: human-capital development, income maintenance and protection, and the facilitation of gendered life course and labour market transitions. Moreover, optimal gains in social investment synergy effect require the effective management of \u2018institutional complementarities\u2019 between social protection, human capital development, and employment regulation. Any measurement of social investment\u2019s \u2018returns\u2019, therefore, requires attention to these complexities. Assessing Social Investment Synergies (ASIS) does precisely that, by developing an evidence-based methodology for analysing the financial, economic and societal returns of social investment policies. This involves setting up the tools to measure the implications of the social-investment approach to social policy, as compared to traditional compensatory social protection arrangements. This involves studying effects of the provision of \u2018capacitating\u2019 policies such as education and training, active labour market policy, and child and elder care, which equip and assist people to surmount the increasingly uncertain\u2014and thus less insurable in an actuarial sense \u2014hazards of the labour market and the life course. The focus of this study is to explore in detail the positive and negative effects of such social-investment-related social policies in terms of economic wellbeing broadly understood in term of employment, GDP growth, labour productivity, gender equality, and (relative) poverty. Although social investment is often positively related to economic growth, social investment policy innovation is certainly not singularly related to higher levels of economic growth. There is wide spectrum of (complementary) policy interventions related to economic growth, ranging from technological progress, trade ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies iv liberalization, the deepening of the single market, higher public investments by EU member state with large current account surpluses, and so on and so forth. Social investment is no \u2018growth miracle\u2019. Over the past decade both policymakers and expert academics have started to rethink the interaction between economic progress and social policy: from \u2018trade-offs\u2019 and \u2018trilemmas\u2019 to Pareto-optimal \u2018mutual reinforcements\u2019 and wellbeing synergies in even Rawlsean terms of benefiting the worst off (Esping-Andersen, 1999, 2008; Hemerijck, 2013; 2014; 2015). Central to the notion of social investment is that the economic sustainability of the welfare state hinges on the number and productivity of future taxpayers. With a deliberate orientation towards \u2018early identification\u2019, social investment policy serves actively to mobilize the productive potential of citizens in order to mitigate new social risks, such as atypical employment, long-term unemployment, working poverty, family instability and lack of opportunities for labour market participation resulting from care obligations or obsolete skills. In order to succeed in the \u2018knowledge economy\u2019, human capital improvement through education and training, social services, and benefits, to help make the most efficient use of available human capital and avoid skill depletion, is paramount, especially in ageing European societies. Alongside demographic ageing, the social investment argument is very much rooted in the changing role of women over the past quarter century. As female participation is critical to sustainable welfare states in ageing societies and parenting crucial to child development, policymakers have good reasons to want to support robust families by helping parents find a better balance between work and family life. Basic income guarantees thus need to be complemented with capacitating services, tailored to particular social needs caused by life-course and family contingencies. We do know plenty about the broad contours, missions and hoped-for accomplishments of social investment reform, but we continue to know surprisingly little about how to identify and empirically track particular policy mixes and reforms that manifest a social investment approach as distinct from other features of (social) policy efforts. This is largely due to the multifaceted character of social investment policies, the multiplicity of effects and implications of these policies for the economic wellbeing for varying groups, the importance of policy complementarities and interactions, and the challenge of assessing effects across different time dimensions. This leaves policymakers and scholars only with broadly plausible aggregate statistical corroboration and pretty much in the dark, or at least the dusk, when it comes to identifying social investment policies that have been developed or dropped, and to revealing the promise and pitfalls of such policies. As a result of these methodological challenges, any effort to methodologically gauge social investment\u2019s returns face \u2013 more than is true for singularly redistributive social policy interventions \u2013 major tensions between relevance and rigor : relevance in the sense of identifying aspects of social investment and its implications that apply to what policymakers and publics want to know about social policy reform; and rigor in the sense of measuring social investment and its implications in a way that support social- scientifically solid descriptive and causal inferences about social investment and its returns. This report seeks to redress prevailing shortcomings in our ability to track the character, accomplishments and problems of social investment in Europe. The core purpose here is to develop a \u2018layered\u2019 methodology, based on an extensive literature review on the relation between welfare policy and economic performance, together with novel theoretical insights into the productive functions of the social investment approach, for assessing the empirical incidence, resource allocation across policy relevant provisions, and socio-economic returns of innovative social investment reforms across EU ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies v Member States. This methodological purpose is, in turn, meant to further the overall substantive goal of understanding the promise and limits of social investment policies for European wellbeing. The study and methodology of ASIS should contribute to better understanding the conditions under which social investment policies can be fiscally robust across variegated policy domains across EU Member States; in ways that contribute to high levels of sustainable employment with good working conditions with adequate levels of protection; and in ways that effectively combat social exclusion and poverty in times of severe fiscal austerity. The more medium-term objective is to secure methodological progress by developing an analytical framework together with a toolkit to measure the (positive) cumulative effects of social investment policies. Our ASIS methodology involves triangulation of three levels of analysis and three broad pathways that we believe clarify the relationship between a given aspect or combination of \u2018social investment\u2019 and a given aspect or combination of wellbeing. The different levels of analysis are (1) quantitative-micro analysis of individual socioeconomic experience; (2) quantitative-macro analysis of country-year socioeconomic experience; and (3) qualitative-institutional analysis of selected national and regional experience. Our method states that the same aspects of social investment and of wellbeing ought to be analysed through the distinct lenses of all three levels of analysis, as each level provides distinct inferential leverage and a broad range of particular methods to develop descriptive and causal inferences about the returns to social investment. Our method also states that the pursuit of each of these levels of analysis ought to explicitly consider three pathways through which social investment can be expected to influence socioeconomic wellbeing: (1) direct and indirect pathways that correlate and process- trace how social investment relates to wellbeing; (2) moderated pathways that consider institutional complementarities or conflicts between social investment on the one hand and broader social transfers and institutions on the other; and (3) moderated pathways considering institutional complementarities or conflicts among different faces of social investment. Key to our ASIS methodology, finally, is that the three levels of analysis be triangulated in a meta-analysis that recognizes and tries to explain the concordant and discordant results across the quantitative-micro, quantitative-macro and qualitative- institutional analyses and for various groups in the population. To the outlined objectives, this report is split into two parts. Part 1 conceptualizes the social investment approach to social policy design, articulates the challenges to measuring social investment\u2019s implications, and proposes a methodology to meet those challenges. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature available on hypothesized social investment returns, we conceptualize social investment policy in terms of three complementary functions: (1) improving the \u2018stock\u2019 of human capital; (2) easing the \u2018flow\u2019 of labour market and life transitions; and (3) maintaining strong universal safety nets and economic \u2018buffers\u2019 (Hemerijck, 2014; 2015) and how they relate to each other through \u201cinstitutional complementarity\u201d, providing us with a robust theoretical framework. Hereafter, we present the multi-layered methodology to assess social- investment\u2019s implications, in line with the theoretical framework and taking account of major methodological obstacles to policy measurement. The methodology integrates three levels of analysis of how a given aspect or combination of social investment policies affect a given outcome relevant to wellbeing: (1) quantitative micro-level analysis of individual-country-years; (2) quantitative macro-level analysis of country-years; and (3) qualitative-institutional analysis of national and sub-national experiences. Each level provides distinct information to gauge social investment\u2019s implications and returns, taking account of the institutional synergies, complexities and complementarities and conflicts manifested in social investment\u2019s implications for wellbeing. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies vi Part 2 illustrates our methodology with two examples of social investment policy provision (active labour market policies (ALMPs) and early childhood education and care (ECEC) broadly understood) and two aspects of downstream wellbeing (employment and poverty). Here, we first focus on the individual-level micro-analysis using time-series- cross-section data from Eurostat and EU-SILC, focusing on how ALMP and ECEC measures relate to an individual\u2019s employment and his or her household\u2019s poverty in a given country-year. As a way of corroborating and aggregating-upwards the micro-level findings, next, we then survey the available aggregate (correlational) findings on social investment and socioeconomic performance, focusing on the level of aggregate country- years. The next section shifts from quantitative micro- and macro-analyses to the more comparative institutional analysis of ALMP and ECEC in countries, selected on the basis of their quantitative micro- and macro-level performance as representing fully-fledged social investment vanguard countries (Denmark), mid-range social investment countries (Germany), and underperforming social investment countries (Italy). We finalize the methodological illustration with an exercise in triangulation of the evidence gathered in the three previous sections to arrive at a grounded conclusion. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies vii Key findings Based on these two main parts, the report supports the general and most important methodological conclusion that measuring the \u2018returns\u2019 or implications of social investment is an extremely challenging but surmountable task in the face of particularly strong tensions between rigor and relevance in this area of social policy research. The task is best pursued, we find, with a plural methodology combining and contrasting quantitative micro- and macro- research with qualitative-institutional research, all focused on social-investment\u2019s direct implications and policy complementarities and conflicts. The report\u2019s two Parts not only support such methodological conclusions, but also substantive conclusions about social investment\u2019s returns that emerge from the empirical illustration of our ASIS methodology. In that (quite very circumscribed) illustration, the social investment approach to welfare reform appears to offer strong promise and modest pitfalls. The most prominent concordant finding is that we observe strong interaction effects between ALMP and Child- development and family policy; also when it comes to other welfare provisions. In more substantive terms the overarching finding is that social investment, as illustrated by ALMP and ECEC provisions, supports both employment and productivity growth, thereby significantly contributing to the welfare state\u2019s \u2018carrying capacity\u2019. ALMP is perhaps the most powerful mechanism for increasing employment from our examples, but Early-child education also seemingly contributes to employment. In addition, the quantitative-micro analysis suggests that the relationship between early-childhood spending and employment rates becomes more positive as a country\u2019s social security \u2018buffers\u2019 become more generous. Another important interaction effect unearthed by our methodology is that employment-retarding effects of social security transfers is dampened by assertive early-childhood education provisions. The macro-quantitative analysis moreover suggests that the relationship between ALMP and levels of female employment rate is particularly strong, thus, when read in conjunction with our qualitative-institutional analysis, corroborating evidence of positive institutional complementarities between activating labour market policies and dual-earner family friendly work-life balance policies. What is perhaps most surprising is that ALMP seemingly contributes to fighting individual poverty for vulnerable groups both directly and indirectly. Early-child education spending has more ambiguous and sometimes poverty-enhancing effects. These results are in important ways contingent on the availability of generous (but activating) social safety-net buffers. The interaction between ALMP and Early Childhood- development and the broader contours of national welfare states vary substantially across countries. However, the general picture is that the two examples of social investment tend to have the felicitous effects where total social expenditures are more generous. The empirical analysis also provides new and important evidence of, at most, subdued Matthew Effects. Total social expenditures tend to strongly reduce the risk of poverty among respondents even in settings of assertive ALMP and Early-child education. In fact, there are key groups of citizens, such as older less-skilled males, for whom ALMP and Early-child education might strengthen the poverty-reducing buffer functions of ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies viii prevailing social safety nets. And our quantitative-macro analysis in fact suggests that the poverty-fighting effects of early-childhood education can be just as strong as social transfers. On the other hand, our quantitative exploration of the data, both at the micro- and macro-level, also suggest less salutary interactions, whereby social investment provisions in interaction with existing welfare policy folios can work at cross purposes enough to produce modest but adverse \u2018Matthew-effects\u2019 of middle classes disproportionately profiting from social investment policy innovation. Whether under such conditions social investment policies work genuinely at cross purposes, or whether social investment policy innovation is undermined by existing patterns of labour regulation or the selectivity of social insurances buffers, can be better answered by moving beyond the quantitative components of our ASIS methodology. Both the micro- and macro-analyses provide a useful balance of rigor and relevance for policy thinking and analysis, but they provide less leverage to understand institutional contexts that so often trump the best policy intentions. Quantitative gains in rigor go at the expense of institutional relevance. These limitations therefore require correction by adding the third layer of qualitative-institutional research to our methodology. Our illustration of such analysis entails historical exploration of interaction effects between traditional social policy transfers and social investment reforms, together with the institutional complementarities and tensions between different faces of social investment. The country-cases chosen for such in-depth qualitative institutional analysis are chosen on the basis of their perverse, mediocre and superior social investment performance in the quantitative analysis, for purposes of corroboration and explanation of divergent performance. The examples of Denmark, Italy and Germany aptly illustrate the empirical presence of positive and negative synergy effects, promises, pitfalls, institutional complementarities and ambiguities that social investment policy experiences face. The country-based qualitative-institutional illustration also suggests that where ALMP and Early-childhood education are institutionally intimately aligned they indeed foster better performance in employment, productivity and poverty, as the Danish case exemplifies. By contrast, Italy appears as extreme case of institutional fragmentation with no cross-purpose policy coordination, rampant unemployment, stagnant productivity and perverse Matthew Effects. With respect to Germany the picture is better in terms of real social investment policy progress and returns, but with important institutional ambiguities that are associated with fairly high levels of labour market dualisation. A final set of findings involve our recommendations for the further use of the ASIS methodology in terms of other policy provisions and complementarities, data improvement, and further methodological refinement in assessing the long-term and short-run effectiveness and efficiency of social investment policy innovation. This includes a potential focus-shift towards more aggregated and downstream conceptions of economic wellbeing \u2013 such as labour productivity, total factor productivity or economic growth, or a shift towards 'thinner' or 'thicker' conceptions of social investment, focusing either on very isolated policy interventions or encompassing policy bundles. Informed by the shortcomings of this report, we would welcome further and difficult-to-design research methods on the same data set, and even more so an effort by the Commission to expand the existing suite of data to cover more countries and years to allow for a more thorough and long-term analysis of outcomes, and to provide more detailed data on individual take-up of policies. Despite the limitations and room for improvement, the ASIS methodology offers a powerful inferential leverage to assess the socioeconomic returns of social investment policies and should be re-applied for other clusters of policies, socioeconomic outcomes, or different groups when needed by policymakers.

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 1 Introduction Assessing Social Investment Synergies (ASIS) seeks to develop an evidence-based methodology for analysing the financial, economic and societal returns of social investment policies. The innovative social investment approach to welfare reform focuses on policies aimed at \u2018preparing\u2019 individuals, families and societies to respond to the new risks of a competitive knowledge economy, by investing in human capital and capabilities from early childhood through old age, rather than in policies that simply \u2018repair\u2019 damages after moments of economic or personal crisis. Crucial to this approach is the provision of \u2018capacitating\u2019 policies such as education and training, active inclusion, and child and elder care, which assist people in surmounting the increasingly uncertain\u2014and thus less insurable in an actuarial sense \u2014hazards of the labour market and life course in general. The core idea behind European integration has always been based on the promise of achieving both economic prosperity and social progress. In defining the European project, the Lisbon Treaty commits the Union to work towards the development of a sustainable \u2018social market economy\u2019, combining full employment with high levels of social protection and cohesion, gender equality and intergenerational solidarity, across all Member States. Under the current crisis predicament of widening economic disparities and deepening social imbalances, the EU and its Member States are at risk of failing to deliver on this promise of economic prosperity and social progress. The experience of welfare reform in a number of Member States suggests that the single market, a common currency, and sustainable public finances can be made compatible with generous and inclusive social policies, provided that the latter are redirected towards a coherent strategy of social investment and capacitating services. The focus of this study is to explore in detail the positive and negative effects of social policies in terms economic wellbeing broadly understood in term of employment, GDP growth, labour productivity, gender equality, and (relative) poverty. Although social investment is often positively related to economic growth, it is of course an illusion to believe that assertive social investment policy innovation is singularly related to higher levels of economic growth. There is wide spectrum of (complementary) policy interventions related to economic growth, ranging from technological progress, trade liberalization, the deepening of the single market, higher public investments by EU member state with large current account surpluses, and so on and so forth. Social investment is no \u2018growth miracle\u2019. The argument in favor of social investment is that social investment policy innovation contributes to more socially \u2018inclusive\u2019 growth compared to other policy alternatives. Recent publications by the OECD (2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2015) and the World Bank (2015; 2016) strongly argue that investing in people in ageing European populations is a sine qua non for economic wellbeing. Employment increases, longer working lives, and increases in labour productivity require major improvements in welfare policy infrastructures along the lines of social investment. In past academic literature, three important conjectures have been advanced about the relationship between welfare efforts and socioeconomic performance. In the mid-1970s, the American economist Arthur Okun was the first to formulate what he called, a \u2018big trade-off\u2019 between equality and efficiency (Okun, 1975). To the extent that generous welfare states are used as the political means to reduce inequality and poverty, Okun argued that this potentially harms economic growth as a consequence of income and labour market distortions produced by comprehensive social policy provisions, labour market regulation, and progressive taxation. High levels of social spending could thus ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 2 incur lower labour supply, higher unemployment, less investment in training and education, and, as a result, stagnating competitiveness. Moving beyond Okun\u2019s dichotomy, by the late 1990s the political economists Torben Iversen and Ann Wren conceptualized that advanced welfare states were not so much confronted with an inescapable \u2018trade-off\u2019 between equality and efficiency but rather faced with the tragedy of what they coined the \u2018trilemma of the social service economy\u2019 (Iversen and Wren, 1998). The gist of it is that with the shift from an industrial to a service economy, in the shadow of accelerating economic internationalization, it has become inherently more difficult for welfare states simultaneously to attain the triple goals of budgetary restraint, earnings equality, and job growth. Government may pursue any two of these goals but no longer all three at the same time. Within a tight budgetary framework, private employment growth can be accomplished only at the cost of wage inequality. If wage equality is a prime objective, employment growth can be generated only through the public sector, at the cost of higher taxes or public borrowing (ibid. 508). As international competition and technological innovation restrict job creation in the exposed (mainly manufacturing) sector, employment growth in advanced economies may be achieved either in well-paid public services, thereby undercutting budgetary restraint, or in low- paid private services, whereby earnings equality is sacrificed. Over the past decade both policymakers and expert academics have started to rethink the interaction between economic progress and social policy: from \u2018trade-offs\u2019 and \u2018trilemmas\u2019 to Pareto-optimal \u2018mutual reinforcements\u2019 and wellbeing synergies even in Rawlsean terms of benefiting the worst off (Esping-Andersen, 1999, 2008; Hemerijck, 2013; 2014; 2015). Central to the notion of social investment is that the economic sustainability of the welfare state hinges on the number and productivity of future taxpayers. With a deliberate orientation towards \u2018early identification\u2019, social investment policy serves actively to mobilize the productive potential of citizens in order to mitigate new social risks, such as atypical employment, long-term unemployment, working poverty, family instability and lack of opportunities for labour market participation resulting from care obligations or obsolete skills. In order to succeed in the \u2018knowledge economy\u2019, human capital improvement through education and training, social services, and benefits, to help make the most efficient use of available human capital and avoid skill depletion, is paramount, especially in ageing European societies. Alongside demographic ageing, the social investment argument is very much rooted in the changing role of women over the past quarter century. As female participation is critical to sustainable welfare states in ageing societies and parenting crucial to child development, policymakers have good reasons to want to support robust families by helping parents find a better balance between work and family life. Basic income guarantees thus need to be complemented with capacitating services, tailored to particular social needs caused by life-course and family contingencies. Unfortunately, the state of empirical proof behind social investment returns, beyond broadly plausible aggregate statistical corroboration, as supplied by the OECD, continues to remain modest. This is related to: (1) the multifaceted character of social investment as it involves a broad mix of differentiated policies, (2) the multiplicity of effects and implications, understood as \u2018returns\u2019 social investment policies have in terms of economic wellbeing for varying groups, (3) the importance of policy complementarities and interactions, and (4) the challenge of assessing effects across different time dimensions (long-, medium- and short-term).

Any effort to methodologically gauge social investment\u2019s returns face \u2013 more than is true for singularly redistributive social policy interventions \u2013 major tensions between relevance and rigor : relevance in the sense of identifying aspects of social investment and its implications that apply to what policymakers and publics want to know about social policy reform; and rigor in the sense of measuring social investment and its implications in a way that support social-scientifically solid descriptive and causal inferences about social investment and its returns. This report seeks to redress prevailing shortcomings in our ability to track the character, accomplishments and problems of social investment in Europe. Its core purpose is to develop a \u2018layered\u2019 methodology, based on an extensive literature review on the relation between welfare policy and economic performance, together with novel theoretical insights into the productive functions of the social investment approach, for assessing the empirical incidence, resource allocation across policy relevant provisions, and socio-economic returns of innovative social investment reforms across EU Member States before and after the crisis. This methodological purpose is, in turn, meant to further the overall substantive goal of understanding the promise and limits of social investment policies for European wellbeing. The study and methodology of ASIS should contribute to better understanding the conditions under which social investment policies can be fiscally robust across variegated policy domains across EU Member States; in ways that contribute to high levels of sustainable employment with good working conditions with adequate levels of protection; and in ways that effectively combat social exclusion and poverty in times of severe fiscal austerity. The more medium-term objective is to secure methodological progress by developing an analytical framework together with a toolkit to measure the (positive) cumulative effects of social investment policies. To realize this objective, the report develops and integrates five complementary components: 1. A comprehensive literature review of the intricate relationship between social policy intervention and spending and economic performance, including policy analysis of the economic and social costs of non-intervention. 2. A coherent theoretical framework, inspired by the Social Investment Package, but also based on the literature review, best able to gauge the functional benefits of the social investment approach to welfare-state reform, in terms of direct and indirect job creation, increased employability, savings on social spending and increased tax revenue as a result higher and more productive employment, economic growth and private consumption at subdued levels of poverty. We propose an alternative view on the \u2018social investment \u2013 social protection dichotomy\u2019, by underlining the productive function of social protection buffers, contingent on their design, across variegated welfare regimes. 3. At the core of the project, a methodology for quantitative modelling and qualitative mapping of social investment policies, allowing for a reliable assessment of the cumulative economic returns of social investment policies, across the full range of EU Member States. Special emphasis is given to gender and age-specific measures of wellbeing, including labour market participation, ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 4 productivity, and poverty. Our methodology combines three levels of analysis of how a given aspect or combination of policies associated with social investment affects a given outcome relevant to wellbeing: quantitative micro-level analysis of individual-country-years; quantitative macro-level analysis of country-years; and qualitative-institutional analysis of national and sub-national experiences. In carrying-out each of these levels, our methodology calls for explicit attention to possible institutional complementarities and conflicts between particular aspects of social investment, and between a given aspect of such investment more traditional non-social investment income transfers. 4. An illustration of our methodology, focused on measurable implications of social- investment provisions in EU member states for specific features of economic wellbeing. The focus is on two outcomes crucial to economic wellbeing (employment and poverty), and on two important features of two social investment policies par example , active labour market policies (ALMP) and early- childhood education and care (ECEC). ALMP includes activation-oriented features of labour-policy services, such as training, job-sharing and public employment, excluding passive unemployment insurance and early-retirement transfers. ECEC are those features of education and care most relevant to early child development thought to facilitate combining work with family 2 . Employment and poverty are crucial to the promise and pitfalls of social-investment reforms, with employment being a crucial positive measure of economic wellbeing, and poverty being a crucial negative measure of economic suffering or \u2018non-wellbeing\u2019. These implications are also clearly relevant to a broad conception of downstream returns, including labour productivity and growth for European economies. Our report focuses on precisely these faces of social investment and wellbeing in parallel illustration of our proposed methodology\u2019s three levels of analysis: quantitative-micro, quantitative-macro and qualitative-institutional exploration. 5. A range of substantive conclusions about contributions and limits of social investments, and recommendations for how to further measure social investment\u2019s returns. As the positive returns of social investment generally present themselves in terms of life course and policy \u2018synergy effect\u2019, the concluding component of the report brings together a number of recommendations for future assessment of social investment on the basis of our proposed methodology, but also important improvements that can be made in terms of data-gathering and further methodological refinement in assessing the long-term and short-run effectiveness and efficiency of social investment policy innovation. These five components build on the relevant literature to combine a theoretical understanding of the complementary institutional manifestations of social investment with a quantitative assessment of policy inputs and performance outputs, thereby contributing to a strong methodological evidence-based toolkit for assessing European \u2018welfare state futures\u2019 within evolving socio-economic contingencies and fiscal constraints. The method we ultimately propose navigates the dilemma of rigor and relevance by articulating a mix of empirical approaches, each of which necessarily constitutes a highly imperfect balance on the spectrum of rigor and relevance to identifying social investment\u2019s returns, and which together triangulate powerful leverage to gauge the promise and pitfalls of social investment. 2 See page 51 for details on how we operationalize ALMP and ECE(C) measures using Eurostat data sources.

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 5 The rest of the report is built-up in two Parts. Part 1 comprises sections 1-4, and is devoted to the theoretical conceptualization and methodological operationalization of social investment policy portfolios and their multifaceted returns. Section 1 provides an historical overview of how the concept of \u2018social investment\u2019 developed and how it is best understood. Section 2 continues with an overview of the literature on social investment returns in terms of three complementary social investment policy functions: (1) improving the \u2018stock\u2019 of human capital; (2) easing the \u2018flow\u2019 of labour market and life transitions; and (3) maintaining strong universal safety nets and economic \u2018buffers\u2019 (Hemerijck, 2014). Section 3 then uses this literature review to provide a more complete overview of the theorized social investment returns, to elaborate on the causal claims of social investment, to expand and elaborate on the crucial notion of \u2018institutional complementarity\u2019, and lastly to stretch the social investment argument to its limits by postulating a life course multiplier effect. Section 4 presents the multi-layered methodology for the assessment of social investment synergies after going through the major methodological caveats and approaches. The methodology integrates three levels of analysis of how a given aspect or combination of policies associated with social investment affect a given outcome relevant to wellbeing: quantitative micro-level analysis of individual-country-years; quantitative macro-level analysis of country-years; and qualitative-institutional analysis of national and sub-national experiences. Each of these levels or components provides distinct and relevant information and leverage to gauge social investment\u2019s implications and returns in terms of wellbeing, taking account of the complexities and institutional complementarities and conflicts that we anticipate. Part 2 subsequently illustrates our methodology with two examples of social investment policy provisions (active labour market policies (ALMPs) and early childhood education and care (ECEC) understood broadly) and two aspects of downstream wellbeing (employment and poverty). Section 5 focuses on the individual-level micro-analysis using time-series-cross-section data from Eurostat and EU-SILC, focusing on how ALMP and ECEC measures relate to an individual\u2019s employment and his or her household\u2019s poverty in a given country-year. As a way of corroborating and aggregating-upwards the micro-level findings, Section 6 surveys the available aggregate (correlational) findings on social investment and socioeconomic performance, focusing on the level of aggregate country-years. Section 7 then shifts from quantitative micro- and macro-analyses to the more comparative institutional analysis of ALMP and ECEC in countries, selected on the basis of their quantitative micro- and macro-level performance as representing fully- fledged social investment vanguard countries (Denmark), mid-range social investment countries (Germany), and underperforming social investment countries (Italy). Section 8 then finalizes the illustration with an exercise in triangulation of the evidence gathered in the three previous sections to arrive at a grounded conclusion. Finally, the report then concludes with recommendations for further use of the ASIS methodology in terms of other policy provisions and complementarities, data improvement, and further methodological refinement in assessing the long-term and short-run effectiveness and efficiency of social investment policy innovation.

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 6 Part 1: Social Investment concept and methodology Social investment as a concept, despite the number of scholarly contributions it motivates, is not a concept that is easy to nail down. Coined by G\u00f8sta Esping-Andersen in \u201cWhy we Need a New Welfare State?\u201d (Esping-Andersen, 2002), it is framed as a specific type of a welfare state with human capital, employment, and investment in children as its core foci. However, even though there is no explicit quarrel amongst social investment scholars with regards to definitions, there exist different conceptions highlighting different constituent parts of the \u2018package\u2019 of ideas, policies, and theories that social investment contains. This highlights the very first challenge of this report: in order to operationalize a concept and propose a methodology to assess it, one needs to propose and defend a sufficiently clear and nuanced understanding of the concept. Social Investment as such does not really have a succinct definition, as it is more of a \u2018refocusing\u2019 of traditional study of welfare states, rather than a completely novel academic effort (despite the fact that the practical significance is of paradigmatic magnitude). To navigate this complexity, Section 1 first explains development of the concept of \u2018social investment\u2019 both as a cumulative policy change (response to changing social realities) and as an intellectual innovation (a scholarly effort to re-conceptualize the study of welfare states). As a conclusion, it offers an overview of the five crucial re- conceptualizations, as well as an acknowledgement that in order for the concept to be operationalized, it needs to be clarified further. Section 2 takes the first step in conceptually clarifying social investment by introducing the taxonomy of three complementary, yet distinct, policy functions (1) improving the \u2018stock\u2019 of human capital; (2) easing the \u2018flow\u2019 of labour market and life course transitions; and (3) maintaining strong universal safety nets and economic \u2018buffers\u2019 (Hemerijck, 2014). The section then goes into some basic implications of this taxonomy, before it presents a literature review of the various economic returns of social investment policies, guided by this taxonomy and structured along the lines of four major life course transitions: from childcare to education, from education to employment, from employment to employment, and from employment to retirement. This literature review illustrates the importance of adopting a life course perspective when evaluating social investment policies, as well as the usefulness of the \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 taxonomy. Following this literature review, Section 3 essentially presents three illustrations crucial to providing enough analytical clarity to the concept of social investment. Firstly, it is a comprehensive representation of the theorized returns of social investment in a table, focusing on four crucial policy areas and their short, medium, and long term effects. This not only provides more structure to the literature review of theorized returns, it also provides a definition of \u201cscope\u201d in terms of what policies are considered to be \u201csocial investment policies\u201d, at least by the academic consensus. The second illustration takes seriously both the life course perspective and the \u2018stock\u2019, \u2018flow\u2019, and \u2018buffer\u2019 taxonomy, in order to clarify the causal claims of social investment, as well as further elaborate the concept of institutional complementarity by introducing \u2018life course synergy\u2019 and \u2018policy synergy\u2019, its two constituent parts. Lastly, the section postulates the existence of a life course multiplier, based on institutional complementarity and certain basic mechanics that transfer the effects of social investment across generations. Together, sections 1, 2, and 3 provide a conceptualization of social investment that is able to avoid both reductionism and irrelevance, making it the ideal conceptualization to base our methodology on. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 7 Finally, section 4 first introduces the methodological landscape of assessing social investment returns so far, and emphasizes the four main caveats that plague the existing portfolio of methods. Finally, it proposes and defends the pluralist ASIS methodology, which comprises of three distinct components that together triangulate to provide the complete picture: the quantitative-micro level, quantitative-macro level, and qualitative institutional level. Formulating this methodology concludes part 1 of this report, followed by part 2, which illustrates this methodology on some \u2018usual suspects\u2019 social investment policies. Section 1: Developing Social Investment Most concepts in the social sciences emerge in light of changing social realities and/or as the result of scholarly intellectual innovation. Social investment is no exception in this respect. The social investment perspective emerged in the light of \u2018new social risks\u2019 and life course complexities that existing welfare policy provision failed to address, but it also came about by intellectual assertion, inspired by a normative argument about the feasibility of progressive social policy for 21 st century knowledge-based economies and societies. After presenting the empirical and intellectual sources of the rise of social investment perspective since the turn of the century, Section 1 debates five key (re- )conceptualizations of social policy, required to move to a fully-fledged dynamic social investment policy analysis with a strong focus of social and economic returns. 1.1 Cumulative policy change Since the late 1980s, majority of European governments enacted a wave of social reforms to make their social policy systems more efficient and employment-friendly. Alongside retrenchments, there have been deliberate attempts to rebuild social programs and institutions and in doing so accommodate welfare policy repertoires to the new economic and social realities of the knowledge-based economy. These realities mainly have to do with the increased flexibility of employment relations through part-time work, fixed-term contracts, temp-agency work, self-employment and other types of employment arrangements. These changes increase the volatility of labour markets, as individuals are expected to transition between jobs, or even in between sectors, throughout their life course. Employers\u2019 preference for flexibility thus puts pressure on social insurance systems and welfare states in general to adapt. The story of European welfare states\u2019 gradual self-transformation to face this new reality is best told as a sequence of cumulative policy alterations across a wide range of interconnected policy areas (Hemerijck, 2013). In wage policy , many countries pursued wage moderation through social pacts among the trade unions, employer organizations, and governments, often linked with wider packages of negotiated reform. The EMU entrance exam of the mid-1990s played an especially critical role forging national social pacts in the hard-currency latecomer countries, such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal, as an alternative to straightforward labour market deregulation and collective bargaining decentralization (Avdagic et al. 2011). With respect to social insurance and assistance , most countries preside over universal minimum income protection programs, coupled with \u2018demanding\u2019 activation and \u2018enabling\u2019 reintegration measures, targeting labour market \u2018outsiders\u2019 such as young, female, or low-skilled workers (Clasen and Clegg 2011). Employment policy expanded considerably from the 1990s onwards (Bonoli 2013), alongside social security activation, spending on active labour market policies, and training and education to improve employability. With respect to labour market regulation , several European countries have moved towards a greater acceptance of flexible labour markets, with new elements ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 8 of security introduced for labour market outsiders, governed by more flexible employment relations (Schmid 2008). For pensions , financing problems due to population ageing and lower growth have prompted the reversal of the trend of early retirement policies towards the adoption of initiatives to promote longer and healthier working lives. A key shift has been the growth of (compulsory) occupational and private pensions and the development of multi-pillar systems, combining pay-as-you-go and fully funded methods, with relatively tight (actuarial) links between pension benefits and contributions factoring-in life-expectancy (Ebbinghaus, 2011). Family policy , including childcare, parental leave and employment regulation, and work and family life reconciliation policies, has experienced a profound upgrade in both scope and substance (Orloff, 2010). Even though social spending has largely been consolidated at the levels reached in 1980s, practically all advanced European welfare states have been recasting and reconfiguring their policy repertoires. Cumulative social reforms, based on domestic policy contexts and conditions, reveal an increasing number of reforms where efficiency improvements went hand in hand with equity enhancements. Depending on country specific institutional conditions, higher minimum wages served to raise labour market productivity of workers. Collective bargaining coordination seemingly mitigated industrial conflicts and encouraged stable and market-conforming wage setting over the business cycle. Unemployment insurance was effective in protecting past investments in human capital, while helping to facilitate job matching with positive implications for individual workers and the macro-economy. Vocational training and continuous education were apparently critical in forestalling skill erosion and active labour market policies secured employability in transitions across different sectors of the economy. Most recently, there is the growing recognition, spearheaded by the OECD (2015), that income equality and less poverty are positively correlated with aggregate economic performance. In an attempt to codify and bring under one heading how particular combinations of social policy interventions contribute to economic performance, from the late 1990s on the notion of \u2018social investment\u2019 emerged as an alternative social policy perspective, with the focus of making citizens and families more resilient and better capable to address the social risks and needs in the competitive knowledge-based economy, challenging the hegemonic market-liberal \u2018Washington Consensus\u2019 of hard currencies, balanced budgets, capital market liberalization, low taxes, labour market deregulation, welfare benefit retrenchment, and the privatization of public services, endorsed by the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD for most of the 1980s and most of the 1990s. The European Commission played an important role in diffusing, brokering and promoting the new social investment edifice, notably through the Lisbon Strategy and the \u2018open method of coordination\u2019 in employment, pension, social inclusion, and health policy, with the ambition to turn Europe into the \u2018most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\u2019 (European Parliament, 2000; Zeitlin & Verhecke, 2014). 1.2 Welfare state intellectual innovation The notion of social investment emerged in political and academic discourse after the mid-1990s. First, and rather surprisingly, it was the OECD in 1996, at the time still wedded to the market-liberal Washington Consensus, who organized a conference focused on rethinking social policy in normative and ethical terms as well as in terms of positive economic output. The European Union followed suit, and under the Dutch presidency in 1997, the term \u201csocial policy as a productive factor\u201d was coined, focused on ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 9 exposing the neoliberal misconception that social policy interventions go at the expense of economic competitiveness (Morel, Palier & Palme, 2012). Next, these ideas were anchored in the EU\u2019s Lisbon Agenda of 2000 for social policy guidance in the knowledge- based economy, creation of better jobs and greater social cohesion. The Lisbon Agenda proved to be crucial for developing social investment intellectually, as it inspired the Belgian Presidency of 2001 to commission a book by Esping-Andersen, Gallie, Hemerijck and Myles with the title of Why We Need a New Welfare State . This seminal work not only echoed the Lisbon Agenda\u2019s conjecture that generous social policy does not necessarily hamper economic efficiency, thereby refuting the market-liberal critique of the welfare state as \u2018crowding out\u2019 private economic initiative, it heavily critiqued the staying power of male bread-winner employment-based social insurance in most European welfare regimes round the turn of the century (Esping-Andersen et. al., 2002). The central diagnosis of Why We Need a New Welfare State was that male-breadwinner employment-based social insurance increasingly fosters suboptimal life chances for large parts of the population, in the face of the \u2018new\u2019 social risks of skill-biased technological change, family change and the feminization of the labour market, and adverse demography. Male-breadwinner social security inertia triggered dynamics of labour market segmentation between insiders, protected by quasi-unlimited social and job protection, and outsiders, women, youngsters and the less skilled, who increasingly have to make do with atypical precarious jobs without social security and with little opportunities for employment mobility or skill upgrading. Labour market dualization and rising levels of in-work poverty were further exacerbated by revolutionary family change, especially the rise of single-parent households. Absent possibilities of externalizing child and elderly care, the rising numbers of female workers faced with \u2018broken careers\u2019 and postponed motherhood resulted in lower fertility, accelerating ageing. An additional worrying trend was the rise of marital homogamy with highly educated and dual-earning couples prospering and low-skill households falling into poverty. To effectively respond to these \u2018new\u2019 social risks, Esping-Andersen et al. (2002) advocated a \u2018social investment\u2019, with the eradication of child poverty taking pride of place. The significance of social investment stems largely from its indirect rejection of some fundamental economic theories: Okun\u2019s big Equity-Efficiency trade-off, mentioned above, together with the Baumol cost disease and the service economy trilemma. The Baumol cost disease, named after the American economist and Nobel Laureate William Baumol (1967), conjectures that productivity improvements in labour-intensive welfare services \u2013 health, education and family care services \u2013 consistently lag behind productivity gains in more competitive industries. When public service pay increases follow wage developments in the more dynamic capital-intensive private sector, low productivity services become relatively expensive. In other words, externalization and professionalization of (for example) care provision, from the family to the public sector, conjure up a significant handicap for competitive adjustment. Consistent with the Baumol cost disease, Torben Iversen and Anne Wren (1998) observed that by the 1990s European welfare states, especially those partaking in EMU, would be confronted with what they term the \u2018trilemma of the service economy\u2019. And since international competition and technological innovation restrict job creation in the tradable (mainly manufacturing) sector, employment growth in may be achieved either through well-paid public services, thereby undercutting budgetary restraint, or in low-paid private services, sacrificing income equality (see also Wren, 2013). The social investment policy paradigm indirectly questions the general validity of the Baumol and service trilemma predicaments. Consider public health care: even if surgery is publicly financed, timely ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 10 intervention allows an incapacitated worker to go back to work sooner, thereby creating extra output at less cost (Atkinson, 2015). The same indirect logic from public investments to private returns applies to parenting services and active labour market policy intervention. In other words, the Baumol cost disease and the service sector trilemma are not predetermined: they are empirical variables, dependent on institutional conditions and specific policy complementarities. (Atkinson, 2015: 121). After Why We Need a New Welfare State laid the intellectual groundwork for social investment, Anton Hemerijck\u2019s monograph Changing Welfare States (2013) supplied ample evidential quantitative and qualitative support for an incipient social investment turn across the European Union over the past decades. In their wake, many academics from various social science disciplines and methodological approaches took up arms either in defense of or against the concept. Looking at the most prominent critiques of social investment, Nolan (2013) has taken issue with the distinction between \u2018capacitating\u2019 (social investment) and \u2018compensating\u2019 (social insurance) spending, used by prominent social investment scholars, which he conjectures as analytically weak. In a similar vein, other academics disapprove with gullible \u2018economization\u2019 of welfare policy embedded in the idea of social investment, whereby social interventions are increasingly assessed in terms of their contribution to economic growth and competitiveness, which obscures the normative objective of distributive fairness (Nolan, forthcoming; Barbier, forthcoming; Leon, forthcoming). This particular argument has most forcefully been made by feminist scholars, who lament how social investment instrumentalizes female employment as a mean to raise macroeconomic performance (Jenson, 2009; Saraceno, forthcoming). Others take issue with the narrow focus on the so called \u2018new social risks\u2019 of atypical work, the fall in demand of low skill work, and work-life reconciliation at a time when the \u2018old\u2019 social risks of mass unemployment reappeared with a vengeance in the wake of the global economic crisis (Crouch and Keune, 2012). The most empirically astute critique of social investment policies is that they are plagued by \u2018Matthew Effects\u2019 of middle class disproportionately benefiting from capacitating services at the expense of more vulnerable groups, in line with the Gospel of Matthew \u201cunto every one that hath shall be given\u201d, thus severely limiting the potential of social investment to achieve inclusive growth (Cantillon, 2011; Bonoli et. al., forthcoming). The social investment critique has been answered both with empirical fortification of the various returns of social investment, but also with conceptual innovation and further clarification. In terms of empirics, the main areas of focus have been early childhood and care policies, family policies, activating labour market policies, and work-life reconciliation policies (Bonoli, 2013). The research methods and designs vary substantially and support different aspects of social investment and some findings are in direct contradiction of some of the critique, such as the absence of a \u2018Matthew effect\u2019 when it comes to ALMP policies and poverty (Burgoon, forthcoming; see also section 5.2 of this report). Alongside cumulative empirical endowment, the conceptual elaboration of social investment has also been substantial. For the purpose of this document, the taxonomy of three complementary policy functions of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 takes the center stage (Hemerijck, 2014). For many scholars and politicians, social investment has come full circle with the adoption of the Social Investment Package by the EU in 2013 (EC, 2013). Meanwhile, the OECD published a series on reports on family policy, gender-friendly employment relations, education, and rising inequality, in support of social investment and inclusive growth (2008, 2011, 2015, 2015a). In terms of a comprehensive understanding of social investment, the Social Investment Package (SIP) of 2013, and especially the Staff Working Document accompanying it (EC, 2013a), renders the most up to date ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 11 delineation of social investment in terms complementary policy functions. Here social investment policy is defined as welfare provisions aimed to \u2018prepare\u2019 individuals, families and societies to respond to novel risks, rather than simply \u2018repair\u2019 damages after moments of economic or personal crisis. The overarching objective laid down in the SIP is to raise employment and employability and thus to sustain inclusive welfare provisions. Adverse demography and the knowledge economy require advanced European welfare states to raise the importance of family policy, care provision and rehabilitation services, alongside basic and comprehensive social security, so as to assist people to surmount the increasingly hazardous labour markets and life course transitions to achieve better aggregate economic output. The SIP also underscores an insight fundamental to the methodology proposed in this document: people experience many transitions in their life course and they can be negatively affected by them, which can lead to escalating detrimental effects throughout life course. In other words, it is better to prepare and prevent rather than repair the damage once it\u2019s done (EC, 2013a). 1.3 Explaining Social Investment In terms of explaining social investment, it is necessary to offer a more comprehensive explanation than an overview of how the concept has developed. We believe the best way to explain social investment is by describing the ways in which it differs from the neoliberal policy paradigm. After all, social investment is not an entirely novel theory - it is, in essence, still the study of welfare states but with a different focus. This shift in focus can be reconstructed into five conceptualizations (or focus shifts) that differentiate social investment from its paradigmatic predecessor. These five conceptualizations are: (1) the already alluded to changing nature of social risks; (2) the welfare state\u2019s carrying capacity; (3) the importance of a life course perspective; (4) the weight of gender and family demography, and; (5) the critical prerequisite of institutional complementarities for the outcomes of interdependent policy packages. This section will now elaborate on each of these conceptualizations. 1.3.1 New social risks The topic of new (or changing) social risks has to do with more flexible labour markets and has been explained earlier. To reiterate: as life course dynamics are becoming increasingly erratic and heterogeneous, as a consequence of more frequent labour market transition and family change, individuals are facing increased risk of damaging their human capital, potentially causing scarring effects throughout their life course, especially in periods of critical transitions. To some extent, the distinction between \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 social risks is a misnomer. In the wake of global financial crisis the \u2018old\u2019 social risk of unemployment resurfaced with a vengeance. The importance of social investment policies is that they address \u2018old\u2019 risks in \u2018new\u2019 ways, as Jon Kvist (2015a) puts it. The incidence of unemployment today cannot be effectively addressed by mere temporary income compensation, paid of a social insurance fund. If the jobless and workless are not immediately serviced through active labour market policies, their skills will atrophy to the extent that they may never be able to return to the labour market (Leoni, 2015). There is need to develop something of an \u2018consolidated old-and-new social risk analysis\u2019 wherein capacitating and compensating policy interventions are complementary, not rivals (Crouch, forthcoming). ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 12 1.3.2 Welfare state\u2019s carrying capacity In Why We Need a New Welfare State Esping-Andersen et al. deplore how much the debate on the future of the welfare state is focused on social reform directed toward budgetary cost-containment here and now. The more dynamic aspect of how social policy interacts with fertility, education and labour supply (the future tax base) remains largely unexplored. From this more dynamic approach to thinking about social policies as investments in the in the productive potential of European citizens in order to guarantee fail and sustainable welfare state preferred by large electoral majorities across Europe, a new welfare cost-benefit equation becomes apparent. This is the second re- conceptualization of a simple cost-benefit equation for a pension system, generalized for the welfare state at large (Myles, 2002): \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60 \u00d7 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60 Myles advocated policy re-orientation from the \u2018numerator\u2019 to the \u2018denominator\u2019 of the welfare state\u2019s cost-benefit equation, by explicitly posing the question of how are social policy interventions able to contribute to higher employment and future improvements in productivity in times of ageing populations. By shifting the focus from the \u2018numerator\u2019 to the \u2018denominator\u2019, Myles brought to the forefront how fiscal resources for welfare provision were by and large generated by productive workers. While mainstream academic welfare state research primarily focused on the redistributive function of social policy for different classes and the sharing of the costs associated with supporting those in need, Why We Need a New Welfare State shifted gears from analysing the cross- sectional distributive impact of social policy interventions here and now to an assessment of the long-term carrying capacity of the welfare state through enhancing aggregate productivity and employment through as a means to securing wellbeing and life chances, including the fundamental argument that economic insecurity and unequal opportunities incur considerable waste of valuable human capital. A larger, more productive and less socially scarred, workforce helps best to secure the funding base of the welfare state\u2019s costly but effective social spending. Social investment is perhaps best understood as policy investment in tomorrow\u2019s taxpayers as future productive workers: investing in children, through high quality education and affordable childcare as the means to achieve a sustainable welfare state by boosting the denominator side of the equation. The emphasis on the welfare state\u2019s \u2018carrying capacity\u2019 in Why We Need a New Welfare State cannot in retrospect be dismissed as one-sided argument dismissive of traditional policy provision of minimum income protection and social insurance. Esping-Andersen et al., writing at the start of the Lisbon Era, were highly critical of Third Way policy advocacy for its unduly selective belief that \u201c(\u2026) activation may substitute for conventional income guarantees. This may be regarded as na\u00efve optimism, but, worse, it may also be counterproductive. (\u2026)[T]he minimization of poverty and income insecurity is a precondition for any effective social investment strategy\u201d (Esping-Andersen, 2002: 5). 1.3.3 Life course perspective The third conceptualization, also stemming from Why We Need a New Welfare State and the changing nature of social risks, shifts the focus from a distinction between welfare \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 and \u2018contributors\u2019 to a life course insurance perspective. One of the aims of social investment policies is to help ease life course transitions from childhood to youth, from school to work, from sickness to health and subsequent labour market reintegration, or from having a child back to the labour market (Kvist, 2015a). ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 13 Throughout the life course practically all citizens rely on all kinds of welfare provision for childcare, education, social insurance, retraining and activation, health care, pensions and family support. Because of the secular erosion of \u2018standard employment relationship\u2019 through part-time work, fixed-term contracts, temp-agency work and self-employment, there is also a need to rethink labour market policy and employment regulation with the aim of minimizing precarious and involuntary employment and underemployment (Gallie, 2002; Schmid, 2008). As a consequence of more frequent life-course and labour transitions, welfare states in rich democracies increasingly have to provide \u2018capacitating social services\u2019, a term coined by Charles Sabel (2012), aimed at equipping and assisting individuals and families in mitigating the unforeseeable hazards they face, in a complementary fashion with more traditional \u2018compensatory\u2019 social insurance provisions. Although much of the political debate about the welfare state is coached in terms of a divide between of \u2018them\u2019 and \u2018us\u2019, between those who benefit from the welfare state and \u2018hard working\u2019 citizens who pay for it, the reality is entirely different. School-age youngsters become workers, ill citizens return to the labour market after rehabilitation, and majority of unemployment beneficiaries, under normal economic conditions, find their way back to the labour market, supported by active employment and training policies, thereby resuming to contribute to the welfare state\u2019s \u2018carrying capacity\u2019 and, in the aggregate, to the economic pie (Hills, 2014). 1.3.4 Gender and family demography Fourthly, and intimately related to the emphasis on the welfare state\u2019s carrying capacity and the imperative of a life course perspective, social investment conceptualizes the role of women and family policy differently than traditional neoliberal social policy or passive male-breadwinner social insurance provision. Given the fact that female participation is critical to sustaining the welfare state in ageing societies and that parenting is crucial to child development, 21st century policymakers have good reasons to want to support robust families by helping parents to balance work and family life. Social Investment strongly advocates greater gender equality in labour markets and households as the means to support employment and fertility aspirations. Esping-Andersen et al. (2002) point out that quality preschool childcare services in conjunction with other policy interventions enable more parents \u2013 and especially mothers \u2013 to engage in fulltime employment, thereby contributing to rising employment while helping young kids to a \u2018strong start\u2019 in life, which will help them to be successful in work, health, and family life later on, as James Heckman has shown in numerous publications (2000; 2008). 1.3.5 Social investment policy analysis A fifth innovation or conceptualization of social investment is that of social investment policy analysis , which holds the relationship between social policy and economic performance to be critically dependent on institutional complementarities of mutually reinforcing policy instruments, at the micro-, meso-, and macro-levels (Hemerijck, 2002). Welfare states are complex policy systems, made up of interdependent policy provisions of active and passive labour market policy, social insurance and pensions, family and care services, and more. Mitigating or preventing social problems usually requires more than one policy in operation, not to mention that to solve societal issues various dilemmas need to be addressed. This conundrum calls for a policy analysis that does not isolate specific policies in an attempt to evaluate their impact using the na\u00efve ceteris paribus assumptions that institutional context either appear not to matter much, or can be controlled for. As this report argues, the very opposite of such assumptions is true, as institutional structures and environmental conditions play perhaps the most ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 14 important role in determining policy success or failure. Economic crises for example engender a multitude of spillover effect across interdependent areas of socioeconomic regulation. In some welfare states policy interdependencies are the product of institutional design; other welfare states are characterized by a high degree of mutual indifference between various welfare policy provisions. Success or failure in containing and resolving salient social problems very much depends how policy actors across different policy areas coordinate problem-solving strategies. Cross-sectoral policy interdependencies, intended and unintended interaction effects and coordination strategies are inherently difficult to analyse and assess. Understanding how social investment policies work out under different institutional structures and economic contexts is at the heart of the matter. However, conducting such a complementarity- focused policy analysis is extremely complex and thus far methodologically underdeveloped: despite the attractiveness of adding an additional \u2018layer\u2019 to policy analysis with the ability to explain previously puzzling policy outcomes, there is no methodology concise enough to produce actionable policy insights and thus most policy analysis in Europe is still conducted based on the silo approach of addressing problems in isolation (Aiginger, 2016: 44). However, the silo approach incurs extra costs due to negative spillover effects and leads to sub-optimal policy outcomes due to conflicting goals and lack of mutual learning (Aiginger, 2016: 43). To aid in moving away from this approach, this document proposes, illustrates, and defends a methodology for social investment policy analysis, which avoids the pitfalls of the silo approach. Constructing such a methodology is not entirely innovative, as the concept of \u2018institutional complementarity\u2019 is well established in comparative welfare regime analysis (Esping-Andersen, 1990, 1999; Scharpf and Schmidt, 2000; Hemerijck, 2013) and the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) approach to comparative economic advantage (Hall and Soskice, 2001). Central to this literature is how variegated policy sectors, ranging from wage setting to skill formation, industrial relation and corporate governance, social insurance and labour market policies, pension and health care, somehow \u2018belong\u2019 together in a form of a Gestalt (Amable, 2005; Crouch, 2010). Nonetheless, despite improved understanding in terms of the \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 between institutions and policy provisions under specific conditions, such an approach stops short from operationalizing strong analytical tools to guide us in a comprehensive manner to test positive and adverse interaction effects between social insurance, human capital development and labour market policy and regulation and their combined outcomes (Kenworthy, 2006). Section 2: Life course transitions and evidence The previous section aptly describes social investment as both a reaction to changing social risks and the increasing inadequacy of the male bread-winner social insurance model at providing optimal life chances for all, but also as an intellectual innovation started in Why We Need a New Welfare State , which was subsequently developed into a rather robust conceptual framework. However, in the era of evidence based policy, policy makers not only require an interpretive framework for understanding the changing nature of social risks, the effectiveness of their responses is also contingent on how prior interpretation speaks to empirical evidence. Social investment policy analysis as an analytical framework has its foundations in the existing literature, but it has not yet been explicitly described, defended, or used as such in testable policy analysis. This report aims to build on the intellectual innovation of social investment and for the first time to clearly articulate the fifth focus shift of comparative welfare state analysis proposed by social investment: the move towards a fully-fledged empirical social investment policy analysis . ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 15 To aid in developing such an analytical framework, this section first introduces the crucial taxonomy of complementary policy functions of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 and then introduces some of the existing evidence in order to illustrate the applicability of this triadic distinction, but also as way to provide the literature review. While presenting this evidence, attention is also paid to the methodological shortcomings in order to provide an accurate empirical picture. 2.1 \u2018Stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 in institutional complementarity To be able to functionally analyse policy and especially policy mixes, it is crucial to be able to distinguish between various policy functions. Such an attempt is made in the Social Investment Package as it, inspired by James Musgrave\u2019s (1959) functional approach to public finance, conceptualizes three main functions of social policy: macroeconomic stabilization, income redistribution to support at-risk groups, and future- oriented social investments. Although Musgrave\u2019s public finance perspective, conceptualized in the late 1950s, is a good starting point for a functional policy analysis of social investment, Hemerijck (2014) has recently developed a more fitting conceptual taxonomy of social investment based on three analytically distinctive and complementary social investment policy functions: (1) easing the \u2018flow\u2019 of contemporary labour-market and life-course transitions; (2) raising the quality of the \u2018stock\u2019 of human capital and capabilities; and (3) maintaining strong minimum-income universal safety nets as social protection and economic stabilization \u2018buffers\u2019 in ageing societies (Hemerijck, 2014; 2015). The \u2018buffer\u2019 function in this taxonomy aims both at securing income protection and at securing economic stabilization. Adequate minimum income protection is a critical precondition for an effective social investment strategy, as income \u2018buffers\u2019 help to compensate and mitigate social inequity at the micro level and thus provide the necessary financial security for people to develop their human capital while at the same time stabilizing the business cycle at the macro level. This kind of \u2018Keynesianism through the back door\u2019 is still practiced today, as we have seen from the disruption of the 2007\u2013 2010 financial crisis. The \u2018flow\u2019 function is directed at making the most efficient use and allocation of labour resources over the life course in support of high employment participation of both genders. The priority is thus to re-integrate school-leavers, unemployed, parents (especially mothers), older worker and the disabled back into the labour market and provide assistance during vulnerable transitions (when more permanent labour market exit is a real threat). The road to high employment levels is therefore not paved with maximum labour market flexibility or only the neoliberal mantra of \u2018making work pay\u2019. Outside of making work pay, the policy imperative needs to also \u2018make transitions pay\u2019 (at least in the long run), through the provision of \u2018active securities\u2019 or \u2018social bridges\u2019 across volatile transitions between jobs, thereby ensuring sustainable and longer working careers and, by implication, adequate pensions after retirement (Schmidt, 2015; Hobson, 2014). The \u2018stock\u2019 function is linked to future productivity, and is directed towards \u2018capacitating\u2019 interventions enhancing and maintaining human capital or capabilities over the life course in ageing societies. This includes early childhood education and care, general education, post-secondary vocational and university training and life-long learning. Given the fact that children make up the future workforce, investing in better education and affordable childcare will ultimately foster higher levels of productivity and employment when the ageing predicament reaches its pinnacle. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 16 In actual policy practice, there is significant functional overlap between the policy functions of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 (De Deken, 2014; De Deken, forthcoming; Dr\u00e4bing and Nelson, forthcoming). They all affect, in one way or another, the quality and quantity of labour supply. For example, early childhood education enables parents, especially mothers, to combine paid work with parenthood (as \u2018flow\u2019), thereby also securing household income \u2013 as \u2018buffers\u2019, while (in terms of \u2018stock\u2019) stimulating cognitive and social capacities of children, especially from low-income families. Early childhood education and care thus contributes to three objectives: parental employment \u2018flow\u2019, improved household income and reduced chance of poverty (\u2018buffer\u2019), and an investment in the future human capital \u2018stock\u2019 of current cohorts of children. A similar example from a different policy area is minimum income protection, which provides \u2018buffers\u2019 and financial security for those in-between jobs, allowing them to move to more prosperous economic sectors, thus smoothing \u2018flow\u2019 in terms of enhanced mobility while also maintaining and protecting human capital \u2018stock\u2019 (which can be eroded by job mismatch). These three policy functions are not only intertwined, but they complement each other: they provide better returns in a policy mix, where all three functions are aligned to a common goal in a multiplicity of policy areas. This argument can also be framed in terms of necessity (more negatively), in the sense that a \u2018missing\u2019 policy complementarity can easily cause policy failure or incur higher costs. Looking at the example of labour markets: upgrading human capital \u2018stock\u2019 without protecting human capital through social security \u2018buffers\u2019 and activating 'flows' is wasteful, as peoples\u2019 skills deteriorate if faced with a period of unemployment or job mismatch. Having fragmented benefit-systems undermines the automatic stabilization capacity of safety net \u2018buffers\u2019. Not extending social security entitlements to zero-hour contracts and other employment arrangements is bound to lead to problems of social security coverage in a manner that undermines the effectiveness of safety nets in the future. As much as this document tries to present clear examples of complementarities amplifying the desired effect or causing a failure, the devil is in the detail: overgenerous policies with unnecessarily long leave or unemployment periods will create undesirable incentives to leave the labour market for longer than necessary and thus fail to achieve their primary purpose in the first place. Complementarities are about careful policy design and balance that allows policies to work together to achieve higher returns, not about the belief that simply having certain element in a policy mix will yield higher returns. Policy analysis that studies interactions between policies is, strictly speaking, nothing new. The message of institutional complementarities is particularly persuasively brought to the fore by the recent OECD (2015) report \u201cIn It Together. Why Less Inequality Benefits All\u201d. According to this report one of the main transmission mechanisms between inequality and growth is human capital development. While there is always a gap in education outcomes across individuals with different socioeconomic backgrounds, this gap is particularly wide in high inequality countries with disadvantaged households struggling to gain access to quality education for their offspring. In the European context, the message of policy synergies is very clearly articulated in the WWW for Europe report on socio-ecological transitions (Aiginger, 2016): the simultaneity of policy goals is a necessary synergy for minimizing negative spillover effects as well as for solving \u201cdouble or triple dividends\u201d - referring to conundrums much like the service economy trilemma, or the welfare and efficiency tradeoff (Aiginger, 2016). In conclusion, OECD and WWW for Europe emphasize that there is no optimal policy mix. Each country needs to design its own package, depending on key social, economic and institutional conditions, keeping ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 17 in mind that it is often possible, through careful policy design, to pursue goals that neoliberal economic theory would see as conflicting. 2.2 Life course transitions in review This section now presents evidence on policy interventions and their economic \u2018returns\u2019 relevant to different transitions throughout a life course. This evidence is not meant to be exhaustive (for a more exhaustive overview see next section), its main purpose is to illustrate the applicability of the \u2018stock\u2019, \u2018flow\u2019, and \u2018buffer\u2019 distinction and the value of adopting a life course perspective focused on transitions, as well as some common challenges relevant to data sources and research methods. It is also worth noting, that specific policy areas are mentioned mainly for transitions where they are the most crucial, omitting the fact that they affect the entire life course of an individual. Due to the sheer number of identifiable policy complementarities this subsection only focuses on the most exemplary and most cited ones. 2.2.1 From childcare to education Early childcare and education (ECEC) and general education are perhaps the most important policy areas when it comes to developing the \u2018stock\u2019 of human capital, especially in intensely knowledge-based economies. High-quality early education and care have been shown to reduce crime, raise earnings, and promote higher overall educational attainment. More importantly, the economic returns of early education are much larger than returns of any education provision later in life (Heckman, 2006). ECEC positively influences school dropout rates (Sabel, et. al. forthcoming), tertiary educational outcomes (Cuhne and Heckman, 2007), motivation in subsequent education (Esping-Andersen, 2015), and other variables crucial to improving the productivity of the next generation and thus the carrying capacity of the welfare state. The carrying capacity is also improved as recipients of high-quality childcare are less likely to require assistance (in the form of \u2018buffers\u2019) later in life (Havnes & Mogstad, 2011). Outside of improving the carrying capacity in this way, ECEC can also positively impact nutrition and the overall health of individuals (Heckman, et. al., 2006), which further reinforces the carrying capacity of the welfare state, be it in a less direct way: healthier individuals are likely to be more productive and, if coupled with appropriate healthcare policies, are likely to spend a larger part of their life in full-time employment. Outside of being good at building the \u2018stock\u2019 of human capital, when ECEC is universally available (in terms of access, affordability and capacity), it also fosters more equal development of children, providing them with equal opportunities in life: the returns on early education are especially high for socio-economically disadvantaged children (Heckman, 2006; Burger, 2010), as they can greatly benefit and learn from their more successful peers (Hanushek, et. al. 2003). This is a very desirable outcome based on its normative value alone, but it can foster inclusive growth through improving human capital (OECD, 2015). As mentioned before, not only is this improvement of \u2018stock\u2019 going to lead to less \u2018buffers\u2019 later in life, it will also help by reducing externalizing and asocial behaviour (Schindler, et. al., 2015), thus helping children to acquire the social skills necessary to make effective transitions later in life (improving their ability to \u2018flow\u2019). To really translate ECEC into educational attainment, individuals need to move easily between different educational stages. These transitions can be problematic as, for example, the transition from home care or a childcare facility to preschool (group setting) can itself be problematic to the point that some children (especially those from ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 18 disadvantaged backgrounds) can be excluded either from preschool in general or be effectively excluded by their peers within a preschool, developing asocial behaviour and dislike towards education. Preventing this does not only require teachers qualified to handle these specific problems, it also involves cooperation with the parents to provide a more coherent learning experience at home (eg. bedtime reading) and in school (increasing \u2018stock\u2019 by easing the \u2018flow\u2019 between home and preschool). The next transition is from preschool to primary school and the way this transition is handled has a significant impact on primary school performance (Ahtola, et. al., 2011). There are multiple ways to handle these transitions, ranging from more coordination between schools and preschools to \u2018transition year\u2019 programmes that integrate preschool material with increased expectations of primary school. These approaches mainly differ on a country-by-country basis as specific institutional and contextual factors necessitate different interventions. Essentially, preschool itself is partially a \u2018flow\u2019 policy to ease the transition of children from home to education: in Europe the majority of states have introduced legal entitlements to preschool education for children that are close to entering school, and some have even made the last preschool year (or more) compulsory (European Commission, 2014), largely for the purpose of easing the \u2018flow\u2019 into primary education and reducing early school dropout, which can negatively affect employment later in life (Esping-Andersen, 2015). In terms of evaluating the returns of ECEC and primary education the PISA ( Programme for International Student Assessment ) and PIRLS ( Progress in International Reading Literacy Study ) data are very useful, as they provide a measure of skill before the relevant cohort enters the labour market. According to Eurydice and Eurostat, who analysed all information contained in both PISA and PIRLS for the year 2012/2013, students who attended ECEC for more than a year outperform those who did not in math. The highest gap between the two groups has been identified in Belgium, Germany and France, but across OECD countries students attended pre-primary school for more than one year scored 53 points higher in mathematics than students who had not. Some other variables examined in the study (i.e. socioeconomic background, gender, or personal motivation) ended up playing a stronger role in explaining performance in tests of math and reading, but a 2% of the difference in math scores can be attributed to earlier enrolment in ECEC. The study also echoes the conclusion that disadvantaged children are those who profit the most from ECEC (in this context the benefit is shown in terms of reading ability). Despite this, the problem of disadvantaged children not participating in ECEC is still quite pronounced and presents an important negative complementarity: ECEC needs to be coupled with a policy that supports the \u2018flow\u2019 of disadvantaged children from home care to ECEC, as children who are not in ECEC cannot benefit from it. Since recent work shows that parents of high socio-economic status are more likely to enrol their children to ECEC at a younger age (Ghysels & Van Lancker 2011; Wirth & Lichtenberger 2012) and socioeconomically disadvantaged children tend to participate in ECEC less, policy needs to be designed very carefully to avoid Matthew Effects. In terms of variables, commonly used indicators are only a part of the story: spending, for example, provides little information regarding quality of the educational provisions. De Deken (forthcoming) discusses the limitations of \u2018input\u2019 side indicators in general and stresses that, due to the fact that some social investment policies aim to achieve multiple goals, but the expenditure category is only one. It then becomes impossible to determine what fraction of that expenditure is devoted to a specific goal: for example childcare should foster returns in terms of improved educational attainment, but it also allows mothers to re-enter labour market faster, and both of these effects are influenced by more policies (expenditure items) than just childcare. Assigning expenditure items to effects then becomes utterly misleading. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 19 By way of accommodating imperfect policy input indicators, it is worth looking into output indicators. For example, PISA and PIACC measure the skills and competences across countries, and therefore give a sense of how education systems perform. Furthermore, these skills are crucial in and of themselves, as foundational skills in mathematics have major impact on individuals\u2019 life chances (OECD, 2012). Other indicators related to labour market outcomes, such as wages, employment, types of employment, and/or risks of unemployment and underemployment (Carneiro, Heckman et al. 2010; Hanushek & Woessmann, 2015). However, due to data availability, these evaluations are usually conducted at the early stages of an individual\u2019s career. Hanusheck et al. (2003) show that this leads to an underestimation of lifetime returns to skills by over one quarter by using PIACC data that cover all lifetime earnings to produce better estimates of returns. They substitute the (input based) schooling variable with measure of cognitive skills and show that, despite heterogeneities across countries, standard deviation in numeracy skills leads to on average 18% wage increase for prime age worker (Hanusheck et al., 2003). Even though these are very optimistic results, there are factors that have been found to restrict the \u2018flow\u2019 in labour markets and thus hamper the returns (in terms of employment and wages) to skills, such as higher union density, stricter employment protection and higher share of public employment. Moreover, as the OECD reports on educational performance at different levels of inequality for different groups: \u201c[H]igher inequality of incomes of parents tend to imply higher inequality of life chances of their children. To achieve greater inequality of opportunities without tackling increasing inequality in outcomes will be very difficult (OECD, 2015a: 27).\u201d In short, \u2018stocks\u2019 develop in the context of available \u2018buffers\u2019. Moving away from variables to the method of analysis, the Mincer equation has been the most popular method. It is a method that aims to capture the impact of additional schooling year(s) on wages, risking omitted variable bias. Over the past century, in Europe, the returns of education have remained quite uniform (Middendorf, 2008), but there is some variation with Portugal and Ireland showing the highest returns of education and Italy and the UK showing the lowest. Schooling has a stronger impact on the higher tail of the income distribution and returns are higher when the differences along wage distributions are stronger. Using a different dataset such as the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) allows for cross-country comparisons that previous studies could not muster; the PURE study was able to observe returns over time and no common trend was detected: some countries seem to have increasing returns to schooling for men (Italy, UK and Denmark) while some other had decreasing ones (Austria and Portugal). Gender, once again, plays a critical role as positive effects of education on labour force participation have been found mainly for women. In Western Germany women born in 1970s saw their returns decrease by 6% with respect to those born in the second half of the 20s (Boockmann & Steiner, 2006). Last finding worth mentioning is that individuals born in larger cohorts will face lower individual returns to education. 2.2.2 From education to employment The school to work transition is another important advance in the professional life of individuals crucial for flourishing economies. Negative externalities that can materialize during this transition include job mismatch, higher risk of unemployment, or longer unemployment duration, all wasting valuable resources and thus harming the economy. Active labour market policies (ALMPs) form a set of policies focused mainly on labour market \u2018flow\u2019 that help (amongst other things) with this crucial transition. In general, there is no strong consensus on the returns of such policies and the results tend to fall between being positive or not significant. Different models have been employed to ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 20 estimate the impact and effectiveness of ALMP policies, from cross sectional analyses to quasi-experimental designs aimed at detecting causal relations, effectively ranging from macroeconomic effects estimations to microeconomic evaluations. This, in conjunction with the wide range of different ALMP policies, leads to an array of different results. That being said, from the macroeconomic perspective there is a consensus that ALMP spending helps in reducing unemployment, as shown by Martin (2014) in a review of ALMPs and aggregate labour market performance. Positive long run effects on employment have been found in, for example, Germany for almost all considered measures: the exceptions in the German context are apprenticeships, which don\u2019t impact employment and public jobs, which are ineffective in the long run (Caliendo & Schmidl, 2016). ALMPs can also help with protection of the most vulnerable groups, as there is evidence that ALMP can decrease poverty levels among the less skilled (Rovny, 2014), among older workers (Knuth 2014), and amongst women (Del Boca and Wetzels 2008). From a more microeconomic perspective, Martins et al. (2014) have studied a particular activation program in Portugal with the aim to test whether the impact of activating programs remains strong in times of economic crisis. Results show that the program doubled the monthly reemployment probability, showing that in certain contexts, and with appropriate institutional complementarities in place, ALMPs can greatly enhance the \u2018flow\u2019 element of policies even in a recession. This finding is confirmed by Card et al. (2015), who conclude that ALMPs tend to have a stronger impact in periods of slow growth and high unemployment, which makes them an important supplement to the \u2018buffer\u2019 function through securing household income. More recent experimental studies show a positive impact of different types of interventions: monitoring the job search effort in Belgium increases the possibility of being employed by 9% (Cockx et al, 2011), while McVicar (2008) showed that stopping the monitoring activity in Northern Ireland leads to a decrease in probability to get out of unemployment of 17%. In general, the effects of ALMP can vary widely from being insignificant to doubling the monthly chance of being employed. The size of the resulting effect is largely determined by the institutional complementarities which, for this specific life course transition, have to do with both \u2018stocks\u2019 and \u2018buffers\u2019 established through other policy areas. The importance of stock (education and training) is very self-evident: activating young adults and helping them with job search is hardly useful, if they lack the skills to actually be employed. The \u2018buffer\u2019 function is crucial both for general, but also transition-specific reasons: on a general level, having the financial security to not be immediately \u2018pushed into\u2019 employment can reduce job mismatch and allow one to find a more productive and better paid job (Acemoglu & Shimer, 2000), as well as keep that job for a longer period of time (Centeno, 2004). On a more specific level, moving out of the family home is a crucial part of this transition that can be supported by for example housing benefits and increase the labour mobility and general self-sufficiency of young adults. However, especially in the case of ALMPs, there are some negative complementarities worth considering. The most important and pronounced one is that of a \u2018Matthew effect\u2019, substantiated by the rationale that ALMP policies require an individual to have some skills employers desire and to not be socially excluded. Thus, the very worst off in a given population will not benefit from ALMP (as they are likely to be socially excluded and lack the necessary skills), whereas the middle class will benefit greatly. In light of the empirical evidence both for (Deleeck, Huybrechs and Cantillon, 1983) and against (Burgoon, forthcoming; Rovny, 2014) the existence \u2018Matthew effects\u2019, it is very important to make sure that ALMP is not implemented in a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 but rather as a policy that through coordination with other policies offers the necessary training or financial support some people might need to make their \u2018activation\u2019 meaningful. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 21 In this case, it is also worth considering complementarities that are preventive in nature, in the sense that they provide an option for individuals to bounce back, should something \u2018go wrong\u2019. Such complementarities are extremely important for young adults, especially if they lack a good financial and emotional support system on a household level. In the Netherlands, after a decade of growing cohorts of early school leavers, a \u2018youth unemployment ambassador\u2019 was appointed for the period of 2013-15, with the mandate to stimulate employers, municipalities and other stakeholders to improve job and training opportunities for young people at risk. In parallel, the budget for career orientation programs increased, allowing for a \u2018double engagement\u2019 of developing more job and career competencies in Vocational Education and Training (VET) and for the development of stronger linkages between labour market actors and the institutions of VET. Stronger cooperation at the regional level, and, especially, more job coaching facilities for vulnerable group of young people living in deprived areas, in combination with placement offers, traineeships and internships offered by employers proved fortuitous. Dutch youth unemployment and early school leaving numbers have fallen in recent year. To be sure, it is unclear whether these declines are the result of a concerted \u2018social investment impetus\u2019, as it inherently difficult to disentangle favourable policy effects from the more general improvement of the Dutch economy in recent years (CEDEFOP, 2015). But what the comparative evidence on youth unemployment, early school leaving, and the number of youngsters Neither in Employment and Education and Training (NEETs) does seem to exemplify is that lower levels of early school leaving and lower youth unemployment is the importance of comprehensive but flexible VET systems and also more job-related learning and training for labour market opportunities for youngsters, also in terms of mitigating inequality (Busemeyer, 2015). The reason why the evidence on ALMP is divided lies partly in the methodological considerations. As Martin (2014) points out, results of most studies on ALMP returns are affected by endogeneity: ALMP spending is always correlated with labour market conditions, meaning that it is very difficult to isolate its effects in single case studies and close to impossible in multi-case comparative study designs. Another reason for why the evidence is so mixed is because the outcome variable used to measure each program\u2019s impact does matter (Burgoon, forthcoming): studies based on registered unemployment are more likely to find positive effects than those based on other outcome variables (like employment or earnings). Naturally, different studies use different outcome variables to measure impact, which makes it difficult to compare them. Due to the methodological variety used to estimate the returns of ALMPs, as well as the different institutional complementarities, the results are often not significant or mixed. That in itself is not a problem, as it is to be expected given the crucial role of institutional complementarities for ALMPs. 2.2.3 From Employment to Employment Due to the increased volatility of labour markets it is no longer the case that people can expect to work fulltime for one company for the majority of their life \u2013 working age adults today are much more likely to change occupations throughout their life more often than any previous generation. As such, being able to transition smoothly from one employment status to another is crucial for today\u2019s economy. A key component to using transitions for ones benefit (rather than just mitigating their negative impact) are ALMPs (discussed above at length). This set of policies focused on \u2018flow\u2019 is extremely important for individuals who become unemployed, as the assistance in job search (coupled with relatively short but generous unemployment benefits conditional on job search) can allow them to re-enter labour market sooner rather than later (Del Boca and Wetzels 2008; Martins et al. 2014). ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 22 However, what is much more important for adults than for fresh graduates or young adults is that ALMPs are coupled with training and lifelong learning policies: with today\u2019s rapid technological advances the skills one learns in education are not going to be up-to- date and useful for an entire career, especially given that higher life expectancy is extending the average length of a career. There are only a few countries in Europe that have developed continuous job-related adult learning and training policies. Nordic countries outperform the rest, with Luxembourg Netherlands and Slovenia also performing quite well. Studies show that lifelong learning reduces poverty and has a moderate positive effect on employment (Gooby, 2014) especially in the case of older and less skilled workers (Knuth 2014). Lifelong learning is also crucial to increasing labour market exit age as declining \u2018stock\u2019 of human capital leads to worse labour market prospects, which can motivate people to exit the labour market prematurely. As mentioned earlier in this report, one of the crucial emphases of social investment is on female labour force participation, as children still penalize women in terms of their employment prospects. To combat this problem multiple policies from different policy areas need to synergize. Luckily, policy makers have been responding to this challenge as last years have seen a steep increase of female employment rate (Billari and Esping- Andersen, 2015). Studies on different datasets (Cipollone, 2012; Del Boca, 2002; Rovny, 2014) try to estimate the impact of the increased feminization of the labour force, showing that in the second half of the twentieth century the trend has been having fewer children and later in life (Del Boca, 2002), but there has been an inversion after 1985 (Kohler et al., 2002). Still, fertility rates remain low and are correlated with youth unemployment (Del Boca, 2007). Sub-optimal fertility rates are to a large degree caused by the fact that having children harms women\u2019s labour market prospects, forcing them to choose between work or having children. The problem is often not unemployment per se, but the type of employment women can enter into after having a child: a very high share of (forced) part-time work and other non-full-time arrangements. The availability of part time jobs increases the probability that women are employed in all European countries (Bardasi and Gornik, 2000) and only in few countries is the probability of women opting for a part time job higher than opting for no job (namely the Netherlands, Ireland, and Belgium). Despite a high percentage of women working part-time being a trend for decades now in some countries (The Netherlands and Switzerland), women are often forced to work part-time, giving them fewer chances to progress their careers (Saraceno, forthcoming) or provide the necessary financial security, especially in a single-parent household situation (Esping- Andersen, 2015). The more intricate and salient social policy problem is that female employment is crucial for the sustainability of the welfare state in the short term, but that high fertility rates are crucial for its sustainability in the long run. Thus, reconciling high levels of female employment with having children is of utmost priority. The area of family policy attempts to do exactly that through a combination of various policy functions. A crucial part are of course ALMPs together with training policies (Martin & Grubb, 2001), as caring for a child usually implies a period of not participating in the labour market. The negative effects of leaving the labour market can of course be mitigated by gender-equal and generous parental leave (Nieuwenhuis, et. al., 2012). However, even if parental leave is split equally between maternity and paternity leave, the leave period still needs to be somewhat short (Del Boca and Wetzels, 2008), meaning that there needs to be good and affordable healthcare that parents are willing to enter their child into at an early age to resume their careers with minimal disruption (Carta and Rizzica, 2014; Verbist, forthcoming; Simonsen, 2010). ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 23 Family policy is one of the best examples of the critical portent of complementarities between \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019 and \u2018buffers\u2019, as there are many detailed conditions that can cause policy failure. In terms of \u2018stock\u2019, if daycare is of low quality and unlikely to cognitively develop children, parents will be reluctant to enrol their children. In terms of \u2018flow\u2019 the daycare needs to cover the entire day in order to allow mothers to work full time, parental leave needs to be appropriately adjusted to allow for return to employment, or in the case that a mother chooses to stay at home longer, ALMP policies need to provide activation and assistance following a prolonged absence from the labour market. In terms of \u2018buffers\u2019, the entire transition process needs to be affordable, meaning that if daycare is accessible and of very high quality, the policy can still fail should it be prohibitively expensive (Carta and Rizzica, 2014). The threat of (mainly mothers) leaving the labour market for extended periods of over a year to care for a child are a part of a larger problem of (mainly) women having a discontinuous relationship with the labour market. Not only do they tend to be employed less or merely in part-time positions, their prospects are harmed by first leaving because of children and then potentially leaving again to care for frail relatives, as debated in next section. 2.2.4 From employment to retirement With this transition, the ideal economic returns are achieved when it is delayed and when the negative externalities on both those retiring, but also their family members, are managed. To delay this transition, the retirement age has been postponed in almost every country in Europe and the countries with the highest retirement age are Sweden (66.1), Portugal (68.4), Ireland (64.6) and Estonia (63.6). Given the increasing life expectancy, it is crucial for the sustainability of the welfare state that people stay in employment longer and receive pensions for a shorter period of time. In doing so people will also retire with higher pensions, allowing them to maintain a higher quality of life and smoothening their consumption. Some of the most salient policies to facilitate longer working lives are the aforementioned retraining programs to maintain \u2018stock\u2019 of human capital, but also ALMP programs that can improve the \u2018flow\u2019 especially for older workers, which also supports the \u2018stock\u2019 as skills tend to erode (Gangl, 2016) In general, labour market transitions become increasingly precarious with age, as older workers experience perhaps the most serious scarring effects in terms of future employment prospects (Chan & Stevens, 2001). Social investment for the elderly has been steered by the catchphrase of \u2018active ageing\u2019, as the focus is largely on extending working careers and employment in advanced age, while maintaining independence, thus allowing younger relatives to stay in the labour market. This is also a major policy challenge, as most European countries struggle with the employment of the older part of prime aged workers (Kvist, 2015a). This development also has a very relevant link to poverty, as (in the American context) the well-off enjoy better health and retire at a significantly older age than previously (upward trend in retirement age since 1980s) - a trend that is much less pronounced for the less well-off, who still tend to retire closer to 65 years of age and have less \u2018flexible\u2019 retirements (Alstott, 2016). One of the crucial policy areas for this transition is healthcare. Older cohorts benefit greatly from health care and often need healthcare to be able to stay in the labour market: there are ways to manage health problems associated with advanced age, including partial retirement, preventive healthcare assistance, or an adjustment to either the workplace or the worker. An adjustment of the workplace in this sense refers to ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 24 accommodation of disabled or chronically sick workers who can still be productive, and adjustment of the worker refers to for example supported employment, which can improve employment prospects for people with disabilities (Kinoshita et. al., 2013). Especially investment in prevention is proving effective when it comes to minimizing the effects of chronic diseases (WHO, 2012). The importance of healthcare cannot be overstated, as involuntary loss of employment has a negative impact on health (Gallo, et. al., 2000), which in turn makes re-employment even more difficult. In terms of general health, scholars have tried to estimate the impact of health on economic growth and produced some reliable estimates. Bloom et al. (2001) tried to associate health with economic growth, as it is a key dimension (in microeconomic studies) of human capital. The study found a positive and statistically significant impact of health on the final aggregate output, i.e. GDP, by employing life expectancy as a proxy for health of the workforce, justified by the strong correlation between the two variables. A one-year increase in life expectancy results in a 4% growth of GDP \u2013 a finding comparable to those of a previous cross-country analysis (Bloom & Canning, 2000). In a recent working paper by CEPS, it is estimated that an extension of working lives by five years by 2035 could be sufficient to manage the ageing predicament over the next 20 years. This would implicate that the number of dependents per 2-69 year-old in 2035 will be at the same level of the current number of dependents per 20-64 years (Barslund and Von Werder, 2016). To be sure, such a favourable extension of working lives is highly unlikely if the push were only to be based on regressive reform in pension \u2018buffers\u2019. Both human capital \u2018stock\u2019 maintenance and flexible labour market \u2018flow\u2019 in mature age will inevitably have to enter the future pension cost-benefit equation to maintain increasing productivity. Lastly, some of the hypothesized returns of elderly care do not have to do with elders so much, as they do with those caring for them: carers are less likely to be employed and are more likely to work less hours if they remain in employment (Bittman, et. al., 2007). Since carers are mainly women, not providing sufficient services for the aging elderly results in women leaving the labour market (possibly for the second time, if they stayed at home to take care of their child) (OECD, 2011). This makes health provision and elderly care one of the fundamental social policies: modern societies will need hospitals where longer care is possible and will need facilities to help families take care of old members without carers having to leave the labour market. Not only is elderly care important for the wellbeing of elderly, it prevents (mainly women) from having a discontinuous relationship with the labour market, which is not conducive to development of human capital \u2018stock\u2019 and thus not conducive to growth. Section 3: Surveying social investment returns The previous section illustrates the value of the \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 taxonomy for a structured analysis of complex policy interactions, but given the narrative nature of the (literature) overview it does struggle with providing clarity because of the multidimensional nature of policy input (in term complementarity) and the equally multifarious nature of outcomes, both good and bad from a social investment perspective. This is not so surprising, as the academic literature often generalizes in an attempt to generalize the social investment impetus by way of exemplifying an argument of decreasing social investment rate of returns throughout the life course (Kvist, 2015a), taking heed from the work of economic Nobel laureate James Heckman. We maintain that this argument focuses too narrowly on human capital \u2018stocks\u2019, at the expense of \u2018buffers\u2019 and \u2018flows\u2019 and only really echoes the conclusion that with social investment it is necessary to \u2018start early\u2019, as the rate of human capital return will ultimately decrease ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 25 with age (Kvist, 2015a). Such a conclusion might hold for education, but falls apart when applied to other social investment functions and policies, such as ALMPs, the returns of which arguably not only peak in adulthood and late adulthood, but are also contingent on the state of the economy and the existence of relevant institutional complementarities. There is of course the other extreme: an abandonment of the effort to construct useful conceptualization in fear of the sheer number of relevant policies, their synergic and sometimes contradictory qualities, and the almost infinite ways they combine in complementary or in-complementary fashion. This extreme is, of course, just as useless for conceptualizing and operationalizing social investment as the declining social investment returns conjecture. A more adequate approach lies somewhere in between: Complex enough to acknowledge and sort out crucial institutional complementarities and contextual conditions, but concise enough to \u2018capture\u2019 the essence of such complementarities for empirical testing. In other words, we need to strike a balance between empirical honesty (having appreciation for the complex nature of reality rather than reducing it through unwarranted simplification) and political relevance (providing evidence that is understandable, actionable, and reconcilable with the empirical outputs of the existing policy paradigm). Building on the \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 taxonomy, this sections aims to provide such a conceptualization. To do so, the first subsection presents an overview of the theorized social investment returns, serving both as a more complete literature review, but also as a definition of scope of what we consider social investment policies. The second subsection presents an overview of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 throughout the life course, helping not only to illuminate the causal chain between social investment and growth and prosperity, but also to further elaborate on the crucial concept of institutional complementarity. The third subsection stretches the social investment argument to its limit by theorizing a social investment life course multiplier that is contingent on good institutional complementarities and illustrates the intergenerational aspect of social investment. Elaborating on the \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 taxonomy in this way provides a conceptualization of social investment that strikes the necessary balance between proof and plausibility and thus can form the basis of a pragmatist methodology for comparative social investment policy analysis. 3.1 Overview of returns To construct a methodology for assessing the returns of social investment, the question of what policies are social investment policies and what are their possible returns is a question that cannot go unanswered. In other words, defining the \u2018scope\u2019 (in this case both in terms policies to evaluate and their possible returns) is a crucial part of any methodology. This report presents this information in a two dimensional table (Table 3.1), where one dimension is that of short, medium, and long term impacts and the other is a thematic distinction between four policy areas: education policies, labour market policies, poverty alleviation policies, and family policies. The short term, medium term and long term distinction is somewhat natural for policy effects, but especially important for social investment: social investment contains many policies whose outcomes are complex, intertwined with other policies and different across time. For example, a policy providing affordable and good daycare has the long term effects of increased cognitive development and productivity of future generations, but when coupled with other policies it also encourages mothers to (re)enter labour market faster and seek full time employment. These two distinct outcomes would be impossible to capture without the short, medium and long-term distinction. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 26 The separation of social investment policies into four policy areas is trickier. The reason for this separation is not so much necessity (as is the case above), as it is practicality: should there be no distinction the table would provide no improvements in terms of analytical clarity. Should there be too many distinctions, the table would be unnecessarily big and would fail to capture the important point of institutional complementarity \u2013 it is often a combination of policies and not just a singular policy that lead to an outcome. The four categories are adopted from Nelson and Stephens (2011) with some clarifications: 1. Education policies: includes the quality of ECEC as well as quality, coverage and accessibility of primary, secondary and tertiary education as well as vocational education and adult training. Life-long learning and quality of training and re-training programs is also included. 2. Labour market policies: includes unemployment benefits (size, structure, length and form), availability and accessibility of training programs and general ALMP provisions. 3. Poverty alleviation policies: includes social assistance, housing benefits and generally policies aimed at equal opportunities and poverty reduction. 4. Family policies: includes mainly the coverage and affordability of ECEC, parental leave policies and other work and family life reconciliation policies. These four categories are chosen simply because they offer a good balance between the need for a meaningful distinction and the need for somewhat broad categories in order to capture some of the main institutional complementarities in the categories themselves. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that the distinction of four thematic areas is somewhat \u2018fuzzy\u2019 and should not be considered an analytically rigorous one. Furthermore, and most importantly, this is a table of theorized social investment outcomes: despite the fact that many effects have been substantiated by empirical evidence, empirical research has only been done in a specific context and does not constitute a \u2018cut and paste\u2019 conclusion that will work in every setting. The table should thus serve as mainly a tool to clarify \u2018where to look\u2019 in terms of returns of social investment, rather than \u2018what to expect\u2019.

In order to do this we return to the important emphasis on a life course approach and the important taxonomy of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019. Table 3.2 thus adopts the distinction between policy functions (\u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019) as the vertical dimension and life course stages (toddler, child, young adult, adult, and older adult) as the horizontal dimension. The five life course stages are consistent with the four major life course transitions reviewed in section 3. Reading the contents of the table by columns starting with \u2018toddler\u2019 and ending with \u2018older adult\u2019 also clarifies the complex and multi-faceted causal mechanism through which we believe social investment policies can lead to increased labour market productivity and inclusive growth.

Pre-school to school) Apprenticeships, good secondary and tertiary education and vocational education and training eases the education-labour market transition, especially when well-coordinated at multiple levels of government ALMP promotes fast return to labour market and unemployment benefits reduce job and skill mismatch. Training is available to smoothen the transition. Family policy allows to reconcile having children with full- time employment Further training and development allows for better employment prospects, higher exit age and consequently a better pension. Buffer Living in a stable household with a low risk of poverty allows for proper nutrition and emotional development Living in a stable household with a low risk of poverty fosters smaller school drop-out rates Solid minimum wage enables one to be a working student sustainably. Transition from a family household to separate household is eased by eg. housing benefits Minimum wage, unemployment benefits and earned income tax credit form a robust safety net. Family benefits or increasing normal benefits based on number of children can positively affect fertility rate Either minimum wage and unemployment buffers, or a sustainable pension Another important function of this table is the way in which it illustrates complementarities. The concept of \u2018institutional complementarities\u2019 has been introduced earlier but only in a very rudimentary fashion \u2013 almost as a consequence of the functional overlap between \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019. In light of the evidence presented in section 2, it is possible to now argue for a much more nuanced understanding of causality which forms the crux of social investment policy analysis. We now expand the critical notion of \u2018institutional complementarity\u2019 into two distinct synergy effects: life course synergies and policy synergies. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 31 3.2.1 Life course synergies The first complementarity we can identify is that of life course synergies, a complementarity traceable in the individual policy functions of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 in a temporal fashion across life course stages (from left to right on the horizontal dimension of the table). This temporal policy complementarity results from the fact that a policy that positively improves life chances of an individual in a particular stage of the life course can have an escalating \u2018knock on\u2019 effect later in life. For example, looking at \u2018buffers\u2019, if child poverty is adequately addressed, the affected cohort of youngsters is less likely to rely on poverty buffers in adulthood, as they are more likely to have upgraded their human capital and thus can find employment. Looking at \u2018stocks\u2019, investing in good quality pre-schools improves the cognitive development of children at an early stage, which enables them to learn better and achieve better results in primary, secondary and even tertiary education (Cuhne & Heckman, 2007). Essentially \u2018learning how to learn\u2019 improves your ability to internalize new skills and knowledge, resulting in early education not just providing better \u2018stocks\u2019 in and of itself, but also amplifying the effect of later training or education interventions. In terms of \u2018flow\u2019, receiving assistance with job search and placement via ALMP policies can cause an individual to require less of such assistance (or benefit from such assistance more) during the next period of unemployment: writing a CV, using appropriate tools to search for a job, or undergoing a job interview are all skills and experiences that individuals can get better at or accustomed to, especially if these skills prove to be useful. Life course synergies should of course not be taken for granted, as inappropriately managed transitions can dampen the \u2018knock on\u2019 effects of early interventions. High quality early childhood education and care, which is not leveraged up in follow-up primary and secondary education policies, because of early selection or class-biased school segmentation, frustrate long-term social investment returns. Transitions in education, such as from preschool to primary school, or from secondary school to a university, can cause people to lose some of their skills (if secondary schools teach you skills useless for universities, etc.), or even drop out of education altogether. Dropping out of education or training is a crucial challenge to social investment: given the strong emphasis on life course perspective, focused primarily on precarious transitions, one will have to accept the harsh reality that individual circumstances can be extremely specific and people will still \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d, even if the relevant policy mix is well designed. These people will need (preferably individualized) assistance in returning to education or the labour market, in order to prevent skill erosion and other scarring effects that can occur in critical life course transitions, and foster further skill development and better productivity instead. In other words, it is not enough to construct the ideal educational system with escalating returns leading to highly relevant skills and exceptional productivity - you also need to help people who, due to a bad transition, end up excluded from the system. 3.2.2 Policy synergies The second synergy we can identify is the mutually reinforcing nature of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019, which can be traced across these three policy functions for different age groups (across the vertical dimension of the table). This policy synergy effect has been elaborated on in quite some detail in prior sections and essentially means that in a given policy mix there are policies that are aligned towards a unified goal and together cover all three policy functions, which maximizes the returns of said policy mix. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 32 This synergy essentially has to do with the fact that preventing social problems before they fester often requires more than one particular policy intervention. Once again, childcare and work-life balance policies are the pivotal example of such policy synergies; Quality childcare in conjunction with paid parental leave and related family services allows parents, especially mothers, to reconcile career, family life and fertility aspirations. Underdeveloped or expensive childcare in the absence of parental and care leave policies, incur low fertility, higher child poverty (especially in single parent households), lower aggregate (female) labour supply and a more taxing ageing burden (Esping-Andersen, 2009). However, if all \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019 and \u2018buffers\u2019 are directed towards achieving activating and high-quality ECEC and family policy, two birds \u2013 better social and cognitive development of children and higher levels of female employment \u2013 are killed by one stone. However, the devil is in the details: using the case of parental leave as an example, short periods of particularly well-paid leave have been shown to be beneficial to female employment, but longer leave periods seemingly compromise post-leave career prospects (Del Boca and Wetzels, 2008). The policy goal is not unconditional generosity, but rather careful balance and evaluation of outcomes. Consolidating the childcare example, a successful policy mix must align the \u2018stocks\u2019 by ensuring high quality and the subsequent cognitive development of attending children, the \u2018flows\u2019 by providing ALMP policies for mothers in conjunction with appropriately long and gender-fair parental leave and \u2018buffers\u2019 by subsidizing ECEC directly or indirectly by subsidizing households with children of certain age. Policy synergy essentially acknowledges the complex reality of life course transitions \u2013 life course transitions are not a \u201cone-step\u201d process and individuals in transitions base their decisions on multiple factors, all of which have the potential to hamper this transition and thus dampen the overall policy returns. Same as with life course synergies, policy synergies cannot be taken for granted. In order to really benefit from them, an administration requires substantial institutional capacities in areas of policy design, decomposing administrative silos, inter-sectoral coordination, administrative devolution, decentralized management, policy learning and feedback monitoring of positive and negative spill-overs, tolerant of variety and diversity in devolved and decentralized management of social programs (De B\u00farca, et. al. 2014). In other words, the different parts that constitute the final policy mix need to be well designed with policy complementarity in mind, and the policy needs to be well implemented, often requiring a great deal of cooperation between institutions on different levels of government. This synergy also needs to take the life course transitional focus of social investment seriously: people can still fall \u201cthrough the cracks\u201d and helping them return to pursuit of higher productivity is best achieved by combining \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019. Perfect examples of this are the already mentioned VET apprenticeship programs to contain early school leaving in the Netherlands: in the case of voluntary early school dropouts, individuals are placed in apprenticeships to allow them to develop their skills (improving \u2018stocks\u2019). However, these apprenticeship programs are designed to demonstrate the benefits of further education, which motivates those who dropped out of school to enter it once again, which is a readily available option (\u2018flow\u2019) and develop their own human capital further (\u2018stock\u2019). This intervention is not aimed at strictly removing people from what is traditionally known as lower productivity sectors, but it aims to provide them more context for their career choices and facilitate either cross-sectorial jumps, or better productivity and innovation in lower productivity sectors. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 33 3.3 Life course multiplier It is now possible to stretch the complementarity argument to its limits by conjecturing a \u201clife course multiplier\u201d of productivity and growth not only during the life course of an individual but also across generations (figure 3.1). Figure 3.1: Social Investment life course multiplier This is clearly an audacious proposal and it is crucial to acknowledge that for such a life course multiplier to materialize all three types of institutional complementarities need to be aligned well: individuals need the maximum possible benefit from policies and they need the policies to be continuous throughout their life course to keep amplifying the returns. However, under a policy mix where all three complementarities function well, and in light of the review of the theorized social investment returns, there is evidence for every single step of the life course multiplier. Furthermore, the evidence for the inter- generational nature of such a multiplier is actually somewhat simple and uncontroversial. Firstly, should productivity of a cohort increase and lead to growth through better human capital and higher employment, the state will collect more revenue which would allow it to invest even more into social investment policies for the next generations. Some of the positive effects of social investment also transition across generations naturally. For example, in terms of \u2018buffers\u2019, if child poverty is tackled, the same cohort will suffer from poverty less in adulthood, and thus their children will not be born into a poor household and will face less risk of poverty. The same goes for other functions such as \u2018stock\u2019, due to the fact that highly educated and skilled parents are not only more likely to prioritize education and skill formation with their children, but also have more relevant knowledge and skills to teach their children. Early childhood education and care Educational attainment Employment Dual earnership, worklife balance (and fertility) Exit age Poverty protection and prevention ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 34 Section 4: Towards a Methodology In spite of the expanding evidence base of social investment returns, putting commonly understood trade-offs and \u2018trilemmas\u2019 in a different light, the relevant empirical observations and theoretical conjectures have yet to be methodologically integrated in labour-market and social-policy evaluations. Evaluation studies rarely focus on interdependencies between policies and how they interact under different institutional and economic conditions and for a reason: there are many methodological caveats associated with such an approach. The mainstream cost benefit analysis generally focuses on isolated single-policy interventions, ranging from active labour policies to early childhood education and care, but avoiding the cumulative life course synergies and positive policy synergies between \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019 and \u2018buffers\u2019. In particular, existing analyses tend to ignore precisely the temporal synergies and cross-sectorial trade-offs, interdependencies, and interactions that are so central to the effects of social investment policies. We contend that this is a major shortcoming, with important political weight: where social policy budget allocation is solely informed by isolated trials, longer and interrelated solutions and life course multiplier dynamics will remain under-examined in policy analysis, and as a consequence, under-developed in policy practice, due to an ingrained reluctance to query alternative insights (Samson et al., 2015). To redress these shortcomings in assessment of social investment, novel methodological tools are warranted. This section lays out those tools, by developing what we can call a synergy-focused methodology. This requires one to navigate the methodological landscape of various \u201cbroad\u201d (focused on policy mixes) and \u201cnarrow\u201d (focused on isolated policies) conceptions of social investment in various \u201crelevant\u201d or \u201crigorous\u201d methods. This section first goes through the possible methodological approaches and outlines their shortcomings. Then, it presents the four main methodological caveats that need to be conquered. Finally and most importantly, the section concludes (in section 4.3) by proposing our synergy-focused methodology, a layered combination of methods that provides different balances of tensions between rigor and relevance in estimating social investment\u2019s returns. 4.1 The methodological landscape To really argue for a specific methodological approach one must be aware of the alternatives: since methodologies are never perfect, arguing for one necessarily involves a judgment on why it is better than others. This section provides the necessary overview of the possible methodological approaches that one might consider for assessing the returns of social investment as well as their inherent problems. All social policies invoke economic and social returns and from the very start the issue of appropriate focus is unclear: should we give more credence to how social investment impacts inequality, or how social investment spurs GDP growth? Or are both equally important? The literature on single social investment interventions provides plenty of contributions linking inequality and growth, but they do so in variegated ways. A way to proceed could be to first highlight and assess social investment correlations with employment (or poverty, inequality, or other \u201cintermediate\u201d objectives), and then use the literature in support of further links with GDP growth (or to any other interesting output which may be considered a final objective). A more straightforward estimating process would be if we were to exploit the term investment as it works in economics. There would be plenty of tools to evaluate whether or not it is worth pursuing an investment, ranging from net present value to the rate of ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 35 returns. However, when it comes to social policy, there are other returns (outside of economic ones) that are of significance. It is therefore necessary to weigh and balance all kinds of returns be they social, political, or other, which in itself is a very challenging (and subjective) task. Furthermore, with social policy it is difficult to associate a particular investment with a specific output given that certain results may be obtained through a combination of various determinants, not just social policy itself, or not just one social policy (Begg, 2016). Outside of adopting an \u201ceconomic\u201d notion of investment, another common approach to assess causality in the returns of public policies is that of counterfactuals. If we take Europe as a geographical area where we want to test the returns, there should be countries that had no sign of social investment reform and countries that embraced such a reform in a holistic way in order for this methodology to work fully. Even if such a tremendously unlikely condition would be met, it would still not be sufficient: these groups of countries would have to have shared many key features for a number of years in order to allow for a meaningful comparison of their behavior. Given the impossibility of constructing country groups satisfying either of these two conditions within the EU or Europe in general, this methodology is rendered unfeasible. Another challenge in modeling the returns of a policy mix is to find a good way of measuring inputs and outputs. Is spending an adequate indicator of input? And what is the output we want to consider relevant? How do we prove that spending in social investment actually spurs growth in a sense of a GDP increase? Strictly monetizing social investment and its returns is a rather limited way to go about measuring socioeconomic impact. Let us first try to set an outcome indicator that has wide support: growth is good for economies, for societies and is the ultimate goal of any government. The key determinant of long run economic growth is productivity growth: human capital is the main resource a country has and can exploit to pursue this goal and social investment enters the picture precisely by improving human capital, increasing the chance of people to be as productive as the knowledge-economy requires them to be. To isolate the impact of social investment on growth, we would face the same limitations many scholars face in other branches of research when investigating the determinants of growth. Three different types of obstacles normally interfere: first it is the simultaneity problem that makes causality relationship hard to detect. All variables that are used to explain growth in the regression are usually jointly determined. Multi-collinearity is the second obstacle and it exists due to all variables that enter the picture being correlated with each other. In cross-country regressions the assumption in order to produce significant estimators is that all observations are independent, but it is very likely that residuals (those variables that end up being in the error term because they are unobserved or not included in the regression) are instead correlated. This decreases the precision of coefficient estimates, as data then contain less information than the standard errors report and the statistical significance is overstated. Third obstacle is represented by the degrees of freedom, since the number of variables to estimate is usually greater than the number of observations (i.e. countries). Plus, results are contingent upon what variables have been excluded. After determining the relevant input and output variables, the question of appropriate measurement of those variables needs to be addressed. As is well documented by Verbist (forthcoming), scholars have measured the impact of social investment based merely on cash benefit, not considering services (the \u201cin kind\u201d type of welfare state), which make up a huge part of social investment. Leaving those elements out does not allow for precise estimates of impact. Also, the division between cash benefit and in kind social spending, according to which all data available on the topic is organized, does not allow ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 36 for proper measurement of what social investment actually is. Verbist herself contributes to previous work by adding the service dimension, but a new dataset that isolates specific elements conveyed in the social investment definition is still needed. Vanderbrouke and Vleminckx provide ample input, as reported by De Deken (2014; forthcoming): they divide social spending into new and old, leaving behind the old separation between cash and services and putting forward a model where old welfare state faces some key features of social investment, with correcting factors (share of people actually entitled to that benefit). Moving on to actual research designs, Cross-country growth regressions focusing on growth via spending have helped detect which elements are conducive to growth and which are not, but with such evidence there is a clear lack of rigor: rigorous evidence follows the strictest scientific standards for establishing causality and relationships between variables in general, but it needs to control for so many variables that it is often rendered irrelevant when applied to a different context. However, cross-country growth regressions are applicable to such a wide range of contexts that they are quite likely to be relevant for designing a policy intervention. The relevance limitations of more sophisticated analyses thus make correlations an interesting fact: when strong, it proves something with respect to those theories or policies that do not show any correlation at all. In other words, \u201cBasic theory, shrewd observation, and common sense are surely more reliable guides for policy\u201d (Mankiw, 1995). This leads to the unfortunate conclusion that, at least in terms of evidence to substantiate policy interventions, there is a tradeoff between rigor and relevance. The only option then is to relax one of the two. If rigor in the scientific analysis has to hold, the analysis would have to break the European context down into either particular groups of people, particular countries or particular policies. Given that trying to link social investment directly with growth does not lead much further than few strong correlations (thereby reducing rigor), it might be wise to also assess the impact of social investment by exploring the linkages between single social investment policies and all possible favorable outcomes one might wish for an economy (thus giving up on the comprehensive relevance, but maintaining stronger scientific rigor). The realization that both rigorous and relevant pieces of evidence have a valuable insight to contribute is crucial for the methodology we propose in section 4.3. 4.2 The four major caveats Based on evidence presented in section 2 of this report and the overview of methodological diversity, we now explicate what we believe to be the four most crucial methodological caveats for measuring social investment returns and how these lead to an inevitable trade-off between rigor and relevance. Addressing these caveats and reconciling rigor and relevance will be the two main goals of our methodology proposed in subsection 4.3. 4.2.1 Conceptual \u2018fuzziness\u2019 and complexity The first caveat has to do with the \u2018fuzziness\u2019 and complexity of the very concept of \u2018social investment\u2019. After going through the elaborations provided by sections 1, 2, and 3 of this report, the concept is not unclear, but it remains fuzzy in the sense that there is no way to separate existing policies and policy mixes to be either social investment or not social investment. Some policies are clearly very much focused on developing \u2018stocks\u2019 and \u2018flows\u2019 via activation of certain groups, making them a clear example of a social investment policy, but for most policies this is not the case. Even the most \u2018compensatory\u2019 policies only providing cash transfers have an indirect social investment ",

Conceptually this is not an issue, as it merely reflects the complex nature of social reality, but for designing a methodology it needs to be kept in mind that the examples of policies we use as \u2018social investment policies\u2019 are labeled as such only based on an academic consensus and not a rigorous sorting criterion. Even should we accept the reductive notion of certain expenditure items being \u2018social investment\u2019 and others not, there are different variations of social investment. For example, consider figure 4.1, which provides a heuristic illustration of how gauging \u2018social investment\u2019 in itself is no straight-forward task. The figure shows a radar diagram based on ten dimensions of social policy, the right-hand of the radar (right of the dotted line) are five dimensions comporting with frequently-used conceptions of social investment effort, and the left-hand five measures of more compensatory interventions, all within the broad categories of labour market policies, old-age assistance, and family assistance. The unemployment-focused measures are measured as a share of GDP, weighted by the country\u2019s unemployment rate. The other dimensions are measured as share of GDP. Spending data are drawn from the OECD Social Expenditures Database (SOCX) (OECD 2015c), and the employment protection data come from (OECD 2015d). Figure 4.1: Selected indicators of social-investment and compensatory policy (2009) Sources: OECD 2015c, 2015d. If nothing else, this figure shows that conceptualizing policy mixes as \u201csocial investment\u201d is critically contingent on one\u2019s conception or clustering of policies thought to manifest social investment. The full ordering across Denmark, Germany, UK, and Italy is different for all different conceptions of the social investment provisions \u2013 for instance, whether one focuses on a part or combination of the parental leave, the daycare services or the ALMP effort. Indeed, even within the category of ALMP, we see a different country ordering of effort across the training and job-search/relocation components of ALMP. Divining which countries are doing more with respect to social investment is a complicated matter that requires varying kinds of clustering and un-clustering of welfare state policies. If mapping social investment policy mixes pose empirical challenges, then a greater challenge confronts any attempt to gauge empirical estimation of the causal implications -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 Parental leave Daycare ALMP Training Job/empl.search Empl. protect.

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 38 of such policy mixes. The multi-component clustering of social investment components puts real limits on what kinds of research designs are meaningful: who cares if some very specific policy intervention, say a particular training provision, is more or less effective as shown by some experimental design, if what matters is the cluster or combination of the that policy plus other training provisions? And yet data may not allow experimental or even quasi-experimental analysis of the broader clustering of policy, such as \u2018ALMP effort\u2019 generally. This is a concrete expression of the rigor-relevance tension with which our project contends. 4.2.2 Multiplicity of returns The second major caveat is that many social investment policies enter the picture in various ways. For example, childcare is undoubtedly important since it enhances a country\u2019s \u2018stock\u2019 through enhanced cognitive development allowing for better skill acquisition, but it also has a more immediate impact in the short run, by allowing more women to enter the labour market. These returns also have more indirect returns, as children who attend childcare are less dependent on welfare \u2018buffers\u2019 later in life (due to better development and growing up in a more financially secure household resulting from mother\u2019s employment). As this example illustrates once more, the outcomes relevant to a broad conception of \u2018returns\u2019 are themselves multiple: multiple with respect to aspects of wellbeing (financial security, cognitive development, etc.); and multiple with respect to the particular groups whose wellbeing is gauged (mothers, children, etc.). These effects are not necessarily positive, as social-investment interventions can benefit the relatively privileged at the cost for those who are less privileged already (Cantillon, 2011). Such is the most obvious face of the putative \u2018Matthew effects\u2019 of social investment \u2013 effects that are no less important to our broad conception of \u2018returns\u2019 than income or education. Indeed, a particular social investment intervention may play out well for the income, employment and life chances of some groups while undermining those for others \u2013 along income, sector, class, education, gender or ethnic lines. Attention to social-investment\u2019s implications for poverty and income distributions may be as important as employment and growth. Reconciling all these outcomes into a singular conclusion about social investment as a whole is thus possible only imperfectly. 4.2.3 Complementarities and clashes The third caveat has to do with how social investment policies may interact, be complementary or clash, in their implications for wellbeing. The highlighting of putative institutional or policy complementarities by many scholars is not just an expression of the importance of bundles rather than individual components of policy reform (a challenge emphasized above); it also asserts that one component of social investment\u2019s implications may depend on, or causally interact with, the existence of another component. A commonly cited example is that the implementation of ALMPs that promote or reward employment by parents may bear fruit for employment or income only where suitable childcare services are in place that allow the newly working parents to combine work with family. This interaction also works inversely, illustrated by the Belgian case, where childcare provision are of high quality, but their effect on parental employment is significantly dampened by the absence of ALMPs targeted at parents (Van Lanker, 2013). Similarly, concerns about possible \u2018Matthew effects\u2019 are not only concerns that certain policy interventions positively impact the wellbeing of certain groups at the cost of a ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 39 negative impact in terms of wellbeing for other, more vulnerable, groups; it is also concern that social investment reforms may hollow out more compensatory or redistributive features of welfare states and/or undermine the effectiveness of the latter features. In other words, social investment policies do not only interact amongst themselves in meaningful ways, they interact with \u201ctraditional\u201d policy provisions as well. Addressing this caveat appropriately will be a central focus of our methodology, as what we term \u201csocial investment policy analysis\u201d is concerned mainly with the impact of these complementarities or clashes (\u2018in-complementarities\u2019) on policy outputs, going far beyond simply bundling policies and evaluating them as mix (first caveat) to studying the actual interactions between individual policies and the way these synergies can be used to maximize the desired effects of a policy mix, as well as minimize the undesirable ones (such as Matthew effects). 4.2.4 Temporal dimension of returns The last caveat is closely related to the emphasis social investment places on a life course approach and the need to \u201cstart early\u201d with human capital development, as earlier interventions not only have the highest returns, but also facilitate better returns of following interventions. However, measuring long term returns, especially when it comes to early childhood education, is an analytically difficult task: despite there being a consensus that ECEC does promote human capital development, human capital development is influenced by so many other variables, making the causal chain from ECEC to better productivity so long and complex that testing the direct effect is impossible, not to mention undesirable. In other words, rigor can be very difficult to maintain for certain social investment returns given their temporal dimension. This caveat also has a more practical side, as a lot of these policies have been implemented only recently, resulting in insufficient data to conduct such long-term evaluations. This is true especially for early childhood care where, in the European context, data started being gathered as of 2005, meaning that long-term impact estimation of effects on \u2018stocks\u2019 will only be possible from 2025 on, when the relevant cohorts will be entering the labour market. Preliminary estimations can be conducted based on different measures of cognitive development, but even in such a case the transfer of cognitive development into better labour market performance (in terms of wages, employment, productivity and ultimately growth) would remain an empirical leap of faith. 4.2.5 Rigor and relevance trade-off The thicket of methodological alternatives and caveats summarized in this section should remind us of the briefly mentioned methodological dilemma with respect to rigor and relevance: relevance in the sense of identifying aspects of social investment and its implications that apply to what policymakers and publics want to know about social policy reform; and rigor in the sense of measuring social investment and its implications in a way that support social-scientifically solid descriptive and causal inferences about social investment and its returns. The tension is this: the more one does to get inferential control on the empirics \u2013 for instance, the more one focuses on data that allow valid inferences about how a discrete policy treatment affects a given aspect of economic wellbeing \u2013 the more one is forced to ignore the multiplicity of social investment, the multiplicity of implications, and the complexity of interactions connecting them. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 40 Such rigor-relevance trade off could be reason for despair or, worse, relativism. The despairing response is this: some might believe that the empirical challenge is simply overwhelming should one want to meet the highest standards of descriptive and causal inference about social investment and its implications. The practical limits of existing data availability only exacerbate the burden. We lack, for instance, enough detailed information on policy take-up by individuals for the range of policy interventions associated with social investment, and certainly not for the multiple countries and groupings on which we must focus \u2013 and certainly not for the longer time periods, spanning decades or even generations, for individuals or countries whose wellbeing or suffering is to be understood. To advance actual politically relevant debate on social investment, the despairing response to such a burden is to either give up or limit discussion to only the narrowest of slices of social investment. Other scholars or policymakers might respond to the same empirical challenges and dilemma with the opposite response \u2013 a methodological relativism that sees any person\u2019s anecdote or scatterplot as no better or worse than any another\u2019s focused quasi-experimental regression analysis on individual panel data. Such a response throws in the empirical towel and leaves the social investment debate to conceptual speculation. A better approach \u2013 what subsequent sections summarize and illustrate \u2013 is a layered and practical pluralism of measures that balance and make explicit the rigor-relevance trade- offs. We call this a synergy-focused methodology. 4.3 ASIS Methodology Our synergy-focused ASIS methodology has three key features. First, our proposed methodology combines three levels of analysis of how a given aspect or combination of policies associated with social investment affect a given outcome relevant to wellbeing: quantitative micro-level analysis of individual-country-years; quantitative macro-level analysis of country-years; and qualitative-institutional analysis of national and sub- national experiences. Each of these levels or components of analysis necessarily constitutes a highly imperfect balance on the spectrum of rigor and relevance to identifying social investment\u2019s returns, but each provides distinct information and leverage to gauge social investment\u2019s implications and returns, taking account of the complexities and institutional complementarities and conflicts that we anticipate to manifest in social investment\u2019s implications for wellbeing. Together, carrying-through the three levels of analysis on a particular aspect of policy and of wellbeing provide a basis for a triangulation of evidence to better measure the promise and pitfalls of social investment. Second, our synergy-focused ASIS methodology calls for exploring or modeling three ways in which a given aspect of social investment can be expected to influence a given aspect of economic wellbeing. A given aspect of social investment might directly, on its own, influence wellbeing. It might also, however, alter the effects of other, non-social- investment, aspects of social policy on wellbeing. And it might, thirdly, have implications for wellbeing that are moderated or altered by other aspects of social-investment. Herein lies explicit attention to possible synergies in how social policies play out for wellbeing \u2013 modeled in different ways in all three levels of analysis (quantitative-micro, quantitative-macro, qualitative institutional). Third, our ASIS methodology entails analysis of how the results of the three levels of analysis fit together in triangulation of evidence on how social investment influences wellbeing. This constitutes more than a simple summing-up of the three levels of analysis alongside one another, but also a contemplation of how and why the results feed into one another, and might reinforce or contradict one another. This is crucial to ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 41 making use of the different kinds of evidence, the different solutions to the rigor- relevance trade-off. Through such triangulation we can best gauge social investment\u2019s returns or lack of returns for wellbeing. This Section 4.3 shall articulate in fuller detail each of these three components. But before doing so, we should emphasize two preliminary features of our ASIS methodology. One involves the operationalization of \u2018social investment\u2019 itself. The ASIS methodology should be applied to the analysis of a given outcome of economic and social wellbeing (e.g. employment, income/poverty, labour productivity, growth), and to the role of various components and combinations of policy interventions deemed relevant as \u2018social investment\u2019 policy provisions or reforms \u2013 such as Active Labour Market Policy (ALMP) provisions \u2013 in shaping that outcome. Identifying the aspects and combinations of wellbeing and of \u2018social investment\u2019 to be analysed is, as the discussion above should have made clear, no mean trick. Doing so is obviously important to the value of our proposed methodology and requires analysis that is itself complex. Such analysis can be subject to exploratory analysis, such as principal component analysis or latent-class analysis. But it can and should also build on existing deductions of the policies associated with social investment, particularly those relevant to the stocks and flow functions of policy, as distinct from (in addition to) buffer functions of policy. From the latter standard, there are already well-known features of social investment policy approaches, including ALMP, early-childhood and other conditions chronicled in Section 3 above (see also Bonoli 2013). For our methodology, all of these policy provisions, including their combinations and sub-components in separate analysis, should be analysed to explore their implications for wellbeing, using the three-aspect ASIS methodology. In the ASIS methodology, finally, we recommend relying primarily on widely-used, recurring and regularly-updated Eurostat datasets on individual-level and country-level social policy and economic experience. The motivation for this empirical bias is two-fold: that we want to ensure quality and coverage of social policies and economic experiences in the full sample of European Union member states; and that we want to design a measurement methodology that can be replicated and extended in future months and years using publicly available and enduring European data sources. For our measures of social investment and other social policy indicators, this focus on Eurostat data means focusing on a range of datasets, including the Eurostat Labour Market Policy, Social Protection database (Eurostat-ESSPROS 2016). For our measures in the micro-level analysis of individuals\u2019 economic experiences and wellbeing, we rely principally on the EU-Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) and on the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). The former is important particularly for micro-analysis of income and poverty, and of true panel data of individual experience (with repeated surveys of a given respondent). The latter is particularly important for employment measures, and is valuable as a non-panel time series cross-section (TSCS) dataset covering more years. A reliance on such data does pose some drawbacks. We know that the Eurostat suite of data on policy and individual economic experience does not always provide the best coverage in time and socioeconomic and policy area (e.g. childcare spending and services; non-spending measures of generosity). We also know that the recurring Eurostat data series data do not include measures of detailed participation or take-up of a range of policy interventions, constraining our estimation possibilities and preventing us from developing a scalable and reproducible methodology with more rigorous control on selection-into-treatment, endogeneity and other inferential threats. For all these reasons, the methodology we propose makes use of other datasets to supplement the Eurostat information, most obviously other recurring and regularly updated OECD data with good coverage of European experiences over longer periods of time. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 42 The rest of this Section 4.3 lays out in more detail the components of our ASIS methodology. This starts with exposition of the three levels of analysis. It then turns to the three pathways by which social investment is expected to influence wellbeing. And it ends with clarification of how the three levels of analysis can be combined or triangulated to clarify social investment promises, pitfalls and returns. 4.3.1 Three levels of analysis: Quantitative-Micro, Quantitative-Macro, and Qualitative- Institutional Working within the limits of such data, our methodology explores how and whether a given face of social investment affects a given face of economic wellbeing, with the same possible relationship considered and compared across the three levels of analysis . The Quantitative-Micro level of analysis focuses on how a given social investment initiative, usually a national-level or regional-level institutional or policy development, plays out at the lowest meaningful level of aggregation \u2013 in the economic experiences of individuals. The micro-data like the EU-SILC and EU-LFS allow one to look at such individual experiences over a significant number of years and in principle all European Union countries \u2013 and in the case of EU-SILC, in a true-panel of individuals across countries and years. Such micro-level of data affords a level of analysis where one can see how a given policy development plays out for individuals with respect to the ostensible stock, flow, and buffer functions \u2013 for instance skill acquisition (most relevant to construing stocks), employment (most relevant to construing flows) and poverty (relevant to buffers). This is intrinsically worthwhile, but mainly because it allows one to explore how social investment provisions play out across particular individual-level characteristics \u2013 including age, gender, education, ethnicity, household situation, and economic status (e.g. part-time work, unemployed, student, etc.). It also allows one to draw meaningful causal inferences about how social investment developments affect wellbeing, by providing degrees of freedom and substantive information (at the individual level) to confront inferential threats like endogeneity, selection-into-treatment, and omitted variable bias. Although the existing suite of Eurostat micro-data may not track actual participation and take-up of particular policy interventions that provide even more leverage to address such threats, the panel and TSCS micro data is rich enough to allow a wide array of econometric techniques, including quasi-experimental matching and other techniques \u2013 and has the advantage of covering enough countries and time to be more relevant than boutique datasets covering a very circumscribed and contained policy experiment in place and time. The second, Quantitative-Macro, level of analysis focuses on how the same given instance of social investment affects the same aspect of wellbeing, but focuses on the aggregate country-year rather than individual. This level is, of course, familiar to anyone analysing and debating social policy reform, and our methodology would make use of the knowledge base and extensive data that such familiarity affords. The macro-level data can involve an aggregation of the micro-level data, as indeed is already furnished by existing Eurostat treatments of EU-LFS and EU-SILC for measures of general and group- specific employment, unemployment, income, inequality, poverty, and other features of economic status. But in plenty of cases, the aggregate level can also consider more downstream developments like labour productivity or growth that are not \u2018mere\u2019 aggregations of the publicly available micro data. The value-added of the macro-level analysis resides partly in analysing such more downstream developments, but also in that it lays bare the level of analysis on which most policymakers and publics consider the experiential reference and benchmarking. More importantly as an issue of methodology, the macro-level provides more coverage in terms of countries and years to allow analysis that can control for or consider many more macro-level developments \u2013 ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 43 like debt, inflation, quality of democracy, etc. \u2013 than the micro-level affords. Quantitative-macro analysis worth presenting and considering can involve many uses of country-year information \u2013 from snapshots using descriptive statistics, radar-diagrams, scatter-plots, and various techniques for gauging over time developments; to a wide array of inferential-quantitative econometric analysis that makes full use of the TSCS structure of the Eurostat, OECD and other data sources. The third level of analysis we shall call Qualitative-Institutional analysis. Such analysis focuses on any available qualitative and quantitative information of a country or region\u2019s experiences with social investment reforms and their downstream dynamics. This information can be anecdotal in nature, but it more likely combines the micro- and macro-level data discussed above, but also information that cannot be quantified or in practice has not been quantified. Most importantly, the qualitative-institutional analysis entails historical narrative and detailed process-tracing of national experiences that considers the development and developments with explicit attention to the design and functioning of policies and institutions in a given country\u2019s history. Such narrative process-tracing certainly provides clarity and colour to the Spartan statistics furnished by the quantitative-micro and quantitative-macro takes on a given social policy reform and subsequent feature of economic wellbeing or suffering. But the analytical value is more than heuristic and didactic: qualitative-institutional analysis allows a fuller portrait of how social investment experiments play out through a detailed sequence of a country\u2019s economic and social experience. 4.3.2 Three synergy-focused pathways: Identifying links between social investment and wellbeing In carrying-out each of these quantitative-micro, quantitative-macro and qualitative- institutional analyses, our ASIS methodology focuses on how a given aspect of social investment may affect a given aspect of wellbeing not only through direct causal links but also through indirect and more conditional links involving other policies and institutions. For any given level of analysis of a given social investment provision and possible aspect of wellbeing, our methodology is to identify and measure three pathways to how social-investment effort influences individual, group and aggregate economic outcomes. First, we should explore whether and how each measure of social investment has a direct or indirect influence on an individual\u2019s, groups\u2019 or country\u2019s economic wellbeing (e.g. employment, productivity, poverty) \u2013 controlling for and hence leaving out of the picture the role of institutional or policy setting. This can involve a range of estimation techniques with more or less leverage to control for these and other possible perturbing factors and sources of endogeneity or omitted-variable bias. And it can involve both direct causal pathways and indirect ones, conditional on an individual, group or country\u2019s economic conditions. For instance, social investment provisions like ALMP can be expected to increase employment directly, but perhaps also indirectly, by diminishing the extent to which low education or other economic risks lower employment chances. And a given social investment initiative might influence poverty directly or indirectly, by diminishing or exacerbating how economic risks like experiencing unemployment increases an individual\u2019s or country\u2019s poverty. Figure 4.2 below captures graphically this combination of direct and indirect effects. In our methodology, we accept that analysis might reveal social investment policy measures to have either a positive, negative or null effect on micro- or macro-wellbeing in the direct correlation, and that it might have a positive, negative, or null effect in moderating the generally relationship between ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 44 economic status (e.g. low-education, unemployment or part-time work) and other measures of wellbeing. Figure 4.2: Direct and indirect effects of Social Investment for Economic wellbeing Second, we anticipate that social investment affects economic wellbeing in ways where policies and institutional conditions associated with social investment (e.g. Early- childhood education and ALMP) might interact with the broader, non-social investment features of a countries economic regulations and policies. An important example of this is related to concerns about possible \u2018Matthew effects\u2019, where a given social investment provision like ALMP effort might indirectly hurt wellbeing by undermining the efficacy of broader social policy transfers and safety nets. These latter, broader conditions, have generally been found in a European context to consistently serve a strong buffer function \u2013 for instance by lowering the incidence and depth of poverty. And it may be that social investments like ALMP, whatever its direct buffer or anti-buffer effects may be for poverty, might alter (either strengthen or undermine) the extent to which broad social transfers reduce poverty. Figure 4.3 captures such interaction, what may turn out to be an example of institutional complementarity (should social investment bolster the buffer functions of broader safety nets) or conflict (should social investment negatively affect such buffer function). The figure focuses on interaction with safety nets in influencing poverty or inequality, but one might need to consider interactions involving other non- social-investment policies and economic outcomes. Our methodology is to explicitly consider such interaction in any given quantitative-micro, quantitative-macro or qualitative-institutional analysis of returns to social investment. All possible interactions, of course, need not be considered; only those that theory and intuition suggest are likely to be important to debate on the promise and pitfalls of social investment. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 45 Figure 4.3: Example of interaction between social-investment and non-social-investment policies Third and finally, study at all levels of analysis should explicitly explore whether and how different aspects or faces of social investment interact with one another in affecting economic wellbeing. This is another area of possible institutional complementarities or conflicts in the effects of social investment, but one where the interaction involves how the effects of one aspect of social investment might be conditional upon the role of another. An example of such is the possible interaction between ALMP and early- childhood education and care \u2013 as captured graphically in Figure 4.4. ALMP might generally be expected to spur employment at the individual-, group- or national levels. But that positive effect can be expected to be weak in settings where those trained to (re-)enter the labour market are hampered from doing so because of limited childcare or early-childhood assistance make it hard to combine work with family. If so, then we expect that ALMP will have positive implications for employment, conditional upon more generous early-childhood education and care. Again, this is but one example of such intra-social-investment interaction. But once again, our methodology entails looking for important possibilities of such in all quantitative-micro, quantitative-macro and qualitative-institutional analysis of how social-investment provisions affect wellbeing via stocks, flows and buffer functions. Figure 4.4: Example of interaction between different social-investment policies ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 46 4.3.3 Triangulation: Connecting the pathways and levels of analysis A final component of our methodology concerns how to tie-together the different aspects of the analysis central to our methodology: looking for the three pathways linking social investment to wellbeing in quantitative-micro, quantitative-macro, and qualitative- institutional levels of analysis. The task of tying-together is important within a given level of analysis, but also be between the levels of analysis. Within a given analysis, we can firstly expect significant nuance or complexity in the portrait of how a given face of social investment affects a given aspect of wellbeing. This requires explicit attention to what might reconcile the discordant findings, perhaps through new lines of inquiry and research. At a minimum, such complexity should be laid bare and acknowledged with honesty and scholarly modesty. Secondly, the results between different aspects and combinations of social investment and between different aspects of wellbeing might be discordant, again requiring honesty and care in dealing with and reporting such. Mainly, however, such nuance is critical to unearthing which if any aspects of social investment are likely to promise the most with respect to which if any aspects of wellbeing. Thirdly, the results often need to be modelled in a way that allows some aggregation to the macro level, even if one is most interested in individual-level differences as well and along the way. And the results need to be modelled in a way to consider how a given effect might have downstream effects that can be linked to endpoint measures of wellbeing \u2013 for instance by considering how social-investment contributions to poverty and employment might have causally subsequent implications for economic productivity or growth. Our ASIS methodology has little to promise on both kinds of such \u2018aggregation\u2019, other than to point out that this should be thought through even if not subject to further empirical analysis. All three kinds of tying-together of insights at a given level of analysis should allow some stronger, if nuanced and qualified, inferences about the broad returns to social investment reforms. The tying-together across the levels of analysis is equally important to our synergy- focused methodology. Our principal presumption, or conceit, is that the quantitative- micro, quantitative-macro and qualitative-institutional levels of analysis should work together to clarify by way of triangulation how a particular aspect or combination of social investment provisions play out for a particular aspect of economic wellbeing. By \u2018triangulation\u2019 we mean in the first instance a test of how a set of developments appears from very different levels of group aggregation, different techniques for analysing cause- and-effect relations, and ways of seeing and processing information about policy experience. Our presumption is that the three levels of analysis will often yield discordant, conflicting information. This should provoke puzzlement rather than despair, and should be a basis for further exploration to reconcile in theory or further empirics what the actual relationship between the given face of social investment and of wellbeing actually is. In this way, the triangulation among the levels of analysis should mean that the whole of the three-tiered analysis should be greater than the sum of its parts. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 47 Part 2: ASIS Methodology illustrated To illustrate our ASIS methodology \u2013 a synergy-focused methodology \u2013 we examine specific examples of how social-investment provisions in EU member states have measurable implications for specific features of economic wellbeing. Our focus is on two outcomes crucial to economic wellbeing (employment and poverty), and on two important features of social investment policies (ALMP and early-childhood education policies). Employment and poverty are crucial to the debated promise and pitfalls of social-investment reforms, with both being intrinsic features individual wellbeing \u2013 employment as a positive measure of economic wellbeing and poverty being a negative measure of economic suffering or \u2018non-wellbeing\u2019. These implications are also clearly relevant to downstream economic implications key to a broad conception of returns, including short-term and long-term labour productivity and growth for European economies. As for the examples of ALMP and early-childhood education, both provisions are also central to any conception of social investment and also to different particular target populations and features of social investment\u2019s possible stock, flow and buffer functions. What matters most is that analysis of how these exemplary social investment provisions relate to employment and poverty illustrates the components of the methodology summarized above. We therefore focus on how ALMP and early-childhood education and care affect employment and poverty at the micro-level (in time-series cross-section analysis of European experience using EU-SILC longitudinal data); at the macro-level (in time-series cross-section analysis of Eurostat and other data on European and OECD experience over a longer period of time); and at the macro-historical level (in qualitative- institutional and historical analysis of selected country experiences). And consistent with the analysis above, our exploration considers how each \u2018face\u2019 of social investment affects employment and poverty for various populations \u2013 the general population, and examples of potential risk populations (e.g. women, youth aged 15-24, and less-skilled and older males). Finally and crucially, we explore not only direct relationships between a given face of social investment (ALMP or early-child education) and of wellbeing (employment or poverty); we also consider two particular examples of possible interactions between policies. First, we consider how the social investment measures might interact with more traditional and passive social transfers in affecting either employment or poverty. This is particularly relevant to identifying possible \u2018Matthew effects\u2019, where traditional welfare- state transfers and safety nets \u2013 providing buffer functions, in our parlance \u2013 might be less effective in fighting poverty, at least for some vulnerable groups, to the extent that a polity invests more in ALMP or other social-investment activation policies. Second, we consider how ALMP and early-child education provisions might interact as a test of institutional complementarity, where the two faces of social investment can be expected to reinforce or complement one another in increasing employment and, perhaps, fighting poverty. The extended illustration yields a nuanced portrait of returns, with results that vary somewhat across levels of analysis and across particular groups whose wellbeing underscore any fair notion of returns. The big picture to emerge from the analysis, however, is one where at all levels, particularly the micro-individual level, ALMP and ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 48 early-childhood education make some major contributions to employment with a more mixed effect on poverty \u2013 with ALMP actually appearing to be an important weapon in the fight against poverty as well as for employment activation, but with Early-childhood education effort yielding more modest and mixed results in its poverty implications. We also find a diverse pattern in the interaction between broader social transfers and safety nets on the one hand and social-investment provisions on the other \u2013 where the balance of evidence suggests that Matthew effects are likely to be modest or non-existent, particularly with respect to ALMP in relation to passive transfers. Finally, the portrait does suggest some important evidence of institutional complementarities, particularly in the micro and the macro-historical analyses, where ALMP appears likely to be most effective in promoting employment particularly where polities also have introduced early- childhood assistance that ease the combination of work and family. Section 5: Quantitative-Micro analysis To illustrate the character and value of the micro-analysis, we focus on EU-SILC dataset, one of the two Eurostat micro-datasets that we believe should be relied-upon to gauge how particular social investment provisions affect individual-level economic wellbeing (Eurostat 2016a). We focus particularly on the longitudinal, true-panel version of that dataset for the period between 2004 and 2011. This is of course a modest time span, even within the limits of the EU-SILC data instrument. But it provides leverage to better capture how year-on-year developments in ALMP and in early-childhood education influence the employment and poverty experiences of individuals over meaningful time span. In analysing these data, we focus on the full sample for 27 EU member states (all EU member states prior to Croatia\u2019s 2013 entry into the EU). However, because our proposed methodology considers the possible uneven effects of social investment interventions across particular groups in a given polity, we also analyse three illustrative sub-samples: the female population; the youth population (aged 15-24); and the older less-skilled male population (men aged 55-64 with no more than a high-school education). Dependent variables : Employment and Household Poverty. We focus on two measures of individual economic wellbeing. Employment is a measure of whether an individual in a given year of the EU-SILC sample is employed, part-time or full-time, self-employed or with an employer (coded as 1; 0=all non-employment, including retirement or other inactivity) (Eurostat 2016a). Household Poverty is a measure of whether a surveyed individual is part of a household with a weighted annual income below 50 percent of the national median (1=household income<national median; 0=at or higher than national median household income) (Eurostat 2016a). 3 Independent variables : ALMP and Early-childhood education effort. We focus on two particular measures of ALMP and Early-childhood education effort, both using Eurostat sources. Our measure of ALMP effort, ALMP spending per unemployed, is based on Eurostat\u2019s Labour Market Policy (LMP) database measure of ALMP spending (adding- together the components 2-7 measuring training, job rotation and job sharing, 3 It is imperative to be explicit on why we opt for the 50% poverty-rate OECD benchmark for illustrative purposes. The methodology we designed, both and the micro and also at the macro level required good data to produce reliable estimates. For doing a reliable analysis of the social investment impact on poverty, the OECD database is the only one that can really serve our purpose in terms of time, coverage, reliability and robustness. Eurostat provides measure with the 60% poverty threshold for the years 2003 to 2011 only. In five or ten years from now we will be positive to gauge the impact on poverty with the methodology we suggest using Eurostat data. For reasons of academic credibility, we now have to work with the OECD poverty benchmark. ",

We also consider other specifications, including spending as a share of GDP, and such spending weighted by the unemployment rate. Our measure of Early-childhood policy effort, Early-child Education, is based on data on pre-primary education (ISCED-0) and childcare spending, drawing from the UOE Education database, a collaboration of UNESCO, OECD, and Eurostat (UOC, Eurostat, and European Commission 2014, p.80-81). 5 Control variables . To explore the relationships between the social-investment measures and either employment or poverty, we want to consider the role of, and social investment\u2019s possible interaction with, a range of individual and country-level conditions relevant to wellbeing. The individual level conditions include the following battery of socio-economic and demographic conditions relevant to employment and/or poverty: Age (raw age at time of survey interview); Male (male=1; female=0); Bad health, based on answer to the relevant EU-SILC question (PH010) (1=bad health; 0=otherwise); Household size, based on the standardized size of members of the household; Married, as those formally married or in domestic partnership; Low education, measured as having no more than the high-school equivalent in formal education (1=low education; 0=some or more tertiary and higher education). For the analyses of poverty, we also include various categories of economic status ( Part-time work; Unemployed; Student; Retired; Disabled; Military personnel; Household-domestic tasks; Otherwise economically inactive). Finally, we consider the role and interaction with Total social expenditures, measured as total government spending on social protection as a percentage of GDP, minus the spending on ALMP (as measured using LMP data above) as a percentage of GDP. The data for Total social expenditures comes from the Eurostat social protection database (Eurostat-ESSPROS 2016). Three-step estimation . Using such variables, we fit a range of models of how ALMP spending and of Early-child spending play out for individual-level employment or poverty. 6 Our models are consistently applied to four samples: all respondents (in a given country-year); only females; youth (aged 15-24); and less-educated and older males (aged 55-64). All our baseline models are based on relatively simple estimators, easy to reproduce and repeat on other data waves and datasets, and appropriate to estimation on the relatively large samples that come with the Eurostat micro-data (often more than a million observations): two-level random-intercept logit models that take account of the binary character of the dependent variables ( employed or in poverty ) and the multi-level character of the data (individuals within countries). All the models consider such effects of the social-investment parameters, (with one-year lags), net of controls that include the above-mentioned individual and national factors, but in all 4 Other categories of the LMP measures include less activation-oriented aspects of labour market services and spending. Category 1, the costs of public employment services, arguably undergirds and overlaps categories more classically associated with activation but is less directly associated with ALMP narrowly construed; Categories 8 and 9 (out-of-work income maintenance and support, and early retirement benefits) are clearly about more passive assistance. 5 Our baseline measure is a measure of spending as a share of GDP, weighted by the 0-4 share of the total population. We also consider other measures, such as the OECD measures of ECEC, though this provides less coverage in terms of country- years. 6 We need to do much of the analysis in estimations that take ALMP and Earl-child Education separately, because they yield different sample sizes relevant to the efficiency and bias of the estimations since both variables of interest vary only at the level of the country-year. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 50 baseline models also include dummy variables for year and a lagged dependent variable. The former addresses time-specific trends and heteroskedasticity, while the latter addresses these issues but does more. It makes explicit use of the panel character of the EU-SILC data, allowing us get some control on likely selection-into-treatment and in any event modelling dynamically how and whether social investment provisions correlate with individual employment or poverty. For each of the outcomes of interest ( Employed and Poverty), we follow our proposed general methodology by analysing in three steps the key aspects of how social investment influence employment and poverty. In the first step, we measure whether and in what direction each spending measure has a direct or indirect influence on individual level poverty or employment, net of the various controls. In our methodology, we test whether social investment policy measures have either a positive, negative or null effect on individual employment or poverty in the direct correlation. In our illustrative estimates of poverty, we also consider whether either ALMP or Early-child education spending has an indirect effect on poverty, by altering the well-known role of socio-economic risks related to economic status \u2013 particularly for those in part-time work, those who are unemployed, or those who are retired \u2013 to fall-into or experience poverty. Such indirect effects might also be relevant to the relationship between social investment and employment, for instance with low education, but for reasons of space we focus on such indirect results only for the poverty estimates. For those poverty estimates, hence, we not only consider the direct correlation between social investment and poverty, but also whether social investment measures have a positive, negative, or null effect in moderating the generally positive correlation between vulnerable economic status (e.g. unemployment or part-time work) and poverty. In the second step, we focus on how ALMP or Early-child spending have implications for Employment or Poverty that are intertwined with the effects of Total social expenditures. This is possible by adding the statistical interaction term (e.g. between ALMP X Total social expenditures ) to the models in step one. Where such interaction terms are positive and significant, they capture a situation where the effect of one variable becomes more positive or less negative as the other component variable rises in value. This allows us to explore the possibility that social investment measures have implications conditional upon the traditional social transfers, or that traditional social transfers have implications conditional upon social investment provisions. With respect to employment, we need to know whether possible activation benefits of social investment might be made stronger or weaker when social investment provisions exist amidst more generous traditional, more buffer-focused, social expenditures. And with poverty, we are particularly interested in exploring possible \u2018Matthew effects\u2019, where activation-oriented ALMP and Early-child assistance might diminish the poverty-fighting effectiveness of broader, traditional social safety nets. The third step for each of our outcomes, finally, focuses on the interaction between ALMP and Early-child education . This is captured by considering ALMP and Early-child education parameters together in a single estimation, whilst adding an interaction-term, of the two social investment measures, to the estimation models from step one. To be sure, this reduces the sample size somewhat and generates some challenge to efficiency in the models due to high correlation between ALMP and Early-child education. But it allows us to explore the possibility that the two faces of social investment have implications, or promise returns, for individual wellbeing that entail \u2018institutional complementarities\u2019. The resulting three-step illustration of how ALMP and Early-child spending influence employment and poverty should capture the nuance and complexity that illustrates our ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 51 methodology\u2019s attempt to balance relevance and rigor. Doing so, however, entails quite some moving parts. We present the results in fourteen (regression) tables, though most of these leave much of the detail in the output (e.g. about the controls) to conserve space. Nonetheless, we offer the following Figure 5.1 below to provide an overview of the analysis to follow. Figure 5.1: Overview of illustrative tables analysing how ALMP and Early-childhood Education affect individual Poverty and Employment 5.1 Employment Tables One through Five provide an illustrative overview of how our measures of ALMP and of Early-child education influence the incidence of individual employment in Europe. Here we see a portrait emerge broadly consistent with conventional wisdom on the promise of social investment provisions. 5.1.1 Employment and the direct effects of ALMP and Early-childhood education Consider, first, the direct results in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Table One provides an overview of how ALMP correlates with individual Employment. The results are very clear in this case. The controls, here as elsewhere, perform very much in line with expectation. Importantly among these is the significant and negative effect of Total social expenditures, where we see that this measure of traditional welfare effort, dominated by spending on passive social transfers, tends to correlate negatively with individual incidence of employment. The important result for our illustration, however, is that ALMP spending strongly positively correlates with employment, net of the various controls, across all of our four sample populations. This is no big surprise, but the consistency and strength of the effect is important empirical evidence that ALMP spending might spur employment.

Note that these results cover only 23 of the 27 EU countries, due to data limits, though the results for the controls remain the same as in the fuller sample above. Most importantly, here we get a more mixed set of results, though these are very much in line with expectation. We see that this face of social investment does, in the full sample (model 1), suggest that Early-childhood spending spurs employment, but this effect is weak and does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. Very much in line with expectation, however, such spending does strongly and significantly increase female employment (model 2). It\u2019s effects, again not surprising, are non-significant for both youth \u2013 who tend to be too young to benefit from the activation benefit of such spending \u2013 and for the older less- skilled males \u2013 who can be expected to be too old to benefit, and might be less likely to respond to the capacitation of better public early-childhood care and education provisions.

We don\u2019t have strong theoretical priors, here, but it is certainly plausible that the generally positive employment-enhancing effects of the social investment indicators might be rendered less or more significant in settings with more generous social policy settings. And it is likewise plausible and important that the generally negative, employment-retarding effects of total social expenditures shown in the previous tables are rendered more or less significant in settings with more generous social investment provisions.

The results are different across the two illustrative faces of social investment. The results for ALMP in Table 5.3 suggest that that the interaction does not hold for all groups, but that as a general matter is positive (for the full sample in model 1). The pattern holds, more strongly in fact, for the youth portion of that sample. Such patterns can be interpreted in a number of ways. But the two most likely and compatible possibilities are good news for supporters of the social investment approach: The results suggest that ALMP has stronger employment-producing effects in settings with more generous total social expenditures, presumably settings where the buffer functions of broad safety nets are stronger. Equally, the results are consistent with the possibility that such broad safety nets, shown in previous tables to be generally bad news in lowering employment chances, may be less so as ALMP becomes more generous. Such findings are important in capturing an important institutional complementarity between ALMP and more traditional, buffer-focused social policy \u2013 important to gauging social returns of social investment. In contrast, the results in Table 5.4 suggest a less consistently significant interaction between Early-childhood education and Total social expenditures. The full sample yields a significant positive interaction, where Early-child education has a negative effect at the lowest levels of Total social expenditures, but becomes less negative and ultimately more positive at higher levels of the latter. This reaches significance above the 60 th percentile in the sample distribution of Total social expenditures (results not shown but available upon request). In any event, all the relevant subsamples for more economically vulnerable groups show no such significance. Such a pattern suggests that the results without such interactions are likely to hold tone, where we see that the dynamics of modest employment-enhancement of Early-childhood education and employment- discouragement of Total social expenditures appear to hold separate from one another. 5.1.3 Employment and the conditional effects of ALMP and Early-child education (1) (2) (3) (4) All Females Youth Older less-skilled males Early-childhood education per child -5.012*** 0.202 -5.924* -0.802 (1.350) (1.756) (3.214) (5.810) Total social expenditures (minus ALMP) -0.045*** -0.019* -0.079*** -0.006 (0.008) (0.011) (0.020) (0.033) Early-child ed.

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 56 Table 5.5 summarizes our final estimations of individual Employment, focused on the possibility of institutional complementarities or tensions between the two illustrative faces of social investment. Here the interaction term of interest is between ALMP and Early-childhood education spending. Displayed again are only the results without the controls, to save space (full table available upon request). The picture painted by such interactions across the full and sub-samples is mixed, though tends to suggest positive institutional complementarity between ALMP and Early-childhood education in shaping employment chances for individuals. For the full sample (model 1) and for the youth subsample (model 3) interaction is positive and significant. This is consistent with the theoretically plausible and more qualitatively supported intuition that the employment- enhancing effects of ALMP provisions can be expected to be strong particularly, or perhaps only, when countries also introduce policies that facilitate the combination of work and family, such as Early-childhood education and childcare. Figure 5.3 graphs this interaction, where we see on the vertical axis the conditional effect of ALMP on Employed, conditional upon variation in the full sample distribution of Early-child ed. \u2013 not as bad a portrait as one might fear for settings with modest Early-childcare and education provisions. ALMP predicts a significant probability of employment throughout the distribution of Early-child education, but the increase across the latter\u2019s distribution is substantial. Before making too much of this main result, however, it is important and puzzling that the interaction is not as strong for the females sub-sample, where one would expect the importance of complementing ALMP with work-friendly child programmes to be the strongest. It\u2019s worth noting that the results are not much stronger, and still in any event below statistical significance, if one further restricts the sample to women of peak child-rearing age (e.g. between 20 and 50) (results not shown but available upon request).

As with our discussion of Employment, we begin with the direct effects, in Table 5.6 for ALMP and in Table 5.7 for Early-child education. An important additional set of controls, here, are the dummies for important categories of economic status: in part-time work; unemployed; student; retired; disabled; domestic task-oriented; otherwise inactive. For reasons of space we show the results for these and all other controls only in the first of the two tables, as they are not appreciably different across the two sets of estimations. As can be seen by the patterns of the various controls in Table 5.6, many of the controls are strong predictors of individual-level poverty, net of the previous year\u2019s status of poverty. Older, married and those in larger households are less likely to be in poverty, while poverty is more likely among respondents reporting bad health, men, low education and all of the vulnerable- economic-status conditions (part-time work, unemployed, etc.) relative to full-time employed respondents. Finally and importantly, we see that most respondents living in country-years with more generous Total social expenditures, the measure of traditional welfare safety nets, are significantly less likely to be in poverty. Interestingly, the opposite may be true for the youth sub-sample, where total spending is significantly positive, increasing youth respondents\u2019 chance of being in household Poverty. Indeed, the social transfers that pre-dominate total social expenditures may do less for this part of a population and even hurt their economic fortunes. All these results are in line with previous research and intuition.

The important results for the study of returns to social investment are that ALMP spending (see Table 5.6) also appears to strongly reduce the risk of poverty, while Early- child education spending (Table 5.7) has more ambiguous and sometimes poverty- enhancing effects \u2013 net of all controls. The findings for ALMP are strong and consistently negative for the full sample, for females and for older less-skilled males -- with the youth sub-sample being the exception wherein ALMP has no significant effect. Although the different denominators for the ALMP and Total social expenditures parameters prevent direct comparison of the substantive size of the effects, supplementary analysis shows that ALMP is less effective in reducing poverty than is general Total social expenditures. This should not be surprising, since ALMP is more focused on and relevant to flow and stock functions than to buffer functions, whereas Total social expenditures are more relevant to buffer functions. The pattern suggests, in a sense, the opposite of the \u2018Matthew effects\u2019 that some fear, where ALMP might promote stocks and flows in an economy, but potentially contribute to suffering, such as poverty, particularly for some vulnerable groups. Figure 5.4 captures the marginal effects for the clearest sub-sample on which one often speaks in fearing \u2018Matthew effects\u2019: the risk of poverty in the sub-sample of older, less-skilled males (model 4 in Table 5.6).

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 61 Sources: Based on results from Table 5.7 (model 4). Poverty and individual controls , Eurostat EU-SILC (Eurostat 2016a); ALMP 2-7, LMP Database (Eurostat 2016b); Total Social Expenditures, Eurostat Social Protection Database (Eurostat-ESSPROS 2016). In contrast, Early-child education spending tends to have less salutary effects on poverty, significant by standard levels only in the case of the females sub-sample, and here in the positive direction of increasing respondent chance of being in household poverty. The social investment literature yields few strong theoretical priors on how this particular face of social investment affects poverty , so such results cannot be deemed surprising. But the effects on labour market participation are less direct and salutary than for ALMP, as we have just seen, and they are as or more indirect in their effects on individual income than ALMP. Nonetheless, the results are important in suggesting that the returns in micro-analysis for poverty are modest for most groups and may even pose bad news for women. A fuller portrait of how ALMP and Early-child education effort affect individual-level poverty in the EU can be gleaned by exploring how these policy faces of social investment alter the tendency of vulnerable economic status to spur poverty. Whatever the direct effects may be \u2013 poverty-reducing for ALMP and more of a wash for Early-child education \u2013 the policies might significantly soften or sharpen the tendency of such individual vulnerability in socio-economic status to push individuals into poverty. To model such issues, Tables 5.8 and 5.9 consider the interactions between each of the categories of economic status with ALMP and Early-child education , respectively. Table 5.8 shows results suggesting that ALMP not only has a tendency to generally reduce poverty risk; it also significantly lowers the chances that being in part-time jobs (for all but the your sub-sample) or being unemployed (for the full population and for the youth sub-population) can actually push individuals into poverty. This can be seen most quickly with the significance and sign of the interaction terms in the Table. On the other hand, the results also show that ALMP may exacerbate the risk of poverty among students and disabled respondents \u2013 captured by the positive and significant interaction terms for most of the samples. Table 5.9 shows that the results for Early-child education are, again, more mixed. Although this face of social investment appears to lower the tendency of unemployment and of being a student to raise the risk of poverty in the full sample and the females sub-sample, it generally exacerbates the tendency of part-time employment and being disabled to increase poverty risk.

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 64 Concern about possible \u2018Matthew effects\u2019 not only involves expectation that a particular feature of social investment might favour aspects of wellbeing with respect to some groups, at the expense of other aspects of wellbeing of other groups; it also involves concern that social investment reforms may hollow out more compensatory or redistributive features of welfare states and/or undermine the effectiveness of the latter features. Tables 5.10 and 5.11 explore such possibilities with respect to ALMP and Early- child education , respectively. The models are the same as in 5.6 and 5.7, but add the interaction term between ALMP and total social expenditures. Table 5.10: Poverty and conditional effects of ALMP and Total social expenditures DV: 1=Poverty (household income<50% of national median); 0=income above poverty threshold. All models are multi-level random intercept logit models (individuals within countries), standard errors (in parentheses).

That interaction turns out to be a mixed picture. For the general sample and the females sub-sample, we see positive and significant interaction terms, suggesting that the strongly poverty-reducing implications of living in settings with generous Total social expenditures gets dampened as the generosity of ALMP spending in that setting rises. This is evidence of a modest \u2018Matthew effect\u2019, modest in the sense that in these data Total social expenditures remain significant in their negative effect on poverty risk, albeit less so, even in settings up to the highest 93 rd percentile of ALMP in the sample. The results also pick up the possibility that ALMP\u2019s poverty-reducing effects are dampened to the extent that welfare state transfers are already very generous. Figure 5.5 below graphs this interaction in the left-hand panel, by plotting the predicted effect of total social expenditures (the coefficient and confidence intervals) on the vertical axis, as a function of variation across the full sample spectrum of ALMP effort. Importantly, however, we can see that the interaction term is statistically significantly negative, for the sub-sample of older less-skilled males \u2013 a group about whom one might most worry with respect to \u2018Matthew effects\u2019. This means that ALMP for this group correlates more strongly negatively, in a poverty-reducing direction, for those living in years and settings with more generous total social spending. And more to the point of concern about Matthew effects, the model shows that total social expenditures have, likewise, a stronger negative correlation with poverty, more poverty-reducing effects, when (1) (2) (3) (4) All Females Youth Older less-skilled males ALMP spending per unemployed -0.054*** -0.074*** 0.058* 0.103 (0.015) (0.021) (0.035) (0.070) Total social expenditures (minus ALMP) -0.032*** -0.048*** 0.028*** -0.023 (0.005) (0.006) (0.010) (0.016) ALMP X Total social expenditures 0.002** 0.002*** -0.002 -0.007** (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.003) \u2026..

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 65 respondents are in settings and years with more generous ALMP. Figure 5.5 captures, in the right-hand panel, that the more generous ALMP in place, the more strongly negative or poverty reducing is the effect of total social expenditures. This pattern suggests, in effect, the opposite of a \u2018Matthew effect\u2019 \u2013 more a story of institutional complementarity between ALMP and the more general buffer-generating properties of broader social spending.

The results in Table 5.11 suggest a more consistent story for the interaction between Early-child education and Total social expenditures. There we see that in the full sample and in the female and youth sub-samples, the interaction is negative and significant. This is, again, a pattern directly opposite to a Matthew effect. We see, in other words, that Total social expenditures tends to more strongly reduce the risk of poverty among respondents in settings that also have more generous Early-child education effort than those in settings with less generous such effort. The effect is not significant either way for the sub-sample of older less-skilled males. But the patterns strongly suggest no Matthew effects for this face of social investment; to the contrary, Early-child education might strengthen the poverty-reducing buffer functions of broader social safety nets.

There are no strong theoretical priors informing such analysis, other than that we expect the effects of social investment to interact with one another in ways the complicate their implications for measures of wellbeing, and in this case also of suffering. As an empirical matter, we see that there is in our data and estimation approach some signs of significant interaction, and in the direction of the two faces of social investment undermining one another\u2019s poverty-reducing powers. In particular, we may have seen that ALMP tends to significantly reduce poverty, net of a range of individual and macro-level factors. But we see here that this effect is significantly reduced in settings where Early-child education is substantial. Such an interaction can have a lot of explanations, one of which is that these two aspects of educational institutions and effort might crowd one another out in the quality of their services. But we see this finding as somewhat surprising, inducing a potentially important institutional tension within social investment that deserves more attention. The point is that our methodology offers the tools to inductively identify such nuanced institutional interactions relevant to gauging the returns of various faces of social investment.

First, we have seen the power of this level of analysis to shed light on the direct and indirect effects of social investment on employment and poverty. There we have seen that particularly ALMP is a powerful mechanism for increasing employment among most individuals in the broad European sample, but also that Early-child education can play such a role. We also saw, perhaps more surprisingly, that ALMP, in our data and estimations, also may have fortunate extra benefit of fighting individual poverty \u2013 both directly and indirectly by lowering the tendency of part-time work, unemployment and (early) retirement. Second, the illustration reveals many situations under which social investment faces tend to interact significantly with broader total social expenditures in shaping both poverty and employment chances of individuals. That interaction tends to vary substantially, but the broad tenor of the estimations suggest a situation where the two faces of social investment tend to do better work for individual economic wellbeing under circumstances where total social expenditures are more generous. For instance, ALMP tends to make stronger not weaker contributions to the employment chances of individuals in settings with more generous total social expenditures. And while ALMP might pose modest Matthew effects for the general population, it may actually have the opposite more salutary effect of strengthening the poverty-fighting qualities of social transfers among older less-skilled males. Third, the illustration also shows significant institutional complementarities and tensions between the two faces of social investment. Consistent with our own expectations, we see that ALMP tends to have a more positive effect on the chances of employment for those respondents in settings with more generous Early-child education effort than those (1) (3) (5) (7) All Females Youth Older less-skilled males Early-child Education -1.950*** -0.728 2.858* 0.006 (0.695) (0.912) (1.539) (2.344) ALMP spending per unemployed -0.076*** -0.072*** 0.056* -0.098* (0.015) (0.020) (0.031) (0.055) ALMP X Early-child Education 0.659*** 0.566*** -0.527* 0.033 (0.119) (0.159) (0.293) (0.566) \u2026\u2026 Constant -3.214*** -2.949*** -3.447*** -2.207*** (0.115) (0.136) (0.250) (0.585) Year dummies Yes Yes Yes Yes Observations 1,113,168 594,598 115,913 29,841 Number of countries 23 23 23 23 Chi-square 151142 81822 18095 4960 Log-likelihood -219004 -120997 -30972 -7496 (cid:9) ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 68 in less generous such settings. This is important evidence of the kind of institutional complementarities between activating labour market policies and family policies friendly to combining work with family. On the other hand, our exploration of possible complementarities suggests plenty of other, less salutary interactions. We see, for instance, that the two faces of social investment appear to work at cross-purposes in their effects on poverty. Such results, of course, should inform further exploration of institutional interaction in social investment. And the complexities of the patterns illustrate what we most want to capture in our methodology for gauging social investment\u2019s returns: the diversity of implications for different faces of social investment; the possibility of interaction between traditional social policy transfers and social investment reforms; and the possibility of institutional complementarities and tensions between different faces of social investment. The examples illustrate the empirical presence of precisely these patterns that any careful empirical exploration of the promise and pitfalls of social investment must face. The micro-data illustrations, of course, also reveal the limits of this micro-level of our methodology. It provides a useful balance of rigor and relevance, with plenty of relevance in the policies, outcomes and countries and individuals being explored. But it lacks the rigor that data tracking participants in particular social investment programs might furnish, or that even other modelling procedures on the EU-SILC data might furnish, such as quasi-experimental methods. Mainly, however, the gains in rigor come at some expense to relevance: the focus on the micro-level obscures the aggregation to national experience, and in the EU-SILC data covers only modest swath of country-years. Such limits are reminders of the importance of adding the macro-level quantitative research and the qualitative-institutional level of research. And it is to illustration of these two levels that we now turn. Section 6: Quantitative-Macro illustration Our ASIS methodology calls for analysing a given aspect of social investment and its implications for a given aspect of wellbeing with quantitative-macro analysis that is parallel to and tries to build on quantitative-micro analysis. For our illustration of the methodology, hence, we continue our focus on ALMP and Early-childhood education effort, and on employment and poverty. But now we do so with respect to data on aggregate country-year measures of all these conditions. We could do so based on aggregation of the data already analysed in the quantitative-micro analysis \u2013 for instance yielding country-year means for the various measures of poverty and employment \u2013 and indeed this is the basis of important Eurostat information on the topic. The promise of such quantitative-macro analysis, however, is that it not only provides a level of analysis most suited to national debate, benchmarking and positioning, but that it promises analytical leverage through coverage of more countries and years of relevant measures of social investment and of relevant outcomes. For our example areas of focus, we elect to consider widely-used and publicly-available and regularly-updated data from the OECD (e.g. OECD Labour Force Statistics, OECD 2014; OECD Social Expenditures Database, OECD 2015c) that provide a somewhat different sample, including countries outside of the EU (while, alas, excluding a number of EU member states covered in the quantitative-micro analysis above), and generally provides better longitudinal coverage. 7 7 As has already been addressed in footnote 2 in chapter 6, for reasons of consistency between the quantitative-micro and quantitative-macro levels of analysis, we have opted, beyond employment figures from Eurostat, for the OECD database, which comprises a larger country sample. The bigger the dataset (more years, more countries) the more efficient estimators we can produce. Deleting some observations, for instance by excluding certain countries from the sample, would bias our ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 69 These data provide a useful comparison with the Eurostat sources illustrated so far, and provide a useful comparison with the quantitative-micro information. Again in line with the quantitative-micro analysis, we are interested in this illustration in the direct and indirect effects of ALMP and Early-child education effort on Employment rates and Poverty rates, but also in interactions between the social investment measures on the one hand and broad social transfers on the other, and in interactions between ALMP and Early-child education. Unlike the quantitative-micro analysis, however, we shall leave out of the illustration the role of possible interactions with measures of aggregate- level \u2018vulnerability\u2019 (e.g. part-time employment rates). We want to use our illustration to clarify the added value of the quantitative-macro level beyond the micro-level, which is that it allows measure of parameters that are not only aggregated up to the level of a national economy or country, but also \u2018downstream\u2019 to more end-point measures of national economic wellbeing. Our illustration of the quantitative-macro level of analysis will therefore conclude by a brief look at how our same two social investment measures, ALMP and Early-childhood education, might affect labour productivity and growth. Dependent variables . In parallel with the quantitative-micro analysis, our focus is on aggregate variants of the measures of employment and poverty discussed above. Employment rates capture the share of a given population that is in civilian employment. Also parallel with the micro-analysis, we focus on both the full country\u2019s population, but also sub-populations relevant to clarifying skews in the implications of social investment: Employment rate is the civilian employment rate, aged 15 to 64 years old; Female employment rate is the same but for the female employment relative to female working- age population; Youth employment rate is the same but for youth, aged 15-24; and Old working-age employment rate is the same but limited to older males and females aged 55-64 (OECD 2014). 8 The coverage in time of these variables differs. Old and young population employment rates were available for a time interval that spans from 1992 to 2014, while time coverage of the general population rate is much wider and goes from 1960 to 2013. For our quantitative-macro illustration, Poverty rates are the proportions of the population whose income falls below the poverty line, taken as 50% of the median household income of the total population. This matches the definition used in our quantitative-micro analysis. But the source is here the OECD (OECD, 2015b). Poverty rate is for the full population, covering 1976 to 2013, but lots of countries had missing values for several years within the interval. For the sub-samples, the same as for our employment rates, the coverage is spottier still, but the definition is the same for Female poverty rate; Youth poverty rate (aged 15-24); and Old working-age poverty rate (55- 64). In these data, the Finland, Germany US, UK and Canada are the best-reported countries. The new outcome variables of interest in our illustration of the quantitative- macro analysis will be Labour productivity, Real GDP per hour worked, drawn from the OECD Level of GDP per capita and Productivity (OECD, 2015b). This is the aspect of productivity most likely relevant to the workings and returns of social investment, including ALMP and Early-child education. estimations. This could trigger allegations of cherry picking to guide the results, which surely we want to avoid as academic researchers. The approach we rely on, using different layers, facing significant data constraints, is to stop short of abandoning scientific rigor. 8 Note that we do not limit the employment rate to a more vulnerable population, such as less-skilled and older males. This is not possible except through aggregation from the micro-data. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 70 Independent variables: For our macro-analysis, we use the OECD measure of ALMP effort, again captured as the spending towards categories comparable to the Eurostat- LMP categories one to seven: employment services and administration costs, labour market training, job rotation and job sharing, employment incentives, supported employment and rehabilitation, direct job creation and support for starting enterprises. We focused on a range of measures, but focus here on two: ALMP as a share of GDP, and ALMP as a share of GDP divided by the share of unemployed people in the country (OECD 2015c). Our measure of Early-childhood education effort is spending as a share of GDP, divided by the share of children in the age compatible with childcare services (0-4) (European Commission 2014). The time interval available for these two broad measures of social investment is 1980 to 2012, though again countries vary in their coverage (yielding an unbalanced time-series cross-section of data). Control variables: To measure the impact of ALMP and Early childhood education and care policies, we consider in our estimates a range of controls, but for the purposes of the illustration we consider a minimal battery of controls: social security transfers, a measure of more traditional and passive faces of social policy protection, measured as a share of GDP; trade openness , measured as the imports and exports as share of the GDP; real GDP growth as the change with respect to the previous year; share of dependent population as the number of people aged less the 15 and more than 64 divided by the whole population any given year; public debt , the gross general government debt as share of the GDP. Time coverage of these macro-control variables goes from 1960 to 2013 (only openness of the economy stops at 2011). All these controls are from the online OECD Data portal (OECD 2016). Estimation technique: With all of these macro-level measures, our illustration again focuses on each of the three pathways highlighted in our ASIS methodology \u2013 direct effects of social investment, interactions with broader safety nets, and interactions among social investment faces. We do so by presenting not only the inferential regression analysis, but also portraits to emerge from descriptive statistics that the quantitative-macro level can usefully highlight. For each pathway connecting social investment to our measures of wellbeing, hence, we provide cross-sectional scatterplots of relationships between ALMP or Early-child education on the one hand and Employment rates , Poverty rates or Labour productivity on the other. As for the more controlled statistical analysis focused on the full time-series cross-sectional data, our baseline models are based on a simple estimator suited to the character of the macro data: fixed- effects OLS with lagged dependent variables to take account of autocorrelation, the full sample of baseline controls (plus controls for all country dummies that manifest the fixed effects). Needless to say, other estimators and specifications are important to consider. But this is a useful, \u2018boilerplate\u2019 approach suitable to the illustration of quantitative- macro analysis. Figure 6.1 provides an overview of the empirical information in this illustration of quantitative-macro analysis. For reasons of space, we will keep the presentation and discussion of these illustrative data brief. Figure 6.1: Overview of discussion of Quantitative-Macro analysis ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 71 6.1 National Employment rates The first set of Figures and tables summarize the observed macro-level correlations between general, female, youth and older Employment rates on the one hand, and ALMP and Early-childhood education effort on the other. Figure 6.2, and Tables 6.1 focus on the direct relationships involving ALMP and Employment rates. Both the cross-sectional relationships, summarized in the scatterplots (Figure 6.2), and the regression results (Table 6.1) suggest a portrait in line with the quantitative-micro results: the measures of social investment tend to have at least a modest positive relationship with various employment rates. The positive results are clearly stronger when one averages more data and focuses on the cross-sectional relationships \u2013 as all four panels in Figure 6.2 show a clear positive relationship over the sample period. Here, the relationship between ALMP and total employment rate and of the female employment rate is the strongest, with youth employment rates and particularly older working-age employment rates having a less tight positive relationship \u2013 thanks to the clear outliers of Iceland (with significantly higher youth and older employment than ALMP would predict) and Sweden (with substantially less).

Table 6.1 shows that the positive effects get somewhat washed-away in the fuller regression context using our macro-data and baseline regression technique. The results fit expectation with respect to the direction and significance of the various controls \u2013 most importantly that we again see that passive social-security transfers appear to significantly dampen employment rates. But the main results for ALMP come out weaker than the micro-analysis suggested (or the descriptive statistics). The results for ALMP are positive across all the general and group-specific measures of employment rates, but it is statistically significant only with respect to Female employment rates. The reason has to do with the outliers mentioned earlier, for instance Iceland. But it also has to do with the slightly different sample of countries (e.g. with Switzerland and Iceland) and measures of the relevant parameters that the OECD provides as opposed to Eurostat \u2013 which may cover less time and no non-European countries, but does cover all European countries very well.

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 75 Tables 6.3 and 6.4 consider the second pathway of our methodology: the possibility that the measures of social investment might interact significantly with other, existing features of social policy safety nets and institutions. We stick with the examples developed in the quantitative-micro analysis, and focus on the possibility that ALMP and Early-childhood education spending might have effects on employment rates that are conditional upon the level of social-security transfers. The answer is mixed. Table 6.3 suggests that the answer is \u2018no\u2019 with respect to ALMP, a pattern in the same direction but non-significant and hence weaker than what we saw in the parallel quantitative-micro analysis, where for the full and youth samples the interaction was positive and significant in the direction of complementarity. Table 6.4 shows, on the other hand, that the answer is \u2018yes\u2019 with respect to Early-childhood education: here we see that early-childhood spending tends to become more strongly positive in its relationship with employment rates as a country\u2019s social security transfers become more generous. Equally, the pattern suggests that the negative, employment-retarding effects of social security transfers gets significantly dampened to the degree that a country introduces more generous early-childhood education provisions. The patterns are, interestingly, strongest for the youth employment rate and weakest for female employment rate, an oddity that parallels findings in the micro-section. We see, hence, a contrast with the micro results in terms of significance but not direction of the results. And as a general matter, the quantitative-macro level of analysis suggests, again, the importance of modelling possible institutional complementarities.

Table 6.5, finally, considers the possibility of institutional complementarities among the two faces of social investment. Here the results are again modest, but again consistently in the direction of the results reported in the quantitative-micro analysis. ALMP and Early-childhood education tend to interact positively though not significantly with one another in their implications for national employment rates. The results are just under standard thresholds of statistical significance for the older working-age population. With respect to this level of analysis and data, we see that this much talked-about interaction does not shine through clearly.

Consistent with our quantitative-micro analysis, the pattern in the macro data suggests that there are few such effects, at least as measured in our illustrative pass at the data. Figure 6.4 and Table 6.6 show the direct results for ALMP. In the cross-sectional analysis, ALMP appears to modestly but significantly reduce general poverty rates in a country, as well as youth poverty (comparable female poverty rates were unavailable for enough country-years in the OECD dataset to warrant comparable analysis). The effects on old working-age poverty are not significant, however. In the regression context shown in Table 6.6, these results emerge as weak, indeed substantially weaker than the fuller quantitative-micro analysis and the cross- sectional macro analysis.

The stronger positive relationship applies to both the nationwide poverty rate and to youth poverty rate. Again, the effect is weakest, and not statistically significant, with respect to older working-age poverty. Table 6.7 shows that precisely this pattern holds up to a regression context in our baseline specifications \u2013 with Early-childhood education correlating significantly negatively with all three measures of poverty, though just under standard levels of significance for poverty. The effect is strongest for youth poverty. Interestingly, the results of the macro data even suggest that the poverty-fighting effects of early-childhood education can be nearly as strong as for social transfers. The results not readable from the table, given different units across the parameters, but further analysis suggests that the poverty-retarding effects of Early-childhood education on nationwide poverty is almost fifty per cent of that of the full palette of programmes captured by social-security transfers.

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 81 Tables 6.8, 6.9 and 6.10 consider the possible pathways of interaction between social investments on the one hand and broader social safety nets on the other (6.8 and 6.9), and between the two faces of social investment (6.10). The quantitative-micro story on such matters, recall, was chequered, with evidence of \u2018Matthew effects\u2019 but also of complementarities, both between social investment and broader buffer protections and between ALMP and Early-childhood education . Here with the particular illustration of the quantitative-macro analysis we see no signs of \u2018Matthew effects\u2019; to the contrary, we see in Table 6.8\u2019s most general measure of nationwide poverty rates that there is some interaction between ALMP and social security transfers in the direction of ALMP strengthening the poverty-fighting power of social transfers. And the lack of significance for ALMP (in Table 6.8) for the other targeted measures of poverty \u2013 for youth and older working-age citizens \u2013 suggests that there is no tendency of ALMP to hollow-out the anti- poverty role of social transfers. That latter story is the same for Early-childhood education\u2019s effects on all the poverty-rate measures (Table 6.9). There is, hence, no support in the aggregate data for this particular possible manifestation of \u2018Matthew effects\u2019. Table 6.8: Poverty rates and conditional effects of ALMP and Soc. Sec.

On the other hand, the aggregate data also provide little support for our third expected pathway by which social investment influences wellbeing \u2013 through institutional complementarities among different aspects of social investment. As can be seen from Table 6.10, there appears to be no statistically significant interaction in either a conflict or complementary direction \u2013 something that modestly befits the theoretical expectation that these particular faces of social investment ought to work together particularly in their influence on employment more than on poverty.

We do so with reference to a necessarily short-term measure of such downstream returns: Labour productivity, real GDP per hour worked, based on OECD data (OECD 2016b). Our expectation is that the contributions that ALMP and, perhaps, Early-childhood education make to employment and poverty are direct measures of wellbeing but also intermediary measures that can percolate up to the economic efficiency of all economic enterprises in the economy \u2013 by making strong and effective use of manpower, and better matching skills to the labour market (particularly relevant for ALMP). Whether this is so, of course, is an empirical question that quantitative-macro data can shed some light upon. Figure 6.6 summarizes the cross-sectional relationships. Here we see that ALMP has positive and significant correlation with subsequent Labour productivity, a relationship that is tight enough to be also statistically significant in the bivariate correlation. Early- childhood education, while a positive correlation, is not as tight, as can be seen by the 95-percent confidence intervals (the dashed lines surrounding the regression line) to be statistically insignificant in a bivariate, summary context.

Table 6.11 considers whether such relationships hold up in a time-series cross-section regression context. It shows, in one table, all three of the ASIS-methodology for tracing possible implications of social investment provisions for wellbeing. Models 1 and 2 summarize the direct \u2018effects\u2019 of our two illustrative faces of social investment (ALMP, in model 1, and Early-child education, in model 2).

Models 3 and 4 consider the possible institutional complementarities or conflicts between broader social transfers on the one hand, and the faces of social investment on the other (models 2 for ALMP and 5 for Early-child ed.). Here we see no significance in either direction, for either of the social investment parameters. This suggests no sign of complementarities or conflict. Finally, model 5 summarizes the possible institutional complementarities or conflicts between ALMP and Early-child education. And once again, we see in these data, using such a baseline estimation specification, no significant sign of complementarities.

        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 85 This brief illustration of the quantitative-macro level of analysis has yielded an abundance of statistical non-results, though at the same time speaks broadly consistently with the quantitative-micro data in the broad tenor of what it tells us about social investment\u2019s returns. We see that ALMP and Early-childhood education, as particular modal features of social investment, do show signs of contributing to the flow and stock functions of social policy by tending to positively affect employment rates, at least for some groups. We also see that the direct effects on poverty are more likely to be salutary, in the direction of diminishing poverty rates. We also have found mixed but important evidence that institutional complementarities can be present in how social investment provisions interact with existing social transfers \u2013 and in a direction that shows if anything a sign of complementarity in poverty-fighting and certainly not in the direction of \u2018Matthew-effects\u2019 conflict. On the other hand, we see in the macro data few signs of institutional complementarity between ALMP and Early-childhood education, though the directions of the interactions are in such a direction \u2013 in any event thus showing even less sign of any institutional conflict. Consistent with and unambiguously supplementing the quantitative- micro story is the last macro-level exploration of how ALMP and Early-childhood education influence labour productivity \u2013 where particularly ALMP shows modest signs of spurring this important downstream metric of wellbeing . It\u2019s important that the overview provided by the descriptive-statistical results tend to be stronger in the direction of identifying stronger returns of social investment, than the story to emerge from the time-series cross-section results. It is important that these are not results subject to statistical control, for instance with respect to some important putatively confounding factors that can render the bivariate relationships spurious. But it is also important that the descriptive statistics on which we focused were based on much broader time-aggregations, capturing in-and-of-themselves evidence of the \u2018truth\u2019 of the promise and pitfalls of social investment that goes beyond the story our time-series- cross-section analysis could show. This is precisely why our ASIS methodology calls for taking different analytical \u2018cuts\u2019 at aggregate-level data seriously. The various patterns, of course, are mere illustrations. We could well have generated different results using different data sources, estimation methods, and different particular samples in terms of time and countries. The key, however, is that we see how the ASIS method can generate cumulative and important knowledge and insight about the returns to social investment reforms \u2013 precisely by matching up the quantitative-micro to the quantitative-macro levels of analysis. And this is the reminder that the third and final level of analysis of our ASIS method \u2013 qualitative-institutional analysis \u2013 plays a crucial role in clarifying in more narrative and holistic political-economic history what the development and relationship is of social investment reforms in particular country contexts. Section 7: Institutional qualitative analysis This section provides depth to the quantitative empirical evidence presented in sections 5 and 6 by engaging in country-level institutional policy analysis for the purpose of identifying institutional complementarities and ambiguities or in-complementarities behind exemplary or suboptimal performance in terms of social investment economic returns. This step is crucial to our methodology, because with this third layer we can not only provide fairly concrete policy recommendations to domestic policy maker; we are also in a much better position to substantiate the evidence from previous two sections by explaining (positive and negative) outliers to bolster the overall analysis. Given the importance of socioeconomic contextual and institutional complementarities one would naturally expect outliers. Our conceptual framework of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 in ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 86 institutional complementarity allows for an in-depth understanding of such outliers for which country-specific policy recommendations can be easily articulated. This section will analyse three countries: Denmark, Italy and Germany. Denmark is generally recognized as a social investment vanguard country (Bouget et al., 2015) and compared to the European mean, a positive performer yielding decent, and more importantly consistent returns on social investment policies, as can be observed from the previous two sections. Italy presents an outlier at the opposite end of the spectrum with rather sub-optimal returns of social investment. Germany completes the spectrum with \u201cmiddle-of-the-road\u201d performance, showing signs of both positive institutional complementarities and accelerating social investment returns, as well as institutional ambiguities that seemingly dampen social investment synergy reinforcements. Our qualitative institutional analysis will mirror and build on the previous sections by again focusing on the two \u2018usual suspect\u2019 social investment policy areas: childcare and family policies and ALMPs (Bonoli, 2013). 7.1 Denmark Thanks to the overall institutional coherence of the Nordic welfare system, Denmark is well equipped to make social investment happen. The most conspicuous characteristic of the Nordic regime has been its combination of generous income maintenance \u2018buffers\u2019, well-developed public social services in the area of human capital \u2018stock\u2019 development, and fairly flexible labour regulation supported by active labour market policies to ease labour market \u2018flow\u2019 and sustain high employment rates for both men and women. Today, all Nordic countries have evolved towards dual-earner social policy models, in which women and men, at least formally, have the same rights and obligations both in the labour market and at home. In particular the expansion of social services improved women\u2019s opportunities to balance paid work and domestic care, while at the same time providing service sector employment. No wonder, Danish ALMP and Family Policy spending is highest in the world (in terms of GDP). This section explains Denmark\u2019s exceptional and consistent performance in terms of childcare and ALMPs. The Danish political objective is to realize the potential of all citizens, independent of their social background, enabling them to be autonomous. A strong commitment exists towards those who cannot take care of themselves and/or cannot take part in the labour market. The cost, of course, is a very high tax rate, underscored also by Iversen and Wren (1998). Danish social investment policies are by and large locally delivered. Social services, including ALMP and lifelong education is organized and delivered by municipalities. Wide local discretion and a variety of social and economic profiles result in differences in the scope, price and quality of social investments across local municipalities and regions. 7.1.1 Active Labour Market Policies (ALMPs) With regards to ALMPs Denmark appears to be an exemplary case, achieving good returns in terms of employment (as shown by figure 6.2, section 6). Anyone who is capable of working is obliged to engage in paid employment, but there is a broad understanding that not everybody can work on market terms and/or run an ordinary family life. This shared understanding helps explain the Nordic tradition of universal safety net \u2018buffers\u2019 for marginalized and vulnerable groups. Danish spending on ALMPS has historically been the highest in OECD countries at around 1.5% GDP (Martin & Grubb, 2001), which is extremely high considering the EU average of 0.47% (in 2011, when Denmark spent 1.54% GDP) (Kvist, 2015b), and recently climbed to an even higher 1.82% GDP (2013 OECD data). The entire ALMP scheme is also very ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 87 comprehensive (Kluve, 2006), with regional administrators enjoying great freedom in terms of the assistance they offer and how they offer it. Unemployment insurance also boasts very high net replacement rates (at least in the short term). Unemployment rate is a relatively low 6.4% (OECD data from 2013) and is almost identical for males and females. Employment rate is also well above the OECD average with 76% for men and 70% for women. In Denmark, a series of labour market reforms in the 1990s gradually implemented both a right and a duty to activation, including mandatory individual action plans that activated the unemployed within three to five months (Hemerijck, 2013). The so-called \u2018active\u2019 turn in the Danish welfare state ultimately gave rise to the now famous \u2018flexicurity\u2019 model that triangulates \u2018flexible labour markets, generous unemployment benefits, and active labour market policies\u2014all coordinated to reduce unemployment and improve the quality and supply of workers. Compulsory activation measures were gradually expanded to reach practically all social assistance recipients. The duration of unemployment benefits was gradually reduced from nine to four years in 1999. However, with the exception of young people with no qualifying education, the levels of benefits remained high (Kvist et al., 2008: 227). Building on this duty to activation, certain policy complementarities need to be in place to achieve good results, starting with the training component of ALMP. Denmark has a very high spending on classroom training programs (compared to for example on-the-job training), but these programs have traditionally been very short, lasting only two to four weeks (compared to approx. three months in UK and US) (Heckman, et. al. 1999). This allows participants to resume job search very quickly and contribute to the carrying capacity of the welfare state. Spending on subsidized jobs is also substantial, but spending on public employment services is very low, further building on the tradition started in late 80s of really emphasizing training (Boone & Van Ours, 2004). For training-focused ALMP strategy to be effective it needs to provide high quality training, which is assured by four policy factors: first factor is the already mentioned high public spending, which coupled with the fact that unemployment is relatively low results in a lot of funds to train and \u201cactivate\u201d each unemployed person. The second is high private investment and involvement, which not only adds to the overall expenditure, it also provides the crucial assurance that skills taught in ALMP programs will be of use to firms looking for employees (Martin & Grubb, 2001). Thirdly, it is the comprehensive approach that often combines benefits, incentives, and sanctions, as is the case with Youth Unemployment Programs (Jensen, et. al. 2003). And lastly, it is the discretion with which regions can determine their own priorities and implement them on a case-by-case basis, taking into account who will benefit from ALMPs the most (as demand usually exceeds supply) (Heckman, et. al. 1999). The comprehensive regional approach in itself is a crucial policy complementarity for coverage and participation. In the early 2000s, the responsibility for all labour market measures for both insured and uninsured jobseekers were streamlined under one National Labour Market Authority. The number of regional councils was reduced from fourteen to four \u2018employment regions\u2019, while seventy-seven newly established one-stop job centers were developed to deliver placement, benefits, and training referrals all under one roof (Hemerijck, 2013). In addition, fourteen \u2018pilot\u2019 job centers under full municipal responsibility were created. In the process, the regional councils have lost much of their steering capacity to municipal policymaking and implementation (Kvist et al., 2008: 244). The most recent reform of employment policies in 2014 aims at achieving faster and more stable employment for the unemployed, greater focus on companies labour need, and greater autonomy for municipalities and labour market exchanges to design ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 88 individually tailored measures (Kvist, 2015b). This benefits participation as municipalities (through job centers) can make individual decisions on who needs training the most and what type of training, helping to maximize the returns. Coverage is also not an issue, as the above mentioned duty to be activated, translates into compulsory labour market programs that adults have to enter if they have been unemployed for two years. This obligation is much stronger for specific at risk groups, such as youth, who have to enter such a program after only 26 weeks of unemployment (Martin & Grubb, 2001). Lastly, given the fully public nature of these services, the national, regional, and local provisions can react very well to changing circumstances without the need to coordinate with private institutions (Cox, 1998). To avoid painting an overly rosy picture, it is necessary to highlight that Denmark, despite still performing very well, is no longer the (arguably) \u2018best\u2019 performing country, especially with recent hikes of unemployment and youth unemployment (still well below OECD average, but falling behind its Nordic neighbors, as seen in figure 6.2, section 6). This can be partially explained by the Danish institutional context, as high levels of \u2018activating\u2019 labour market spending are very good at \u2018matching\u2019 the unemployed to employers in periods of prosperity, but in recession the cause of unemployment shifts from job and skill \u2018mismatch\u2019 to depressed demand (Schmitt, 2014). In such a setting, activation policies lose a lot of their effectiveness. This could of course be mitigated by strong unemployment \u2018buffers\u2019 to smoothen the business cycle, but Denmark has actually done the opposite by substantially reducing expenditure on \u2018passive\u2019 unemployment insurance during the recent crisis (OECD data comparing 2005 and 2013). Essentially ALMPs facilitate \u2018flow\u2019 well, as not only is the focus on training appropriate to the Danish context (most people have a preference for full time work for most of their life, and thus do not need to be convinced to do so, but need to be enabled to do so), many policies synergize together to maximize the returns: program spaces are distributed with great care and appreciation for the local context and their effectiveness is assured by high public investment, high private involvement and investment, and a comprehensive approach combining multiple forms of incentives in \u2018one stop shop\u2019 centers. The most at risk groups are also obliged to attend these programs, making sure that the \u2018stock\u2019 of future generations is not endangered. However, as we see from the increasing ALMP spending but decreasing spending on more \u2018compensatory\u2019 labour market policies, Denmark might have went \u2018too far\u2019 with activation and neglected the \u2018buffers\u2019 that are a necessary precondition, further illustrating that when it comes to policy complementarities the devil is in the details: the \u2018stock\u2019 function is certainly developed well, but the \u2018flow\u2019 function is somewhat restricted by depressed demand, which could be seen as an insufficiency in the \u2018buffer\u2019 function. 7.1.2 Family Policy Denmark spends comparatively more on children through a very integrated and comprehensive policy package than most other countries, i.e. more than five times the EU 27 average on child daycare (Kvist, 2015b). Child family allowances are particularly generous for single parents, parents with multiple children, parents out of work or in education and training. Childcare is widely available, heavily subsidized and provided by qualified pedagogues, resulting in an improved cognitive development, especially for disadvantaged children (Esping-Andersen, et. al. 2012). Child poverty is less than half the average of EU 27 and overrepresented among single parents, unemployed parents, and ethnic minorities. Hence, social policies facilitate early childhood development for most children, including those most disadvantaged, but less so children in jobless households (Kvist, 2015b), resulting in very good, but not exceptional, performance in ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 89 figure 6.5 (section 6). The upshot is high full-time female labour participation with a significant reduction in the wage penalty of childbirth (Esping-Andersen, 2005). Denmark\u2019s good performance is not a result of isolated policy but rather the comprehensive nature of the policy mix and other contextual factors, starting with the very basic notion of rights and responsibilities. In Denmark rights are framed in relation to individuals and not in relation to households (Knudsen, 1999), which further reinforces the (context-specific) female preference to work full-time for most of their life and have children even if they are not married, or even if they have not secured their careers yet (Esping-Andersen, 2005). This context is of course of great value to social investment approach and cannot be easily replicated elsewhere, but it is important to acknowledge how the individualized notion of rights supports it. This is relevant for fertility, as marriage is not a necessary pre-requisite for having children, which is apparent from the fact that average age for giving birth to a first child is lower than the average age for entering into marriage. However, Denmark had decreasing fertility rates all the way up to the first half on 1980s. The policy complementarity that was missing was appropriately long and equally distributed parental leave. Once the length of maternal leave was carefully balanced by two extensions and paid paternal leave was introduced in the 80s, fertility rates started climbing again (Knudsen, 1999). In the Danish context it appears that whether the father took paternal leave with the first child influences the chances of the couple having a second child (Esping-Andersen, et. al. 2005). Denmark is also one of the most equal countries in terms of unpaid work division, where women do on average 1.4 hours of unpaid work for every hour men do (Esping-Andersen, 2005). Despite equality playing a big part, there is another crucial policy complementarity to improving fertility rates: reducing the penalization women suffer in the labour market for having children. Denmark performs extremely well, as some research shows this penalty to be very low due to the relatively short leave periods (5% lifetime wage decrease, compared to for example 20% in Spain) (Esping-Andersen, 2005) and some research shows this penalty to not be statistically significant at all (Gupta, & Smith, 2002). The relatively short leaves of average 9 months (Esping-Andersen, 2005) are of great help in preventing skill deterioration and allow women to easily re-enter the labour market with a relatively small lifetime wage penalty (if any at all). Outside of fertility, childcare is perhaps the most crucial policy for fostering female employment. For childcare to foster mothers\u2019 employment it needs to be of high quality, accessible and affordable. High quality is assured by the high expenditure, which was increased again in 2013 (Kvist, 2015b), and by the extremely low ratio (1.3) of carers to children (Esping-Andersen, 2005). Affordability is not an issue, as childcare is fully subsidized with the vast majority being provided by municipalities (70%), by cooperatives, and by almost no private childcare facilities (Esping-Andersen, 2005; Randall, 2000). Access is also not an issue, as capacity is largely sufficient due to good planning and municipalities being in charge of allocating childcare and preschool spaces. The only imperfection could be that children who spend too much time away from their mothers in early childhood develop behavioural problems, but this effect has been shown to be mitigated by the quality of childcare provisions and the quality of mother\u2019s job, both of which are of very high level in Denmark. This combination allows Denmark to have very high employment of mothers, demonstrated by the fact that mothers of children under 12 years of age are working more than women without children (Esping- Andersen, 2005). The returns are not exceptionally high given the expenditure, but they are still very good, as is clear from figure 6.3 (section 6). ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 90 Outside of well-designed childcare and well-designed parental leaves labour market policy is also important for female employment. In Denmark the labour market adjustments are largely informal and include measures such as priority to have your holidays in the summer when children are not attending school (Knudsen, 1999). There are also more formal policies to help mothers enter the labour market, such as nationally mandated \u2018care days\u2019 (only a few per year) they get to spend with their child at home. However, to really consider all the complementarities relevant to female employment, one would have to also investigate the care policies for frail and dependent parents (another potential reason for leaving the labour market). Extensive long-term care provisions are available in this respect, supporting the labour market participation of persons with care dependents (Kvist, 2015b). The last complementarities to consider relate to policies to enable childcare to foster equality of opportunity. In this respect, Denmark is essentially the opposite of Italy: since the right to childcare is a right of the child and not of the household, it is illegal to discriminate children based on the educational attainment or labour market status of their parents (Gupta & Simonsen, 2010). This fosters really good participation of children from all backgrounds in childcare and preschool, further helped by the fact that municipalities can adjust specifics of the curriculum to their local context (inclusion of disadvantaged children can be a large priority, if it is an issue in that municipality). The cognitive improvements Danish childcare fosters (Esping-Andersen, 2005) are thus available to most children, fostering equality. However, there are coverage problems concentrated around those groups that are most in need of social policies supporting early childhood development. The subsidized childcare fee and voluntary nature of childcare plus the household dependent social assistance and child family allowances has three adverse effects. Firstly, unskilled, ethnic minority groups and other groups where formal childcare is not the norm may choose not to make use of childcare. Secondly, single parents may choose to remain single because the child allowances (and housing allowances) are higher for single parents. Finally, unemployed parents on social assistance (couples or single-person households) may refrain from taking up work because as not only their social assistance but also their housing allowance may be reduced and childcare fees may be increased when they are receiving income from work. Despite this, Danish childcare is a good example of childcare done right in terms of all three policy functions of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019. The \u2018stock\u2019 function for children is well managed via high ECEC expenditure and a lot of individual attention from carers to foster cognitive development. In terms of facilitating \u2018flow\u2019 of women back into the labour market the quality of childcare is complemented by generous parental leave of appropriate length that both mothers and fathers can make use of, as well as by a labour market with both formal and informal norms to ease reconciliation of full-time employment and care for a child. The leave periods are well managed and thus reduce the risk of skill deterioration. Given how preschool spaces are allocated ECEC really helps children from disadvantaged backgrounds to develop at the same pace as their peers, essentially using \u2018stock\u2019 building as a crucial \u2018buffer\u2019 for later in life. This effect manifests itself as extremely low youth poverty rate (figure 6.5, section 6). The fact that childcare is fully subsidized is of course also a great \u2018buffer\u2019 for less well of households, despite the fact that the design of this subsidy might encourage some undesirable behaviour. These carefully designed policy complementarities essentially result in a very low lifetime wage penalty for having children, which fosters relatively high fertility rates and high employment rates. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 91 7.2 Italy As is evident from radar graph in section 4, Italy is a highly compensatory welfare state. Expenses on traditionally \u2018compensatory\u2019 social policies, such as old age and survivor pensions, are significantly higher than the OECD average, whereas expenditure associated with social investment policies, such as education, family policies, or ALMPs, is lower than the OECD average (Nikolai, 2012). These differences are not small; In terms of public expenditure on education, Italy is spending the least out of all the OECD countries (OECD, 2013). From a developmental perspective, the presence of strong extended families and of a familistic culture surely delayed the arrival of public social assistance and family-oriented policies. Italian labour market is also heavily dualised with substantial protection for insiders but disregard for young people and their careers, resulting in one of the highest youth unemployment rates in Europe. Female employment, another crucial social investment statistic, is also lagging behind the EU average. The traditionally compensatory old-age protection biased and fragmented Italian welfare system has surely frustrated the development of policies that combine social investment strategies with strong buffers for people experiencing poverty and social exclusion, leading to the belief that social investment only has a meagre chance to be developed in Italy (Ascoli and Pavolini, 2015). In the early 2000s, the centre-right Berlusconi government privileged a welfare model based on family and community based voluntarism. It drastically cut the fund for social services and family policy and put an end to the experimentation with the minimum insertion income. Subsequently, the short- lived centre-left Prodi cabinet (2006\u20138) also decided not to expand childcare and ALMP, but rather regressively chose to strengthen ordinary unemployment insurance by extending duration and increasing benefits. These setbacks left Italy without provision to combat the \u2018new social risks\u2019 of poverty and social exclusion by the mid 2000s (Hemerijck, 2013). Despite some well-intended initiatives both in terms of childcare and ALMP (especially for the youth), in more recent years, more recent contextual factors (impact of the sovereign debt crisis), institutional factors (insufficient institutional capacity and coordination), and policy factors (in-complementarities in recently adopted measure) have led to increased social risks for large sections of the population \u2013 especially children, lone mothers and the long-term unemployed, typically new social risk groups. 7.2.2 ALMP and Apprenticeship programs In contrast with the sharp increase in expenditure on passive labour market measures since the start of the crisis, expenditure on ALMPs decreased from 0.376% of GDP (2008) to 0.312% (2011) of GPD in Italy \u2013 corresponding to a decline from 84% of the EU average in 2008 to 66% in 2011 (0.448% and 0.471%, respectively) (Jessoula et al., 2015). Although this trend was motivated by the need to protect workers affected by the employment crisis via the provision of unemployment benefits \u2013 expenditure on passive measures as a share of total labour market expenditure increased sharply, from 67% (2008) to 82% (2012) \u2013 it also followed a longer trend towards \u201cless active\u201d labour market policies. The 2013 Jobs Act contains a promising (on paper) provision regarding the introduction of a National Employment Agency in order to align with ALMP, placement services and unemployment benefits. While the main features of the national agency remain under construction, developments in the field of labour market policies in the last decade, and even more so during the crisis, have aimed more at reinforcing the protective compensatory provisions than capacitating social investment provisions. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 92 However, there have been some positive developments in terms of apprenticeships and work-study programs (ALMPs for young adults) and childcare, as on a certain level Italy seems to be taking the right steps: apprenticeship was framed as a key concept of the \u201cYouth Guarantee\u201d for Italy with an increased coverage (increased age limits and extended to high school graduates) (Kazepov & Ranci, forthcoming), which more than doubled the number of apprentices in Italy between 1997 and 2008 (from 250,000 to 650,000) (Isfol-Inps, 2013). Apprenticeship has also become a mixed training contract, combining work and off-company training, even introducing a new type of \u201cadvanced\u201d apprenticeship contracts for highly qualified young adults, thus heavily emphasizing the \u2018stock\u2019 function of apprenticeship and extending it for highly educated workers crucial in the knowledge based economy. Outside of apprenticeships, work-study programs are used by 45.6% of all secondary schools and 8.7% of all secondary students in Italy are participating (Kazepov & Ranci, forthcoming). Yet, Italy is an outlier in figure 6.2 and has extremely high youth unemployment, the reduction of which is the primary focus of these programs. The first incomplementarity becomes apparent when disaggregating relevant data by regions: in Lombardy 85% of schools participated in work-study programs and only 6% of schools in Campania did (Indire, 2013a). This significantly frustrates the effects on youth unemployment, as Southern Italy (where Campania is located) is dealing with higher youth unemployment rates than the northern regions (where Lombardy is located). The second problem appears when considering how apprenticeships were designed. Regional authorities were expected to regulate apprenticeships, but due to lacking institutional capabilities and inability to implement multi-level governance arrangements the reforms failed to address the lack of coordination between education, training, and the labour market (Kazepov & Ranci, 2016). There are now 20 regional regulatory frameworks regulating 200 different apprenticeship contracts (Di Monaco and Pilutti, 2012), making it impossible to provide national-level solutions, leaving the regulatory burden with regional authorities that have already proved inadequate for the job. This problem is worse in the southern regions, further frustrating the effect on youth unemployment. The design of work-study programs also suffers from an insufficient interest and participation of employers. Schools need to build networks with employers and employers\u2019 association in order to provide skills actually useful in the labour market, which they so far fail to do compared to rest of Europe (Kazepov & Ranci, forthcoming). The third problem has to do with the quality of training provisions. In the case of apprenticeships, nearly 50% are interrupted within 3 months, especially for seasonal jobs. Furthermore, more than 80% of all apprentices did not participate in training in 2011 (Villani, 2015), despite the training provision being a crucial part of apprenticeships. These two statistics point to a severe misuse of apprenticeship by employers as a cost-saving measure on labour rather than training and developing the workforce. This results in young adults not receiving the training they need and not acquiring skills necessary for stable employment. The fourth problem is a very obvious Matthew effect: youth unemployment and lack of relevant skills are problems most pronounced in Southern regions of Italy, yet Northern regions participate more in work-study programs, have better regulated apprenticeship contracts and cooperate with employers better to teach more useful skills. This not only frustrates the aggregate policy returns in terms of employment, it also contributes to further dualisation of the labour market and rising inequalities, potentially even creating a \u201clost generation\u201d if youth unemployment remains so high. In terms of general ALMPs, the efforts to support the poorest sections of the population (the so-called incapienti - those who do not receive any benefit from tax deductions, since they do not pay any ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 93 taxes due to low income) have been very limited. The policy agenda of the current Government has further postponed the introduction of a comprehensive framework for national minimum income provision, further harming the prospects of the least well-off (Jessoula et al., 2015), exemplified by Italy\u2019s sub-optimal performance in terms of ALMPs and poverty (figure 6.4, section 6). Considering these problems, the overall evaluation indicates that Italy has been unable to adopt a coherent approach to social investment. Accordingly, at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion rates (total and for children), employment rates (total and female) and unemployment rates (total and for young adults below 25 years) and the share of LTU \u2013 Italy ranks consistently among the ten worst performers in the EU (Bouget et al., 2015; Jessoula et al., 2015). Work-study and apprenticeship programs have suboptimal returns on all three policy functions of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019: \u2018stocks\u2019 are frustrated due to lack of training and the relevance of the skills taught, \u2018flows\u2019 are frustrated due to lacking cooperation with employers and the failure to address education/labour market mismatch, and \u2018buffers\u2019 are frustrated as the poorest regions with highest youth unemployment benefit the least in terms of securing employment and the additional household income that comes with it. The overall idea of these programs is to improve \u2018flow\u2019 by improving relevant \u2018stocks\u2019 and facilitating cooperation between schools and employers. Given that the \u2018stock\u2019 building function fails on both accounts, the improvements of \u2018flow\u2019 typical for ALMPs will be heavily dampened. 7.2.2 Childcare On a certain level one would not expect Italy to be an outlier in terms of returns of childcare policies per se: despite investing in childcare later than other European nations, Italy has doubled its childcare coverage over the last two decades (Istat, 2013) and maintained the trend of increasing coverage in some regions despite the crippling budget cuts to municipalities brought about by the recent austerity measures. Furthermore, the returns of childcare both in terms of facilitating the \u2018flow\u2019 of mothers back into employment and building up the human capital \u2018stock\u2019 seem to apply to Italy as well: attending ECEC before turning four significantly increases individual educational performance in high school and in university (Del Boca, et al., 2012) and increasing the coverage rate of childcare by 10% at the national level is estimated to result in a 13% increase of mothers\u2019 employment rate (Brilli, et al., 2011). However, figure 6.3 in section 6 shows Italy to have unusually low returns on childcare. There are number of problems of institutional origins which explain the poor economic leverage of family and child policy. The first problem appears when the increasing coverage is disaggregated from national to regional level. The increase in childcare coverage is much larger in Northern Italy, especially in urban areas: coverage increased by 15% in Rome compared to only 3% in Naples for the same time period, and the overall financial investment increased by 27% in Rome, contrasting with the modest increase of 9% in Naples (Cerea, et. al., 2015). The divide between Northern and Southern regions of Italy in terms of wealth is a well-documented factor deeply rooted in history and of crucial importance for policy design. If the increase in childcare coverage continues to be so drastically different across regions, the divide will be further reinforced, especially considering that the actual coverage rate is already more than five times higher in Milan than in Naples (31% and 6% respectively) (Cerea, et. al., 2015). The second problem can be observed when looking at the drivers of the increase in childcare coverage. The increase of publically managed childcare places has been very modest compared to a large increase in the privately provided childcare places (Ranci ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 94 and Sabatinelli, 2014). Given that even these privately managed childcare places are publically funded, affordability is not necessarily the main problem the privatization causes. The objective of privatization was to lower labour costs, which is not possible in the public sector due to the fact that \u2018national\u2019 contracts provide good salary and employment security. By contrast, contracts from private childcare providers can offer lower wages and less secure employment arrangement such as fixed term contracts (Kazepov & Ranci, forthcoming). However, decreasing labour costs in this way deters the most skilled teachers (who can find employment elsewhere) and thus contributes to decreasing the quality of ECEC in general, dampening its \u2018stock\u2019 building capabilities. The third problem, which cannot be deduced from expenditure data, has to do with working mothers given priority when allocating childcare places. Based on a research from 101 big Italian cities, mothers who are permanently employed are given priority in almost all municipalities (Pavolini & Arlotti, 2015). Unemployed mothers are accepted in 78% of municipalities, temporary employed in 36% and inactive in 30%, all paling in comparison with the close to 100% acceptance for permanently employed mothers. This obviously dampens the effect of childcare on female employment, as mothers who cannot access childcare will not benefit from it in terms of being able to enter the labour market. Essentially, to foster female employment childcare needs to be good, affordable, and accessible and in this case there are enormous problems of access skewed in favor of those who are already employed. The fourth problem is the lack of coordination and a coherent policy direction. There are many different ways to receive support in terms of ECEC in Italy: centre-based services such as cr\u00e8ches, nurseries and pre- kindergarten services (nido di infanzia, scuola dell\u2019infanzia, sezioni primavera); home- based services such as family day care and child- minders (asilo familiare, tagesmutter); tax relief for children under 3 years of age; vouchers provided by several regional and local authorities; vouchers introduced in 2012 at a national level in parallel with maternity and parental leave (Jessoula, 2015). However, these benefits are not well institutionally aligned with other policy provisions, resulting from fragmented legislation and scant coordination between institutional levels and between financial funds. In addition, not only has the sector traditionally been underfunded, recent developments further reduced financing. More importantly, there are crucial complementarities absent, such as no adequate leave provisions that would foster gender equality in parenting roles, or insufficient assistance to provide long-term care for frail relatives and allow their children to not leave the labour market. There have been efforts to remedy these in-complementarities, such supporting more balanced parenting roles, greater sharing of childcare duties, and a more balanced relationship between work and family life. However, this shift in priority was accompanied by a decreased funding between 2008 and 2014. The one worthwhile increase in funding was to family support, but this increase included mainly cash transfers and not services. The final problem is the Matthew effect resulting from the reason mentioned above. In this case the effect cannot be more obvious (identifiable in figure 6.5, section 6): childcare favors mothers who are already employed (have better and more stable income), live in cities (wealthier than rural areas), and in the Northern regions of Italy (wealthier than the Southern regions). In sum, predominantly due institutional problems, Italian childcare harbors suboptimal returns in terms of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019: the returns in terms of \u2018stocks\u2019 are frustrated by the reduced quality resulting from privatization and worse employment contracts, the returns in terms of \u2018flow\u2019 are frustrated as the mothers\u2019 who need to re- enter the labour market are disadvantaged in favour of those who are already there, and ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 95 the returns in terms of \u2018buffers\u2019 are frustrated as poverty is unlikely to decrease due to unemployed mothers not securing the necessary household income. 7.3 Germany It is often argued that Germany as the \u2018archetypical\u2019 male-breadwinner Bismarckian welfare state would face an uphill battle in pursuit of social investment recalibration (Palier and Thelen, 2010). There are two reasons for this. In the first place, the traditionally passive, employment-based, male-breadwinner German welfare regime is programmatically ill-equipped to effectively respond to the \u2018new\u2019 social risks of social segmentation, skill erosion, and structural poverty dynamics in the knowledge-based economy and society (Esping-Andersen, 1999). Secondly, there are political-institutional constraints to adoption of a coherent social investment profile: there exists a large array of veto players, notably trade union and employer organizations, who tend to use their privileged status in social policy administration to block path-shifting reform proposals geared towards helping \u2018new outsider\u2019 risk categories of children and youngsters, the less-skilled, working mothers and lone parents. Despite holding onto insider-biased labour market regulation for most of the 1980s and 1990s, since the early 2000s social investment policy innovation in the areas of (active) labour market policy, skill formation, and childcare and family services has gained considerable currency in Germany. As evident from section 6, Germany is no longer a purely passive compensatory welfare state. Traditionally \u2018compensatory\u2019 expenditure does remain high, but expenditure associated with social investment policies, such as family policies, or ALMPs, have seen a significant increase. This makes Germany a very special case with a policy mix of distinctly Bismarckian origin, but with social investment elements that are pronounced enough to position Germany as a middle-of-the road performer with regards to social investment returns both for ALMPs (figure 6.2, section 6) and Childcare (figure 6.3, section 6). In both Italy and Denmark historical and institutional context is largely unchanged (despite attempts on the Italian front) and largely explains the unusually low or high returns for both cases. This is not the case in Germany, as there has been a path-breaking change in welfare provisions, warranting a more historically oriented approach in an attempt to understand this change. Below we zoom in, on the dual earner family policy innovation and the evolution of active labour market policies since the Hartz-reforms. 7.3.1 Labour market policy and the Hartz reforms In terms of Labour Market policy, the defining developments are certainly the Hartz reforms. The 1998 federal elections brought to power the first Red-Green coalition under the helm of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, which seized the moment of a political scandal (Federal Agency for Work publishing misleading statistics) to appoint an expert commission led by the then Volkswagen head of human resources, Peter Hartz. In its final report, the Hartz Commission recommended an overhaul of the German social insurance system and the governance of the German Public Employment Service with the aim of creating a single \u2018unified gateway\u2019 for all unemployed and job-seeking persons in Germany (Weishaupt, 2010). The following so-called Hartz reforms (2002\u20135) constituted a definite break with the traditional Continental social insurance legacy of high benefit dependency, low employment, reluctant activation, and truncated flexibilization (Seeleib-Kaiser and Fleckenstein, 2007). The reforms focused very heavily on \u2018flow\u2019 of workers, a result that they ultimately achieved, but at the cost of some crucial policy complementarities. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 96 Under the Hartz I and II reforms of 2002, \u2018flow\u2019 restrictions on fixed-term contracts were eased and temporary work agency further liberalized so as to expand job placement via commercial work agencies. To foster even more employment flow a new direct low-wage job-creation program included public employment opportunities through so-called One- Euro-Jobs, which provide additional income of \u20ac1.00 to \u20ac2.00 per hour, in combination with full benefits. Essentially employment was helped by both the private and the public sectors, even if at the expense of decent wages and job security. This emphasis on reducing unemployment was helped by new \u2018in-work benefits\u2019, applicable to, as one might expect, those who are employed. More importantly, The Hartz IV reform merged the provisions of unemployment assistance for the long-term unemployed and social assistance for those in need without an employment record into a new, tax-financed, Unemployment Benefit II (Arbeitslosengeld II [ALG-2]) to complemented the more traditional unemployment insurance provision, termed \u2018Unemployment Benefit I\u2019 (Arbeitslosengeld I [ALG-1]). In the same instance, the duration of unemployment insurance payments was reduced from 32 to 12 months (18 months for older workers), to provide even more incentive for individuals to seek employment. The effect of merging unemployment assistance and local social assistance provisions was further complemented by tight eligibility criteria and strong activation requirements for all long-term unemployed (Hinrichs, 2010), effectively making even social assistance contingent on seeking employment or at least \u2018activation\u2019. The responsibility for ALG-2 and the vast majority of jobseekers, was transferred to newly created job centers (Fleckenstein, 2008; Knuth, 2009). Eventually a layered social protection system emerged, combining Bismarckian social insurance for core workers, supplemented by Beveridgean minimum income protection \u2018buffers\u2019 (Eichhorst et al., 2008). Hereby traditional limitations of social insurance coverage for new social risk groups were compensated by way of strengthening universal, citizenship-based provisions of social protection. An even more important effect of these job centres, which was not entirely intended, is the freedom they have in designing local and regional programs, where quantified goals are in place, but they are defined through mutual consultation and learning between different job centres (Sabel, et. al. forthcoming). This has led to some very effective programs, such as the Perspective 50plus program, which helps older workers find employment, and aids an increasing percentage of these workers to find employment at decreasing costs (Sabel, et. al. forthcoming). This is an important policy complementarity to increasing the retirement age, a measure that without effective employment assistance could lead to increasing unemployment of this vulnerable group of older workers and thus increasing their risk of poverty, especially given the tight eligibility criteria for Unemployment Benefit I. However, there is still the policy in-complementarity of long-term unemployed and former atypical workers, who cannot meet the new eligibility criteria of Unemployment Benefit II, now relying on a means-tested benefit, risking reproducing rather than mitigating dualization drift dynamics (Seeleib-Kaiser et al. 2012). Since the Hartz reforms do not boast a strong ALMP component that would assist long-term unemployed with entering the labour market outside of local programs of job centres, there is the risk that providing only incentives will not be enough. Concluding on the Hartz reforms in terms of \u2018stocks\u2019, \u2018flows\u2019, and \u2018buffers\u2019 is a difficult task, as they were by no means a social investment reform. In terms of flow the reforms were a success, as the unemployment decrease to lowest levels since re-unification following a 2012 increase in demand for German exports was attributed to the \u2018flow\u2019 facilitated by multiple complementary incentives to find employment introduced in the Hartz reforms. Furthermore, more fixed-term employment and even small jobs with low ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 97 wage arguably helped the German workforce to survive the crisis without going through long spells of unemployment, leading to skill erosion and reducing \u2018stocks\u2019. Given that education was spared the ruthless budget-balancing cuts pursued by both grand coalitions, \u2018stocks\u2019 were most likely improved, or at least maintained. Perhaps most importantly, there is an undeniable shift in policy objectives from keeping overt unemployment down by channelling (less productive) workers into social security programs, to maximizing the rate of employment as the single most important policy goal, which is a shift in line with social investment. However, the policy complementarity left behind is that of sufficient \u2018buffers\u2019: despite the fact that providing some jobs (even though of lesser quality) during a crisis is in itself a \u2018buffer\u2019 through securing additional household income, the Matthew effects of the Hartz reforms are rampant. The reform has further \u2018dualising\u2019 consequences, such as low pay and increased precariousness in the subsidized low-wage service sector employment through One-Euro-Jobs, Minijobs and Midijobs. The skewed protection between core employees and \u2018atypical\u2019 workers in German labour market and social security system means that employment came at the price of poverty rate among the unemployed, which are now highest in the EU (Hanesch et al., 2015) and sharply increasing income inequality (Palier and Thelen, 2010). As was the case with childcare, should we leave policy outcomes aside Germany has showed an extraordinary shift from insiders to outsiders (by normalizing \u2018flexible work\u2019 arrangements) and from a fragmented system of social protection to having social insurance and assistance and labour market policies under one institutional roof in so-called \u2018one-stop centres\u2019. Such changes might, in due time, remove the programmatic insufficiencies that make a fully-fledged social investment reform in Germany so difficult. 7.3.2 Dual earner family policy Quite surprisingly, employment-oriented family policy change gathered momentum with the return to power of Christian Democracy, the political party historically most wedded to traditional \u2018female homemaker family policy\u2019. The 2005 Grand Coalition of CDU/CSU and the SPD, under Angela Merkel, started building up the necessary policy complementarities to facilitate high returns for family policy. The first necessary change was the expansion of (public) childcare facilities for toddlers between the age of one and three. Ursula von der Leyen (Christian Democratic Minister for Family, Seniors, Women, and Youth Affairs) committed the Grand Coalition to rapidly expand childcare facilities to 750,000 places by 2013 with a subsidy of \u20ac4 billion (covering one-third of the costs) which now covers 35% of all children under three years of age. Since then, every child above the age of one is entitled to publicly provided or subsidized childcare (Fleckenstein, 2011). To complement the commitment to healthcare as a legal entitlement, a new parental allowance came into force in 2007, modeled after the Swedish experience, granting parents 67 per cent of their previous wage for twelve months in a much more gender- neutral provision, fostering financial security for young parents, gender equality, and encouraging higher levels of labour force participation of mothers. Building on this momentum the 2015 Act for a Better Reconciliation of Family, Care and Work\u2019 introduces a legal entitlement to reduced and flexible working hours up to 24 months, with guaranteed return to work and a compensation of income loss during care-leave or part- time work. This development was also internalized on a local level, as growing number of municipalities embarked on the development of local action plans for the promotion of child and family wellbeing (Korthouwer, 2010). Parental benefits and childcare provisions ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 98 are continuously expanding, signalling a tipping point of social investment to no return (Seeleib-Kaiser 2010). However, there are also missing policy complementarities in the German social investment oriented family policy turn. Parallel to the introduction of the legal right to early childhood education and care for every child between one and three years of age, a so-called \u201cat-home-care allowance\u201d ( Betreuungsgeld ) was introduced in 2012 for parents wishing to renounce their right to day-care. The primary problem with this measure is that it frustrates the positive effect on female employment, as this allowance can be seen as an incentive to stay at home. The secondary, but not less important, problem is the Matthew effect this intervention created: low-education and low-income parents, or parents with a migration background tend to vouch for passive cash-payment to improve their precarious family income situations, thereby abstaining from childcare and frustrating early childhood social and cognitive development a good quality childcare can have (Bonin et al., 2013; Hanesch, 2013). All in all, despite the fact that Von der Leyen advocated the German family U-turn on a typical social investment platform highlighting the inclusive benefits to female employment, fertility, and human capital formation, the change in German family policy triggered a rather skewed effect in favor of higher educated mothers who disproportionately benefit as a consequence of the extension of child care and parental leave, in comparison to less educated and low-income mothers, who prefer to rely on passive child benefits and at-home-care allowances (Schutter and Zerle-Elaeser, 2012; Morgan 2013; H\u00e4usermann and Zollinger 2016). On the other hand, not all is lost, as there was a an impressive growth of childcare capacity and quality, which does facilitate improvements in the \u2018stock\u2019 of human capital, and in conjunction with more gender-equal parental leave arrangements gives women more incentives to have a child (increasing the fertility rate), through the promise of good leave \u2018buffers\u2019 and easy \u2018flow\u2019 back into the labour market on the back of guaranteed return to work. The overall effect on employment \u2018flow\u2019 of working parents, especially mothers, has been positive, even though it was frustrated by an inappropriate skew towards highly skilled mothers who are more likely to be employed in the first place. What is important to note, leaving policy outcomes aside, is that Germany seems to have shrugged off its Christian conservative female home-maker policy legacy, opening up the doors for a much more explicit social investment reform later down the line. Section 8: Triangulation The final component of our illustration concerns the triangulation exercise of bringing the different methodological layers \u2013 the quantitative-micro, the quantitative-macro, and the qualitative-institutional levels of the methodology \u2013 together in a composite conclusion on social investment returns arising from the examples of ALMP and Early-childhood policy and their interaction effects. This requires honest attention to both concordant and discordant findings across the three levels of analysis. Such findings should ultimately feed into new lines of empirical inquiry, data gathering, and methodological improvement. Surely the most prominent concordant finding is that we observe strong interaction effects between ALMP and Child-development and family policy; also when it comes to other welfare provisions. In more substantive terms the overarching finding is that social investment, as illustrated by ALMP and ECEC provisions, supports both employment and productivity growth, thereby significantly contributing to the welfare state\u2019s \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d. ALMP is perhaps the most powerful mechanism for increasing employment ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 99 from our examples, but Early-child education also seemingly contributes to employment. In addition, the quantitative-micro analysis suggests that the relationship between early- childhood spending and employment rates becomes more positive as a country\u2019s social security \u2018buffers\u2019 become more generous. Another important interaction effect unearthed by our methodology is that employment-retarding effects of social security transfers are dampened by assertive early-childhood education provisions. The macro-quantitative analysis moreover suggests that the relationship between ALMP and female employment rate is particularly strong, corroborating the quantitative evidence of positive institutional complementarities between activating labour market policies and dual-earner family friendly work-life balance policies. What is perhaps most surprising is that ALMP seemingly contributes to fighting individual poverty for vulnerable groups both directly and indirectly. Early-child education spending has more ambiguous and sometimes poverty-enhancing effects. These results are in important ways contingent on the availability of generous (but activating) social safety net buffers. The interaction effects between ALMP and Early Childhood-development and the broader contours of national welfare states vary substantially across countries. However, the general picture is that the two examples of social investment tend to work best where total social expenditures are more generous. Next, the upshot is more subdued Matthew Effects. In other words, total social expenditures tend to strongly reduce the risk of poverty among respondents in settings of assertive ALMP and Early-child education. Or, in other words, ALMP and Early-child education might strengthen the poverty-reducing buffer functions of prevailing social safety nets. Our quantitative-macro analysis in fact suggests that the poverty-fighting effects of early-childhood education are just as strong as social transfers. On the other hand, our quantitative exploration of the data, both at the micro- and macro-level, also suggest less salutary interactions, whereby social investment provisions in interaction with existing welfare policy folios cancel each other out to produce adverse \u2018Matthew-effects\u2019. Whether under such conditions social investment policies work cross purposes, or whether social investment policy innovation is undermined by existing patterns of labour regulation or the selectivity of social insurances buffers, can only be answered by qualitative institutional analysis and an in-depth empirical exploration of interaction effects between traditional social policy transfers and social investment reforms, together with the institutional complementarities and tensions between different faces of social investment. The country-cases chosen for such in-depth qualitative institutional analysis are chosen on the basis of their perverse, mediocre and superior social investment performance in the quantitative analysis, for purposes of corroboration and explanation of divergent performance. The examples of Denmark, Italy and Germany all aptly illustrate the empirical presence of positive and negative synergy effects, promises, pitfalls, institutional complementarities and ambiguities that social investment policy experiences face. Both the micro-data and macro-data provide a useful balance of rigor and relevance, with plenty of relevance for policy thinking and analysis, but they lack in understanding of institutional context that so often trumps the best policy intentions. Quantitative gains in rigor go at the expense of institutional relevance. These limitations therefore require correction by adding the third layer of qualitative- institutional research to our methodology. From the in-depth country comparison of Denmark, Italy and Germany, it follows that where ALMP and Early-childhood education are institutionally intimately aligned they indeed foster better performance in employment, productivity and poverty, as the Danish case exemplifies. By contrast, Italy appears as extreme case of institutional fragmentation with no cross-purpose policy coordination, rampant unemployment, stagnant productivity and perverse Matthew Effects. With respect to Germany the picture ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 100 is better in terms of real social investment policy progress and returns, but with important institutional ambiguities that are associated with fairly high levels of labour market dualisation. A singular focus on passive social protection, dismissing social investment, produces less employment with lower rates of economic growth and perhaps even greater income polarization, as the Italian case exemplifies. By supporting our theoretical conceptualization and operationalization of social investment in terms of the complementary policy function with quantitative and qualitative insights, our triangulation exercise on ALMP and Childcare and Family Policy warrants a refutation of a number of commonly accepted theorems about the relationship between social policy, employment, labour market productivity and growth, inequality and poverty. Our three-layered analysis places Iversen and Wren\u2019s (1998) trilemma of the service sector economy, theoretically rooted in Baumol cost disease, suggesting that (public) service sector jobs engender no positive effects on long-term productivity, employment and competitiveness, whilst maintaining basic minimum income protection, in a different light. Many mechanisms are at play, as we highlight above, through which employment and productivity growth can be achieved by social investment policies operating in sync with generous social protection. Human capital investment, as the Danish and German experiences reveal, raises employment and improves productivity in both the private and public sectors, whereby the costs of public daycare are essentially reimbursed by working mothers via higher tax payments and social contributions throughout their working lives. By the same token, as daycare minimizes maternal employment interruption, cumulative lifetime earnings increase, implying higher future tax revenues (Esping-Andersen and Sarasa, 2002). This goes to show that the \u2018service sector trilemma\u2019 can indeed be surmounted by investment in human capital \u2018stock\u2019 and improved easing of gender-sensitive labour market \u2018flow\u2019. We have also been able to show in sections 6 and 7 that social investments in the areas of ALMP and Child Policy, using readily available statistical data, plausibly raise levels of male and female employment participation, and, more indirectly, support higher productivity growth and fertility trends, thereby enlarging the long-term fiscal capacities of active welfare states. Evidence that generous welfare provision with relatively low levels of poverty can be maintained in a globalized economy suggests ways to overcome the trade-off of social equity and economic efficiency and the service sector trilemma. Public services have a positive role to play here, which places the Baumol cost predicament in a different light. Tony Atkinson gives the obvious example of public health care. Even if surgery is publicly financed, timely intervention allows an incapacitated worker to go back to work sooner, thereby creating extra output at less cost. The same indirect logic from public investments to private returns applies to parenting services and active labour market policy intervention (Atkinson, 2015: 121). In the final analysis, Matthew Effects, labour market dualisation, the Baumol cost disease, and by implication the service sector trilemma are not predetermined: they are empirical variables, not givens. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 101 Conclusions and recommendations The central ambition of ASIS has been to articulate a theoretically-informed methodology for measuring the promise and pitfalls \u2013 and social and economic \u2018returns\u2019 \u2013 of social investment provisions for various measures of socioeconomic wellbeing. Doing so, we have argued, is difficult because the complexities and ambiguities in the debate about social investment and its implications \u2013 more than with respect to other (more directly redistributive) social policy provisions and outcomes \u2013 give rise to a major dilemma of rigor and relevance. Our proposed approach is a layered and pluralist one that combines and compares different kinds of data and evidence that constitute different solutions to that dilemma. Each piece of information consulted constitutes, individually, imperfect \u2018solution\u2019 to the rigor-relevance dilemma, but taken-together those different parts can be combined to substantially resolve this dilemma. Our particular method for doing so, developed in section 4.3, involves triangulation of three levels of analysis and three broad pathways that we believe clarify the relationship between a given aspect or combination of \u2018social investment\u2019 and a given aspect or combination of wellbeing. The different levels of analysis are quantitative-micro analysis of individual socioeconomic experience; quantitative-macro analysis of country-year socioeconomic experience; and qualitative-institutional analysis of selected national and regional experience. Our method states that the same aspects of social investment and of wellbeing ought to be analysed through the distinct lenses of all three levels of analysis. All three levels of analysis entail observational empirical research, but each level provides distinct inferential leverage, each of which includes room for a broad range of particular methods to develop descriptive and causal inferences about the returns of social investment. Our method also states that the pursuit of each of these levels of analysis ought to explicitly consider three pathways through which social investment can be expected to influence socioeconomic wellbeing: (1) direct and indirect pathways that correlate and process-trace how social investment relates to wellbeing; (2) moderated pathways that consider institutional complementarities or conflicts between social investment on the one hand and broader social transfers and institutions on the other; and (3) moderated pathways considering institutional complementarities or conflicts among different faces of social investment. And our method gives explicit attention to all such pathways, in all levels of analysis, to the possibly disparate experiences of an entire population and particular groups within a population \u2013 such as women, youth and vulnerable older demographics. Key to our ASIS methodology, finally, is that the three levels of analysis be triangulated in a meta-analysis that recognizes and tries to explain the concordant and discordant results across the quantitative-micro, quantitative-macro and qualitative-institutional analyses. Our extended empirical illustration in Part II (sections 5-8) has sought to give a taste of the inferential power of this methodology. Our focus on ALMP and on Early-childhood education, and on employment and poverty as outcomes, has hopefully provided multiple examples of how each level of analysis gleans information crucial to judging the returns to social investment, and how the levels together yield a portrait of the whole of such returns that are greater than the sum of the three parts. In a nutshell, we see ample reasons, even in this very circumscribed illustration, to believe that social investment approach to welfare reform offers strong promise and modest pitfalls \u2013 though we also see plenty of nuance and discordant evidence to clarify risks of social investment. By way of conclusion, we would like to very briefly consider a few of the most important limitations of our study and methodology, and offer concrete recommendations to the ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 102 Commission for the application and further development of a methodology for measuring the returns, promise and pitfalls of social investment. Qualifications to our ASIS methodology Our favored methodology and the particular illustrations have some important limits that we want to highlight. One set of limitations involves our measures of \u2018social investment\u2019. It is obvious that any given implementation, as in our illustration, will focus on a limited set of aspects or combinations of social investment reforms. For us that was a particular agglomeration of labour-market policies associated with activation and retraining (i.e. ALMP) and a particular agglomeration of education and childcare subsidies associated with the development and supervision of children (i.e. ECEC). There are a great many others that might be more urgent and of keener interest \u2013 such as long-term care, lifelong education provisions, and administrative regulations that facilitate particular bundling or combination of \u2018capacitating\u2019 social services. An obvious candidate for further investigation concerns skill development and vocational training (as measured by PISA, ISCED and PIAAC outcomes) as educational attainment seemingly is an extremely salient return of social investment. A more qualitative institutional analysis is perhaps warranted to analyse the \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 between maternity/parental leave arrangements and early childhood education programs, which we have merely touched upon above. One might also be interested in more agglomerated \u2018thick\u2019 conceptions of such policies (e.g. all labour market activation; lifelong education-related provisions, or a composite \u2018social investment index\u2019), or conversely much more discrete, disaggregated \u2018thin\u2019 conceptions (e.g. just the training provisions of ALMP, or the education services). More importantly, one might be more interested in non-spending measures of social investment \u2013 such as attempts to measure replacement rates, access and benefit duration that inform measures of \u2018generosity\u2019 of various aspects of social policies (e.g. Scruggs 2012). Another set of limitations involves the particular bundling and conceptions of outcomes. Our emphasis has been on intermediary steps in economic wellbeing, such as employment, income and poverty that we know to be crucial metrics of wellbeing but also inputs into more aggregated and downstream conceptions of economic wellbeing \u2013 such as labour productivity, total factor productivity or economic growth. This raises an important inferential question of how and to what extent such intermediary steps really do aggregate to more end-point measures of wellbeing. And just as important, relevant economic conceptions of wellbeing might need to be analysed with respect to other cleavages within a socio-economy \u2013 not just the distinctions illustrated (general, female, youth, and older working-age population) but also many others that matter to any fair analysis of returns (e.g. minority or migrant groups or vulnerable sub-national regional groupings). Finally, we should care about socioeconomic wellbeing measures that include distributional issues, such as inequality, and that include social conceptions of wellbeing, such as health, psychological and subjective-happiness indicators. A final crucial set of limitations involve particular methods of analysis within and between given levels of analysis and pathways connecting social investment and wellbeing in these levels of analysis. Our existing analysis and recommendations have been very open to different estimators and statistical techniques, within the limits of observational research. Our illustration has chosen well-known and relatively simple \u2018workhorse\u2019 estimators and methods to carry out parallel quantitative-micro, quantitative-macro and qualitative institutional analyses. But one can imagine many other specifications or alternatives, and we would like to see consideration of methods that include ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 103 computationally more intense and difficult-to-design quasi-experimental methods looking at the same data. More importantly, our laid-out and illustrated ASIS methodology has discussed but has not pushed for a particular way in which we can link and aggregate the levels of analysis. For instance, one can imagine developing particular algorithms for aggregating the quantitative-micro findings to the country-year level, with multipliers that yield inferences for more downstream outcomes related to economic growth and productivity. Most importantly, our analysis has been constrained by data limitations that prevent exploration of more long-term implications of social investment for wellbeing. Our presumption is that the real returns to a given face of social investment for such wellbeing might only show up after many years, even generations of take-up and experience with various clusters of social investment reforms. And we would like to be able to explore this possibility, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Within all such limitations, however, our contention is that the ASIS methodology, as articulated and illustrated, provides powerful leverage to better understand the returns to social investment in Europe. In our own analysis this has already undergirded some descriptive and causal inferences about such (largely positive) returns. But the more important point to take away from our analysis is that we have a particular instrument for analysing social investment that can be reproduced and scaled up or down to inform policy analysis of any given aspect or combination of social investment, and any given aspect or clustering of measures of economic or social wellbeing. Recommendations This brings us to two concrete recommendations that we offer to the Commission to best apply and extend the analysis and methodology summarized in this report. First, we recommend that the Commission actually use and (re-apply) our ASIS methodology as an instrument for thinking about and debating the promise and pitfalls of social investment. This means considering a given aspect or cluster of social investment and cluster or aspect of wellbeing, and then carrying-out the full-fledged three-level \u2018mixed- method\u2019 analysis and their triangulation, with attention to the three pathways by which social investment can be expected to influence wellbeing. We have tried to make such an instrument accessible by using well known and regularly updated Eurostat and OECD micro- and macro-datasets on social investment provisions and various features of wellbeing. And we have also chosen to use easily reproducible and scalable methods of qualitative institutional analysis. Second, we recommend that the Commission gather new and (in our judgment) better data on social investment provisions and on their take-up and downstream socioeconomic outcomes. As our discussions throughout this report already suggested, there are many empirical gaps in the data that we need to understand and overcome in investigating various aspects of social investment. To give but one example, we know that there are too few standardized measures of spending and effort on parental leave and childcare provisions. There are fewer measures of the generosity of various social investment regulatory measures that allow us to go beyond spending-based operationalization of \u2018effort\u2019. Most scarce are good indicators of labour market \u2018flow\u2019 over the life course. As our discussion has also made clear, there is an equal urgency to gather all existing data measures relevant to social investment and outcomes to more countries and, particularly, years to allow a fuller analysis of the short- and long-term implications of social investment for economic wellbeing. The Commission can request, help finance or perhaps itself provide, such coverage to earlier decades \u2013 where we often see data extending-back no earlier than the early 2000s or, at best, the 1980s. ",
        "Assessing Social Investment Synergies 104 Finally, we recommend that the new data not only involve new and better measures of social investment, and of better coverage over time and space, but also of fuller qualitative information of actual use or take-up of particular and interdependent and thus interacting social investment provisions. This is particularly important to understand whether a particular face of such provisions make a difference for economic wellbeing \u2013 given the many inferential threats that threaten rigor, such as selection-into treatment and endogeneity. One of the best ways to address such issues is to have and analyse data with detailed information on groups before, during and after the provision of some policy, including information on the incidence and extent of receiving or participating in benefit programs. As we have made clear above, implementation of our ASIS methodology can involve use of the occasional dataset that provides such tracking and take-up. But we know that this is often tiered to very narrow slices of policy that might be relevant to the social investment debate (hence the relevance trade-off of achieved rigor). Our recommendation is that the Commission begins to systematically include such data where that is possible. This might involve an entirely new data instrumentarium for various aspects of social policy programs, (co-)financed and carried out by Eurostat or national statistical bodies. But an easier fix might be to expand the EU-SILC data instrument to include more information on respondents\u2019 detailed experiences with social policy benefits or receipt of monies relevant to the various programs we associate with social investment.
