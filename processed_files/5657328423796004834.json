RECALLS the Europe 2020 Strategy's Flagship Initiative \u2018European Platform against Poverty\u2019, which states that on almost every account people with mental health problems are among the most excluded groups in society and they consistently identify stigmatisation, discrimination and exclusion as major barriers to health, welfare and quality of life; 7. RECALLS the Europe 2020 Strategy's Flagship Initiative \u2018An agenda for new skills and jobs\u2019 and the Communication from the Commission on a European contribution towards full employment ( 1 ), which states that in order to raise employment rates substantially workers' physical and mental health need also to be taken into account to address the demands of today's working careers, which are characterised by more transitions between more intense and demanding jobs and by new forms of work organisation; 8. RECALLS the Conference \u2018Discovery research in neur\u00ad opsychiatry: depression, anxiety and schizophrenia in focus\u2019 held in Budapest on 18-19 March 2011; 9. RECOGNISES that mental well-being is an essential constituent of health and quality of life, and a prerequisite for the ability to learn, work and contribute to social life; 10. RECOGNISES that according to recent research evidence a high level of mental health and well-being of the popu\u00ad lation is an important factor for the economy, and that mental disorders lead to economic loss for instance through lower business productivity, lower participation in employment, and costs to individuals, families, and communities dealing with mental disorders; EN 8.7.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 202/1 ( 1 ) COM(2010) 682 final.

        "11. RECOGNISES that mental disorders are disabling and represent the greatest share of disability-adjusted life years in the EU, depression and anxiety being the leading causes of that burden; 12. RECOGNISES that according to WHO-estimations, mental disorders affect every fourth citizen at least once during their life and can be found in more than 10 % of the EU population during any given year; 13. RECOGNISES that suicide remains a significant cause of premature death in Europe, with over 50 000 deaths a year in the EU, and that in nine out of ten cases it is preceded by the development of mental disorders; 14. RECOGNISES that considerable inequalities in mental health status exist between Member States and within Member States and also between social groups of which socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are the most vulnerable; 15. RECOGNISES that the determinants of mental health and well-being, such as social exclusion, poverty, unem\u00ad ployment, poor housing and bad working conditions, problems in education, child abuse, neglect and maltreatment, gender inequalities as well as risk factors such as alcohol and drug abuse are multifactorial, and can often be found outside health systems, and that therefore improving mental health and well-being in the population requires innovative partnerships between the health sector and other sectors such as social affairs, housing, employment and education; 16. RECOGNISES the importance of educational institutions and workplaces as settings for actions in the field of mental health and well-being, as well as the benefits they can gain from such actions for their own objectives; 17. RECOGNISES that authorities and other actors at regional and local levels play a key role in action for mental health and well-being, both as agents for improving mental well- being in their own right, and as promoters of participation from other sectors and communities; 18. RECOGNISES that users of mental health services and their family members, carers as well as their organisations have a specific and valuable expertise to contribute and should be involved in policy action on mental health and well- being; 19. RECOGNISES the need for research on mental health and well-being and mental disorders and WELCOMES the contribution that EU Research Framework Programmes have made to this; 20. WELCOMES the results of the five thematic conferences organised under the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-Being as follows ( 1 ): \u2014 the Conference on \u2018Promotion of Mental Health and Well-being of Children and Young People \u2014 Making it Happen\u2019 held in Stockholm on 29-30 September 2009, \u2014 the Conference on \u2018Prevention of Depression and Suicide \u2014 Making it Happen\u2019 held in Budapest on 10-11 December 2009, \u2014 the Conference on \u2018Mental Health and Well-Being in Older People \u2014 Making it Happen\u2019 held in Madrid 28-29 June 2010, \u2014 the Conference on \u2018Promoting Social Inclusion and Combating Stigma for Better Mental Health and Well- being\u2019 held in Lisbon on 8-9 November 2010, \u2014 the Conference on \u2018Promoting Mental Health and Well- being at Workplaces\u2019 held in Berlin on 3-4 March 2011. 21.

        "Council conclusions on childhood immunisation: successes and challenges of European childhood immunisation and the way forward (2011/C 202/02) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION 1. RECALLS that under Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Union action is to complement national policies and be directed towards improving public health by covering in particular the fight against the major health scourges; it is also to encourage cooperation between the Member States in the field of public health and, if necessary, lend support to their action, and respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care; 2. RECALLS that under Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Member States, in liaison with the Commission, are to coordinate among themselves their policies and programmes; 3. RECALLS Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 setting up a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community ( 1 ), which requires timely scientific analysis in order for effective Community action to be undertaken; 4. RECALLS Regulation (EC) No 851/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 estab\u00ad lishing a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( 2 ), which supports existing activities, such as relevant Community action programmes in the public health sector, with regard to the prevention and control of communicable diseases, epidemiological surveillance, training programmes and early warning and response mechanisms, and should foster the exchange of best practices and experience with regard to vaccination programmes; 5. RECOGNISES that while childhood immunisation is the responsibility of individual Member States and various vaccination schemes exist in the EU as regards their profes\u00ad sional content, their mandatory or voluntary character or their financing, there is added value in addressing this issue at a European level; 6. RECOGNISES that possible joint efforts to improve childhood vaccination may also benefit from improved synergies with other EU policy areas with special regard to vulnerable groups, for example the Roma in certain Member States; 7. WELCOMES the outcomes of the expert level conference \u2018For a Healthy Future of Our Children \u2014 Childhood Immunisation\u2019, held in Budapest on 3-4 March 2011, where participants examined successes and challenges of childhood immunisation in the European Union and underlined the need to achieve and maintain timely, high childhood immunisation coverage in both general and under-vaccinated populations; having quality data for monitoring coverage and surveillance of vaccine- preventable diseases at sub-national, national and EU levels; and co-ordinating and refining communication strategies to target under-vaccinated population groups or those who are sceptical about the benefits of vaccination; 8. NOTES that while childhood immunisation programmes have been instrumental in controlling infectious diseases in Europe, many challenges still remain; 9. RECALLS that the most effective and economical way of preventing infectious diseases is through vaccination, where vaccination exists; 10. NOTES that increasing mobility and migration raise a number of health related questions, which are also relevant for childhood immunisation; 11. UNDERLINES that vaccines have led to the control, lower incidence and even elimination of diseases in Europe that in the past caused death and disability for millions of people, and that the global eradication of smallpox and the elimination of poliomyelitis from most countries in the world are excellent examples of successful vaccination programmes; 12. NOTES that measles and rubella epidemics continue to occur in several European countries and UNDERLINES that Europe failed to meet the goal of eliminating measles and rubella by 2010, because of lower-than- required vaccination coverage prevailing at sub-national levels, and therefore RECALLS the resolution of the World Health Organisation (WHO) of 16 September 2010 on renewed commitment to the elimination of measles and rubella and prevention of congenital rubella syndrome by 2015 and sustained support for polio-free status in the WHO European Region; 13. UNDERLINES the importance of identifying and addressing population groups at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and at the same time NOTES the significance of the fact that susceptible populations differ from one country or region to another; EN C 202/4 Official Journal of the European Union 8.7.2011 ( 1 ) OJ L 268, 3.10.1998, p. 1.

        "Council conclusions on innovation in the medical device sector (2011/C 202/03) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 1. RECALLING the Council conclusions of 26 June 2002 ( 1 ) and of 2 December 2003 ( 2 ) and the subsequent amendments to the legislative framework for medical devices ( 3 ); 2. DRAWING ATTENTION TO the conclusions ( 4 ) of the High Level Health Conference on innovation in medical tech\u00ad nology held in Brussels on 22 March 2011; 3. BEARING IN MIND: \u2014 the major long-term societal challenges facing Europe, such as an ageing population, which will call for inno\u00ad vative healthcare systems, \u2014 the importance of medical devices in health- and social care, their contribution to improving the level of health protection and the fact that medical devices today account for a significant amount of public health expen\u00ad diture, \u2014 that the development of medical devices may deliver innovative solutions for diagnosis, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, that could improve health and quality of life for patients, disabled persons, and their families, could contribute to mitigating the shortage of healthcare professionals and could contribute to addressing the sustainability of healthcare systems, \u2014 that innovation in medical devices should contribute to the continued improvement of patient and user safety, \u2014 the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing launched by the European Commission with the aim of tackling societal challenges through innovation, \u2014 that the medical device sector in Europe comprises around 18 000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and that this fact must be considered when future legislative and administrative measures are being adopted at European Union level and at national level, \u2014 the need to adapt EU medical device legislation to the needs of tomorrow so as to achieve a suitable, robust, transparent and sustainable regulatory framework, which is central to fostering the development of safe, effective and innovative medical devices for the benefit of European patients and healthcare professionals, \u2014 the importance of having the EU continue to play a leading role in the field of international regulatory convergence and best regulatory practice regarding medical devices, for instance through the Global Harmonisation Task Force, and be party to global initiatives such as global vigilance and global instruments for improving identification and traceability of medical devices; 4. STRESSING that in order for innovation to benefit patients, healthcare professionals, industry and society: \u2014 innovation should be increasingly patient- and user- centred and demand-driven, e.g. through increased involvement of patients, their families and users in the research, innovation and development processes in order to improve individual health and quality of life, \u2014 innovation should be a more integrated process, building on experience and knowledge acquired in other sectors, such as IT and the development of new materials, \u2014 innovation should be based on a holistic approach (i.e. it should take into account the whole healthcare process and all patients\u2019 needs \u2014 physical, social, psychological, etc.), \u2014 innovation should focus on public health priorities and healthcare needs inter alia in order to improve cost-effec\u00ad tiveness, \u2014 there is a need to increase research in order to identify public health needs and priorities still to be addressed and to better define patients\u2019 medical needs, \u2014 future legislative actions in this area must, when adapting the European regulatory framework, specifically aim to increase patients\u2019 safety while at the same time creating a sustainable legislative framework favourable to medical device innovation that can contribute to a healthy, active and independent life; 5. INVITES THE COMMISSION AND THE MEMBER STATES to: \u2014 promote measures that make use of valuable innovative solutions with proven benefit, and improve information and training for healthcare professionals, patients and patients\u2019 families regarding their use, EN 8.7.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 202/7 ( 1 ) Doc. 10060/02. ( 2 ) Doc. 14747/03.

        "\u2014 further map and share national and European best practices regarding innovation and enhance the deployment of research to facilitate, where relevant, the transfer of experiences gained in national or regional studies and pilot projects to the multinational, multire\u00ad gional or European level, \u2014 ensure stronger collaboration and dialogue between the various actors involved in the innovation process (e.g. through networks and clusters), \u2014 promote valuable innovation through public procurement policies while taking into account safety aspects, \u2014 take existing measures into account, and when necessary consider further measures which enhance the capacity for innovation, for instance the use of innovative funding systems directed, in particular, towards SMEs and that are designed to make optimum use of resources from the private and public sectors, \u2014 pay particular attention to interoperability and safety issues related to the integration of medical devices in e- Health systems, especially Personal Health Systems and mobile health systems (m-Health) while bearing in mind that the deployment of health ICT systems is entirely a matter of national competence, \u2014 encourage better consideration of the needs of patients and healthcare professionals in the design process of medical devices, \u2014 consider further improving the involvement of patients and healthcare professionals in vigilance in order to improve the system of notification of adverse incidents relating to the use of medical devices, \u2014 promote early dialogue between manufacturers, scientific and clinical experts, competent authorities and, where appropriate, notified bodies regarding \u2018new products\u2019 in particular, and their classification, \u2014 enhance cooperation between authorities of relevant sectors, where appropriate, \u2014 examine how and at which level the promotion of medical devices can be regulated in the most effective and efficient way; 6. INVITES THE COMMISSION to take the following considerations into account in the course of its future legis\u00ad lative work: \u2014 mechanisms are needed to enhance reliability, predicta\u00ad bility, speed and transparency in decision-making, and make sure that it is based on scientifically validated data, \u2014 the system of risk based classification should be improved (in particular for in vitro diagnostic medical devices and \u2018new products\u2019 as appropriate), \u2014 clinical data from pre-marketing studies and post- marketing experience (vigilance reports, post-marketing clinical follow-up, European registers) must be collected in a transparent way and to a greater extent in order to provide the clinical evidence which fulfils regulatory purposes and can, where appropriate, assist health tech\u00ad nology assessment, whilst fully recognising and respecting national competences for the latter. Consideration should also be given to methods for ensuring that notified bodies are better equipped with the appropriate expertise to analyse such data in a mean\u00ad ingful way, \u2014 there is a need for clearer and simpler rules defining the obligations and responsibilities of all economic operators and the role of other stakeholders (in particular national competent authorities and notified bodies), \u2014 the development of a modern IT infrastructure for a central and publicly available database must be further pursued with a view to providing key information about medical devices, relevant economic operators, certificates, clinical investigations and field safety corrective actions. In this context, the possibility of introducing a system to improve the traceability of devices, thus enhancing safety, must be studied, \u2014 where necessary, clarification should be made regarding the definition of medical devices and the criteria for their classification, \u2014 in addition, a simple and rapid mechanism must be set up for accelerated adoption of binding and consistent decisions and the implementation thereof on the deter\u00ad mination of products as medical devices and the classifi\u00ad cation of medical devices in order to address the growing number of \u2018borderline\u2019 cases between medical devices and other products subject to different regulatory frameworks (the framework for pharmaceuticals in particular, but also those for cosmetics, aesthetic products, food or biocides), \u2014 as regards the oversight of notified bodies, there is a need to continue to improve the harmonised list of criteria to be satisfied before their designation. In particular the designation process should ensure that they are designated only for the assessment of devices or tech\u00ad nologies which correspond to their proven expertise and competencies. The process should also address the need to improve monitoring of notified bodies by national authorities in order to ensure an EU-wide comparable and high-level performance of notified bodies, in this context an enhanced European coordination between competent authorities as well as between notified bodies should also be considered, EN C 202/8 Official Journal of the European Union 8.7.2011 ",
        "\u2014 the vigilance system for medical devices must be further developed in order to allow a coordinated analysis and a rapid and coherent EU-wide response to safety issues, if needed, \u2014 it is desirable to consider a European coordination mechanism founded on a clear legal basis and mandate in order to ensure efficient and effective coordination between national authorities while creating a level playing field. Synergies with existing bodies with relevant expertise should be explored when deciding on the mechanisms for such coordination. Consideration should also be given to which activities are best carried out in cooperation between Member States, \u2014 as the medical device sector is a global one, a stronger coordination with international partners is desirable in order to ensure that medical devices are manufactured according to high safety requirements worldwide, \u2014 there is a need for a sustainable legislative framework for medical devices which ensures safety and promotes inno\u00ad vation, \u2014 it should be considered how to address regulatory gaps in the system, for instance in relation to medical devices manufactured utilising non-viable human cells and tissues, \u2014 the need for introducing more harmonised provisions relating to the content, presentation and comprehensi\u00ad bility of the instructions for use of medical devices should be further considered.

The growing rise of chronic diseases represents one of the major challenges to health systems; 10. RECOGNISES that, whilst ensuring equitable access to high quality healthcare services in circumstances of scarce economic and other resources has always been a key question, at present it is the scale and urgency of the situation that is changing and, if unaddressed, it could become a crucial factor in the future economic and social landscape of the EU; 11.
