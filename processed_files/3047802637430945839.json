        "4 1. Introduction and Scope 1.1. Context The internet 1 and social media are fundamental elements through which institutions and citizens engage in democratic processes and civil action throughout Europe. Indeed, social media, and the World Wide Web more generally, have democratised access to involvement in political action, providing ever-greater numbers of Europeans with opportunities to become involved in civic empowerment and participatory democracy. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) expressed its interest in gaining a greater understanding on the ways social media and social networking as agents of participatory democracy and civil empowerment, could help it more effectively engage with organized civil society institutions online . This report presents the findings of a study that provides in-depth qualitative insight on the attitudes and behaviours of organized civil society organizations . It aims to enable the EESC to make more informed decisions about the identity of influential civil society organizations, where internal resources should be focused to maximise impact and, in particular, increase opportunities for the EESC to affect the attitudes and behaviours of other users to support its internal objectives. 1.2. Objectives of the Study The purpose of the Study on Social Media and Social Networking as agents of Participatory Democracy and Civic Empowerment is to provide the EESC with in-depth qualitative insight and strategic recommendations into the ways social media and social networking impact upon democratic and political engagement, particularly amongst organized civil society institutions. In addition, the study will provide the EESC with insight into the ways civil society organizations utilise social media to achieve their objectives and, subsequently, explore ways social networking can help create a network of mutual interdependence that collectively strengthens those organizations that comprise civil society. It is, therefore, the aim of this analysis to provide the EESC with detailed and compelling insight into the ways social media can be used to better engage with civil society organizations in addition to providing recommendations on how social 1 \u2018Internet\u2019 is often spelled with a capital \u2018I\u2019. In keeping with other works in contemporary internet studies and for the purpose of this study, the author will spell with the lower case \u2018i.\u2019 Capitalising suggests that the \u2018internet\u2019 is a proper noun and implying that either it is a being, or a place. Both metaphors suggest that the internet has agency and power that are better granted to its users and developers. ",
        "5 media and social networking can inform, empower and foster constructive grassroots participation in a more consistent and systematic way. 1.3. Scope of Research This interim report presents the findings of the internet research conducted by Semantica Research, which focuses on the following areas: \u2022 How does the EESC utilise social media? \u2022 How is the EESC perceived by civil society organizations within social media platforms? \u2022 Where and how does engagement related to the EESC occur? \u2022 How do influential organized civil society institutions utilise social media to achieve their objectives in relation to the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives? \u2022 Which civil society organizations related to each Europe 2020 flagship initiative are deemed influential? It is important to emphasise that this report does not focus exclusively on civil society organizations directly associated with the EESC (for which there is limited discussion on social media platforms). Rather, its emphasis focuses on the nature of the digital communications ecology in which online stakeholders related to the EESC reside in relation to specific Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative activity. This report maps, categorises and evaluates a selection of influential digital civil society organizations in English, French, German and Spanish, in addition to their potential impact to the EESC. This report is entirely diagnostic, based upon an open search of the World Wide Web using a comprehensive set of search tools. It covers the open internet, as well as parts of the \u201cun-indexed web\u201d, forums, imageboards, wikis, blogs and social networks. ",
        "6 2. Methodology 2.1. Internet Research Process to Map, Analyse and Evaluate the Digital Civil Society Ecosystem The research process used was unobtrusive in nature, meaning that civil society organizations were not directly solicited for information on their social media activity. The methods employed to conduct this research were as follows: \u2022 Empirical data was acquired from various online sources and segmented into the numerous ways the EESC utilises social media to engage organized civil society institutions, by sourcing content from various online platforms. The same process was applied to online content related to the ways other civil society organizations use social media and perceive the EESC \u2022 The analysis was conducted in English, French, German and Spanish languages \u2022 Qualitative research techniques such as discourse analysis and netnography were employed to conduct in-depth sociological analyses of social media content \u2022 Following this process of online content aggregation and analysis, a series of strategic recommendations was made and included in Section 6 of this report The strategic impact of this method of research is presented in the actionable and persuasive insight derived from data from the social Web. The above method is particularly appropriate to the scope of work set out in Section 1.3 because unobtrusive analysis of the nature of engagement organized civil society institutions online provides in-depth intelligence and insight in a way that other, more traditional forms of research and analysis in which participants\u2019 responses are directly solicited from them, do not (Ampofo, 2011). 2.2. Framing the Conceptualisation of Organized Civil Society In framing the methodological approach, in-depth discussion between the Semantica Research team and the EESC\u2019s Online Information Unit sought to clarify the nature of digital civil society in order to provide a mutually agreeable working definition for the study. The definition of the term \u2018civil society\u2019 has a rich scholarly heritage (Fukuyama, 2001, Castells, 2007, 2000, Foley & Edwards, 1996) and refers to the notion that members of society come together to engage in issues of concern to society at large. European civil society is an essential element of a healthy and vibrant democracy and can be conceived of as an \u2018active European citizenship\u2026a social relationship that stems from citizens lining up with others and participating in ",
        "7 political discourse and structures of governance that stretch beyond national borders\u2019 (Bellamy and Warleigh, 2001: 6). According to Bee & Bozzini (2010), the organizations that comprise civil society work to bring about a strong and flourishing society by interacting \u2018with institutions in different ways: through open debates, for example through the internet or open conferences, through advocacy work to influence public policy and through the criticism of, and expressing opposition to, institutional activities. Interaction between civil society organisations and institutions is thus a fundamental aspect of the dialogic interaction through which social actors can have a say in setting the public agenda and generally speaking in the public sphere\u2019 (Bee & Bozzini, P2, 2010). The presence of a strong active and engaged civil society in Europe will, according to Maloney and Deth, \u2018increase transparency, accountability and democracy\u2019 (Maloney & Deth, pg. 2, 2010). For the purpose of this study, therefore, the term civil society is defined as \u2018the realm of private voluntary association, from neighbourhood committees to interest groups to philanthropic enterprises of all sorts, [and is seen as]\u2026an essential ingredient in both democratization and the health of established democracies \u2019 (Foley & Edwards, pp. 1, 1996). 2 As the communications landscape becomes ever more complex and participatory in nature (Shirky, 2011), the internet research process for this study highlighted that the panoply of civil society organizations active online was equally complex and participatory. As the European population becomes more connected to the internet, using an ever-increasing array of social media platforms, they equally encounter mounting opportunities to engage in collective civic action. It is from this theoretical standpoint that that the study commenced. In addition, it was decided by the EESC\u2019s Online Information Unit that civil society organizations relevant to the Flagship Initiatives of the Europe 2020 initiative should be the focus of the analysis. The following Europe 2020 Flagship Initiatives, therefore, were used to select civil society organizations to analyse for the study: 1. Digital Agenda 2. Youth on the Move 3. Innovation Union 4. New Industrial Policy 5. New Skills and Jobs 6. Platform Against Poverty and Social Exclusion 7. Resource Efficiency In addition, discussions between the Online Information Unit and Semantica Research on an agreed definition of civil society organizations settled upon those organizations which are officially registered as civil society organizations by EU member states. The analysis of such organizations was specified for this study, as civil society itself does not exhibit actor qualities. Rather, actor qualities arise from organized civil society organizations themselves. \u2018Civil society organizations (CSOs) have multiple functions: first a performative function since they form and transform civil society through discourse and interaction in the public sphere; second, a 2 In-depth discussion between Semantica Research and the Online Information Unit regarding the definition of Civil Society for this study agreed that it would include analysis of the social media activities of governmental organizations, as well as those civil society organizations which receive finding directly from governments. ",
        "8 representative function because they make civil society visible and give societal interests a voice\u2019 (Kohler-Koch, 2010: 5). Therefore, while organizations such as Oxfam, Greenpeace and the UK Trade Union Congress (TUC) are included in this study as organized civil society organizations , the analysis of other, non-registered online communities engaging in civil action, such as Anonymous and Los Indignados is beyond the scope of this study. However, it is important to note that some of the non-official civil societies were very successful at generating high levels of civil engagement using social media and some of their techniques can be conceived of as examples of best practice in social media engagement. This viewpoint was underscored by Bee and Bozzini (2010) who claimed that organizations like the EESC should remain mindful of the contribution and \u2018existence of counter publics (for example, marginalised groups, social movements and so on) and their relevance in shaping social reality\u2019 (Bee & Bozzini, 2010: 2). ",
        "9 3. Executive Summary Social media and social networking tools present the EESC with a significant opportunity to further enhance the position of the organization as a bridge between civil society organizations and the European Union . The successful use of social media will enable the EESC to forge strong and long-lasting relationships with established and emergent civil society organisations online. This study analyses the steps that have already been taken to this effect and presents evidence to suggest that continued efforts by the EESC in this endeavour will yield results. The mapping and a nalysis of the online civil society ecology into the ways social media and social networking impact upon democratic and political engagement, particularly amongst organized civil society institutions online, takes place across a wide range of online platforms . The diversity of such organizations is far- reaching, complex and constantly changing . The EESC has an extensive, far-reaching social media presence , with profiles evident on YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn and blogs. However, the social media content published by the EESC and its members extends to a select community of like-minded social media users and civil society organizations. As a result, the EESC has experienced mixed degrees of success in stimulating long-lasting, in-depth engagement with its social media profiles by civil society organizations. Comprehensive analysis of civil society organizations highlighted the range of engagement techniques used to connect with their target audiences. The organizations that generated high levels activity in terms of both the frequency and depth of engagement with their social media content had employed a variety of engagement techniques. It is the simultaneous implementation of numerous social media engagement methods that comprised success for civil society organizations online, and this should be considered by the EESC if it is to better engage with civil society organizations online. The recommendations included in Section 6 of this report are designed to enable the EESC to generate increased levels of positive social media engagement with organized civil society organizations in relation to the current resources and capabilities of the EESC\u2019s Online Information Unit.

        "10 4. Social Media and the EESC 4.1 How Does the EESC Utilise Social Media? The EESC has an extensive, far-reaching social media profile . The diverse social media channels used by the EESC to engage civil society are at once visible and accessible from entry to the EESC homepage. Social media users are presented with the opportunity to interact with the organization\u2019s content by clicking through to these social media channels created and maintained by the EESC. In addition, the organization endeavours to integrate the presentation of its comprehensive research and policy documentation within its social media profiles. Entry to the homepage also allows EESC members to engage with other social media content originating from senior EESC members (see Table 1 below). The social media profiles of senior staff members are a confluence of personal and professional content whose aim is to permit general social media users the opportunity to witness a more human and everyday perspective of these political professionals. In addition, the content from senior politicians within the EESC combines with the content feeds from the wider EESC social media portals, as a means of further engaging potentially different audiences. The \u201cTake Part\u201d page of the EESC website contains a full list of the EESC\u2019s social media profiles and encourages social media users to become involved with the output from the its various social profiles. To date, the EESC maintains a variety of profiles on social media platforms, which are listed below: Table 1: EESC Profiles on Social Media Platforms Social Media Platform Digital Channel Facebook Constantly Updated Pages \u2022 Main EESC portal \u2022 Staffan Nilsson \u2013 EESC President \u2022 Anna Maria Darmanin \u2013 EESC Vice President \u2022 Jacek Krawczyk \u2013 EESC Vice President \u2022 Single Market Observatory \u2022 Your Europe Your Say \u2022 Video Challenge Competition \u2022 5 Ideas for a Younger Europe Less Frequently Updated Pages \u2022 Design Competition \u2022 How can civil society appeal to and communicate with Young ",

Information Compiled by Semantica Research The multifaceted nature of the EESC\u2019s collective social media profile , which integrates numerous social media pages for specific events, specific policies, specific people and the actual EESC organization page is a direct representation of a hub and spoke social media strategy , where, like the hub on a bicycle wheel, the EESC itself represents a cross-functional group providing information for multiple stakeholders across the organization. The main content from the organization is represented in the middle of the structure, or the hub, and the hub facilitates resource sharing and cross-functional communications (via the spokes in a wheel) to those at the edge of the organization. In addition, the EESC has linked its collective social media profile to other initiatives where online users can become involved in the activities of the organization such as the various cultural events staged by the organization, youth events, the Open Day 2012, and information about jobs, traineeships and Public Procurement. Finally, the EESC links its social media profiles closely to the competitions it runs on social media to generate interest and engagement levels amongst its audiences such as the EESC Video Challenge 2012 and the Civil Society Prize. It is imperative that the EESC engages with civil society using the Web and social networking platforms for a number of reasons. Principally, high levels of online engagement will greatly contribute to ensuring awareness for the work conducted by the EESC, and EU more generally, amongst social media users who, in turn, will promote the good work by the organization across the social Web. In addition, higher levels of engagement with the EESC\u2019s social media content will do much to better fulfil the stated mandate of the organization of becoming a bridge between the EU and civil society . It will also have the effect of creating virtual ambassadors for the EESC, Europe 2020 and the EU more generally, which would generate a more positive perception of the organizations, while enabling the EESC to positively address the plurality of concerns of civil society organizations using social media. ",
        "12 Fostering positive relationships with influential online ambassadors and increasing positive engagement with the EESC\u2019s online content will also enable the organization to retain greater control of its core messages and, in turn, the attitudes and behaviours of influential civil society organizations online. Greater control of the EESC\u2019s social media presence and Europe 2020 will also enable the organization to create a collection of master narratives (Halverson, 2011), which, successfully managed, would foster a more positive perception amongst online stakeholders that will be difficult to counter. 4.2 How is the EESC Percieved by Civil Society Organizations on Social Media Platforms? The low level of engagement from social media users with the EESC\u2019s social media content has a discernible effect on the way that online users perceive the organization . An analysis of the online stakeholder community as it pertains to the EESC reveals that the social media users and organizations interested in the EESC online is similar in institutional and conceptual raison d\u2019\u00eatre to the EESC. While it is, therefore, important to note that the EESC has achieved the important task of obtaining a high level of reach amongst like-minded organizations, it is clear that its reach does not extend much further beyond these stakeholders. This results in the EESC\u2019s social media content remaining in a community of limited size, as engagement occurs with people who already agree with the organization. The reasons for the EESC\u2019s limited levels of engagement on its social media pages , to date, are various. The internet research revealed that, in general, there was a low level of online engagement amongst content generated by government organizations or those organizations emanating from Groups 1 and 2 3 . The type of online behaviour dovetails well with the influential findings from the political scientist Lance Bennett (2003), in which he outlines that in general, engagement with official institutions by young people is low because they perceive the institutions as untrustworthy. Another explanation for the low level of engagement exhibited is that people are often reticent to engage with non-humans in an online context. In general, the organizations that exhibited high levels of social media engagement placed a strong emphasis on the importance of a human presence at the forefront of their social media presence. This was in direct contrast to those organizations which otherwise engaged with social media users through the institutional brand and usually generated less positive engagement as a result. Organizations which demonstrated the human-focused social media engagement strategies include Avaaz, Oxfam and, in general, organizations that resided in Group 3 of EESC Members. 3 This demarcation refers to the classification of groups which are members of the EESC: Group 1 \u2013 Employers Organizations, Group 2: Employees Organizations, Group 3: NGOs and other Organizations. A fuller definition of the nature of the Groups can be found on the EESC website on this link: http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.groups ",
        "13 Finally, engagement with EESC content, in general, reverberates amongst those organizations which are in strong accord with the aims and objectives of the European Union. The fact that general online engagement with the EESC takes place amongst like-minded people and institutions means that the EESC\u2019s content is not discussed between a wide population of social media users and therefore contributes strongly to the low levels of social media engagement. The network map in Figure 1 demonstrates the spread of the EESC\u2019s 1603 follower network on Twitter (this figure is correct as of 1 September 2012). The various nodes within the network represent distinct followers to the EESC\u2019s Twitter account (@eu_eesc) and are sized according to the number of followers they have accrued. Figure 1: Network Map Displaying the EESC\u2019s Twitter Followers Source: Semantica Research. Follower counts accurate as of 1 September 2012 One important finding is that the range of Twitter users linked to the EESC share a great deal of similarities, particularly the EU-related entities such as @eu_research, @eu_commission and @martinschulz. Other Twitter profiles revealed stakeholders who retain a strong interest in the EESC and Europe more generally such as @euracivfr and @eu_sports_team. This finding supports the notion that the EESC could do more to diversify the range of online communities with which it engages, as many of its followers on social media profiles are those who are already affiliated with the European Union. In general, the perception of the EESC by civil society organizations online was neutral, as very low levels of social media content exist.

        "14 made of the EESC (primarily amongst organizations that have partnerships or affiliations with the European Union), it has been in a way that has described the EESC as a partner organization, supporting or funding association. 4.3. Where and How Does Engagement Related to the EESC Occur? The various online communities, in which engagement related to the EESC occurs, reflect the structure of the stakeholder ecology in which the EESC operates, which is a close-knit ecology with a high reach across to other social media communities. The engagement that does occur online tends to be either neutral or positive in sentiment . Neutral commentary takes the form of users or organizations that syndicate content, repost content from the EESC, or simply report on the status of the EESC\u2019s research output. An example of this is seen in Figures 2 and 3 from the organization Involve and the ADT Quart Monde in which the EESC is mentioned. Figure 2: Involve Mention of the EESC Figure 3: ATD Quart Monde Mention of the EESC It should also be highlighted that the sentiment analysis conducted revealed no negative discussion occurring in relation to the EESC from civil society organizations or online users. The sum of online discussion amounted to mention from civil society organizations that they had secured an affiliation with the EESC or were attending one of the various conferences hosted by the EESC. Positive commentary related to instances in which the EESC\u2019s content was responded to or engaged with in an affirmative manner. Commentary of this kind was witnessed most frequently when social media users agreed with a comment or post from the EESC, or an organization achieved official partnership or affiliation with the EESC. In general, engagement with the EESC takes place on the social media platforms, where their content has been created, as outlined on Table 1. In other instances that engagement has taken place, it has been through the use of press releases and ",
        "15 other official content from organizations who work with the EESC, such as think tanks, NGOs and charities. ",
        "16 5. Mapping and Analysis of the Digital Civil Society Ecology 5.1 How Do Influential Civil Society Organizations Utilise Social Media to Achieve their Objectives within the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative Topics? High-level insight into the nature of organized civil society and its relationship to social networking and social media reveals much about the contemporary nature of participatory democracy and civic empowerment in a digital context. The composition of organizations that exhibit civil engagement tendencies in the online space is a dense and complex milieu that is constantly changing and adapting to the fluid and dynamic media ecology (O\u2019Loughlin & Hoskins, 2010). As noted previously in this report, the civil society organizations analysed utilise various tactics including whistleblowing, education and activism when engaging with the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiatives online . Table 2: List of the Principal Engagement Methods by Civil Society Organizations Engagement Method Description \u2022 Activism \u2022 Where the principal engagement method for the civil society organization is to conduct vigorous campaigning to bring about social or political change \u2022 Campaign / Awareness \u2022 When the civil society organization utilises a series of organised activities and tactics to work towards a stated goal \u2022 Education \u2022 The civil society organization seeks to educate its target online audience to achieve a stated goal \u2022 Lobbying \u2022 The civil society organization chooses, as its principal tactic, to influence legislators on a particular topic \u2022 Research and Fundraising \u2022 Academic research and fundraising are the means by which organizations engage in civic action Source: Semantica Research The criteria by which influential civil society organizations were selected for analysis were based upon those organizations that displayed a close ideological accord with the European Union\u2019s Flagship Initiatives for Europe 2020 . An example of this is the Digital Agenda Flagship Initiative, defined as the delivery of \u201c\u2026 sustainable economic and social benefits from a digital single market , based on fast and ultra fast internet and interoperable applications\u2026The Digital Agenda makes proposals for actions that need to be taken urgently in order for the EU to get on track for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Its proposals will set the scene for the longer-term transformations that the increasingly digital economy and society will bring about\u2026Success in this area will spur innovation, economic growth ",
        "17 and improvements in the daily lives of citizens and businesses, such as through better health care, safer and more efficient transport solutions, a cleaner environment, new media opportunities, and easier access to public services and cultural content. \u201d 4 The organizations subsequently analysed within this Flagship Initiative were identified and selected based on the extent to which their raison d\u2019\u00eatre in both an online and offline context related to the Digital Agenda. An example of the type of organization analysed within this category is the Hansard Society based in the UK, particularly its e-democracy programme, whose focus can be described as follows; \u201c[s]ince 1997 the Hansard Society's Digital Democracy Programme has led the way in understanding how digital media affect and transform the way democracy works\u2026Our research, networks and experience mean that we keep our finger on the pulse of this fast changing area .\u201d 5 In addition to the saliency of organizations\u2019 raison d\u2019\u00eatre to the Europe 2020 flagship Initiative, civil society organizations were selected for analysis based partly on the strength of their online influence, which was defined by the depth and level of engagement evident on their various social media profiles. Engagement, for the purpose of this report refers to the extent to which social media users participated in the creation and co-creation of online content related to civil society organizations. Engagement can take various forms such as those users who merely visit websites and read or view content, to those users who provide some sort of minimal activity (such as product ratings), to those committed individuals or organizations that engage, rally people and visit particular websites on a frequent basis. As one of the key elements of this report is to outline benchmarking recommendations on the optimal approach for engagement with civil society organizations using social media, the following section will feature charts mapping the extent to which civil society organizations engaged with social media users. The final criteria by which civil society organizations were selected for the Final Report was the degree to which they could be defined as one of the three EESC groups: (Employers\u2019) Group 1, Workers\u2019 (Group 2), and Various Interests (Group 3). A table listing the organizations analysed within this study is located in the Annex. The following analysis presents an overview of the key influencers related to the specific Flagship Initiatives for Europe 2020 , and how they utilise social media. It focused on the principal methods by which civil societies engaged with their audiences using social media in addition to the extent of their engagement online. Influential organizations included in the Final Report were selected according to the following criteria: \u2022 Relevance to the work of the EESC \u2022 Relevance to organized civil society \u2022 Relevance to the three EESC Groups: o Group 1 \u2013 Employers\u2019 Group o Group 2 \u2013 Workers\u2019 Group o Group 3 \u2013 Various Interests 4 Digital Agenda for Europe http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital- agenda/index_en.htm 5 Hansard Society, http://hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/eDemocracy/ ",
        "18 5.1.1 Digital Agenda The civil society organizations that comprise the Digital Agenda section of the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative were highly innovative in terms of generating buzz and excitement through their social media profiles . Such activity stemmed from organizations successfully combining frequent content delivery on social media platforms with sustained depth of engagement by members of target audiences. A preeminent example of this is seen in the Hansard Society\u2019s social media profile for its e-Democracy programme. This programme has a considerable amount of users who ally themselves with the stated aims and objectives of the programme on a regular basis and exhibit deep engagement with the organization across a multitude of social media sites including social networks, video sharing sites and blogs. In addition, there is diversity in the reach of organizations in this section. Reach is defined as the number and cross-section of people who will be exposed to their viewpoints and other digital content . In general, it has been observed that organizations with high levels of offline influence did not necessarily manifest this in the social media space . In addition, civil society organizations with less online reach, predominantly Group 1 and Group 2 organizations, tended to produce less polemic content which may account for the decrease in social media engagement. Figure 4: Map Showing Civil Society Organizations and Social Media Engagement Levels Figure 4 outlines that a number of organizations, such as ACSEL and AUI, had low levels of depth and frequency of engagement. Simply put, social media users did not engage with some of the organizations analysed on a regular basis or on a very profound level. However, Internet sans Fronti\u00e8res was an example of an organization in which its users exhibited a high level of depth of engagement with the organization by contributing to its various social media presences and responding vociferously to the organization\u2019s campaigns such as E-Syndicat and FEOWL. In contrast, organizations such as Enna Europe and Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Responsables de Comunidad y Profesionales social media were apt at generating high levels of frequency of engagement but not depth. This led to high levels of buzz and activity surrounding the organizations in place of lasting, profound engagement. Asociaci\u00f3n de internautas ! Depth!of!Engagement! F r e q u e n c y ! o f !

        "19 On balance, the stance held by the civil society organizations towards the Digital Agenda is a positive one, as all organizations share the EESC\u2019s perspective that more people should be connected to the internet to facilitate greater civil participation. While there are a small number of groups that are wholly dogmatic, and unlikely to offer a constructive dialogue with other organizations (which were not classified as organized civil society organizations and were therefore excluded from this study), the majority have viewpoints informed by a variety of media forms, including the mainstream media and social media in addition to other people, reinforcing the two-step view of political and civic communication flow. The highest level of civic engagement, with respect to frequency of engagement, came from Avaaz, and Change.org. These organizations were able to attract high numbers of users to their social media users to engage with their content on a regular basis, displayed comfort employing a wide range of social media tools to achieve their objectives and had an extremely high levels of penetration amongst their targeted online communities. One of the principal explanations for the high level of civil participation on these sites is that such organizations offer users the opportunity to engage in a meaningful participatory experience using social media with a low barrier to entry . The facility for social media users to join short- lived, ephemeral groups on social networks generates millions of followers and signatories to petitions in very short spaces of time. While this high level of civic participation is commendable, there may be a danger that this form of \u201cclicktivism\u201d or \u201cslacktivism\u201d does not encourage people to become deeply and meaningfully engaged in the democratic process. ",
        "20 5.1.2 Youth on the Move The various organizations identified as displaying relevance to \u201cYouth on the Move\u201d demonstrated a high degree of congruency in their approaches to achieving their strategic objectives, as demonstrated in Figure 5 below. Figure 5: Map Showing Civil Society Organizations and Social Media Engagement Levels In a similar fashion to that seen in the Digital Agenda analysis, organizations with the greatest levels of engagement in Youth on the Move were the Group 3 organizations such as La Croix Rouge and Save the Children. The reason for this occurrence is that these organizations were particularly adept at encouraging their supporters to become engaged in short-lived campaigns whilst simultaneously capturing the attention of more engaged social media users in advocating and engaging with the organization over the long term. To a lesser degree, other Group 1 and 2 organizations in Youth on the Move demonstrated a prominent profile offline, which they were unable to translate to success on social media, such as the Irish Youth Council and Juventud Espa\u00f1a which both generated low levels of frequency of engagement and medium levels of depth of engagement. Part of this can be explained by the finding that organizations with an overarching corporate or institutional social media persona, or those organizations which began as offline organizations before migrating their digital operations to the social space relatively recently, tend to be perceived mistrustfully by social media users, particularly young people (Bennett, 2003). There is very little disparity between the various approaches to \u201cYouth on the Move\u201d as all but four of organizations displayed medium levels of both frequency and depth of engagement. As a result, this occurrence indicates an ample opportunity for young people to become involved in civic action and for the EESC to initiate further online engagement focused on the Youth in Movement Flagship Initiative.

        "21 5.1.3 Innovation Union The civil society landscape pertaining to the Innovation Union is complex and populated by a great many organizations. However, this sector is not particularly active in relation to the frequency and depth of engagement by the organizations selected for analysis. A reason for this could lie in the fact that while some organizations did discuss the issue of innovation in a European context, it was not their dominant focus. Organizations in this category include Ing\u00e9nieurs sans fronti\u00e8res, Dialog \u00fcber Deutschland and the Innovation and Design Council. Figure 6: Map Showing Civil Society Organizations and Social Media Engagement Levels Civil society organizations that occupied the social media landscape in relation to this Flagship Initiative had extensive followings and communities in an offline context. They are examples of organizations which have migrated their operations from an offline context directly to social media platforms, which has not, in many cases, translated into significant success. Figure 6 highlights that NESTA, the UK organization responsible for innovation, achieved the highest level of both frequency and depth of engagement in the Innovation Union corpus. The reason for this is that the organization was able to galvanise engagement from its target audience through its multiple blogs to its comprehensive presence on social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, all of which sustain high levels of followers interested in developments related to the organization. The rest of the organizations analysed in this section generated low to medium levels of social media engagement. As a result, there exists an ample opportunity for the EESC to become an influential player in this sector by encouraging deep, long-lasting engagement with its content , in a way that few other organizations currently achieve.

        "22 5.1.4 New Industrial Policy The civil society organizations operating within the New Industrial Policy Flagship Initiative were populous and active , similar to that seen in the Digital Agenda landscape. It is noticeable that civil society organizations within this space approach the idea of creating a new industrial policy from different viewpoints , as presented in Figure 7 below. Figure 7: Map Showing Civil Society Organizations and Social Media Engagement Levels Some perspectives to digital civic engagement are more dominant than others in the social media landscape, such as the range of civil society actors operating in the Corporate Social Responsibility sphere. In cases such as these, organizations tend to form coalitions with other corporations to increase the impact of their work and also the reach of their social media presence. An example is seen in the work conducted by CSR Europe, a coalition of organizations with Europe-level interests and committed to corporations delivering a positive impact on society. The landscape of organizations populating the New Industrial Policy discussions online is comprised of institutions that have low to medium frequency of engagement but exhibit the full range of depth of engagement. Only organizations such as Unite the Union, Unison and CSR Europe were able to generate high levels of both elements.

        "23 5.1.5 New Skills and Jobs The civil society landscape related to New Skills and Jobs is formed of organizations concerned with the improvement of employment skills of the population in order to create more jobs and prosperity for Europe-based organizations following the global recession. Figure 8: Map Showing Civil Society Organizations and Social Media Engagement Levels Civil society organizations in this sector exhibit a greater spread as the majority of organizations generated medium to low levels of frequency of engagement. However, it is clear that certain organizations, such as the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail (CGT) and the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Luxembourgeoise des Syndicats Chr\u00e9tiens (LGBC) were able to generate high levels of depth of engagement as social media users commented extensively on publications and blog posts created by the organizations. Civil society organizations that were able to generate high levels of depth of engagement as their main tactic to foment social media engagement were better able to bridge the gap between generating excellent offline and online reputations and civil engagement . An example of this is the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), which combined medium levels of depth of engagement with high levels of frequency of engagement to build a large, loyal audience. In addition to the WFTO, it is noticeable that various knowledge-based, or epistemic communities of organizations emerged in relation to this particular Flagship Initiative. Such organizations included, for example, groups of industry professionals who commented actively on various aspects of the range of skills needed by new people entering the respective professions, such as Fundaci\u00f3n Hazlo Posible. These organizations were responsible for generating widespread engagement in specific, targeted communities that could go some way to influencing debates and policy at the governmental or corporate level. Other organizations, such as Skills for Health, were less pronounced in generating social media content as a means of achieving their objectives.

        "24 platforms and as a result, had not generated high levels of social media engagement and, by implication, online civil engagement. 5.1.6 Platform Against Poverty and Social Exclusion There was a very high level of online engagement related to the Platform Against Poverty and Social Exclusion. The internet research revealed that this community was one of the most populous and dynamic areas of online civil society . An array of organizations were represented in this area and the nature of their approaches to online engagement using their social media profiles presents compelling insight for the EESC. Figure 9: Map Showing Civil Society Organizations and Social Media Engagement Levels Particularly successful organizations in this sphere were able to form alliances amongst groups of civil society organizations with differing perspectives and viewpoints on poverty and how the issues should be tackled, such as Caritas. In cases such as these, specific organizations or campaigns were able to utilise the combined reach and community size of a variety of organizations to maximise the frequency and depth of their engagement strategies . Other organizations were more adept at integrating online and offline engagement strategies to achieve high levels of effect, such as Concern Worldwide. This was seen in Concern\u2019s ability to host high-frequency campaigns such as Concern Challenge, supported strongly through its various social media channels, and other long term engagement techniques such as the Concern blog, events and the blog of the Chief Executive Officer, Tom Arnold. However, it is notable that engagement levels for the majority of other organizations included in the analysis, such as Inspiraction, ATL and Terre Solidaire, are low. This is important as such organizations were capable of generating large numbers of social media users as followers, this energy and momentum faded over time without innovation and ongoing engagement to galvanise the attracted online community. Therefore, engagement on the site and on the social media profiles slowed, requiring the organization to work hard to rouse such engagement in the future.

        "25 5.1.7 Resource Efficiency The various civil society organizations which comprise the Resource Efficiency sector demonstrate a strong level of congruency in the ways they engaged with users to foment civil action. Organizations such as WWF and Greenpeace, demonstrated proficiency in integrating their online and offline activities to engage their users through a mixture of education, lobbying and campaign / awareness tactics. Organizations that utilised these tactics were simultaneously the most vocal and most active online , posting to their various social media channels on a daily basis. Figure 10: Map Showing Civil Society Organizations and Social Media Engagement Levels Figure 10 highlights that the civil society organizations in this sector are distributed across a wide range of the rankings for frequency and depth of engagement. Organizations such as Agir pour l\u2019Environnement and Bund f\u00fcr Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland (BUND) generated medium to high levels of both forms of engagement on their social media platforms. In addition to this, other successful organizations, such as \u00danete al Planeta and Greenpeace demonstrated adroitness by combining social media engagement in relation to their long and short-term campaigns. As a result, overall success for civil society organizations online appeared to be reserved for those organizations that were able to employ a variety of engagement tactics seamlessly to ensure successful digital civic engagement.

        "26 6. Recommendations and Best Practice The following recommendations form a contribution to EESC attempts to better engage with civil society organizations using social media and are the result of the mapping and analysis of organized civil society organizations. The recommendations are intended to aid the EESC more effectively fulfil its mandate as a bridge between civil society and the wider European Union . Consolidate the EESC\u2019s Positioning as a Fundamental Part of the Civil Society Landscape in Europe In the eyes of online stakeholders, the EESC is perceived as a great influence on civil society organizations from both economic and policy perspectives. While there remains a low level of discussion amongst civil society organizations online regarding the EESC specifically, it is apparent that there is a great opportunity for the EESC to both consolidate and ameliorate this position. The EESC could do this in a variety of ways which would help it to forge strong online relationships with the influential members of organized civil society effectively using social media. One such way is for the EESC to identify and cultivate people from within its own organization to become influencers on social media. An influential person on social media platforms is a person who affects the others\u2019 decisions about what to think and do. They are more connected and informed than general social media users and can be major allies in helping the EESC to become an influential conduit between civil society bridge and the European Union. Adopt a Flexible and Adaptive Social Media Strategy The civil society landscape is extremely dense and complex, composed of thousands of organizations and bespoke online communities actively engaged in a milieu of issues affecting society in general. In order to effectively engage with online civil society organizations, particularly those linked to the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiatives, the social media strategy adopted for this purpose should be flexible enough to adapt to the various engagement techniques employed by such organizations which appear over time. An example of this is seen in Concern Worldwide\u2019s approach to social media engagement as it incorporates a wide range of campaigns which generate both high levels of activity from social media users and the increase in informal discussion about the focus of the campaign in general. Gain a Comprehensive Understanding of the Online Stakeholder Landscape Before the implementation of the social media engagement strategy, it is imperative that the EESC first seeks to fully understand the online stakeholder landscape as it pertains to its strategic objectives, by implementing a comprehensive and periodic social media listening and analysis programmes. Such analyses should seek to understand the motivations of the community(ies) in which it is attempting to interact, a solid understanding of the composition of the stakeholder landscape over time and the various ways the stakeholders interact with each other in the most impactful way. In addition, the listening and analysis exercises will enable the EESC to provide more relaxed setting for participation in civil society using social networking. An ongoing understanding of the nature and composition of the stakeholder landscape will provide the EESC with the opportunity to fully understand the unique environment in which it is situated before engaging with it. ",
        "27 The insight gained from the social media listening exercise will enable the EESC to transform strangers into members, members into contributors and contributors into ambassadors. Develop Tools and Skillsets for Digital Civil Engagement Many social media users are, unfortunately, not digitally literate. The EESC could create a social media public communication skillset document that acts as an influential reference point for safe and impactful engagement with the EESC and EU on matters of interest, but also equips people with the skills to better engage organizations in the civil society space in the future. Adopt a Horizontal Communication Model Currently, communication via social media for the EESC can be characterised as follows: 1. A top-down process that relies on the creation of content mainly in the form of blogs by senior staff members, which is then disseminated on social media platforms, 2. A decentralized approach to social media engagement where social media users within the organization assume a considerable degree of autonomy in their social media engagement. The EESC has been proactive in creating social media guidelines and frameworks for their staff and its associated members. In light of this approach, it is recommended that a more multifaceted, horizontal model of communication is adopted, where intended audience members of EESC content become empowered to be creators of social media content related to the EESC and the wider EU. If this change were to be implemented effectively, the EESC\u2019s role, as a bridge between civil society organizations and the European Union, would be further enhanced. It is apparent that this form of bottom-up, user- generated communication has the greatest impact in regards to social media engagement amongst civil society organizations. Convincing Internal Stakeholders The EESC\u2019s social media engagement strategy should be resilient enough to withstand objections and opposition from staff and organizational members who are resistant to it. Finding \u2018internal champions\u2019 who are passionate about the social web can help translate executive feedback and concerns into a coherent organisational direction. Another method of encouraging internal stakeholders is to make the social media strategy as user-friendly as possible with clear benchmarking incorporated to demonstrate the progress of people\u2019s efforts to engage with civil society organizations online. Foster In-Depth Engagement It is advisable that the EESC focuses on depth of engagement when interacting with civil society organizations online. This is a measure of how engaged civil society organizations are with the EESC\u2019s content and not solely on how many social media users are engaged. There is evidence, as outlined previously in this study, to suggest that people are resistant to receiving social media content in a top-down fashion in a modern participatory economy. One way of forging in-depth engagement is to create compelling content that is communicated in an effective way that resonates with civil society organizations on the most appropriate social media platform. An example of this is seen by the work of the French trade union La CGT with the release of its interactive web portal and mobile sites for users to engage with the organization. ",
        "28 Figure 11: La CGT Mobile Banner Source: La CGT Adopt A Variety of Engagement Methods It is imperative that a comprehensive exploration of rhetorical styles and other tactics used to engage with social media users be undertaken, along with other methods such as gamification and innovative multimedia content sharing. An example of this is seen in the use of online games developed by the FGMM/CFDT trade union. The game, which is designed to help young people become better acquainted with the process of securing employment, is supported by a blog and specific social media presence on Facebook and Twitter for the game. Figure 12: Le Blog d\u2019Eloise Employment Game Source: F\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Mines et de la M\u00e9tallurgie (FGMM) / Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise D\u00e9mocratique du Travail (CFDT) Promote EESC Projects on Social Media More Emphatically It is imperative that the EESC demonstrates clearer ownership and involvement in their own projects, and does more to promote its involvement within these projects across social media platforms and channels. Such promotion will help build discussion and engagement outside the immediate network in which the EESC resides, to include other organizations from different communities of interest and build bridges with such organizations. This would help increase the reach of the EESC\u2019s digital network. An example of this is seen in the \u201chighlights\u201d page from the Avaaz website in which success stories from the various campaigns and petitions organized by Avaaz are listed for interested persons to view. Content such as this serves to foster a strong sense of achievement and camaraderie amongst stakeholders involved with the site as they have a direct link to the impact of their work. The EESC could implement similar content in its social media profiles and, in the process, foster a growing community of loyal, influential ambassadors. ",
        "29 Increase Focus on Influencers When seeking increased social media engagement, the EESC should focus on deriving the insights and contributions of uniquely qualified minds within the stakeholder community and not simply focus on gaining a mass of contributions from numerous people. This is because passion for social media engagement and collaboration is not evenly distributed across the entire population; rather, it is concentrated in small pockets of evangelists whose influence can sway public opinion. An example of this is to utilise the influence of uniquely positioned people to advocate or contribute positive content to the EESC\u2019s profile. Such \u201cstar power\u201d can be seen in the work of the organisations Fondation Abb\u00e9 Pierre and Restos du Coeur which use the words of their well-known founders to encourage today\u2019s communities to form connections in order to continue the work already completed. Figure 13: Abb\u00e9 Pierre Facebook page Source: Facebook ",
        "30 Establish the EESC Website as the Focal Point For Pressing Civil Society Issues Figure 14: Greenpeace Deutschland Page The EESC could position its website as a focal point for pressing issues within civil society. In this way, it could create a social newsroom for key EESC and EU social media activity. This portal could link currently isolated activities to the Flagship Initiatives of Europe 2020, enabling social media users to explore the issues raised from the initiative more deeply. This would increase traffic to the site and create a dynamic platform for social media exchange, as, currently, Europe 2020 offers users the opportunity to share its content across social media platforms, but does not appear to be engaging in social media itself. An example of organizations that have found success in re-formatting their websites as news hubs is seen by Greenpeace Germany. Greenpeace\u2019s homepage also functions as a news hub which displays the latest headlines from their articles, the latest tweets and blog posts (this is also a dynamic element where posts changes in real-time) as well as other short headlines from their range of social media sites.
