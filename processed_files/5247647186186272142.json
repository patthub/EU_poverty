        "What this report is about Decentralised EU agencies and other bodies are important drivers of the successful implementation of the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda. This report presents their contribution to the priorities set out in the Union\u2019s strategic guidelines. This is illustrated by showing how agencies deliver benefits to EU citizens across various themes of their everyday lives. Since the 1990s, the European Union and Member States have set up specialised bodies which are decentralised from the historical core location of the EU administration. The 37 EU decentralised agencies 1 , 7 European joint undertakings and other bodies in the scope of this report (hereafter: \u2018agencies\u2019) are located across many Member States in order to bring Europe closer to citizens. They help the European Institutions make decisions and implement policies thanks to their expertise in specialised areas. The agencies were created to respond to a particular need. Each of them carries out legal, technical and scientific activities and tasks in various areas, ranging from transport to security, from energy to health or from financial services to telecoms. They have an impact on the everyday life of more than 500 million European citizens. Agencies have gained visibility by taking on an increasingly important role in the activities of the EU. Overall, the 2015 budget of the 44 agencies represents less than 0.8% of the EU\u2019s total budget (about \u20ac1.2 billion) 3 , and their workforce amounts to about 5,500 staff in 2016 4 . In order to achieve even more benefits for the citizens, they collaborate within the EU Agencies Network (EUAN). The Network is currently composed of 44 EU agencies and cooperates closely with European Institutions and Member States. Challenges facing the Union and Member States include recovery from the 2008-2012 economic and financial crisis, the migration crisis, internal and external security threats, and climate change. EU agencies play a key role in implementing measures to respond to these challenges. They coordinate and pool together scientific and technical expertise and resources from European Institutions, national governments, authorities and industry. As a result, the EU can capitalise on the value agencies add in order to implement the strategic goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy and of the Juncker Commission Agenda. The action of several agencies also has an external dimension. In particular, some of them encourage the development of international standards which bring value to the rest of the world. The purpose of this report is to present the benefits of EU agencies in a clear and understandable way to a range of audiences, including citizens, members of the European Parliament and stakeholders and beneficiaries of agencies\u2019 services. Its aim is not to evaluate the performance of individual agencies but to explain and illustrate the contribution they make to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda \u2013 which in turn allows them to work towards the improvement of citizens\u2019 everyday lives. 1 ACER, BEREC Office, CdT, CPVO, CEDEFOP, CEPOL, EASA, EASO, EBA, ECDC, ECHA, EDA, EEA, EFCA, EFSA, EIGE, EIOPA, EMA, EMCDDA, EMSA, ENISA, ERA, ESMA, ETF, EUIPO, EUISS, Eurofound, Eurojust, EUROPOL, eu-LISA, EU- OSHA, FRA, FRONTEX, EIT, GSA, SatCen, SRB. 2 Joint undertakings \u2013 namely BBI JU, Clean Sky 2 JU, FCH JU, F4E, IMI 2 JU, SESAR JU, S2R JU - are collaborative structures set up for the \u201cefficient execution of Union research, technological development and demonstration programmes\u201d under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 3 Consolidated annual accounts of the European Union \u2013 Financial year 2015, p. 33, http://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/ documents/2015/EU_AnnualAccounts2015_ EN.pdf, consulted on 1 September 2016. 4 Budgets \u2013 Definitive adoption (EU, Euratom) 2016/150 of the European Union\u2019s general budget for the financial year 2016, p. 152, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2016:048:FULL&from=E, consulted on 1 September 2016.

        "This report reviews the contribution of the 44 agencies of the EU Agencies Network against two major strategies setting the tone and direction for Europe in the last decade: the Europe 2020 Strategy, elaborated by the Barroso in 2010, and the Juncker Commission Agenda, published in July 2014. Agencies' contribution is analysed based on their missions, strategic objectives and actions as defined in their Founding Regulations and translated into their Annual Work Programmes and Annual Activity Reports. The first section of the report presents the background to the EU\u2019s strategic objectives set out by the EU Treaties, the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda. It establishes the methodological approach chosen for the analysis, namely the Value Map of the EU agencies. The second part of the report provides the analysis of agencies\u2019 contribution to the objectives of the two EU strategies according to five themes that cover several key aspects of citizens\u2019 everyday lives: \u2022 Ensuring an area of freedom, security and justice, \u2022 Supervising financial systems, \u2022 Supporting EU businesses and innovation (including separate sections on innovation, energy, transport and digital connectivity), \u2022 Fostering citizens\u2019 well-being (including separate sections on citizens\u2019 protection and skills and education), \u2022 Providing security and defence. The concluding chapter summarises this analysis and the agencies\u2019 contributions to innovation, growth, jobs, the digital society, the internal market, climate change and energy policies, the economic and monetary union, justice and fundamental rights, the migration agenda, and Europe\u2019s external policies. Finally, the annexes contain a detailed analysis of the contribution of each of the 44 agencies to the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda.

        "The Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda In order to understand the contribution of agencies to the European Union\u2019s work, it is important to also understand the Union\u2019s purpose and strategic objectives. These have evolved in order to address new challenges and to respond to unexpected crises, while ensuring overall coherence with Member States\u2019 common evolution. For the purpose of this report, the overall objectives of the European Union are illustrated at three levels: the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Europe 2020 Strategy, and the Juncker Commission Agenda. How do EU agencies contribute to the Europe 2020 Strategy and to the Juncker Commission Agenda? 5 ",
        "The Treaty of the European Union: the EU\u2019s overall objectives and focus The foundations of the Union\u2019s actions are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union 5 \u2013 (hereafter: TEU) as amended by the 2009 Lisbon Treaty; the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 6 \u2013 hereafter: TFEU). The Treaty sets the foundation for the Member States\u2019 common evolution by defining principles, values and objectives that all peoples and citizens of the Union may claim equally.. In short, the Treaty defines the common principles and values binding Member States and the overall objectives for which they confer competences to the supranational level. It also defines the respective spheres of competence framing the cooperation between the Union and Member States and the policy areas in which this cooperation is implemented. Lastly, it defines the institutional framework organising the Union\u2019s actions and identifies the areas in which its intervention is foreseen.. Article 3 of the TEU sets out the overall objectives, which form the basis for EU agencies\u2019 raison d\u2019\u00eatre : \u2022 Promoting peace and the well-being of citizens in Europe; \u2022 Building and sustaining an area of freedom, security and justice; \u2022 Establishing an efficient and sustainable internal market; \u2022 Establishing an economic and monetary union whose currency is the euro; \u2022 Upholding and promoting the Union\u2019s values in its relations with the wider world. The Europe 2020 Strategy: Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth In the aftermath of the 2008 economic and financial crisis and the high level of unemployment and pressure on social cohesion it created, the Europe 2020 Strategy was drawn up by the European Commission in March 2010. The uncertain and turbulent times the Union has faced since the beginning of the economic and financial crisis has led the European Commission to elaborate on the short- and long-term priorities that guide the strategic and tactical objectives and actions of the EU Institutions. These constitute the framework, from the top level of the Europe 2020 Strategy pillars down to the strategic activities implemented by the EU agencies, enabling the reflection on how those bring value to the peoples and citizens of Europe. The Europe 2020 Strategy essentially focuses on two of the five overall objectives \u2013 the internal market and the economic and monetary union. It targets Smart , Sustainable and Inclusive Growth : t hree mutually reinforcing priorities with the ultimate objective of delivering high levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion. The implementation and monitoring of the Europe 2020 Strategy is guided and steered via five interrelated headline targets, quantitative indicators and objectives towards investment in research and development, employment, energy efficiency, education and reduction of poverty. The ambitions and objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy are translated into initiatives focused on a variety of policy areas and specific key actions to which many agencies contribute. EU Policy Focus Areas Articles 2 to 6 of the TFEU establish the policy areas of focus with a view to achieving the objectives set by the Treaty. \u2022 Internal market, including the establishment of the competition rules necessary for its proper functioning; Monetary policy for the Member States whose currency is the euro; \u2022 Conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy; \u2022 Common commercial policy; \u2022 Social policy; \u2022 Economic, social and territorial cohesion; \u2022 Agriculture and fisheries; \u2022 Environment; \u2022 Consumer protection; \u2022 Transport; \u2022 Trans-European networks; \u2022 Energy; \u2022 Freedom, security and justice; \u2022 Common safety concerns in public health matters; \u2022 Research, technological development and space; \u2022 Development cooperation and humanitarian aid; \u2022 Economic policies within the Union \u2022 Protection and improvement of human health; \u2022 Industry; \u2022 Culture; \u2022 Education, vocational training, youth and sport; \u2022 Civil protection; \u2022 Common foreign and security policy, including a common defence policy; \u2022 Administrative cooperation 5 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0013:0045:en:PDF , consulted on 25 May 2016. 6 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT, consulted on 25 May 2016.

        "Sustainable Growth Promoting a more resource-efficient, greener and more competitive economy Sustainable Growth addresses the challenges inherent to building a resource- efficient, sustainable and competitive economy. Europe has ambitions to become a leader in the development of new processes and technologies \u2013 including green technologies \u2013and acknowledges the importance of fostering its advanced knowledge of ICT, exploiting EU-scale networks, reinforcing the competitive advantage of its businesses and assistance to consumers. This approach strives to meet the constraints and challenges of a low-carbon, resource-constrained world \u2013 while preventing environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and unsustainable use of resources.

        "1 A new boost for jobs, growth and investment The objective of this cross-cutting priority is the mobilisation of up to \u20ac300 billion of public and private investment in the real economy between 2015 and 2017. This constitutes additional funds to be invested in infrastructure, education, research, innovation and energy efficiency. In that respect, the Juncker Commission Agenda feeds into all of the Europe 2020 Strategy areas of action: innovation, education, training and life-long learning, digital society, competitiveness, employment, skills and fighting poverty. Moreover, these goals correspond to the Europe 2020 Strategy objective of investing 3% of the EU GDP in R&D. They are also in line with the Europe 2020 Strategy targets in terms of encouraging education, boosting employment and fighting poverty. 2 A connected Digital Single Market This priority aims at creating a connected Digital Single Market which is expected to generate up to \u20ac250 billion of additional growth and hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout the Union up to 2020. Reinforcement of data protection, telecommunication and copyright rules are set to increase the use of digital technologies and online services.. 3 A resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy This priority entails increasing the Union\u2019s energy efficiency by pooling resources, combining infrastructures and uniting Member States\u2019 negotiating powers vis-\u00e0-vis third country suppliers. Development of renewable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency are also included in this objective. 4 A deeper and fairer Internal market with a strengthened industrial base This priority aims at increasing the weight of industry in the EU GDP to 20% by 2020, thereby ensuring that Europe remains a global leader in strategic sectors with high-value jobs. In order to enable this, the EU should, amongst other things, invest in new technologies, facilitate access to markets and finance, and ensure that workers have the skills industry needs. This priority also aims at stricter controls on banks within a Capital Markets Union and at further facilitating the free movement of workers, while combatting tax evasion, tax fraud and money laundering. 5 A deeper and fairer Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) This priority targets the reform of the EMU and the re-balancing of the way conditional stability support is granted to Eurozone Member States in difficulty. In particular, it aims at replacing the \u201ctroika\u201d 7 with a more legitimate and accountable structure with increased parliamentary oversight at EU and national levels. This objective also foresees the inclusion of a social impact assessment in any support and reform programme. 6 A reasonable and balanced free trade agreement (FTA) with the US This priority targets the negotiation of a reasonable and balanced FTA with the United States, which would benefit the European economy by creating jobs and growth, while ensuring the protection of Europe\u2019s safety, health, social, cultural diversity and data protection standards. The European Commission\u2019s priorities The Juncker Commission Agenda The Juncker Commission Agenda was published in July 2014. It identifies ten key policy areas as part of an agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change.

        "7 An area of Justice and Fundamental Rights based on mutual trust This priority aims at reinforcing the Union as an area of justice and fundamental rights based on shared European values. This involves fighting discrimination, strengthening data protection, combating cross-border crime and terrorism, as well as increasing judicial cooperation among Member States. 8 Towards a new policy on migration This priority strives to address shortages of specific skills and the demographic challenges of the Union, a strong common asylum policy and a stronger stance on irregular migration and trafficking of human beings. These policies, based on a spirit of solidarity, aim to secure Europe\u2019s borders. 9 A stronger global actor This priority aims at asserting Europe\u2019s role on the global stage by integrating some defence capacities within a permanent-structured cooperation and increasing synergies in defence procurement between Member States. 10 A Union of Democratic change This priority involves setting up a political rather than technocratic dialogue between the EU institutions, citizens and national parliaments, as well as increasing transparency in the contact with stakeholders and lobbyists. This Union of Democratic Change also entails a review of the legislation applicable to the authorisation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This priority is thus cross- cutting and can be considered as a horizontal aim re-enforcing all other priorities. 7 The troika is a group of international lenders composed of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. EU agencies\u2019 strategic objectives and activities Each of the 44 agencies has a mandate to act in a variety of policy areas, in line with the European Commission\u2019s priorities that are presented above. Most agencies also operate in collaboration with other agencies and the European Commission Directorates- General at a cross-cutting level. The strategic objectives and key actions of each agency are defined in its founding acts and translated into its annual and multi-annual work programmes. Their implementation serves the effective and efficient execution of its mission and contributes to the realisation of the Juncker Commission priorities, the Europe 2020 strategic actions and ultimately the fundamental objectives of the Lisbon Treaty.

These are in general interrelated, and most EU agencies, bodies and offices operate in several areas. Juncker Commission priorities The Juncker Commission Agenda constitutes the policy framework guiding the actions of EU institutions and national governments for the period between 2014 and 2019. While it builds on the Europe 2020 Strategy (which focuses on economic objectives), it also covers a wider scope of policy areas, encompassing a total of ten priority areas. Strategic objectives and activities of EU agencies The strategic objectives and key actions of each agency are defined in its founding acts and translated into its annual and multi-annual work programmes. In most cases, the strategic objectives and activities of EU agencies connect with several EC priorities, several areas of EU actions and several pillars of the Europe 2020 Strategy, considered both at the level of the internal market and outside Europe\u2019s frontiers.

        "The contribution themes in a nutshell The contribution themes were defined in line with the different objectives stated in Article 3 of the Treaty on the European Union, which form the agencies\u2019 raison d\u2019\u00eatre (see the chapter: \u201cThe Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda\u201d). Moreover, other factors were taken into account, such as the existence of official networks of other forms of collaboration between agencies (e.g. the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies Network, the European Supervisory Authorities), the types of agencies (e.g. public-private partnerships, agencies under the Common Security and Defence Policy), as well as the current state of cooperation between agencies. It is also important to note that agencies were allocated to a contribution theme based on their primary mission and objectives with the purpose of facilitating the presentation of their contribution towards the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda. These contribution themes are used to structure the next sections presenting the contribution of EU agencies to the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda. Ensuring an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice The EU Justice and Home Affairs Agencies Network (composed of Frontex , eu-LISA , EASO , EIGE , EMCDDA , CEPOL , Europol , FRA and Eurojust ) helps build and sustain an area of freedom, security and justice where free movement of people is guaranteed. These agencies contribute to increasing judicial and police cooperation in Europe, raising awareness on gender equality and the respect of fundamental rights, the fight against serious cross-border crime and terrorism, and better cooperation on external border management, migration and asylum. Supervising Financial Systems The supervision of financial systems enhances the protection of consumers of financial products and services. This is particularly important for the functioning of the internal market and in an economic and monetary union that shares a currency, the euro. EU agencies operating in this theme \u2013 EBA , EIOPA , ESMA and the SRB \u2013 work towards ensuring that the money consumers place or invest in financial products (e.g. bank accounts, pension funds, bonds, mortgages, etc.) is safe and that taxpayers will not bear the costs of any future financial crisis. Providing Security and Defence The Union strives to guarantee the security of EU citizens and to promote peace within and beyond its borders. The Juncker Commission Agenda also aims to increase the cooperation between Member States in the field of security and defence. The four Security and Defence agencies, EDA, EASA, GSA, EUISS and SatCen support the EU\u2019s external policy in achieving these goals in order to increase prosperity and safeguard democracy in the Union and abroad.

        "Fostering Citizens\u2019 Well-Being EU agencies contribute to promoting the well-being of citizens at two levels: Citizens' protection CdT , ECDC , ECHA , EEA , EFCA , EFSA , EMA , EU-OSHA and Eurofound aim to improve the protection of citizens in all their social and economic activities, within a sustainable and healthy environment. They provide scientific advice and support policy-makers to ensure the protection of European consumers, patients and workers through safe medicines, chemicals, products, food. Education and Skills Cedefop and ETF promote the development of skills and education in all Member States, in particular to match the evolving needs of the labour market. Supporting EU Businesses and Innovation An efficient and sustainable internal market is paramount to growth, employment, competition, quality of the environment and scientific progress in Europe. Its achievement entails addressing challenges in four areas in particular: digital connectivity, energy, innovation and transport. Digital connectivity BEREC Office, ENISA and GSA contribute to creating a connected Digital Single Market by helping establish efficient telecommunications networks and services for European citizens and businesses. Energy ACER, BBI JU, the EIT, FCH JU and F4E participate in ensuring safe, affordable and environmentally friendly energy for all European citizens. They strive to offer EU citizens and companies fair energy prices, the choice between energy providers, continued supply of affordable energy, sustainable, cleaner sources of energy, competitiveness within the European energy sector and limited polluting emissions for a cleaner environment. Innovation BBI JU, Cedefop, Clean Sky 2 JU, CPVO, the EIT, ETF, EUIPO, FCH JU, F4E, GSA, IMI 2 JU, SESAR JU and S2R JU contribute to creating an environment conducive to innovation and investment in Europe.

        "Background The EU offers its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice, which constitutes one of the fundamental objectives of the Union as put forward in the Lisbon Treaty. However, the elimination of internal border controls is accompanied by compensatory measures to ensure the security of all citizens. The idea of more cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs dates back to the 1970s with the first move towards more police cooperation to fight terrorism. The 1980s witnessed the start of the dismantling of the internal borders between five EU Member States with the signing of the Schengen Agreement in 1985. Since its foundation, the \u2018Schengen Area\u2019 has gradually been expanded and currently covers 26 states, four of which are not part of the EU. Within the Schengen area, people can move freely across internal borders without border control. However, the removal of these controls requires the adoption of other provisions to ensure and maintain security within the area. External borders need to be managed. This includes policies on border checks, asylum and immigration, and judicial and police cooperation that need to apply to the 44,000 km of external sea borders and the almost 9,000 km of land borders along which the Schengen area currently extends. The area of freedom, security and justice was incorporated into the European Treaties as of 1993, with the Maastricht Treaty. Since 2007, it is part of the European Union, together with the Schengen acquis . It allows an \u2018opt out\u2019 for the United Kingdom and Ireland, whereas Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are candidate countries. Article 3(2) TEU states that \u201cthe Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime\u201d. Moreover, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is legally binding on the EU. This Charter is a single document that defines the personal, civil, political, economic and social rights of EU citizens. Agencies\u2019 contribution to the area of Justice and Fundamental Rights Agencies contribute to the area of justice and fundamental rights in multiple ways. FRA provides evidence and raises awareness on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU, and offers access to effective remedies where rights are violated; EIGE focuses more in particular on equality between men and women in political and economic life. Eurojust, Europol and CEPOL work towards enhancing judicial and police cooperation, hence contributing to security in Europe. Fundamental rights are an important value of the EU. It is all about safeguarding the minimum requirements that need to be respected so that every person can be treated with dignity. Justice, gender and consumer equality include principles \u2013 such as democracy, freedom, tolerance, the rule of law \u2013 that are key to citizens\u2019 everyday lives. Fundamental rights FRA issues opinions and formulates advice in the domain of fundamental rights for policy-making and legislative processes. It does this through the collection and analysis of data \u2013 ranging from legal analysis through to social statistics. This includes the creation of large-scale survey data on different groups in the population and pressing fundamental rights issues as they relate to EU policies. The purpose is to ensure that the fundamental rights of all people living in the European Union are protected, respected and fulfilled. The promotion of fundamental rights underpin many aspects of the Single Market and Europe 2020, and hence support Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth respecting fundamental rights. EIGE focuses on gender equality, gender mainstreaming and raises citizens\u2019 awareness on gender equality issues. Gender mainstreaming refers to the In 2015, FRA carried out the second EU-wide survey of experiences of discrimination and victimisation of immigrants and ethnic minorities (EU- MIDIS II): about 25,000 people from immigrant and ethnic minority groups participated.

        "incorporation of gender considerations into all policy-making processes. The participation of women in economic and political life is of paramount importance to meet the Europe 2020 Strategy\u2019s employment targets, hence fighting poverty and bringing economic growth. FRA and EIGE work together on the topic of the eradication of violence against women. They also collaborate in this respect with other agencies such as Eurofound and EU-OSHA . Justice and the fight against cross- border crime In the field of justice, Eurojust strives to strengthen judicial cooperation and coordination to fight serious cross- border crime and terrorism. Eurojust supports the coordination of cross-border investigations and prosecutions, and ensures the gathering of evidence for court proceedings. Eurojust \u2019s coordination meetings bring together judicial and law enforcement authorities from Member States and third States to resolve legal and practical difficulties resulting from the 30 existing different legal frameworks of the EU and beyond. Its coordination centres enable real-time exchange of information and simultaneous execution of investigative measures. Eurojust offers legal expertise to Member States\u2019 competent national authorities through facilitating the application of EU legal instruments. Examples include the European Arrest Warrant, the European Investigation Order, and joint investigation teams. Europol also contributes to combating serious cross-border crime and terrorism. It functions as a support centre for Member States\u2019 law enforcement authorities, and as a criminal information hub by exchanging and analysing criminal intelligence. The agency focuses on terrorism and online radicalisation, cybercrime, migrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings, illicit drugs, mobile organised groups, cigarette smuggling, intellectual property crime, VAT fraud and money laundering. These matters are also supported indirectly by CEPOL that provides training to law enforcement officers in order to enhance police cooperation in Europe. EMCDDA works together with Europol , Eurojust and CEPOL on the specific issues of drug trafficking. The agencies working in the field of migration and asylum, such as EASO , also contribute to the fundamental rights theme by helping EU Member States to fulfil their international obligations in this respect. Moreover, EASO supports cooperation among Member States on matters related to vulnerable applicants, such as children and unaccompanied minors, \u201cvictims of torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment, persons at risk because of their gender, gender identity or sexual orientation and any other groups of applicants with special needs\u201d 8 . This aim is also followed by Frontex . In its daily activities, it provides assistance to vulnerable groups. The agency identifies vulnerable groups in the mixed migratory flows passing the external border and rescues them when in distress at sea. Frontex organises dedicated joint operations and provides training to border guards on identifying people in need of protection and the fight against trafficking in human beings. EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index 2015 shows a slight advance in gender equality between 2005 and 2012: the score for the 28 EU Member States rose from 51.2 in 2005 to 52.9 (out of 100) in 2012, showing that the EU remains only halfway towards gender equality. A total of 98 Joint Actions were coordinated by Europol in 2015. The biggest coordination effort targeted Illegal Immigration, Trafficking in Human Beings, Drugs and Organised Property Crime and resulted in successful operational outcomes, such as nearly 900 arrests, the seizure of 7.7 tons of drugs, 1,400 tons of stolen metal, 190 tons of counterfeit pesticides, \u20ac136k in cash and the confiscation of 254 vehicles.

        "Agencies\u2019 Contribution to a new policy on migration EASO, Frontex, eu-LISA, Eurojust and Europol help to ensure the free movement of people within the Schengen area. The focus is on enhancing coordination of external border management, dealing with migration flows and promoting the common asylum system. Many agencies contribute to migration and asylum priorities. They help Member States and third countries cater for asylum seekers and refugees, often in emergency situations, in the framework of a Common European Asylum System (CEAS). Moreover, some of these agencies work on securing Europe\u2019s borders, combatting serious and organised crime and facilitating migration and asylum flows and processes. EASO works towards the coherent implementation of the Common European Asylum System, with the objective of ensuring that the EU functions as a single area as far as asylum is concerned, by adopting common practices and processes. As such, similar cases are treated in a similar way and result in a similar outcome in all EU member states. In order to fulfil its mission, EASO provides training to asylum and reception officers; special and emergency support to EU+ countries 9 with specific needs or whose asylum and reception systems are under particular pressure; and last but not least information on the flows of asylum seekers and Member States\u2019 capacity to respond to them. Frontex works towards more coordination between EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries 10 in order to establish common rules, standards and procedures for external border control. The agency provides technical and operational assistance to Member States through joint operations and rapid border interventions, and ensures the practical execution of measures in a situation requiring urgent action at the external borders. Frontex deploys technical equipment and border guards from Member States to patrol, carries out border checks and collects data on cross-border crime. Frontex also provides technical and operational assistance in the support of search and rescue operations for persons in distress at sea. The agency also organises, coordinates and conducts the return operations of third-country nationals who have received a legal decision to leave EU territory. It carries out risk analyses and monitors the situation at external borders in order to identify potential threats, risks and vulnerabilities. It organises training to enhance the harmonisation of border control goals, methods, standards and terminology. Through their activities to combat serious cross-border crime and terrorism, Europol and Eurojust also work in the field of migration and asylum. The European Migrant Smuggling Centre at Europol provides, among others, on-the spot analytical and investigation support to disrupt the activities of criminal networks in relation to migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings. Additionally, Europol can deploy, upon request, guest officers from Member States to perform secondary security checks. Eurojust supports investigations, prosecutions and on-the- spot operations to disrupt the activities of criminal networks in relation to trafficking of human beings, as well as to combat illegal immigration. CEPOL organises training for law enforcement officers on these topics to increase cooperation and enhance policing in Europe. FRA promotes fundamental rights in various aspects of border management and asylum. eu-LISA ensures the 24/7/365 functioning of the European Union\u2019s (EU) largest IT systems and their respective communication infrastructures in the area of freedom, security and justice: Eurodac, SIS II and VIS. With information technology, eu-LISA safeguards the EU\u2019s internal security and supports the implementation of asylum, migration and border management policies. In 2015, Frontex contributed to the rescue of more than 250,000 people at sea. It deployed 15 vessels along with several helicopters and planes in Italy, and 17 vessels along with aerial means in Greece. 8 EASO Work Programme 2016 \u2013 Rev. 2, p. 25. 9 European Union Member States plus Switzerland and Norway. 10 Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.

        "European \u2018Hotspots\u2019 The \u2018Hotspot approach\u2019 was presented by the European Commission in May 2015 in its European Agenda on Migration. The objective is to help Member States that face exceptional migratory pressure at the EU\u2019s external borders. Since May 2015, the Hotspot approach has been implemented in different places in Italy and in Greece. It is the result of the close collaboration between four EU Agencies: EASO , Frontex , Europol and Eurojust . The agencies provide the authorities of the concerned Member States with on-the-spot support to identify, register and fingerprint incoming asylum seekers. In addition, FRA has - with the support of the Commission - been engaged in the hotspots to assist with the identification of fundamental rights compliance needs. EASO helps teams support the provision of information, registration, identification and referral of asylum seekers, whereas Frontex is in charge of coordinating the return operations of migrants whose asylum application was refused, irregular migrants or persons with no right to remain in the EU. Moreover, Frontex deployed experts and technical resources from other Member States within joint maritime operations who have contributed to sea border surveillance, search and rescue of persons in distress, land coastal patrolling, screening, identification and registration of persons, etc. EASO is also supporting the implementation of relocation of applicants for international protection from Greece and Italy. In Greece, EASO has been supporting the admissibility procedure and more recently eligibility within the context of the EU-Turkey Statement. Europol and Eurojust provide the Member States with analytical and investigation support to dismantle smuggling and trafficking in human beings networks. Europol can deploy guest officers from other Member States to perform secondary security checks. National prosecutors have been appointed as Eurojust \u2019s contact points to support the hotspot locations and to channel relevant information and cases to Eurojust \u2019s national desks for judicial follow-up and coordination at EU level. Moreover, eu-LISA supports the activities of Member States working within the Hotspots by providing large-scale IT systems and databases, such as Eurodac, the fingerprint database used for processing asylum applications and determining the country responsible for handling the application. eu-LISA manages the central systems of three large scale IT systems: \u2022 Eurodac The European Asylum Dactyloscopy (fingerprint) database, Eurodac, helps Member States and Associated Countries 11 to manage asylum applications. It is a European database that stores and processes the digitalised fingerprints of asylum seekers and irregular migrants who have entered a European country. This helps determine the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application. \u2022 Schengen Information System II (SIS II) The second-generation Schengen Information System is a large-scale IT system that supports the exchange of information on people and objects between national police, border control, customs, visa, migration and vehicle registration and judicial authorities. Since people and goods can move throughout the Schengen Area without being checked at internal borders, SIS II is a tool used to ensure internal security in Europe. \u2022 Visa Information System (VIS) VIS supports the implementation of the EU\u2019s common visa policy and facilitates border checks. The system enables dedicated national authorities and Europol to enter and consult data, including biometrics, for short-stay visa requests to access the Schengen Area. 11 Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland 24 ",
        "The agencies work together on migration, asylum and border management priorities to increase the efficiency of their actions and exploit synergies. For example, they collaborate on specific issues, such as support to vulnerable groups of migrants. FRA also provides key research evidence and input to the work of these Agencies with respect to the fundamental rights of asylum seekers and migrants, in particular as regards vulnerable groups such as children, women and persons with disabilities \u2013 for example, by providing targeted input to training material as well as direct training, and through research collaboration. Together, these Agencies also organise specific actions, such as the \u2018Hotspot\u2019 approach in which EASO , Frontex , Europol and Eurojust participate Freedom, Security and Justice Agencies also collaborate with other agencies, including SatCen , which provides satellite images for border surveillance, and EMSA and EFCA as far as maritime surveillance is concerned. Agencies\u2019 Contribution to a safer and healthier Internal Market Within the Justice and Home Affairs Network, a special focus is given to drugs and drug addiction through the work of the EMCDDA, which contributes to citizens\u2019 safety and health. The (cid:40)(cid:48)(cid:38)(cid:39)(cid:39)(cid:36) \u2019s purpose is to support sound decisions and actions at EU and national level by providing factual, objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences. In this way, it aims to contribute to a more secure and healthier Europe. Independent, science-based information is a vital resource to help Europe understand the nature of its drug problems and better respond to them. The EMCDDA not only offers policymakers the data they need for drawing up informed drug laws and strategies. It also helps professionals and practitioners working in the field pinpoint best practice and new areas of research. The EMCDDA works together with Europol , Eurojust and CEPOL on drug trafficking issues. One of the agency\u2019s key tasks is to detect new drugs appearing on the European market that could pose health risks to European citizens. In cooperation with Europol , EMA (the European Medicines Agency), the European Commission and EU Member States, it carries out early-warning and risk- assessment activities that may pave the way for legal controls. On 15 December 2015, eu-LISA\u2019s Visa Information System (VIS) processed its 20,000,000th visa application. The fee of these applications amount to around \u20ac1.0 billion in non-fiscal revenues for Member States since operations began on 11 October 2011. In 2015, 98 new psychoactive substances (NPS) were reported for the first time within Europe. This brings the total number of NPS monitored by the EMCDDA to more than 560, and more than half of these were reported in the last three years alone.

        "Background Learning from the experience of the financial and economic crisis of 2007-2008, the EU set a priority to reinforce the supervision of financial institutions. Financial institutions include banks, insurance companies, pension funds and other financial institutions (such as credit rating agencies). Three agencies were created to take part in this objective. The purpose is to prevent another similar crisis and its adverse effects on citizens. The financial and economic crisis of 2007-2008 revealed shortcomings in the supervision of financial services institutions. Supervision was performed by national authorities. This national approach to supervision did not reflect the reality of financial globalisation and interconnected European financial markets, where many institutions carry out cross- border operations. The crisis emphasised the weaknesses of the model, such as the lack of cooperation, coordination and trust between national supervisors, and the inconsistent application of EU law across Member States. Moreover, the financial and economic crisis put the stability of the financial system under severe strain and posed serious risks to the functioning of the internal market. Restoring and maintaining a stable and reliable financial system is therefore a necessary condition for rebuilding and preserving trust in the internal market, and, in the end, fostering sustainable economic growth through regained market confidence. In this respect, the European Institutions called for a more integrated European supervision of financial markets, to enhance the protection of consumers of financial products and services and to re- instil trust in the financial system. The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), as part of the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) The European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) was established with the purpose of ensuring consistent and coherent micro- and macro-prudential financial supervision 12 in the EU. The micro-prudential supervision is carried out by: \u2022 The three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) founded in 2011, i.e. the EBA , EIOPA and ESMA ; \u2022 The Joint Committee of the ESAs; \u2022 The National Competent Authorities (NCAs). The macro-prudential oversight is conducted at EU level by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) which comprises the European Central Bank (ECB), the national central banks, the ESAs and the European Commission. The ESFS works as an integrated network towards the efficient functioning of the Single Market, through its actions regarding the harmonisation of the regulatory and supervisory framework and its equal and coherent application across Europe. While the day-to-day supervision of the financial institutions mainly remains at a national level, the three ESAs bring EU- wide uniformity of rules and harmonise supervisory approaches across the EU. The ESFS\u2019s purpose is therefore to link national supervisors within a strong EU network. The ESFS also collaborates with other financial supervisory networks, such as the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). In 2015 EIOPA worked on the finalisation of the Insurance Single Rulebook, producing the 2 nd set of Solvency II technical standards and guidelines. 12 The micro-prudential supervision is the supervision of individual institutions, while the macro-prudential supervision focuses on system-wide risks to financial stability.

        "The ESAs\u2019 contribution to an efficient functioning of the Single Market One of the main purposes of the three agencies is to protect the citizen when he/she consumes financial services and products (e.g. by taking out a loan or a mortgage, taking out an insurance policy, depositing money in a bank account, buying shares and bonds or transferring money). These agencies strive to ensure that consumers buy financial services and products according to their risk profile and that unfair products and services are prohibited. Moreover, they want to make sure that financial institutions are capable of respecting their contractual commitments and do not become insolvent. In this respect, the agencies enhance consumer protection by the early detection of consumer detriment, develop sound regulation, ensure its common application across Europe, and promote prudent common supervisory practices. Through their contribution to the integrity and stability of the financial system, the transparency of markets and financial products and the protection of consumers, the three European Supervisory Authorities act towards the improvement of the functioning of the internal market. Their main activities can be categorised into four themes. A. Regulatory work. The ESAs contribute to the achievement of an effective European level playing field in each of their respective areas of responsibility \u2013 i.e. banking, securities and markets, and insurances and occupational pensions \u2013 by elaborating a single rulebook applicable to all financial institutions in the internal market. They develop technical standards and guidelines that need to be applied in a coherent manner in the Member States and by this means, lay the basis for supervision. They also provide technical advice and opinions to the EU Institutions in the area of their competence. B. Supervisory convergence. The ESAs promote supervisory convergence across the Member States and coordinate international supervision of cross- border groups. This creates a common supervisory culture that benefits the economy. They ensure high quality, effective and consistent supervision of financial institutions. They also prevent regulatory arbitrage, a practice in which financial institutions might seek to avoid unfavourable regulation by geographic relocation. C. Risk assessment. The ESAs monitor and assess market developments in their area of responsibility in order to identify micro-prudential trends and potential risks and vulnerabilities. They may (temporarily) prohibit or restrict financial products or activities that could jeopardise the orderly Consumer protection: Information for investors across the financial sector The Regulation on Key Information Documents for Packaged Retail and Insurance-Based Investment Products (PRIIPS) adopted in 2014 introduced the new Key Information Document (KID). The KID is a simple, standardised document which is designed to present the main features of an investment product in a consumer-friendly manner, allowing consumers across the EU to compare investment-linked insurance policies, investment funds and investment products. EBA, EIOPA and ESMA have jointly produced a number of technical standards specifying the exact contents of the KID: it must outline the product\u2019s aims, how risky it is, when investors can get their money back, how much it costs and its expected returns. All of this information must be set out in a standard way, regardless of the type of investment product. The main objective of KID is to enhance consumer protection and trust in the financial markets, which in return could contribute to growth and investment in Europe. The EBA established a Single Rulebook for banking, including 117 technical standards and 46 guidelines.

        "functioning of the financial markets as well as the integrity and stability of the financial system. D. Consumer Protection . Through their activities in the field of regulation, supervisory convergence and risk analysis, the ESAs promote transparency, simplicity and fairness of financial products and services in the internal market. This protects the consumers of these products and services, be it depositors, investors, policyholders or pension scheme members and beneficiaries. In order to carry out these four core tasks and ensure consistency in their approach, EBA , EIOPA and ESMA cooperate and coordinate their efforts under the coordination of a Joint Committee. The Joint Committee of the ESAs conducts cross- sectoral risk assessment and proceeds with joint regulatory work, for example in the field of anti-money laundering or financial conglomerates. It also contributes to the exchange of information with the ESRB, which carries out macro-prudential oversight, and to the development of the relationships between the ESAs and the ESRB. Agencies\u2019 contribution to the completion of the Financial Union and to a deeper Economic and Monetary Union (which in turn will promote competitiveness) On top of the measures that have been discussed, two additional actions have been taken. The Banking Union is being created as an additional step in the protection of citizens. One of the purposes of this Union is to ensure that banks are robust and that customers will not pay the cost of failing banks. Second, the Capital Markets union is to be created to strengthen the free movement of capital. The Capital Markets Union would enable citizens who want to develop and invest to access funding from other sources than the traditional banking sector, hence fostering the creation of jobs and growth. The Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union are planned to further evolve in the coming years. The so-called \u201cFive Presidents\u2019 Report\u201d 14 presents a roadmap towards the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in order to create a better and fairer life for citizens as well as increase competitiveness in the euro area. It lays a process in two consecutive stages that implies progress in the fields of Economic, Financial, Fiscal and Political Unions. A deeper EMU goes hand in hand with the completion of the Financial Union: they are complementary and mutually reinforcing. As demonstrated during the financial and economic crisis, if no single financial system exists, the monetary policies are not applied uniformly across Member States. As such, the completion of the Financial Union not only helps to deepen the EMU but also supports the completion of the internal market for financial services. It comprises two main components in which financial services agencies participate. 1. Completing the Banking Union The Banking Union aims to further integrate the controls on banks on top of what has already been put in place through the ESFS. In 2015 ESMA took enforcement action against 1 Credit Rating Agency (CRA) in respect of a number of infringements of the requirements of the CRA Regulation regarding governance and compliance. \u201cThe Banking Union is a way to better protect taxpayers from the cost of bank rescues.\u201d 13 Five Presidents\u2019 Report 13 Five Presidents' Report, p.11. 14 Completing Europe\u2019s Economic and Monetary Union, Jean-Claude Junker, Donald Tusk, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Mario Draghi and Martin Schulz, http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/economic-monetary-union/docs/5-presidents-report_en.pdf, consulted on 27 June 2016.

        "It comprises three elements. \u2022 The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) ensures the coherent and consistent supervision of credit institutions under the responsibility of the ECB. The EBA collaborates with the SSM mainly by providing tools to enhance regulatory and supervisory convergence and ensure consistent supervisory practices, comparable supervisory outcomes and compliance with EU rules. \u2022 The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) establishes and enforces an effective resolution regime and thus helps avoid further bank bailouts at the taxpayers\u2019 expense. The SRB is at the centre of the SRM, as a planning and decision-making body, and manages the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), a fund financed by the banking sector which could be used as a last resort when a credit institution is being restructured. \u2022 The European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) , still at the conceptual stage, could increase resilience in case of future crises. The SRB is closely involved in the technical and political discussions on its conception. The EBA has been collaborating with the SRB since its start in order to provide its experience of resolution planning in the EU. 2. Establishing the Capital Markets Union The Capital Markets Union (CMU) will deepen the internal market by developing the free movement of capital but will also benefit the euro area. It will ensure a greater diversity of financing and complement the traditional bank financing by better connecting investment projects to capital. By deepening the integration of capital markets, it will also reinforce cross-border risk-sharing, hence improving the capacity of the financial system to absorb shocks. The CMU will also reduce the cost of capital, hence increasing the competitiveness in the euro area. ESMA \u2019s main objectives of enhancing investor protection and promoting stable and orderly financial markets are in line with the CMU\u2019s goals. Through its four core activities, i.e. completing a single rulebook, promoting supervisory convergence, assessing risk and conducting direct supervision, the ESMA has already implemented actions that underpin the CMU and is ready to further collaborate in that direction. EIOPA \u2019s work regarding the development of a Standardised Pan- European Personal Pension Product would also contribute to the establishment of the CMU, by attracting more retirement saving that would increase the provision of long-term capital. Moreover, the tools and activities deployed by EIOPA to build and facilitate a common supervisory culture and enhance supervisory convergence in the field of insurances and occupational pensions also support this strategic objective of building a CMU through the achievement of better protection of the policyholders.

        "Innovation Creating an innovation-friendly environment in Europe Many EU agencies are dedicated to fostering an environment conducive to innovation and growth in Europe. All of them contribute to the Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth objectives of the Union. They do so by creating incentives for investment and innovation. Activities range from skills development, setting up collaborative research and innovation projects, to facilitating the market entry of innovative products and services and the protection of intellectual property rights. The agencies concerned include Cedefop, CPVO, the EIT, the ETF, EUIPO, GSA and joint undertakings (JU) in the fields of bio-based industries (BBI JU), air transport (Clean Sky 2 JU), fuel cells and hydrogen (FCH JU), Fusion for Energy (F4E), medicines (IMI 2 JU), Single European Sky air traffic management (SESAR JU) and rail (S2R JU).

        "Background Innovation is the cornerstone of the European Commission\u2019s strategy for fostering long-term growth, the creation of quality jobs in Europe and improving citizens\u2019 well-being. Innovation has become a major economic asset for countries and their citizens in the face of global competition and rapidly changing consumer needs. Barriers to innovation and its translation into new products and services need to be removed. Increasingly, the ability to innovate has become a main driver for competitiveness. The EU acknowledges the importance of innovation and promoting scientific and technological advances is one of its fundamental objectives 15 . To that end, the Europe 2020 Strategy set the objective of investing at least 3% of the European Union\u2019s GDP in research and development. However, several barriers prevent Europe from fully exploiting its potential for innovation: research efforts are spread between industry and academia, entry costs in nascent industries are sometimes high and the effectiveness with which specific skills and market demand are matched is often poor. Agencies address these challenges in multiple ways to boost innovation in the Union. Agencies\u2019 contribution to jobs, growth and investment EU agencies encourage investment in innovation and support Smart Growth in Europe. Their main focus is on developing entrepreneurial skills, supporting research programmes within public-private partnerships (PPP), increasing the performance of the European economy thanks to new technologies and protecting intellectual property rights. In this way, they contribute to creating jobs for Europeans. In line with the Europe 2020 objective of Smart Growth, agencies create incentives for investment in innovation in the Union. This involves contributing to improvements at each stage of the innovation process. Developing new skills is paramount to creating the innovators of tomorrow in Europe. For that purpose, Cedefop focuses on expanding and raising the skills of the European workforce through vocational education and training in line with changing research and labour market needs. For example, to support the green economy requires adapting skills at all levels and across many sectors. The ETF supports the development of similar skills in neighbouring countries. 15 Treaty on European Union, Article 3.3. Tackling the scourge of antimicrobial resistance Antibiotic-resistant bacteria kill 25,000 people in the EU every year and cost the European economy \u20ac1.5 billion. Without new antibiotics, we risk returning to an era where doctors are unable to treat many infections. The Innovative Medicines Initiative\u2019s \u20ac650 million New Drugs for Bad Bugs programme is addressing many of the challenges hampering the development of new antibiotics. The COMBACTE project has set up a pan-European network of clinical trial sites to make it easier to run clinical trials of new antibiotics. The network includes almost 800 hospitals in 36 countries, as well as over 500 laboratories. A number of trials of novel antibiotics designed to treat some of the toughest infections are now being carried out through the network.

        "The EIT works towards integrating business, higher education and research in order to foster an entrepreneurial culture among Europeans, while IMI 2 JU develops education and training projects for all those involved in the development of medicines. Collaboration between public and private actors within cross-sectoral knowledge communities is also key to reinforcing Europe\u2019s innovation capacities. Specific research and innovation programmes therefore pool resources and facilitate knowledge-sharing between a wide variety of stakeholders which do not traditionally work together: industry stakeholders and, particularly, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), research and technology centres, universities and Member States\u2019 representatives. The involvement of both the industry and research communities ensures that research is driven by industry needs and that the results translate efficiently into marketable outcomes for European companies, especially for SMEs. Moreover, BBI JU , CleanSky 2 JU , FCH JU , IMI 2 JU , SESAR JU and S2R JU adopted the PPP formula. PPP allows the leveraging of additional funds from the public and private sectors to make up for the uncertainty, risks and high demonstration and market entry costs. These deter investment in innovation in nascent industries such as bio-based products or fusion energy. By encouraging the large-scale deployment of technology applications, these PPPs shape a new industrial policy for the globalisation era and reinforce Europe\u2019s industrial leadership. It is important to note that the speed with which research is translated into breakthrough innovations has a positive impact on the performance of the European economy. Agencies therefore participate in the development of innovative performance-enhancing solutions, particularly in the fields of medicine, health, agriculture, transport, climate change, digitalisation and energy. These contribute to increasing production, e.g. new plant varieties enable higher agricultural outputs ( CPVO ); overcoming cost and time inefficiencies, \u2013 for instance in air traffic management ( SESAR JU ) or medicines research and development ( IMI 2 JU ); and translating satellite navigation services ( GSA ) technology from European space programmes into useful applications that impact all areas of citizens\u2019 everyday life. The Union\u2019s competitiveness is furthermore reinforced by the protection of intellectual property rights. Indeed, efficient protection regimes encourage companies to invest in research and innovation since they significantly raise the chances of recovering the investment when innovations can be turned into marketable economic assets. It is important that property rights are protected, both in the internal market and in third countries. In this respect, CPVO and EUIPO grant intellectual property rights and work towards the convergence of property rights protection systems to enhance predictability for companies wishing to invest abroad and to fight counterfeiting. Every year, EUIPO registers around 120,000 EU trade marks and 85,000 designs, while CPVO protects around 25,000 plant varieties. In addition, recognition of European standards worldwide strengthens the competitiveness of the European industry. Finally, the agencies fuel the creation of highly-skilled jobs in blooming industries in Europe. In the case of CPVO , the potential for new jobs is particularly high in rural and underdeveloped areas. These constitute important pillars for knowledge-based and inclusive growth. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a connected Digital Single Market The agencies help develop the digital potential of Europe. They promote the growth of innovative start-ups, raise the protection of intellectual property rights and develop the digital skills of European citizens. Agencies work towards the European digital agenda by encouraging the development of digital and information technologies. In particular, they contribute to the creation of innovative European start-ups and provide them with tools that help achieve breakthroughs in the field of information and communication technologies. GSA helps using GNSS technology through digital tools such as the Internet of Things or Big Data in various sectors of the economy. S2R JU contributes to transforming the oldest transport mode \u2013 rail transport - into a modern and sustainable transport mode. The use of digitalisation creates seamless journey experiences for passengers. Moreover, EUIPO contributes to establishing an efficient Digital Single Market with standards and regulations that How do EU agencies contribute to the Europe 2020 Strategy and to the Juncker Commission Agenda? 39 ",
        "are adapted to the digital revolution and new consumer behaviour. In particular, they encourage the use of technology for a more effective enforcement of intellectual property owners\u2019 rights, and develop and share online tools, such as databases, to reinforce the protection regime. They also raise awareness among policy-makers and the general public on the importance of intellectual property rights for European innovators. Cedefop is also committed to helping Member States and social partners develop digital skills for the European labour force. The digitalisation of the economy means IT operations and the need for IT skills are emerging in nearly all economic sectors. This includes the growing need to collect and analyse data to improve Europe's long- term employability and productivity. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy Innovation plays a significant role in climate change mitigation. EU agencies support innovation towards sustainable development. Some contribute to cross-sectoral innovative improvements, while others focus on reducing the environmental impact of specific sectors. Agencies focus on assessing and reducing the environmental impact of flights (CleanSky 2 JU, GSA, SESAR JU) , agriculture (CPVO) , energy (BBI JU, F4E, FCH JU) and railway systems (GSA, S2R JU) . FCH JU seeks to advance the use of hydrogen and fuel cell systems in energy and transport. The EIT promotes cross-sectoral research on innovations conducive to sustainable development. These initiatives allow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, an increased protection of biodiversity and better resource efficiency. In the field of energy, the PPPs and F4E help achieve the Energy Union goals by working towards increasing supply security, cost-efficiency and sustainability of the European energy mix through the increased share of renewable sources. Developing the use of alternatives to polluting fossil fuels, namely biomass (BBI JU) , fusion energy (F4E) , fuel cells and hydrogen for energy and transport (FCH JU) and raw materials (EIT) is essential to reaching the Union\u2019s environmental goals and decreasing its dependency on external sources which make it vulnerable to economic, environmental and geopolitical instability. Moreover, it contributes to reducing the cost of energy in value chains and thus further boosts the competitiveness of the European economy. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a deeper and fairer Internal Market with a strengthened industrial base The internal market is reinforced when innovation allows European businesses to turn their ideas into new products and services that are adapted to consumers\u2019 changing demands. Innovators should also enjoy the same level of protection across all Member States. EU agencies play a vital role in helping to turn new knowledge and innovative ideas into products and services that directly benefit European citizens. While Europe has a strong track record of research, turning research results into new products and services is far from easy. The key is to tackle major societal challenges through investment in research and innovation, focusing on areas where both market potential and the need to resolve major societal challenges are greatest. As a result, consumers can enjoy improved services that are better tailored to their needs and with minimised risks. CleanSky 2 JU, FCH JU, SESAR JU and S2R JU offer travellers better transport systems through safety improvements, capacity increase, lower environmental impact, improved service levels and reduced life cycle costs within a Single European Railway Area and with harmonised air traffic management systems. In the health sector, patients are offered more effective and efficient treatments that are tailored to their evolving needs thanks to the IMI 2 JU efforts. And in the energy sector, citizens and companies will ultimately benefit from a wider range of affordable energy sources. To make all this happen, PPPs such as Clean Sky JU, FCH JU, IMI 2 JU, SESAR JU and S2R JU bring together a wide range of stakeholders, including academics, industry scientists, SMEs, and regulatory authorities. By working together, they are able to rapidly share and validate new knowledge, ideas and resources, and turn them into products and services that are meaningful to Europe\u2019s citizens. In the pharmaceutical sector, IMI 2 JU is delivering knowledge, tools and resources that help to speed up the drug development process and make it more efficient. This helps boost the competitiveness of Europe\u2019s life science sector, and in the long term will help to deliver even safer, more effective medicines for patients.

        "Background Facing increased traffic, changing mobility needs and rising environmental concerns, the European Union is modernising its approach to transport in order to best support the free movement of people and goods within the Union. Free movement of people and goods within the internal market has been the cornerstone of the Union\u2019s society and economy. Mobility is also key in ensuring the economic, social and territorial cohesion of Member States enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty as a fundamental objective of the Union 16 . Emerging societal and technological challenges \u2013 rising traffic demand, changing mobility patterns and environmental concerns \u2013 need to be addressed through the comprehensive modernisation of Europe\u2019s transport systems. The European Commission therefore set up a Roadmap of 40 initiatives in order to build a competitive European transport system ensuring the safe and efficient mobility of people and goods across the Union and in order to remove major barriers to the development of transport. These initiatives will also considerably reduce Europe\u2019s dependence on imported oil, free cities from conventionally-fuelled cars by 2030 and cut carbon emissions in transport by 60% by 2050 17 . Each agency and joint undertaking of this subgroup contributes to one of the Roadmap\u2019s objectives in their respective capacity. In the field of aviation, the Union is set to harmonise and modernise air traffic management in Europe within the Single European Sky framework. This involves ensuring the safety of aeronautical products and the cost- and flight-efficiency and environmental sustainability of air traffic in the face of sustained growth 18 . In the field of rail transport, the Union also works towards the achievement of the Single European Railway Area to make up for the lack of competition, regulation and investment in the rail market 19 . Finally, in the maritime field the Union implements and integrates maritime policy to promote the competitiveness and reduce the environmental impact of maritime transport 20 . The agencies contribute to these achievements and thereby to the Europe 2020 Strategy and Juncker Commission Agenda. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base The EU transport agencies contribute to achieving safe, effective and efficient transport systems that facilitate the movement of people and goods within the Union. Achieving the completion of the Single European Sky, the Single European Railway Area and a European Maritime Space without Borders is paramount to enhancing the competitiveness of the European transport industry. Removing technical and operational barriers and simplifying access for customers (as for ERA and S2R JU , in the railway sector) and rationalising surveillance procedures is in the interest of European travellers and companies. A harmonised approach and collaboration across Member States is fundamental to ensuring the safety and environmental compatibility of transport within the internal market. For that purpose, EASA , EMSA and GSA support the definition 16 Treaty on European Union, Article 3.3. 17 European Commission, White Paper 2011 \u201cRoadmap to a Single European Transport Area - Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system\u201d. 18 European Commission Communication \u201cTraffic management: the creation of the single European sky\u201d. 19 European Commission Communication concerning the development of a Single European Railway Area. 20 European Commission Communication \u201cStrategic Goals and Recommendations for the EU\u2019s Maritime Transport Policy until 2018\u201d.

Other joint undertakings such as Clean Sky JU develop new concepts in order to meet European citizens\u2019 evolving mobility needs with cleaner and quieter aircrafts. FCH JU supports research projects to reduce the production costs of fuel cell and hydrogen systems to be used in transports systems (including machinery, trains, ships, aeroplanes), which in turn would reduce transport costs. GSA improves the overall effectiveness of transport. In the field of aviation, the Agency enhances the safety of passengers thanks to landing procedures facilitated by navigation satellite services (GNSS) technology, and optimises airlines\u2019 operational management. It also improves the safety of roads through eCall \u2013 a system which automatically dials 112, the European single emergency number, in the event of a serious accident \u2013, optimises the access to road infrastructure via road user charging and congestion charges, and enables innovative applications such as connected cars. GSA will also play a significant role in signalling for rail and helps save lives thanks to the Search and Rescue service in the maritime field. Finally, safe and seamless mobility will be achieved thanks to efficiency gains. For that purpose, ERA contributes to implementing a single EU train control system, a single set of EU technical specifications for railway vehicles, infrastructure and operations, and is acting as a one-stop-shop for vehicle authorisations and safety certifications. S2R JU performs research and innovation enhancing this European system to double railway capacity, increasing reliability and punctuality by as much as 50%, and halving the life cycle costs of a railway. GSA \u2019s Galileo system also promotes seamless mobility through its contribution to navigation services. By participating in the development of a safe, effective and efficient internal market in the field of transport and reinforcing the EU industrial leadership in the transport sector, these EU agencies are key contributors to achieving Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth in Europe. The technology developments already made or in progress with the help of Clean Sky 2 JU could reduce aviation CO 2 emissions by more than 20% compared to 2000, i.e. an aggregate reduction of 2 to 3 billion tonnes of CO 2 over the next 35 years.

        "Agencies\u2019 contribution to a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy The agencies improve the sustainability of Europe\u2019s transport systems by ensuring European safety and interoperability and developing innovative solutions for more resource-efficient and sustainable transports. Reducing the environmental impact of transport has become a major concern in the development of this sector, especially given the sustained increase in mobility in Europe. To ensure the transition towards a resource-efficient society and improve the quality of the environment, Clean Sky 2 JU , FCH JU and S2R JU are developing clean technologies to reduce energy consumption and other externalities such as noise and vibration. Enhanced energy efficiency also decreases pressure on Europe\u2019s energy supply security. GSA is instrumental in that field as it allows space programme service applications to outline fuel-efficient paths for transportation in the aviation and maritime fields. In the maritime sector, EMSA is testing the use of Remotely Piloted Airborne Systems to measure ship emissions. EMSA is also supporting the enforcement and monitoring of relevant EU legislation at national level in the field of emissions and greenhouse gases. FCH JU helps develop technologies for the development and refuelling of electric cars and buses. EASA , EMSA and ERA work towards creating a European level playing field in the implementation of EU environmental standards, which they help develop and maintain. EMSA also monitors and sets up quick response mechanisms in the event of adverse events such as oil or chemical spills from ships into water. ERA promotes the competitiveness of rail as an environmentally friendly mode of transport and fosters the harmonisation of technical specifications regarding the noise of rail wagons. All of these improvements contribute to the development of the transport of tomorrow, in line with the Union\u2019s objective of resource-efficiency and sustainable development.

        "Background The European Union seeks to ensure the availability of secure, affordable and environmentally friendly energy for all its citizens in the face of increasing resource scarcity, the geopolitical instability linked to the supply of fossil fuels, and environmental concerns. The increasing global demand for energy puts pressure on energy systems and aggravates the problem of resource scarcity. Economic growth still largely relies on the use of polluting fossil fuels, which renders Europe\u2019s energy supply vulnerable to economic, geopolitical and environmental risks. This growth model is no longer compatible with Europe\u2019s commitment to preserve and improve the quality of the environment, in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Treaty 21 . Moreover, Europe committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels, to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% and to improve energy efficiency by at least 27% by 2030 22 . The Europe 2020 Strategy spells out the need to decouple economic growth from resource use in order to achieve greater resource efficiency, competitive and sustainable growth and the transition towards a petroleum-free society. In parallel, geopolitical instability in the EU\u2019s Southern and Eastern neighbourhood highlights the need to reduce Europe\u2019s reliance on fuel and gas imports, to increase its collective negotiating power vis-\u00e0-vis third countries and to diversify its energy sources. In order to overcome technical, environmental and geopolitical challenges to its energy supply, the European Union is committed to establishing an Energy Union geared towards ensuring supply security, a fully-integrated internal energy market, energy efficiency, emission reduction, climate research and innovation 23 . By contributing to achieving these goals, EU agencies support innovation and the development of the EU energy sector. Agencies\u2019 contribution to jobs, growth and investment Joint undertakings bring together the industry and research communities to develop and place on the market innovative, greener sources of energy. This enhances the competitiveness of the EU economy and contributes to job creation. The EIT , F4E , BBI JU and FCH JU work towards the full deployment of Europe\u2019s industrial and research potential and capacities in the field of energy. BBI JU and FCH JU are public-private partnerships (PPPs). The EIT , F4E and these public-private partnerships (PPPs) aim at fostering collaboration between all the stakeholders involved in the development of the European energy sector, i.e. industry representatives, SMEs, research and technology centres and universities. Pooling the research efforts of industry and academic stakeholders allows research agendas to be driven by concrete needs so their results directly feed into marketable outcomes. It enables stakeholders to address technological and innovation challenges in nascent industries such as the bio-based sector. It also encourages industry involvement in large-scale research projects, especially SMEs. Moreover, the PPP formula allows the leveraging of funds to make up for the uncertainty, risks and high market entry costs, which deter investment in innovation in nascent energy industries. FCH JU participates in the development and market readiness of technological solutions for fuel cells and hydrogen, while BBI JU aims to provide the industry with information on the availability of renewable resources for the production of bio-based materials. 21 Treaty on European Union, Article 3.3. 22 2030 Energy Strategy. 23 Energy Union Factsheet.

        "F4E , which is publicly funded, works towards developing fusion energy. The EIT focuses part of its activities on developing the supply and use of raw materials. By encouraging the large-scale deployment of technology applications in the field of energy, the EIT , F4E and the PPPs shape a new industrial policy for the globalisation era in Europe. Activities carried out within these bodies also enhance the competitiveness of the European energy industry by contributing to strengthening its value chains. They strive to allow the production of cheaper energy and the reduction of the cost of energy in the value chain, which benefits all sectors of the economy. By broadening the European industrial base, they foster quality job creation, including in rural areas in the case of BBI JU , thus laying the ground for Smart and Sustainable Growth in Europe. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy EU agencies strive to increase energy security and environmental protection by developing greener sources of energy from renewables, increasing energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Environmental protection is at the core of the new EU energy policy. It aims to decouple economic growth from resource use through increased energy efficiency, and to reduce emissions by replacing polluting fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy. The EIT, BBI JU, FCH JU and F4E facilitate the development of sustainable and clean energy sources \u2013 fusion energy, biomass, fuel cells and hydrogen \u2013 which are paramount to the transition towards a low-carbon society. For instance, BBI JU supports research and the market entry of processes to use waste and agriculture and forestry residues as a source of industrial production, while FCH JU seeks to promote the development of fuel cells and hydrogen technologies and their applications for fuel cell electric vehicles, in particular passenger vehicles and buses. Resource efficiency, a key objective of the Europe 2020 Strategy, is central to climate change mitigation. These projects also contribute to significantly enhancing security of supply by diversifying the European energy mix (e.g. enhancing the share of renewables as an alternative to conventional sources) and increasing storage capacities. In the case of fusion energy, the projects contribute towards a potentially limitless source of energy. This makes European energy supply less vulnerable to economic, geopolitical and environmental risks. Moreover, ACER reinforces energy security by ensuring the smooth functioning of the EU Internal Energy Market for electricity and natural gas, which enables energy to flow freely across Europe through interconnectors. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a deeper and fairer Internal Market with a strengthened industrial base Thanks to the harmonised Internal Energy Market for electricity and natural gas, European consumers are guaranteed affordable energy and a choice of energy provider. The smooth functioning of the Internal Energy Market for electricity and natural gas, which ACER is in charge of ensuring, is key to providing affordable energy and the choice between energy providers to European citizens and companies \u2013 thanks to an open, transparent and competitive energy market. For that purpose, ACER implements the integration of national energy markets into a single, European one where fair competition rules are strictly applied. \u20ac3.7bn investments in bio- based innovation in 2014- 2020, funding more than 200 cooperative projects through cross-industry clusters in 2020.

        "Background The development of digital services and networks holds great potential for growth and job creation in Europe. This entails the development of a regulatory framework for the implementation of fair competition rules and efficient network and information security measures. European citizens and businesses increasingly rely on innovative, affordable and reliable telecommunications networks and services 24 : 315 million Europeans use the Internet every day, and virtually all citizens own a mobile phone 25 . Not only is the digital economy a thriving economic sector, but it also constitutes a key enabler for long-term knowledge-based growth in Europe in the context of fast change and globalisation. The European Commission set up a first regulatory framework for electronic communications in 2002 26 which was completed in 2009 27 . In addition, it launched its Digital Agenda flagship initiative for the creation of a connected Digital Single Market for content and telecom services in 2010. The Agenda aims in particular at speeding up access to high- speed internet and bringing the difference between roaming and national tariffs to near zero. In 2015, the European Commission established its Digital Single Market strategy for the development of the European digital economy. In a Digital Single Market, \u201cthe individuals and businesses can seamlessly access and exercise online activities under conditions of fair competition, and a high level of consumer and personal data protection, regardless of their nationality or place of residence\u201d 28 . The strategy includes 16 initiatives to be delivered by the end of 2016, which rest on three pillars: \u2022 Ensuring better access for consumers and businesses to digital goods and services across Europe; \u2022 Creating the right conditions and a level playing field for digital networks and innovative services to develop; \u2022 Maximising the growth potential of the digital economy. In this context, the respect of EU competition rules in the telecoms sector and the guarantee of network and information security are paramount to the completion of a sustainable European Digital Single Market. The agencies are working towards ensuring those aspects, as well as using navigation satellite service technology to boost digital connectivity in Europe. 24 The EU regulatory framework for electronic communications defines electronic communications networks as \u201ctransmission systems which permit the conveyance of signals by wire, by radio, by optical or by other electromagnetic means\u201d and electronic communication services as \u201cthe transmission of signals over these networks, and associated facilities and services of the networks or of the electronic communications services [\u2026] which enable the provision of services via that network or service\u201d. 25 European Commission Communication \u201cA Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe\u201d. 26 Directive 2002/21/EC. 27 Directive 2009/140/EC. 28 European Commission Communication \u201cA Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe\u201d.

        "Agencies\u2019 contribution to jobs, growth and investment The agencies promote competition and foster investment and innovation in telecoms sector development, to fully benefit European citizens and businesses. The Digital Single Market holds significant growth potential both for new start-ups and existing companies: estimates show that it will generate \u20ac415 billion per year in the European economy, large-scale jobs creation and significant improvements in the delivery of public services across Member States 29 . With the professional services and administrative support of the BEREC Office , BEREC is supporting the development of a stable regulatory framework which creates incentives for innovation in new technologies. It thereby contributes to a competitive European telecoms market, with positive spill- over effects on all other sectors of the economy. This complements Digital Agenda initiatives, for instance by speeding up access to high-speed internet in Europe by encouraging investment in broadband and fibre-based networks. Progress is further facilitated by the technological breakthroughs derived from the EU\u2019s space programmes, which are translated, thanks to GSA, into high-quality, cost-efficient applications for the telecoms sector, as well as in other industries such as mobile commerce or autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the establishment of a telecoms networks and services environment is conducive to achieving these goals and to fully benefiting EU Citizens and companies. It is linked to the adoption of a regulatory framework that ensures an ambitious balance between shared highest service offering standards and barrier-free, cost-optimised business practices \u2013 while guaranteeing fair competition. To that end, BEREC assists the European Commission and national authorities on the establishment of regulation and ground- level implementing rules and guidelines to ensure a level playing field for an efficient yet compliant business practice and innovation in the sectors of information technologies and telecoms markets. This requires the consistent application of EU competition rules on antitrust, state aid and mergers to the telecoms sector. These rules have become especially important since mergers and acquisitions, as well as the growing presence of bundle offers, lead to increased consolidation in this market. BEREC monitors the market to avoid the appearance of oligopolies which would impede the entry of new telecoms operators and thus force existing providers to increase the quality of their offer and reduce their prices. This reinforces the competitiveness of the European telecoms market and benefits both consumers and businesses, thereby contributing to Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth. 29 European Commission Communication \u201cA Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe\u201d.

Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus are key enablers for new trends such as Big Data, the Internet of Things and multimodal transportation. GSA contributes to developing related technology applications and services adapted to user needs. Reducing the cost of calls, texts and data download abroad within the EU The European Commission has significantly reduced roaming tariffs when travelling in the EU. From 15 June 2017, European citizens will pay the same as domestic prices without extra roaming fees during temporary stays within the EU. BEREC ensures the smooth transition towards the end of roaming fees by regulating the tariffs of European service providers. It thereby ensures European citizens enjoy cheaper tariffs while preserving the competitiveness of the telecoms market across Member States.

        "Agencies\u2019 contribution to a connected Digital Single Market EU agencies support the convergence of regulatory approaches across Europe to guarantee end-users protection and a high quality of telecoms services. The revised EU regulatory framework for electronic communications aims at the provision of additional consumer rights, more consumer choice and better protection of privacy 30 . Regulators are therefore committed to promoting the affordability and accessibility of pan- European telecoms networks and services. These are paramount to the completion of a connected Digital Single Market where businesses and citizens can benefit from a minimum level of services regardless of their location. A fundamental step towards achieving this goal is the removal of barriers to the cross- border provision of telecoms services. For that purpose, BEREC promotes the consistent implementation of a common regulatory approach to consumer protection, net neutrality and international mobile roaming across Member States. Such convergence is key to empowering and protecting end-users of telecoms networks and services. The goal of these efforts is to safeguard the quality of telecoms services by enabling end-users to have the necessary information to choose between telecom products, to switch between operators and to benefit from net neutrality \u2013 i.e. access to all content and applications is ensured regardless of their source, without internet service providers favouring or blocking certain products or websites. Moreover, the efficient protection of end- users is a condition for the completion of the Digital Single Market. It includes data privacy, internet security and content regulation. In parallel, ENISA is in charge of promoting a high level of network and information security in order to protect the Union from threats to its digital environment, in particular by encouraging the development of a common European approach to cybersecurity. Finally, GSA is also contributing to reinforcing digital connectivity in Europe by facilitating the translation of European space programmes into enablers for telecoms and new digital trends such as Big Data, autonomous vehicles or the Internet of Things. For instance, Galileo sets a standard time which constitutes the reference for telecoms networks, while global navigation satellite services provide location services which facilitate the development of mobile commerce or enable the global localisation of the Internet of Things.

        "Background Protecting and maintaining the well-being of its peoples is a fundamental objective of the Union. EU agencies are dedicated to providing EU citizens with the highest standards in the world in terms of patients\u2019, consumers\u2019, workers\u2019 and environment protection across all Member States. Promoting the well-being of EU citizens is a fundamental objective of the Union: it is inscribed in the Lisbon Treaty 31 . This entails ensuring the highest standards of protection for citizens in all domains of life and economic activity. The Union created a single market, where people and goods can circulate freely. Its raison d\u2019\u00eatre goes beyond the economic dimension of this borderless structure: many EU policies aim at creating \u201ca high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment\u201d across Member States 32 . It is therefore necessary to create a level playing field for all citizens to enjoy an equally high quality of life wherever they live, work and study across the Union. Agencies provide scientific and technical advice to EU and Member State policy- makers to achieve such standards of protection and well-being for citizens in the Union. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a deeper and fairer Internal Market The single market is an area without borders which contributes to citizens\u2019 welfare by offering safe products of the highest quality, thanks to risk monitoring, assessment and minimisation activities carried out by the agencies. They also contribute to achieving fair conditions for the mobility of citizens and workers within this space, as well as the conditions for companies to access all EU markets with safe products. The single market is one of the greatest achievements of the Union: it creates a prosperous zone where people, goods, services and capital can circulate freely. This success goes beyond the economic dimension in that it also ensures the welfare of European consumers and workers within this area: citizens are provided with safe products of the highest quality, and workers with safe, healthy and productive working conditions. ECHA , EFSA and EMA strive to create the best conditions to ensure that products which enter the single market are safe for consumption. Their actions are based on scientific risk assessments: products are placed on the market only once it has been proven that they are safe for consumption 33 . The agencies\u2019 activities aim to protect public health by ensuring that the benefits of medicines or products made available to European consumers outweigh the risks, thus preventing threats to consumers\u2019 health and safety. In particular, ECHA , EFSA and EMA are involved in the processes of the authorisation and supervision of medicines, chemical substances, food and feed additives and bio-engineered products placed on the internal market, in collaboration with relevant national authorities. They play a direct role in the free movement of products in the single market. The monitoring and communication activities of EU agencies also serve to reinforce the trust of European consumers in the goods market and in the surveillance systems which monitor them. 31 Treaty on European Union, Article 3.1. 32 Treaty on European Union, Article 3.3. 33 For industrial chemicals, safe use needs to be demonstrated. In 2015, EFCA organised 17,000 coordinated inspections, allowing the detection of 703 suspected infringements, with 21 million Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) positions received and processed and 6,500 catch certificates and supporting documents analysed.

        "Moreover, the free movement of workers is a pillar of the dynamism of the single market. Eurofound and EU-OSHA participate in its reinforcement by providing policy-makers with evidence- based expertise to assist them in creating a level playing field in the Union. This allows European workers to find equally fair and safe working conditions across Member States and encourages their mobility. In this increasingly interconnected environment, ECDC \u2019s activities also ensure the proper functioning of the internal market by supporting activities to prevent outbreaks of communicable diseases. It thereby reinforces the social and territorial cohesion of the Union by creating safeguards for the whole population, including those most vulnerable to risks. Agencies\u2019 contribution to jobs, growth and investment Encouraging the development of high standards for the products sold on the internal market reinforces the role of innovation and knowledge in the European growth model. By working towards strengthening citizens\u2019 well-being, ECDC , ECHA , EEA , EFSA and EMA promote innovation and competitiveness in their specific policy areas. By encouraging companies to develop products which meet the EU\u2019s high standards and solutions, strictly tested for safety and sustainability, thereby giving EU companies a competitive edge in the global market. By anticipating the impact of long-term trends \u2013 such as demographic ageing and digitalisation on job creation and employment \u2013and by monitoring existing practices in Member States, EU-OSHA and Eurofound also empower EU and national policy-makers and social partners to improve social and work policies. This stimulates job creation in the long term. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy EU agencies monitor and encourage the respect of high environmental standards in order to preserve Europe\u2019s natural resources and protect citizens from risks to their health and well- being. Protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development are fundamental objectives of the European Union and its Member States 34 . As climate change is becoming an increasingly salient issue across the world, the Union has set medium- and long-term objectives for the protection of its natural resources and of its citizens from environment-related threats. Through thematic and cross- sectoral policies, the EU is striving to achieve a long-term objective of \u201cliving well within the limits of the planet\u201d 35 . This means ensuring the sustainability of Europe\u2019s economic growth model for current and future generations. Moreover, reducing the impact of human activity on the environment and increasing energy efficiency leads to cheaper energy for European consumers and companies. It reinforces the European economy\u2019s resilience to climate-related risks, thereby increasing its competitiveness at a global level. The EEA contributes to the public debate on a healthy environment and reviews progress towards environmental policy targets through its five- year assessment: \u2018The European environment \u2014 State and outlook 2015\u2019 (SOER 2015), the most comprehensive assessment of the European environment\u2019s state, trends and prospects in a global context. 34 Treaty on European Union, Article 3.3. 35 7th General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020.

Moreover, EFCA stimulates sustainable fishing practices in the Union by ensuring compliance with the \u201clanding obligation\u201d 36 and assisting Member States and the European Commission in fighting illegal fishing. As a result, EU citizens enjoy some of the highest environmental standards in the world, for the benefit of current and future generations. Agencies\u2019 contribution to an area of justice and fundamental rights Workers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights are enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty: they are fundamental rights of EU citizens. Protecting these rights through monitoring and policy recommendations contributes to turning the Union into an area of justice and shared values. Each agency focuses on protecting a set of rights specific to its domain of activity: EU-OSHA and Eurofound are dedicated to the rights of workers, while ECDC , ECHA , EFSA , EEA and EMA defend citizens\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights to a safe and healthy environment and promote their health and well-being. EFCA works towards the sustainability of fisheries resources and jobs in the fishing industry. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a Union of Democratic Change To promote good governance, transparency and openness in decision-making, EU citizens are entitled to access EU Institutions\u2019 documents in all EU languages. The Translation Centre contributes to making EU policies, communications and reports available to EU citizens in all official EU languages. It promotes cultural and linguistic diversity in the EU by offering its linguistic services in all 24 official EU languages. Enabling EU citizens to access documentation on the work of the EU in their mother tongue significantly reinforces the transparency and openness of the work of institutions, and thereby the link between citizens and the Union. Agencies\u2019 contribution to improving international standards of citizens\u2019 protection The agencies foster citizens\u2019 well-being by promoting EU standards abroad and encouraging EU partners to adopt similar measures. This reinforces the Union\u2019s standing as a strong global actor committed to the well-being of the world population. The agencies also make information available to consumers, which helps build trust and allows companies to better target their innovation. 36 The landing obligation laid down in the Common Fisheries Policy entails landing all catches of species subject to catch limits and minimum sizes made in EU waters or by Union fishing vessels. Over 6,000 substances are registered with ECHA, which has delivered over five million classification and labelling notifications for more than 100,000 substances. In 20 years, the Centre has translated close to 9 million pages for its 61 clients in 24 languages (552 language pairs); the launch in 2007 of the IATE database, open to the public, with 8.6 million terms covering the 24 EU languages: 41 million queries had been submitted to the free public version of IATE by 2015.

        "Background Developing skills throughout life is paramount to reinforcing the employability and mobility of citizens across Europe and beyond. According to the Lisbon Treaty, the Union has the competence to support, complement or supplement the actions of the Member States in education and training. As greater emphasis is placed on vocational education and training (VET) to improve employability, Member States work towards improving the alignment of VET provisions with labour market needs. This requires a better understanding of changing labour markets. Agencies\u2019 contribution to jobs, growth and investment Developing citizens\u2019 skills is key to boosting the productivity and competitiveness of the EU business environment. Cedefop and ETF help develop employability and skills in order to address the structural changes in the EU labour market and to empower citizens in Europe and beyond. In the Union, Cedefop promotes skill development and progression opportunities throughout people\u2019s lives within the Union. It works on making training systems more flexible and qualifications more transparent to raise qualification levels, increase participation in lifelong learning and encourage mobility. It does so in particular by collecting evidence to help policy-makers revise common European VET priorities and supporting the creation of partnerships for apprenticeships. ETF projects EU internal policies towards employability and skills and contextualises them to the development needs of neighbouring countries. Thereby it supports knowledge, business and innovation. It enhances trade, prosperity and stability in the Union and its neighbourhood. It also supports skills as a tool for economic growth and social development in partner countries. By anticipating the impact of long-term trends such as demographic ageing and digitalisation on job creation and employment, and by monitoring existing practices in Member States, these agencies empower EU and national policy-makers and social partners to improve VET, social and work policies. This further stimulates job creation in the long term and reinforces well-functioning labour markets. The agencies therefore contribute to Inclusive Growth by promoting competitiveness and social inclusion within and outside the Union. Agencies\u2019 contribution to a deeper and fairer Internal Market By promoting the development of skills, the agencies support the mobility of workers and citizens within the internal market. The free movement of people is a pillar of the dynamism of the single market. Cedefop works on promoting mobility for learning and work, by increasing transparency of qualifications. It supports Member States and social partners in their cooperation on common priorities for VET and has contributed to developing tools which European citizens can use to enhance and demonstrate their qualifications in all Member States. For instance, 65 million Europeans have already used Europass, a portfolio of documents to show their knowledge, skills and competences in a standardised format available in 27 languages. ETF supports the better use of skills in labour migration from and to the EU neighbouring countries. Cedefop also contributes to preparing the integration of refugees and asylum-seekers by helping policy-makers to ensure access to education and training or to the labour market. To promote mobility for learning and work, Cedefop has helped develop Europass, a portfolio of documents that show someone\u2019s knowledge, skills and competences in a standard European format available in 27 languages. Since its launch in 2005, more than 65 million Europass CVs have been generated online. How do EU agencies contribute to the Europe 2020 Strategy and to the Juncker Commission Agenda? 65 ",

        "Background Pooling Member States\u2019 defence capabilities at EU level in order to improve interoperability and reduce costs has been on the European agenda for a long time. With the establishment of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) in 2003, it became a reality. The idea of creating a European defence is as old as the EU integration process: it was already suggested in 1950 in the form of a Europe Defence Community. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht, further reinforced by the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, created the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), \u201cwhich would deal with all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence\u201d 38 . One year later, the December 1998 Franco- British Saint-Malo Declaration paved the way for a common European policy on security and defence which was launched at the 1999 European Council summit in Cologne. This initiative was strengthened when Member States agreed the Helsinki Headline Goal, and a set of military capability objectives to be completed by 2003. The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) became fully operational as from the European Council summit of December 2001. In this context, three intergovernmental agencies that operate in the field of security and defence within the EU structure were created: the European Union Satellite Centre ( SatCen ) and the European Union Institute for Security Studies ( EUISS ) in 2002, and the European Defence Agency ( EDA ) in 2004. Agencies\u2019 contribution to strengthening the EU\u2019s position as a global actor The Security and Defence agencies contribute to the development of the EU\u2019s security and defence resources. They carry out research in the field of security and defence and provide EU decision-makers with intelligence. They create a common security culture within the EU through the exchange of ideas and facilitate the development of cooperative military capability. This further reinforces the EU\u2019s standing as a global actor in the fields of security and defence. Each of the Security and Defence agencies focuses on specific objectives and activities to contribute to this goal. SatCen supports EU decision-making in the field of common foreign and security policy, and in particular in defence and security policy. It provides, at the request of the Council or the High Representative, products and services resulting from the exploitation of relevant space assets and \u201cThe European Union will promote peace and guarantee the security of its citizens and territory. This means that Europeans, working with partners, must have the necessary capabilities to defend themselves and live up to their commitments to mutual assistance and solidarity enshrined in the Treaties. Internal and external security are ever more intertwined: our security at home entails a parallel interest in peace in our neighbouring and surrounding regions. It implies a broader interest in preventing conflict, promoting human security, addressing the root causes of instability and working towards a safer world.\u201d 39 Global Strategy for the EU\u2019s Foreign and Security Policy, June 2016 38 EDA, 10 years of working together, p. 11. 39 Shared Vision, Common Action: A Stronger Europe, A Global Strategy for the European Union\u2019s Foreign and Security Policy, June 2016, p. 14.

The agency also provides decision-makers with early warning of potential crises so that a diplomatic, economic and humanitarian response can be formulated in a timely manner. SatCen produces satellite and aerial imagery analysis and intelligence for different stakeholders. The European External Action Service, the European Commission, EU Member States, Frontex and international organisations such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), NATO or the United Nations all make use of SatCen \u2019s imagery analysis and intelligence. SatCen provides different types of reports ranging from brief descriptions for fast response requirements to detailed studies related to topics such as humanitarian aid, contingency planning, general crime and security surveillance, critical infrastructure, military capabilities and weapons of mass destruction. The EUISS fosters a common security culture in the EU. To this end, it publishes extensive documentation and organises events and task forces. In this way, it supports the elaboration and projection of EU foreign policy and enriches the strategic debate on security inside and outside Europe. The EUISS is the interface between experts and decision-makers on a large panel of security-related topics, focused on specific regions or policies. EDA (European Defence Agency) supports the Council and Member States in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities for the CSDP, especially by promoting defence research, armament cooperation, the development of cooperative military capabilities and joint procurement. It seeks to increase cooperation and interoperability between Member States as well as to harmonise their operational needs, so that Europe can act as an efficient security provider at home and abroad. Some of EDA \u2019s key capability development programmes include air-to-air refuelling (AAR), remotely piloted aircraft systems, cyberdefence and governmental satellite communications. SatCen and EDA collaborate with the EUISS on joint studies related to the topics and policies under their responsibility. They also participate in conferences and seminars organised by the EUISS . SatCen and EDA have been working together since 2004 on several projects that require geospatial information for defence purposes. These projects include GISMO (Geospatial Information to Support Decision Making in Operations), GISMO 2 and SULTAN (Persistent Surveillance Long Term Analysis). EDA and SatCen also collaborate on other topics and programmes such as the Space Situational Awareness programme, maritime surveillance, Big Data exploitation in the space and security domain, future space-based earth observation systems, cyberdefence, imagery exploitation and geospatial analysis and applications. Although EASA \u2019s main missions concern civil aviation, its role in supporting the military and defence industry in the field of aviation safety is increasingly important. In 2015, SatCen delivered a total of 1,348 satellite imagery analyses, mainly to the EEAS, OSCE, Member States, Frontex and the OPCW-UN Joint Mission. The majority of analyses responded to general security surveillance tasks, followed by support to crisis management and arms control. \u201cA sustainable, innovative and competitive European defence industry is essential for Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy and for a credible CSDP.\u201d 40 Global Strategy for the EU\u2019s Foreign and Security Policy, June 2016 40 Shared Vision, Common Action: A Stronger Europe, A Global Strategy for the European Union\u2019s Foreign And Security Policy, June 2016, p. 45.

        "It works in particular on topics such as the risks of flying over conflict zones and cybersecurity. Through its contribution to the development of the only GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) programme under civilian control in the world, Galileo, GSA guarantees Europe\u2019s autonomy. Its technology applications enable it to play a larger role in global disaster relief and development projects. Moreover, through the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre, GSA plays an important role in averting threats to the security of the Union and Member States and mitigating serious harm arising from the deployment, operation or use of the European GNSS. GSA also includes an autonomous body, the Security Accreditation Board, which takes accreditation decisions for it two satellite navigation programmes, Galileo and EGNOS. Finally, GSA plays a key role in ensuring the security and coordination of public regulated services. These are used in Member States for sensitive applications requiring effective access control and a high level of service continuity, even in crisis situations. Agencies\u2019 contribution to innovation and a more competitive internal market The Security and Defence agencies also contribute to innovation in the fields of security and defence. They support research projects, especially for SMEs. EDA stimulates innovation in the European defence industry, which has been under severe financial strain in recent years. It promotes dual-use research and technologies (i.e. both civil and military) in the fields of security and defence. EDA manages many research programmes and projects, and in this way, enables cooperation and synergies for Member States. Moreover, EDA reinforces the European defence technological and industrial base. For example, it supports SMEs that set up research projects to get access to European Structural and Investment Funds. Moreover, in the context of Horizon 2020, SatCen i s participating in the BigDataEurope project, and in particular in the Big Data in Secure Societies programme. This programme aims at assessing tools that help to manage extremely large and complex datasets in a timely and efficient manner. With the aim of exploiting synergies between the civil and military worlds, EASA collaborates with EDA and other institutions active in the military domain to address the defence and security challenges for aviation safety. Civil and military aircraft operate from the same airports and use the same airspace. Moreover, a very important part of military (transport) aircraft design can be shared with civil aircraft. EASA certifies the civil configuration of military or dual-use products (planes, tankers, helicopters and drones), hence contributing to the growth and competitiveness of the European defence sector.

        "Key takeaways Building on their expertise in a wide range of areas, the agencies support the European Institutions as they make decisions and implement policies. The decentralisation of tasks to agencies targets increasing the efficiency of the European Union, but also brings Europe closer to citizens in many Member States. As decisions in more and more policy fields are taken and implemented by the Union, agencies play an important role in many aspects of the everyday life of citizens. These include food, medicine and chemical safety, education and knowledge, work environments, justice and fundamental rights, transport and security. ",
        "For the past four decades, EU Agencies have supported the work of the European Institutions and Member States. In 20 years, the number of EU agencies, bodies and offices has gone from 10 in 1995 to 44 in 2016. A growing number of specialised tasks has been decentralised from the core of European Institutions to bodies located across the European Union. The Union has gone through crises of various natures \u2013 financial and economic, migratory, internal and external security. In the face of these crises, agencies have been flexible and adaptive to ever-changing circumstances, participating in their resolution. They have focused on delivering value and tangible benefits for European citizens and businesses. The agencies are instrumental in bringing to life the fundamental objectives of the Union underlined in the Lisbon Treaty, namely: \u2022 Promoting peace and the well-being of citizens in Europe; \u2022 Building and sustaining an area of freedom, security and justice; \u2022 Establishing an efficient and sustainable internal market; \u2022 Establishing an economic and monetary union whose currency is the euro; \u2022 Upholding and promoting the Union\u2019s values in its relations with the wider world. Their actions for the implementation of these objectives enhance the well-being of citizens and the competitiveness of the Union. This report demonstrates how agencies contribute to the Europe 2020 Agenda and the Juncker Commission Agenda by highlighting nine areas in which they positively impact various aspects of citizens\u2019 everyday lives. In the field of freedom, security and justice , agencies contribute to ensuring the free movement of people within the Schengen area, guaranteeing a high level of security to citizens within that area by enhancing police and judicial cooperation, managing external borders, migration flows and asylum, and promoting fundamental rights. When it comes to the supervision of financial systems , agencies work towards strengthening consumer protection through more integrated European supervision and regulation of financial systems. Moreover, agencies create incentives for investment and innovation in Europe. Their activities include developing skills, setting up collaborative research projects, facilitating the market entry of innovative products and services and protecting intellectual property rights. They ensure safe, efficient and effective transport of people and goods in Europe, as well as the supply of affordable and environmentally friendly energy for citizens and businesses. They support EU businesses and innovation through digital connectivity by participating in the completion of a connected Digital Single Market. Agencies also focus on protecting citizens in all their social and economic activities, as well as the environment. They work towards ensuring that Europeans are protected from unsafe products and communicable diseases, and that sustainable development practices counter the effects of climate change, and promote a fair working environment in all Member States. They strive for the development of skills and education to better match the evolving needs of the labour market. Finally, agencies support the Union\u2019s external policy that strives to guarantee the defence and security of EU citizens and territory and promote peace within and beyond the EU\u2019s borders, in order to increase prosperity and safeguard democracy. And the action of agencies also has an external dimension as they encourage the development of international standards, thereby bringing value to the rest of the world in addition. Agencies operate in a dynamic environment. They are ready to adapt to the Union\u2019s evolving objectives. They are already working towards the new goals highlighted by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in the 2016 State of the Union address, in particular the preservation of the European way of life and the empowerment and defence of citizens 41 . Their missions and actions are fully in line with the Union\u2019s 2017 budget focus on growth, jobs and addressing migration and its root causes. 41 State of the Union 2016 by Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, 14 September 2016. 42 ACER Communication Strategy 2014-2015, p. 4.

        "ACER Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators ACER contributes to Sustawinable Growth via its actions towards an efficient functioning of the Single Market by working towards the completion of the Internal Energy Market, tackling the infrastructure challenges, monitoring wholesale energy markets, and dealing with longer-term regulatory challenges. Through its work, ACER contributes to an efficient, transparent, competitive and sustainable Internal Energy Market. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2011 \u2022 Location: Ljubljana, Slovenia \u2022 Staff: 92 FTEs (AWP 2016) ACER\u2019s mission is to \u201cwork towards the completion of the EU internal energy market for electricity and natural gas by complementing and coordinating the work of national energy regulators at EU level\u201d 42 . Background ACER was created in 2011 in order to support the completion of the Internal Energy Market, hence filling the regulatory gaps inherent to the national competences of the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). Initially, the Agency contributed to the development of common market and network operation rules and to the development of the European energy networks. At the same time, the Agency started coordinating and supporting the Electricity and Gas Regional Initiatives in order to accelerate the integration of energy markets into a single market. As from 2012, the Agency began to monitor the Internal Energy Market. Following the publication of different legislative acts (see examples in the paragraphs below), ACER\u2019s mandate has continued to be revised in the last years and its tasks and responsibilities are still expected to evolve to meet the future challenges of the energy market. In order to fulfil its mission, ACER currently focuses on four strategic areas. Contribution to an efficient functioning of the Internal Market ACER works towards the completion of a competitive and transparent internal market for electricity and natural gas that will benefit consumers by offering them more choice, fair cost-reflective prices and the security of energy supply. This is mainly achieved through the Agency\u2019s action in the following two areas. 1. (Post-) Completion of the Internal Energy Market The Council of the EU declared in 2011 that the Internal Energy Market should be completed by 2014. This objective has advanced significantly but some progress is still needed. Being one of the core priorities of the agency, ACER has contributed substantively to this aim and still continues on its track by working towards the development and adoption of Network Codes and Guidelines (aiming at the harmonisation of the rules for the cross- border exchange of electricity). Through its activity, ACER also collaborates with the different NRAs. Another activity within this area of action is the monitoring of the Internal Energy Market to identify the needs for regulatory interventions. Moreover, ACER publishes the Annual Market Monitoring Report which comprises all relevant developments in the EU\u2019s gas and electricity markets.

        "\u201cIn 2015, progress toward completing the Internal Energy Market (IEM) has continued apace. Together the Agency and the national regulators (NRAs) have made significant advances in developing and implementing the Network Codes; contributed to the promotion of essential energy infrastructure; and taken a giant leap towards ensuring the transparency and integrity of wholesale energy markets. All this is good news for consumers who stand to benefit substantially from a well- functioning IEM.\u201d 43 Lord Mogg, Chair of ACER\u2019s Board of Regulators should be completed by 2014. This objective has advanced significantly but some progress is still needed. Being one of the core priorities of the agency, ACER has contributed substantively to this aim and still continues on its track by working towards the development and adoption of Network Codes and Guidelines (aiming at the harmonisation of the rules for the cross- border exchange of electricity). Through its activity, ACER also collaborates with the different NRAs. Another activity within this area of action is the monitoring of the Internal Energy Market to identify the needs for regulatory interventions. Moreover, ACER publishes the Annual Market Monitoring Report which comprises all relevant developments in the EU\u2019s gas and electricity markets. 2. Wholesale energy market integrity and transparency ACER contributes to the implementation of the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT), which aims at a well-functioning European energy market in which energy is traded with transparency and integrity, i.e. where prices reflect the balance between supply and demand. REMIT also includes some provisions on trade and fundamental data reporting, which provides ACER with the necessary information to monitor and detect market manipulation, market abuse and insider trading. Abusive practices are notified to NRAs for further investigation. This work also contributes to the security of energy supply which is also a crucial aspect of the European Commission\u2019s Energy Union priority. Contribution to an energy Union and climate change 3. The infrastructure challenge ACER works in the framework of the Trans- European Energy Infrastructure (TEN-E) Regulation that aims at the development of critical energy infrastructures for example through Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), which also contribute to a more integrated European energy market. ACER is engaged in energy network development projects with the purpose of \u201cremoving \u2018energy islands\u2019, i.e. better connecting those EU regions whose systems have limited interconnection capacity with the rest of the Union\u201d 44 . ACER identifies potential PCIs through cost-benefit analyses and can decide on investment requests and cross-border cost allocation of PCIs. As such, ACER supports the development of a cost-efficient network that prevents bottlenecks due to physical congestion at interconnection points on the transmission systems, hence improving energy security and enhancing sustainability. 4. Future challenges (including the integration of renewable energy source) ACER works towards the future of energy networks, one of the challenges of which will be the integration and greater penetration of renewable energy sources. Those changes will help to reach EU climate targets but may require specific regulatory responses. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies ACER is collaborating with ESMA for the activity of monitoring energy markets for abusive behaviour and insider trading. It is also collaborating with third countries whose energy networks are connected with the EU\u2019s network (e.g. Switzerland, Norway). Moreover, relevant EU regulations and ACER\u2019s work also impact the jurisdiction of Contracting Parties of the Energy Community, which are non-EU countries. 45 The Early Voluntary Implementation Process In 2006 the European Energy Regulators launched the Electricity and Gas Regional Initiatives to promote regional cooperation and accelerate the implementation of the Internal Energy Market. It consisted in the voluntary implementation of the Network Codes and Guidelines provisions, still in the rule-making process, so that it could benefit the energy consumers before that the rules for cross-border exchange of energy became binding. As from its creation in 2011, ACER took over the coordination and supporting role in this process. This strategy was particularly successful in the case of electricity day-ahead market and in the allocation of capacity on cross-border gas interconnectors. When a few Network Codes and Guidelines entered into force at the end of 2014, the progress achieved by the early implementation process made it possible to claim that the Internal Energy Market was substantially completed in several areas.

        "BBI JU Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking BBI JU is a public-private partnership (PPP) dedicated to developing a sustainable European bio-based industry. It contributes to Smart and Inclusive Growth in Europe by fostering innovation, competitiveness and job creation in rural areas. It also works towards ensuring Sustainable Growth through the development of a clean source of energy in the context of the transition towards a petroleum-free society. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Joint Undertaking \u2022 Foundation year: 2014 \u2022 Location: Brussels, Belgium \u2022 Staff: 21 FTEs (AWP 2016) The BBI JU is a \u20ac3.7 billion PPP between the Union and the Bio- based Industries Consortium (BIC), a non-profit organisation which represents the industry group that supports the BBI JU initiative. Its members include European small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs), regional clusters, trade associations and industry-led stakeholder fora (European Technology Platforms) involved in the bio-based industry. The PPP\u2019s mission is to increase investment for the development of sustainable and competitive European bio-based industry and value chains. EU funds amount to \u20ac975 million within the Horizon 2020 research programme, while private investments represent \u20ac2.7 billion. Background The European Commission has highlighted the importance of bio-based industries and value chains both for the transition towards a sustainable, post- petroleum society 46 and for European competitiveness 47 . These goals coincide with the Lisbon Treaty objectives of sustainable development, environment protection and scientific advance, as well as territorial cohesion 48 . Europe 2020\u2019s Innovation Union flagship initiative encompasses these considerations by setting to improve framework conditions for research and innovation in Europe. To this end, the BBI JU Initiative carried out by the Joint Undertaking is aiming to develop the emerging use of biomass for industrial and energy purposes in line with the imperatives of food security, natural resources scarcity and environment protection. The growth of this nascent sector is stalled by the dispersion of technical competences and the lack of public data on the availability of renewable biological resources for the production of bio-based materials, which is necessary for the establishment of competitive value chains in Europe. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment The BBI JU focuses on addressing the technology and innovation challenges faced by the nascent bio-based industry and its value chains. In particular, the lack of publicly- available information on the availability of biomass supply for bio-based industries creates uncertainty and thus deters private investment in research, demonstration and deployment activities in Europe. \u201cA strong European bio- based industrial sector will significantly reduce Europe\u2019s dependency on fossil-based based products, moving Europe more quickly towards the many socio-economic benefits of a post- petroleum society.\u201d 49 Philippe Mengal, Executive Director AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET LEVEL OF EU ACTION BBI JU BBI JU\u2019s Strategic Objectives BBI JU\u2019s Strategic Activities JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES EUROPE IN THE WORLD JOBS, GROWTH & INVESTMENT ENERGY UNION & CLIMATE CHANGE EU 2020 PILLARS Set - based alternatives Demonstrate technologies that enable new chemicals, materials and consumer products from European biomass, which replace the need for fossil-based inputs Develop business models that integrate economic actors along the value chain Value chain demonstration projects R&D projects focused on filling the gaps in technological innovations Value chains supporting projects addressing cross-cultural challenges Set-up flagship biorefinery plants that deploy the technolo- gies and business models for bio-based materials, chemicals and fuels and are competitive with fossil based alternatives SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING 46.

        "Contribution to jobs, growth and investment The BBI JU focuses on addressing the technology and innovation challenges faced by the nascent bio-based industry and its value chains. In particular, the lack of publicly-available information on the availability of biomass supply for bio-based industries creates uncertainty and thus deters private investment in research, demonstration and deployment activities in Europe. The BBI JU implements research and innovation activities to mitigate risks and support the development of sustainable bio-based value chains, with the collaboration of all the value chain stakeholders, i.e. primary production and processing industries, consumer brands, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), research and technology centres and universities. \u201cA strong European bio- based industrial sector will significantly reduce Europe\u2019s dependency on fossil-based based products, moving Europe more quickly towards the many socio-economic benefits of a post- petroleum society.\u201d Philippe Mengal, Executive Director By allowing the potential of the European bio-based sector to unfold, the BBI JU contributes to high-skilled jobs creation, especially in Europe\u2019s rural and underdeveloped areas, and significant increases in farmers\u2019 incomes, a driver of Inclusive Growth in the long term. It participates in the re-industrialisation of the EU economy through the development of bio-based products which benefit consumers, farmers and diversify industries\u2019 revenue streams. It also enables Europe to be at the forefront of research on the bio-economy and fosters Smart Growth based on an innovative use of resources, thereby boosting European companies\u2019 competitiveness in line with the EU Innovation Union flagship initiative. Contribution to a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy The BBI JU supports the development of an industry which turns waste, agriculture and forestry residues into greener everyday products through innovative, waste-free technologies. Its actions are therefore instrumental in achieving Europe\u2019s sustainable development goals. In particular, it participates in the achievement of the 2030 targets of replacing at least 30% of oil-based chemicals and materials with bio-based and degradable ones, and of meeting Europe\u2019s transport energy needs with advanced biofuels, while optimising land use and food security. The BBI JU Initiative plays a key role in the transition towards a petroleum-free society, increasing resource efficiency and limiting the environmental impact of economic growth. It thus actively works towards achieving Sustainable Growth in Europe. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies The BBI JU collaborates closely with other EU programmes in a wide range of areas, including environment, competitiveness and SMEs. It also works with Cohesion Policy funds and Rural Development Policy towards strengthening regional and national research and innovation capabilities in the framework of specialised strategies. Fostering regional growth in Europe through multipurpose biorefineries The 2014 FIRST2RUN project, which received a \u20ac17 million EU contribution, demonstrates the technological, economic and environmental sustainability at an industrial scale: \u2022 transforming under-utilised crops like cardoon (a typical thistle growing wild in Sardinia) into chemical building blocks to be turned into biolubricants, cosmetics and bioplastics; \u2022 processing them in different ways (chemical, biochemical, thermochemical); \u2022 creating value from by- and co-products for energy, feed products and added value chemicals. The impact will be to revitalise the local economy by reconverting old industrial sites and the creation of skilled jobs: estimated 60 new skilled jobs every kiloton of produced bioplastics across the whole value chain.

BEREC is a body without legal personality, composed of the Board of Regulators which brings together representatives of National Regulatory Authorities (NRA) of the EU Member States responsible for the regulation of electronic communications. BEREC strives to enhance the internal market for electronic communications and network services. BEREC\u2019s mission is to \u201c[ensure] the independent, consistent, and high-quality application of the European regulatory framework for electronic communications markets for the benefit of Europe and its citizens\u201d 50 . The BEREC Office is a decentralised agency of the EU. Its mandate is to provide professional and administrative support services to BEREC. The mission of the BEREC Office is to \u201cprovide superior professional support to BEREC by assisting it in an efficient, proactive and timely manner in the achievement of its objectives, and thus contributing to the development of the electronic communications market for the benefit of Europe and its citizens\u201d 51 . In this respect, the BEREC Office\u2019s main objectives are 52 to: \u2022 maintain appropriate capacity while taking into account the effects of technology and market developments; \u2022 develop expertise to encompass EU regulatory developments; \u2022 assist BEREC to improve its working methods and quality of output. The BEREC Office is responsible for: \u2022 establishing the BEREC Expert Working Groups (EWGs) and supporting their activities; \u2022 best practices and information collection, exchange and dissemination among NRAs; \u2022 for providing assistance to the Board of Regulators, its preparatory bodies and to the BEREC Chair and Vice-Chairs and; \u2022 for ensuring the internal and external transparency and accountability of BEREC\u2019s activities.

        "Contribution to innovation and competitiveness A competitive European telecom market enhances European economy and fuels innovation. Two of BEREC\u2019s strategic priorities are \u201cpromoting competition and investment\u201d and \u201cempowering and protecting end-users\u201d. BEREC and the NRAs focus on creating the right (effective and consistent) regulatory environment in order to promote competition and foster investment and innovation. In the last year, the market has shown increasing convergence and consolidation through important mergers and acquisitions, as well as through the growing presence of bundle offers. As such, BEREC monitors the market to avoid the appearance of oligopolies that would impede competitiveness. Telecommunications is a dynamic sector that has required the development of an intricate web of regulatory measures and rules. While insuring that the market is not distorted, this regulatory framework must also be stable and create incentives for investment in new technologies. BEREC takes a forward- looking and technologically neutral point of view when considering regulations for new business models and technologies. Regulatory intervention is also necessary to protect citizens\u2019 benefits. BEREC and the NRAs ensure that end-users have the necessary information to make sound choices between telecom products. They also make sure that end-users can benefit from the ease of switching between operators, so that they access offers that meet their needs. This behaviour is indeed important to foster competitiveness. As such, regulators promote consumer\u2019s choice, accessibility and affordability. Moreover, BEREC and the NRAs want to make sure that end-users benefit from an open internet and that the quality of the telecommunication services is safeguarded. Finally, BEREC is concerned with end-users protection (including e.g. data privacy, internet security and content regulation) and seek collaboration with other bodies where appropriate to achieve this aim. Contribution to an efficient functioning of the Internal Market and to a Digital Society BEREC\u2019s third strategic priority relates to the fostering of the internal market. To that effect BEREC\u2019s objective is to complete the digital single market so that European businesses and citizens, whatever their location, can benefit from a minimum level of services and access pan-European services. In this respect, BEREC supports the convergence of IP network technologies. In order to achieve this objective, it is important for BEREC and NRAs to develop a consistent regulatory approach based on fair and transparent processes throughout Europe. Moreover, BEREC aims at removing barriers to cross-border provision of telecommunication services. Cross-border issues falling under BEREC\u2019s mandate include a common European approach to consumer protection, to net neutrality 53 and to international mobile roaming. Cooperation with agencies and other bodies The BEREC Office is collaborating with ENISA in the field of the implementation of the internal control standards, ex-post controls and business continuity and with eu-LISA on data protection matters. BEREC\u2019s work on Network Neutrality In 2016 BEREC launched a public consultation on guidelines of the implementation of the new EU rules on Network Neutrality. These guidelines will govern the future use of internet and they are of paramount importance for both the telecommunications industry and the citizens of Europe.

In addition, the Translation Centre aims to contribute to rationalising the use of resources and harmonising procedures in the field of EU translation through interinstitutional cooperation\u201d 54 . Background The Translation Centre was established as a shared service provider for the EU agencies and bodies in order to meet their language needs, in addition to absorbing surplus work of the EU institutions which have their own translation services. With the successive enlargements of the European Union, which increased the number of EU official languages to 24, each EU citizen is entitled to access documents of the EU institutions, agencies and bodies in his or her language. 55 This fundamental right aims at promoting good governance in the Union by ensuring the transparency and openness of its work and by triggering the participation of civil society in the democratic process. The translation of official documents is therefore all the more important since the Union is committed to respecting its cultural and linguistic diversity. 56 Contribution to a Union of Democratic Change As the shared service provider of language services for the EU agencies and bodies, the Translation Centre contributes to the European Commission\u2019s priority of making the European Union a Union of democratic change. In fulfilling its mandate, the Translation Centre facilitates effective multilingualism in the Union by playing its role in partnership with its clients in ensuring access by EU citizens to information in the various EU official languages. \u201cDuring [the first 20 years of its existence], the Centre delivered almost 9 million pages to its 61 clients, thus playing a key role in facilitating and supporting effective multilingualism in the European Union.\u201d 57 (cid:48)(cid:163)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:46)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85) EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET EUROPE IN THE WORLD LEVEL OF EU ACTION CdT CdT\u2019s Strategic Objectives CdT\u2019s Strategic Activities docu(cid:80)ents of translation tools JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES UNION OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGE SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY (cid:55)ranslation(cid:15) re(cid:89)ision(cid:15) (cid:80)odi(cid:564)cation and editing of docu(cid:80)ents Facilitate and su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort e(cid:909)ecti(cid:89)e (cid:80)ultilingualis(cid:80) in EU agencies and bodies (cid:55)ranslation of (cid:38)o(cid:80)(cid:80)unity trade marks and designs (cid:55)er(cid:80)inology(cid:15) language consultancy Sharing of (cid:90)orking (cid:80)ethods (cid:90)ith the E(cid:56)(cid:519)s language ser(cid:89)ices(cid:15) rationalisation of the use of translation tools EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING 54.

        "As the shared service provider of language services for EU agencies and bodies, the Translation Centre was established in order to achieve economies of scale, centralise the costs of outsourcing and avoid the proliferation of mini-translation services in various EU agencies. The centralisation of the provision of translation services for the EU agencies and bodies in the Translation Centre is a cost-efficient solution designed by the EU legislator in order to ensure efficient use of taxpayers\u2019 money. The Translation Centre provides a broad range of language services to the EU institutions, agencies and bodies in the 24 EU official languages (552 language pairs), as well as in various non-EU languages. Its activities include the translation of EU trade marks and designs for the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). In addition, the Translation Centre participates in interinstitutional cooperation between the EU translation services in order to streamline resources and standardise procedures, in line with the latest technological developments, resulting in substantial savings in translation at EU level. Not only does the Translation Centre support the work of EU institutions, bodies and agencies, but it also contributes to making EU policies, communications and reports available to all EU citizens. It promotes multilingualism in the EU by offering its linguistic services in all 24 EU official languages. Enabling EU citizens to access documentation on the work of the EU in their mother tongue significantly reinforces the transparency and openness of the work of institutions, and thereby the link between citizens and the EU. This is paramount to achieving a Union of Democratic Change. IATE: A success story in the field of interinstitutional cooperation By catering for the diverse multilingual communication needs of the EU agencies and bodies, as well as for the specific needs of the EU institutions, the Translation Centre contributes to bringing the EU and its numerous fields of activity closer to EU citizens. One of the most striking achievements of interinstitutional cooperation was the launch by the Translation Centre of the IATE project (Inter-Active Terminology for Europe) in 2003. The IATE terminology database has been open to the public since 2007 and brings together the terminological resources of all the EU translation services. The Translation Centre manages this large-scale project on behalf of its EU institutional partners. With 8.6 million terms covering the 24 official languages of the Union, this database is a highly popular resource not only for translators but also for any citizen who has questions about terms used in EU legislation and publications. In 2015, 41 million queries were submitted to the public version of IATE, which is accessible free of charge at http://iate.europa.eu.

Changing stakeholder needs has seen Cedefop\u2019s work evolve. Its original 1975 founding regulation is being revised to reflect that Cedefop is now recognised as a centre of expertise with an important European VET policy support role and a leader worldwide on qualifications frameworks, skill forecasting and green skills 58 . Being at the interface of VET and the labour market, Cedefop provides new knowledge and evidence, monitors policy trends and analyses policy developments. The agency also acts as a knowledge broker for countries and stakeholders to \u201cstrengthen European cooperation in VET and support the European Commission, Member States and social partners in designing and implementing policies for a world-class and inclusive VET that provide skills and qualifications relevant for working lives and the labour market\u201d 59 . Cedefop\u2019s work is widely used by EU Institutions and international bodies, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Through tailored publications, videos and social media activities, the Agency also reaches out to a wider VET audience. Contribution to jobs, growth & investment Supporting modernisation of VET systems Under the Copenhagen process, which began in 2002 and was subsequently included in the Europe 2020 Strategy, Cedefop has worked with its stakeholders to modernise VET systems and make them more flexible to raise qualification levels, increase lifelong learning and encourage mobility. Cedefop\u2019s regular reports on policy developments and challenges for VET are used by policymakers to agree and monitor common European VET priorities. Using Cedefop\u2019s analyses, the European Commission, Member States and social partners agreed on new priorities for 2015- 2020. To support policy development and implementation, Cedefop will continue to monitor and report on progress made in addressing new priorities. Cedefop\u2019s Country statistical overviews set out 33 indicators that monitor the performance of VET systems, including progress towards AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET LEVEL OF EU ACTION (cid:38)edefo(cid:83) (cid:38)edefo(cid:83)(cid:519)s Strategic Objectives (cid:38)edefo(cid:83)(cid:519)s Strategic Activities (cid:38)ontribution to (cid:57)E(cid:55) (cid:83)olicy design and i(cid:80)(cid:83)le(cid:80)entation JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES Su(cid:83)(cid:83)orting the (cid:80)odernisation of (cid:57)E(cid:55) syste(cid:80)s JOBS, GROWTH & INVESTMENT MIGRATION EU 2020 PILLARS Strengthening coo(cid:83)eration in (cid:57)E(cid:55) (cid:83)olicy INTERNAL MARKET EUROPE IN THE WORLD INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY (cid:36)nalysing skills and co(cid:80)(cid:83)etence needs to infor(cid:80) (cid:57)E(cid:55) (cid:83)ro(cid:89)ision SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH 89 ",
        "the Europe 2020 targets of at least 40% of 30-34\u2013year-olds completing tertiary level education and reducing rates of early school leaving to below 10%. \u201cMany demands are being made of VET; these include improving employability, addressing inequality, managing changing skill needs, increasing productivity, raising the labour market participation of a shrinking and ageing labour force and developing the green economy. Cedefop is involved in many European initiatives to help VET meet these demands.\u201d 60 Joachim James Calleja, Director Preceding Europe 2020 Strategy but now linked to its flagship initiative Youth on the move, to promote mobility for learning and work, Cedefop has played a major role in developing several common European tools, including the European qualifications framework (EQF) and Europass as well as the new Mobility Scoreboard for VET. The EQF compares all types of national qualifications with each other and those from other countries. Cedefop also maintains Europass as a portfolio of documents that show someone\u2019s skills in a standard European format available in 27 languages. The mobility scoreboard for VET aims at helping Member States identify where to invest effort to ensure mobility for learning is successful. Apprenticeship is being revived in the Union. Through its data and research, Cedefop advocates for work-based learning and encourages international partnerships under the European alliance for apprenticeships. It reviews Member States\u2019 apprenticeship arrangements at their request. Analysing skills and competence needs To strengthen alignment between VET and a changing labour market, Cedefop produces the only pan-European skill supply and demand forecasts. First produced in 2008, the forecasts now support the Europe 2020 New skills and jobs flagship initiative. The forecasts for the Union and each Member State reveal differences across countries that may influence national VET policy priorities. With the European Commission, Cedefop operates the EU Skills Panorama, a web platform with data on trends in skills and jobs across Europe. Addressing skills mismatch is an EU policy priority. Cedefop\u2019s 2014 European skills and jobs survey on skill mismatch provides strong evidence that traditional ideas of skill mismatch being due to a lack of available skills is too simplistic. The survey shows around 25% of highly qualified young adult employees in the EU are overqualified for their job, while 33% need only basic or no ICT skills at all in their jobs. In June 2016, the European Commission, drawing on Cedefop\u2019s work, launched its Skills Agenda, which Cedefop will be key in implementing. Contribution to the new policy on migration It remains to be seen how the influx of refugees and asylum seekers into the EU will affect VET. Cedefop is examining how Member States are integrating new arrivals into education and training or the labour market. European tools and validation systems could play an important role. Cedefop, with the European Commission, periodically publishes new European guidelines for validating informal and non- formal learning. In recent years, Cedefop has also contributed to developing evidence to help policy makers address the challenges of demographic change. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies Cedefop works with ETF and Eurofound . It also cooperates with international organisations such as the OECD, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNESCO.

Since 1 July 2016, the date of its new legal mandate, CEPOL\u2019s official name is \u201cThe European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training\u201d. CEPOL has dedicated National Units (CNUs) in every Member State to provide information and assistance to law enforcement officials who wish to participate in CEPOL\u2019s activities. CNUs also support CEPOL\u2019s operations. Contribution to the area of Justice, Freedom and Security CEPOL contributes to a safer Europe by facilitating cooperation and knowledge sharing among law enforcement officials of the EU Member States and to some extent, from third countries, on issues stemming from EU priorities in the field of security; in particular, from the EU Policy Cycle on serious and organised crime. CEPOL brings together a network of training institutes for law enforcement officials in EU Member States and supports them in providing frontline training on security priorities, law enforcement cooperation and information exchange. CEPOL also works with EU bodies, international organisations, and third countries to ensure that the most serious security threats are tackled with a collective response. The agency\u2019s annual work programme is built with input from this network and other stakeholders, resulting in topical and focused activities designed to meet the needs of Member States in the priority areas of the EU internal security strategy. Moreover, CEPOL assesses training needs to address EU security priorities. CEPOL constantly strives to offer innovative and advanced training activities by integrating relevant developments in knowledge, research & technology, and by creating synergies through strengthened cooperation.

        "CEPOL in a nutshell \u2022 Supports, develops, implements & coordinates training for law enforcement officials; \u2022 Awards grants to national training institutions (framework partners) for the implementation of its training portfolio; \u2022 Cooperates with third countries within the framework of working arrangements \u2022 Trains leaders, future leaders and trainers; \u2022 Integrates research into training. CEPOL\u2019s stakeholders are essential actors in assessing the training needs of the European law enforcement community. The annual Work Programme was elaborated with input from the agency\u2019s network and stakeholders, and resulted in topical and focused activities in line with the EU internal security strategy, and tailored to the needs of Member States. The portfolio of activities is developed around eleven strategic priorities areas, ranging from leadership to counter-terrorism, cybercrime, EU cooperation and serious and organised crime. Learning products were designed to facilitate sharing of knowledge and good practices, and to contribute to the development of a common European law enforcement culture. A comprehensive assessment system is in place to ensure the quality of CEPOL\u2019s training portfolio. Course evaluation aims at assessing training efficiency, but also at measuring participants\u2019 satisfaction rates. Post-course evaluations are carried out on participants and their line managers approximately six months after the completion of a residential activity. \u201cIn 2015, the agency\u2019s training portfolio encompassed 151 training activities (85 residential activities and 66 webinars), 428 exchanges in the frame of the European Police Exchange Programme- EPEP, 24 online modules, one online course, and nine common curricula. For the fifth year in a row the outreach of the agency has increased: CEPOL trained 12 992 law enforcement professionals in 2015 vs. 10 322 in 2014.\u201d 62 Dr. Ferenc B\u00e1nfi, CEPOL Executive Director CEPOL\u2019s portfolio focuses on 11 priority topics stemming from the EU Agenda on Security: 01. The EU Policy Cycle to tackle Serious and Organised Crime 2014-2017 (in 2015, 21 residential courses and 41 webinars); 02. Other organised international crime (in 2015, six residential courses and seven webinars); 03. Counter terrorism (in 2015, six residential courses and two webinars); 04. Special law enforcement techniques (in 2015, nine residential courses and five webinars); 05. EU police and judicial cooperation and networks (in 2015, 12 residential courses and four webinars); 06. External dimension of the area of Freedom, Security and Justice (in 2015, nine residential courses and one webinar); 07. Maintenance of law and order and public security (in 2015, six residential courses); 08. Leadership, learning, training and language development (in 2015, five residential courses and seven webinars); 09. Research and science (in 2015, a global conference and one webinar); 10. Crime prevention (in 2015, two residential courses); 11. Fundamental rights (in 2015, three courses and ten webinars). Cooperation with other agencies and bodies As from 1st July 2016, CEPOL has a coordinating role in the implementation of the European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS) proposed by the Commission in 2013. This scheme foresees a more efficient coordination of trainings between Member States, the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies (CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, EMCDDA, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA, Frontex) and international organisations such as i.e. Interpol. The objective is to ensure a coherent approach and response to law enforcement training needs. The scheme aims at: \u2022 ensuring that law enforcement cooperation instruments (e.g. Europol\u2019s databases) are well known and used; \u2022 equipping law enforcement officers with the knowledge and skills needed to combat cross-border crime; \u2022 guaranteeing that officers working with third countries or contributing to EU civilian missions are properly trained. \u2022 LETS shall hence contribute to enhancing policing standards and collaboration across the EU.

Its purpose is to reduce the environmental impact of the life cycle of the aeronautical products and to achieve by 2020 the following environmental goals (compared to year 2000 values): \u2022 fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduced by 50%, \u2022 Nitrous oxides (NOx) emissions reduced by 80%, \u2022 Reduction in perceived external noise of 50%. 64 The Clean Sky 2 JU has seen the collaboration of major aeronautical manufacturers but also of a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from all the air transport sectors. The research and innovation work to develop, integrate and validate new technologies has been structured in six Integrated Technology Demonstrators (ITDs): smart fixed wing aircraft, green regional aircraft, green rotorcraft, sustainable and green engines, systems for green operations and eco-design. Moreover, Clean Sky 2 JU has put in place a Technology Evaluator, i.e. a simulation network that assesses the environmental and societal impact of the developed technologies. Following the positive outcomes of Clean Sky 2 JU , the European Commission extended the programme with Clean Sky 2 JU, which started in 2014 within the Horizon 2020 framework. Clean Sky 2 JU research and innovation activities are funded by private and public investments of about \u20ac4 billion and will run until 2024. The transition period between the two phases of the Clean Sky research programme is foreseen for 2014-2017. Contribution to smart and sustainable growth Clean Sky 2 JU fosters the development of near-term solutions and longer term breakthrough innovations in order to fulfil the following objectives: \u2022 Creating resource-efficient transport that respects the environment. Clean Sky 2 JU focuses on completing the work of Clean Sky programme in achieving the 2020 environmental targets.

The first objective contributes to the EU 2020 Strategy area of action aiming at fighting climate change and the European Commission\u2019s priority on Energy Union and climate change. The second and third objectives contribute to EU 2020 Strategy areas of action \u201cinnovation\u201d, through increased R&D spending, and \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d, by boosting the industrial base. This corresponds to the Juncker Commission priority \u201cJobs, Growth and Investment\u201d. The objective of Clean Sky is to develop selected technologies towards a higher level of maturity so that they can prove to be efficient in operational situations. The purpose of the Integrated Demonstration Programmes (ITDs) is to integrate different technologies at higher system or aircraft level and conduct realistic operational assessments to evaluate their feasibility and their environmental impact. A second Clean Sky\u2019s instrument is the concept aircraft, where technologies are integrated in a viable conceptual configuration for rotorcraft, business jets, or regional and large commercial aircrafts. Clean Sky 2 JU programme builds on Clean Sky activities described above and is made of a technology evaluator and \u2022 Innovative Aircraft Demonstrator Platforms (IADPs) for large passenger aircraft, regional aircraft and fast rotorcraft; \u2022 Integrated Technology Demonstrators (ITDs) focusing on airframe, engines and systems; \u2022 Transverse activities consisting in small air transport and eco-design. Through the funding of those different research programmes, Clean Sky 2 JU contributes to Europe 2020 Strategy\u2019s smart and sustainable growth, by fostering investments in innovative technologies that will make air transport greener, enhance the competitiveness of the European industry and safeguard highly skilled jobs in Europe. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies Clean Sky 2 JU cooperates with SESAR JU \u2013 which focuses on Air Traffic Management \u2013 for a greener European air transport system, in order to avoid overlap and ensure consistency between the two research and innovation programmes. Their cooperation covers some joint activities in relevant research areas. Flight trajectory management influences for example the possible aircraft fuel economy.

It is part of the Smart Fixed Wings Clean Sky technology platform working on innovative laminarity for wings. As part of the Clean Sky programme in PROUD (precision outer wing assembly devices), SERTEC is working on two different parts: new concept tooling and automatic wing assembly. The project has achieved innovative solutions for the design and manufacturing of the tooling of two different kinds of configuration for the outer wings. In addition, it has developed a new way of using intelligent systems and high precision robots to accomplish small parts assembly automatically (or with low human interaction). 94 ",

CPVO Community Plant Variety Office CPVO manages the EU plant breeders\u2019 rights system and grants intellectual property rights for plant varieties. It thereby creates strong incentives for innovation and investment in new plant varieties, leading to higher and more sustainable agricultural outputs and job creation in rural areas. The CPVO therefore contributes to Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 1995 \u2022 Location : Angers, France \u2022 Staff: 45 FTEs (AWP 2016) The CPVO\u2019s mission is \u201cto foster innovation in plant varieties by high quality processing of applications for Community plant variety rights at affordable costs while providing policy guidance and assistance in the exercise of these rights for the benefit of stakeholders\u201d. 65 Background The EU enjoys the biggest intellectual property rights system for plant varieties in the world: the plant breeders\u2019 rights (PBR) system. It allows the free use of protected plant varieties for the breeding of new varieties and promotes innovation on plant breeding. The CPVO manages this system and grants intellectual property rights for plant varieties within this unified framework at EU level. Contribution to a new boost for jobs, growth and investment Protecting plant varieties enables breeders to collect royalties and thereby recover their investment in research and development. By ensuring the effective protection of plant breeders\u2019 rights in the Union and abroad, the CPVO is instrumental in fostering research, development and innovation in new plant varieties. The increased yields resulting from improved crops generate additional farm income and jobs, especially in the most disadvantaged areas 66 . Encouraging job creation is of paramount importance in the plant breeding and seed production sector, which already involves over EU 7,000 companies \u2013 a majority of which are family- owned SMEs. The work of the CPVO work contributes to the economic sustainability of these companies, and the competitiveness of the EU plant breeding industry, the world\u2019s largest exporter of seed plant material. The Office is also involved in the development of intellectual property training programmes in partnership with European universities and Commission research programmes, to reinforce knowledge in this field. \u201cThe Community protection system managed by CPVO provides an added value in the sense that breeders can get return on investment throughout the entire European Union.\u201d 67 AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET LEVEL OF EU ACTION CPVO CPVO\u2019s Strategic Objectives CPVO\u2019s Strategic Activities Advise EU Institutions and Member States on plant variety rights legislation JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES Processing and taking decisions on applications for EU plant variety rights EUROPE IN THE WORLD JOBS, GROWTH & INVESTMENT DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET EU 2020 PILLARS INTERNAL MARKET Raising awareness on plant variety protection Support research and development on testing methods Contribute to the enforcement of EU variety rights ENERGY UNION & CLIMATE CHANGE BALANCED EU - US FTA SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY Optimise EU plant variety rights system, quality and costs Improve international cooperation in plant variety protection Collaborate with the Interna- tional Union for the Protection of Varieties of Plants 95 ",
        "Contribution to a digital single market The CPVO encourages the use of digital technologies for more efficient enforcement of plant variety rights. It has developed and shared numerous online databases such as Variety Finder or Plant Variety Rights (PVR) CaseLaw which reinforce the protection and allow sharing information on existing intellectual property rights through digital tools. Contribution to a forward-looking climate change policy The CPVO supports the development of increasingly resistant new plant varieties which reduce the use of crop protection products and of fossil fuels in agriculture. Increased yields also decrease the need for additional land cultivation. This contributes to a reduction of CO2 emissions and water consumption and a better conservation of biodiversity, thus leading to the achievement of the Union\u2019s climate change policy goals. Innovation in plant breeding also increases food security in the face of climate change and a growing world population. Contribution to a deeper and fairer internal market Helping plant breeders to be informed, verify and enforce their intellectual property rights on new varieties, and combat fraud reinforces the internal market. Online databases set up by the CPVO allow the comparison of the implementation of intellectual property law in the field of plant breeding across the Union. This ensures plant breeders enjoy the same level of protection in all Member States. Within the EU plant breeders\u2019 rights system, small farmers are allowed to produce seeds from protected varieties (including potatoes and cereals) for use in their own exploitations. By ensuring the management of a system which foresees the protection of the most fragile producers, and therefore strives towards a fairer internal market, the CPVO also takes part in reinforcing economic, social and territorial cohesion in the Union as foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty. 68 Contribution to a reasonable and balanced free trade agreement with the USA and to Europe\u2019s footprint in the world The CPVO works with the European Commission to ensure the protection of European plant breeders\u2019 rights in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the United States, currently under negotiation. It cooperates with the US Department for Agriculture towards obtaining protection on both sides and on plant variety testing. The CPVO also exports European intellectual property rights protection standards by encouraging neighbouring and EU candidate countries to develop harmonised plant variety protection systems. The CPVO collaborates with non-EU countries and regional organisations for the promotion of the international standards and capacity-building in South America, China, Africa and East Asia. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies The CPVO collaborates with EUIPO in the framework of the European Observatory on infringements of intellectual property rights. The CPVO set up a case law database of judgments on intellectual property rights infringements to be hosted by the EUIPO 69 . PROUD: A SERTEC Clean Sky project Breeders have confidence in the EU system. The EU PVR system is the biggest in the world in terms of received applications (3,500/year) and titles in force (more than 25,000). In the past 15 years, plant breeding in the Union has contributed to: \u2022 Yearly increase in yields on average, e.g. an additional 47 million tons of grains and 7 million tons of oilseeds produced in the EU; \u2022 More carbohydrates, proteins and vegetable oils to feed between 100 and 200 million humans; \u2022 Social welfare gains of almost EUR 9 billion in the agricultural sector and more than EUR 14 billion to the EU GDP; \u2022 An additional farm income of EUR 7,000 on average and 70,000 new jobs in the agricultural sector; \u2022 Ornamental breeders have over the past 20 years bred and protected more than 24,400 new varieties; this has contributed to the creation of jobs and business opportunities in the horticultural sector. 68.

The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2002 \u2022 Location: Cologne, Germany \u2022 Staff: 676 FTEs (AWP 2016) EASA\u2019s mission is to \u201cprovide safe air travel for EU citizens in Europe and worldwide\u201d 70 Background The aviation industry in which EASA operates is dynamic and constantly evolving using new technologies and business models. The expected improvement of the economy, the increasing trade globalisation and the growing participation of emerging markets are factors that are shaping the future of the aviation sector as they involve an increase in the number of passengers and aircrafts. This will have impacts on developments regarding aircraft size, aerodromes and airlines capacity and Air Traffic Management (ATM) as well as on the environment. Moreover, the scarcity of energy supplies and cybersecurity threats represent challenges that will trigger further evolution in the sector. Against this evolving background, EASA assists the European Commission, National Aviation Authorities, the aviation sector and the General Aviation Community in order to make sure civil aviation, through all its developments, achieves the highest level of safety and environmental protection for EU citizens on a global perspective. The Agency carries out activities in the fields of safety management and promotion, regulation, certification, oversight and international cooperation. It advises the European Commission on legislative matters and ensures that regulations are applied correctly by all aviation stakeholders. Contribution to a safe Internal Market and EU\u2019s footprint in the world EASA works in the framework of the Single Market providing the highest common standards of aviation safety and environmental protection for the transport of people and goods. Its work articulates around 7 main activity areas: 1. Safety strategy, management, promotion and data collection EASA has put in place the European Aviation Safety Programme (EASP) and Plan (EASp) to ensure sound safety policy, planning and implementation and the continuous improvement of common safety standards. The EASp has as near-term objective the improvement of risk assessment and performance measurement; as medium- term objective, the implementation by all EASA States 71 of the EASP and their safety management system (SMS) to pro-actively manage safety risks; and as long-term objective, the implementation of predictive systems 72 . Moreover, EASA monitors aviation safety by collecting and analysing data related to all parts of the SMS. The purpose of this activity is to identify key safety risks and support their mitigation. 2. Regulation EASA is responsible for the preparation of EU legislation in the field of civil aviation safety and environmental protection in order to achieve a cost-effective and efficient regulatory system. EASA takes an integrated approach dealing with all aspects of civil aviation domain, such as aircrews, aerodromes, aeronautical products, operators, ATM/ANS, etc. EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET EUROPE IN THE WORLD LEVEL OF EU ACTION EASA EASA\u2019s Strategic Objectives EASA\u2019s Strategic Activities Safety management Safety promotion Regulation (cid:51)roduct Safety (cid:18) En(cid:89)iron(cid:80)ent Oversight ENERGY UNION & CLIMATE CHANGE JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES INTERNAL MARKET Organisation a(cid:83)(cid:83)ro(cid:89)als (cid:918)nternational cooperation JOBS, GROWTH & INVESTMENT A STRONGER GLOBAL ACTOR SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY Ensuring the highest co(cid:80)(cid:80)on le(cid:89)el of safety (cid:83)rotection for E(cid:56) citi(cid:93)ens Ensure the highest co(cid:80)(cid:80)on le(cid:89)el of en(cid:89)iron(cid:80)ental protection Single regulatory and certi(cid:564)cation (cid:83)rocess a(cid:80)ong Member States Facilitating the internal a(cid:89)iation single (cid:80)arket and creating a le(cid:89)el (cid:83)laying (cid:564)eld Working with other international a(cid:89)iation organisations and regulators O(cid:89)ersight of the Euro(cid:83)ean (cid:36)(cid:89)iation Syste(cid:80) 70.

        "3. Certification Product Safety/ Environmental compatibility EASA carries out the initial airworthiness and environmental certification of aeronautical products and parts, and of the continuing airworthiness oversight. Moreover, it provides upon request certification-related services to the industry, aviation authorities or other public institutions (such as the validation of EU products in third countries). Furthermore, EASA issues mandatory safety directives and disseminates safety and security information, which is a means of achieving continuous operational safety and to promote risk awareness and safety culture among the aviation sector stakeholders. EASA issues and publishes for example mandatory Airworthiness Directives and Safety Information Bulletins on issues such as operations, flight crew licensing, aerodromes, or Air Traffic Management/Air Navigation Services (ATN/ANS). EASA is also part of the EU strategy regarding cybersecurity and the safety of passengers flying over or near to conflict zones. It also seeks synergies with the defence industry regarding the certification and continuing airworthiness of military (transport) or dual use aircraft. 4. Organisation approvals The Agency is responsible for the approval and oversight of organisations located outside the EU Member States that are responsible for the production, maintenance, training, continuing airworthiness management, and flight crew licensing as well as the approval and oversight of design organisations (i.e. organisations where most aircraft design activities take place in a controlled and approved environment) wherever located. 5. Oversight of the European Aviation System EASA has been tasked with the monitoring of the implementation by competent national authorities of EU regulation in the field of air operations, aircrew, ATM/ ANS, aerodromes and airworthiness. This activity also contributes to EASA\u2019s objective of improving safety standards. EASA is also part of the EU system of ramp inspections 73 on aircrafts used by EU and third country operators. Inspections are carried out when there is suspicion of non-compliance with the requirements or by way of spot-checks. In addition, EASA also grants authorisations for third country operators performing air transport operations into the EASA states. EASA\u2019s work on General Aviation (GA) A few years ago EASA established a vision and commitments for the GA industry, including better and lighter regulation, which was urgently needed after the initial regulations imposed too much \u2018red tape\u2019 on the GA community. 6 GA strategic principles: \u2022 One size does not fit all; \u2022 Philosophy of minimum necessary rules; \u2022 Adopt a risk-based approach; \u2022 Protect \u2018grandfather rights\u2019 unless there are demonstrable and statistically significant safety reasons against doing so; \u2022 Apply EU smart regulation principles; \u2022 Make the best use of available resources and expertise. 6 GA key objectives \u2022 Facilitate access to IFR Flying; \u2022 Allow the training of private pilot outside Approved Training Organisations; \u2022 Simplify and reduce the costs related to the maintenance of your aircraft (Part M Light, Part CAO); \u2022 Allow and promote the introduction of new technology (or the Standard Changes and Repairs Process); \u2022 Simpler certification process; \u2022 Develop the use of Industry Standards (or CS-23 reorganisation). EASA has successfully put in place specific actions to achieve the aforementioned objectives. 6. International cooperation EASA aims at continuously improving cooperation with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and enhancing external relations with third countries, through the implementation of Bilateral Agreements (currently with the US, Canada and Brazil), Working Arrangements and technical cooperation projects with various states and regions around the world. EASA\u2019s main objectives on the international scene are the reinforcement of safety and environmental protection, the promotion of the EU standards and the support to the EU industry interests. Contribution to an Energy Union and climate change EASA\u2019s regulatory, oversight and certification activities aim at promoting high standards of environmental protection for EU citizens. EASA plays a leading role in developing and implementing ICAO environmental standards for aircraft noise, engine emissions and CO2. Moreover, EASA publishes, together with the European Environment Agency (EEA) and Eurocontrol, the European Aviation Environmental Report on a periodical basis. It has also developed impact assessment tools and guides research projects in cooperation with the European Commission. Contribution to the creation of jobs, growth and investment The certification of aircraft is a key enabler for growth. EASA aims at facilitating the European aviation industry competitiveness, innovation and emerging technologies through proportionate and risk- and performance- based safety regulations, which generate high- value jobs and stimulate growth. Collaboration with other agencies and bodies EASA collaborates with other EU agencies, such as: \u2022 EDA regarding the harmonisation of military aviation safety requirements, and especially certification and continuing airworthiness of military or dual-use aircraft as well as cybersecurity and the fly over or near to conflict zones; \u2022 SESAR JU regarding regulatory, certification and standardisation matters of the systems/services developed by the ATM research programme; \u2022 EEA regarding environmental protection matters and the publication of the European Aviation Environmental Report; \u2022 ECHA regarding the implementation of the REACH Regulation.

the implementation and development of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) by providing support and facilitating, coordinating and strengthening practical cooperation among EU+ countries 74 as an independent centre of expertise on asylum\u201d 75 Background The EU provides to its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice. Within that space, the EU ensures to apply harmonised rules regarding the way it grants international protection to those fleeing prosecution in their home countries. As far as the right to international protection are concerned, the EU hence represents a single area, which needs to be underpinned by a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) to ensure that similar cases are treated in a similar way and result in a similar outcome. Contribution towards a new policy on migration In this context, EASO plays a key role in supporting the EU Institutions, Member States and other bodies regarding further development of the CEAS and the achievement of common asylum practices and processes. In order to fulfil its mission, EASO carries out five main activities. Permanent support In order to create a common approach on asylum, EASO supports and encourages the practical harmonisation of asylum systems by providing common training (material) to asylum and reception officers. EASO also aims at facilitating common standards within the CEAS. EASO works towards the development of a comprehensive common country of origin information (COI 76 ) system. Special support To EU+ countries with specific needs regarding the coherent and comprehensive implementation of the CEAS, EASO provides tailor-made assistance and support, including capacity building, relocation and special quality control processes. Emergency support EASO provides emergency support to EU+ countries whose asylum and reception system are under particular pressure. EASO deploys EU+ countries\u2019 experts under Asylum Support Teams or increases the presence on site of its staff or Member States\u2019 experts, in the so-called \u2018Hotspot\u2019 approach (providing on-the-spot staff and equipment to face exceptional migration EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET LEVEL OF EU ACTION EASO EASO\u2019s strategic objectives EASO\u2019s Strategic Activities S(cid:83)ecial su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort E(cid:80)ergency su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort (cid:918)nfor(cid:80)ation and analysis su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES EUROPE IN THE WORLD Third -country su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort (cid:51)er(cid:80)anent su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort MIGRATION SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY (cid:51)ractical and technical su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort to MS and E(cid:56) (cid:918)nstitutions O(cid:83)erational su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort to MS (cid:90)ith s(cid:83)eci(cid:564)c needs or (cid:90)ith (cid:83)articular (cid:83)ressure on their asylu(cid:80) and rece(cid:83)tion syste(cid:80)s Scienti(cid:564)c in(cid:83)ut for E(cid:56) (cid:83)olicy(cid:80)aking and legislation in all areas ha(cid:89)ing a direct or indirect i(cid:80)(cid:83)act on asylu(cid:80) JUSTICE & FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 74.

Information and analysis support EASO collects and exchanges accurate and up-to-date information and documentation relative to the CEAS and makes it available via a single point of information, the Information and Documentation System. EASO\u2019s work also includes gathering common COI and the development of the Early warning and Preparedness System (EPS) that aims at providing EU+ countries and EU Institutions \u201cwith accurate, timely information and analyses on flows of asylum seekers to and within the EU and the EU+ countries\u2019 capacity to deal with them\u201d 77 . Third country support EASO supports the external dimension of the CEAS through partnerships with international organisations and third countries, by promoting capacity building of asylum and reception systems in key neighbouring third countries, providing training and improving the quality of the asylum process, in countries of origin, transit and destination, and coordinating Member States\u2019 actions on resettlement. 78 Contribution to the area of Justice and Fundamental Rights \u201cAs a centre of expertise on asylum, EASO helps Member States fulfil their European and international obligations to give protection to people in need\u201d 79 . Moreover, EASO supports their cooperation on matters related to vulnerable applicants, such as children and unaccompanied minors, \u201cvictims of trafficking in human beings, victims of torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment, persons at risk because of their gender, gender identity or sexual orientation and any other groups of applicants with special needs\u201d 80 Cooperation with other agencies and bodies EASO is part of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies\u2019 network. EASO hence closely collaborates especially with Frontex, FRA, eu-LISA, EUROPOL, CEPOL and Eurojust. In particular, EASO works with: \u2022 CEPOL, Europol, FRA and Frontex on vulnerable groups issues; \u2022 Frontex on training programmes, quality initiatives, data analysis sharing in the context of EPS and COI, and operational support, including the Hotspot approach (in which Eurojust and Europol also play an important role); \u2022 FRA on information sharing, exchange of research and data collection methodologies, best-practices and expertise related to fundamental rights. Furthermore, EASO also collaborates with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on training, quality processes, trends and analysis, vulnerable groups, resettlement and (third country) operational support. EASO also cooperates with members of courts and tribunals with the goal to harmonise judicial decisions made in asylum cases. EASO\u2019s contribution to Hotspots Present in all operational Hotspots in Greece and Italy, contributing to relocation and registration of asylum seekers, over 10.000 participants in our training modules, provision of Country of Origin Information, developing tools to assist Member States asylum systems. Europe is facing the biggest migratory flow in modern history, and EASO is there to support Member States asylum systems, the EU as a whole and refugees to better cope with the migration challenges. EASO is actively present in Italy and Greece coordinating all activities, supporting the registration, relocation, and further processing of applications of international protection. EASO\u2019s added value: expertise, rapid assistance for countries facing migratory pressures, training and vital information relevant for decision makers.

Through its actions towards a Banking Union, EBA also contributes to a deeper Economic and Monetary Union, which will enhance the competitiveness in the euro area. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type : Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2011 \u2022 Location: London, United Kingdom \u2022 Staff: 189 FTEs (AWP 2016) The EBA\u2019s mission is to \u201cbuild a single regulatory and supervisory framework for the entire banking sector in the 28 EU Member States, so as to ensure an efficient, transparent and stable Single Market that benefits its consumers, businesses and the broader economy\u201d 81 Background The EBA was established in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis of 2007- 2008, which revealed shortcomings in the supervision of financial services institutions due to a lack of cooperation, coordination and trust between the national supervisors, as well as an inconsistent application of EU law across Member States. The severe strain on the stability of the financial system caused by the crisis also put at risk the functioning of the internal market. Restoring and maintaining a stable and reliable financial system is therefore a necessary condition to rebuild and preserve trust in the internal market, and hence foster economic growth. The so- called \u201cFive Presidents\u2019 Report\u201d 82 presents a two-stage roadmap towards the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in order to create a better and fairer life for citizens as well as increase competitiveness within the euro area. The first stage comprises among others the completion of the Financial Union, which encompasses the completion of the Banking Union and the settlement of a Capital Markets Union (CMU). Contribution to an efficient functioning of the internal market The EBA\u2019s work is driven by the reform package adopted by the G20 83 that includes an action plan to gradually strengthen banks\u2019 capital and liquidity, as well as regulatory reforms in the area of recovery and resolution of failing financial institutions to ensure that the cost of bank rescues does not fall on taxpayers. The EBA has three intertwined strategic objectives, i.e. \u201cto maintain financial stability in the EU; to safeguard the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of the banking sector; and to foster consumer protection in all EU Member States by identifying and seeking to address consumer detriment in the financial services sector\u201d 84 . In order to realise these and to contribute to the efficient functioning of the Single Market, the EBA identified eight strategic areas for its activity. \u201cI am very proud that the Single Rulebook in banking is now a reality, with 117 technical standards and 46 guidelines delivered in key areas.\u201d 85 Andrea Enria, EBA Chair EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET EUROPE IN THE WORLD LEVEL OF EU ACTION EBA EBA\u2019s Strategic Objectives EBA\u2019s Strategic Areas Financial stability Consumer protection INTERNAL MARKET JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY Integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of the banking sector Develop and maintain a Single Rulebook Protect consumers and monitor financial innovation Ensure secure, easy and efficient payment services Develop and coordinate resolution policy and resolution plans Promote the convergence of supervisory practices Identify and analyse trends, potential risks and vulnerabilities Maintain and develop the common supervisory reporting framework 81.

        "1. Playing a central role in the regulation and policy framework with the development and maintenance of the Single Rulebook. The objective is to contribute to a level playing field for financial institutions, provide the regulatory basis for a single EU banking sector, and improve the quality of the Financial Regulation as well as the overall functioning of the Single Market. 2. Promoting the development and coordination of resolution policy and resolution plans, and developing common approaches for the resolution of failing financial and credit institutions and financial market infrastructures. The EBA develops resolution plans, assesses resolvability and addresses the obstacles to resolvability. It also compares the plans and provides benchmarks to resolution and supervisory authorities in order to promote common approaches to resolution. 3. Promoting the convergence of supervisory practices to a high standard so as to ensure that regulatory and supervisory rules are implemented equally across all Member States. This activity is essential for the Single Market since it aims at achieving consistent conclusions and a real level playing field. 4. Identifying and analysing trends, potential risks and vulnerabilities stemming from the microprudential level across borders and sectors. The EBA identifies, analyses and addresses key risks in the banking sector in order to ensure the stability of the financial system and the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets. 5. Maintaining and developing the common supervisory reporting framework, as well as strengthening its role as an EU data hub for the collection, use and dissemination of data on EU banks. The EBA plays the role of a data transparency hub for the banks in Europe, in order to make data available for various stakeholders and improve banks\u2019 own disclosures. 6. Protecting consumers and monitoring financial innovation. The EBA enhances the protection of consumers by monitoring and tackling consumer detriment. It stimulates transparency, simplicity and fairness for financial products and services. 7. Ensuring secure, easy and efficient payment services across the EU. The objective is to guarantee a comprehensive set of rules that would make all cross-border payments in Europe as easy as payments within a Member State. 8. Functioning as a competent, responsible and professional organisation, with effective corporate governance and efficient processes. The purpose is to continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the support and administrative processes and to collaborate with the other ESA\u2019s to reach economies of scale. The EBA\u2019s exercise on Transparency The EBA has published in November 2015 the outcome of its 2015 EU-wide transparency exercise and provided detailed bank-by-bank data on capital positions, risk exposure amounts and asset quality on 105 banks from 21 countries of the European Economic Area (EEA) as part of its ongoing commitment to enhancing transparency in the EU Banking sector. The data, which shows improvements in the resilience of the EU banking sector, is published at the highest level of consolidation, covering around 70% of total EU banking assets for the reference dates of 31 December 2014 and 30 June 2015. By disclosing these fully comparable figures in user friendly formats, the EBA aims to promote greater understanding of capital positions and exposures of the EU banking sector and foster market discipline in the Single Market. Contribution to the Banking Union and the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union The Banking Union comprises three pillars: the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS). The EBA collaborates with the SSM mainly by providing tools to enhance regulatory and supervisory convergence and ensure consistent supervisory practices, comparable supervisory outcomes and compliance with EU rules. Moreover, it has stepped up its participation in supervisory colleges where joint and coordinated actions are put into place. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies The EBA operates within the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) that has the purpose of ensuring consistent and coherent micro- and macro-prudential financial supervision 86 in the EU. Micro- prudential supervision is carried out by the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) \u2013 i.e. the EBA, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) \u2013, the Joint Committee of the ESAs and the National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Macro-prudential oversight is conducted at the EU level by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) which comprises the European Central Bank (ECB), the national central banks, the ESAs and the European Commission. The EFSF works towards an efficient functioning of the single market thanks to a regulatory and supervisory framework that is applied equally across Europe. While the day-to-day supervision of the financial institutions mainly remains at national level, the three ESAs bring EU-wide uniform rules and harmonise supervisory approaches across the EU. The ESFS, and the EBA in particular, also cooperates with other supervisory authorities such as the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The EBA has also collaborated with the SRB since its creation in order to provide its experience of resolution planning in the EU via the participation to working groups and various committees. EBA also collaborates with ENISA regarding the cybersecurity challenges of cloud computing in the financial sector.

This entails the need to address gaps in Europe\u2019s defence system against communicable diseases and outbreaks. Prevention and control are of utmost importance for the Union since ever- increasing interconnectedness gives rise to more complex and numerous cross-border threats to human health. Moreover, health has been singled out as an important factor in economic recovery 88 in Europe. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment ECDC provides EU Institutions and Member States with impartial, evidence-based scientific support on communicable diseases and health threats in order to support the efficiency of prevention and control systems for communicable diseases within the Union. Protecting citizens from communicable diseases and unknown threats contributes to achieving all three Europe 2020 objectives of Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth. Indeed, health is a crucial driver for growth in that it increases workers\u2019 productivity and employability, contributes to the financial sustainability and efficiency of healthcare systems by reducing infections-related costs. For that purpose, ECDC provides advice to the European Commission for research and innovation programmes. \u201cReducing the burden of infectious diseases in the highly interconnected Europe of today is always a collaborative effort.\u201d 90 (cid:39)(cid:85)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:41)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:169)(cid:82)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:58)(cid:72)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:41)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:40)(cid:38)(cid:39)(cid:38)(cid:3) (cid:48)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:37)(cid:82)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:85) ECDC is also geared towards reducing inequalities within and across Member States by providing tools and technical assistance to them to set up an equal EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET LEVEL OF EU ACTION ECDC\u2019s Strategic Objectives EDCD\u2019s Strategic Activities Epidemic intelligence Support to response JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES JOBS, GROWTH & INVESTMENT Surveillance of communicable diseases Scienti fi c advice INTERNAL MARKET ECDC EUROPE IN THE WORLD SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY (cid:38)ollection and disse(cid:80)ina- tion of scienti(cid:564)c and technical data (cid:51)ro(cid:89)ision of scienti(cid:564)c opinions and technical assistance (cid:38)oordination of the Euro(cid:83)ean net(cid:90)ork of bodies in the (cid:564)eld of (cid:83)ublic health (cid:38)oordination of the Euro(cid:83)ean net(cid:90)ork of bodies in the (cid:564)eld of (cid:83)ublic health (cid:51)ro(cid:89)ision of ti(cid:80)ely infor(cid:80)ation to E(cid:56)(cid:15) national and international decision(cid:16) (cid:80)akers in the (cid:564)eld of (cid:83)ublic health 87.

        "protection from communicable disease threats to all, especially to the most deprived populations which are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases 89 . By supporting the achievement of each of these objectives, ECDC contributes to delivering more jobs, growth and investment to Europe. 91 Contribution to an efficient functioning of the internal market ECDC activities also ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market by contributing to the protection of citizens from the health threats caused by communicable diseases and arising from the increased mobility within Europe and with the rest of the world. Indeed, increased interconnectedness of people and products aggravates the risk of spread of communicable diseases and outbreaks. In particular, ECDC surveillance, monitoring and risk assessment activities facilitate the swift withdrawal of products unsafe for consumption from the internal market if they endanger the health of European consumers. Contribution to Europe\u2019s footprint in the world ECDC contributes to Europe\u2019s footprint in the world through technical cooperation with third countries and international organisations in the detection and protection from communicable diseases. It shares its knowledge on communicable diseases with the World Health Organisation and the main other centres for disease prevention and control, and expands Europe\u2019s high standards worldwide. ECDC activities, which are open to the participation of third countries, also promote the integration of European standards in the field of prevention and control of communicable diseases in countries which are bound by agreements with the Union to implement EU legislation, especially in the neighbourhood. The agency assists the Commission in developing cooperation on communicable diseases with third countries. Cooperation with other agencies and public bodies ECDC collaborates with other EU agencies to foster cooperation and the exchange of scientific information in the field of public health. It has signed Memoranda of Understanding with EFSA , related to food safety, prevention and control of communicable diseases, and support to emergency response; with EMA in the fields of vaccination, antimicrobial resistance, antivirals and substances of human origins; and with the EMCDDA on monitoring, communication and prevention of the spread of drug-related infectious diseases in Europe. ECDC also punctually collaborates with EEA, EASA, Europol, Frontex and FRA. European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD) EAAD is a European health initiative coordinated by the ECDC which aims to provide a platform to support for national campaigns on the prudent use of antibiotics. Each year, EAAD is marked by national campaigns on the prudent antibiotic use. In 2015, 41 countries took part in EAAD. The goal of EAAD is to provide an evidence-based focus for national campaigns, as well as key messages, campaign materials, technical and political support at EU and Member States levels. EAAD was awarded the European Health Award in 2016. The award supports initiatives focused on the development of sustainable and innovative concepts which successfully address current challenges. The jury stated: \u201cThe project is dealing with probably the most important threat to public health today: antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The EAAD has contributed to placing this issue high on the national and international public and political agenda\u201d.

ECHA helps companies to comply with the legislation, advances the safe use of chemicals, provides information on chemicals and addresses chemicals of concern\u201d 92 . Background The EU chemicals legislation consist of four Regulations which oversee the circulation of chemicals in the Internal Market while guaranteeing the protection of humans and the environment: \u2022 the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals; \u2022 the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of hazardous chemicals; \u2022 the Biocidal Products Regulation; \u2022 the Prior Informed Consent in the international trade of hazardous chemicals and pesticides. ECHA is in charge of their consistent implementation across the Union, in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Treaty\u2019s objectives. 93 Contribution to the efficient functioning of the Internal Market ECHA\u2019s mandate derives from the necessity to harmonise regulatory requirements regarding chemicals and to ensure their consistent implementation across the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA) 94 , in order to guarantee the free movement of substances within a safe framework for human health and the environment throughout the supply chain. \u201c[In 2015] Over half of the dossiers checked by ECHA were on substances expected to have the greatest impact on improved protection for people and the environment.\u201d 95 (cid:42)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:15)(cid:3) (cid:40)(cid:91)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85) For that purpose, it manages the registration, evaluation, labelling and restriction of chemicals, hazardous chemicals and biocidal products. Companies must submit authorisation applications for prioritised substances to ECHA, who delivers a scientific opinion. On the basis of the Agency\u2019s assessment of the risks and socio-economic consequences, the European Commission decides whether or not to grant the authorisation.

        "manages the registration process, which companies must document by providing the Agency with all the information on the substances they manufacture or import. Finally, ECHA evaluates the compliance of registration dossiers, examines proposals to test substances and, in cooperation with Member States, evaluates substances to see whether they represent a risk for human health or the environment. This aims to guarantee that sufficient information is available, in order to ensure that unacceptable risks from chemicals are addressed at EU level while substances of very high concern (SVHCs) are controlled and progressively replaced by safer alternatives 96 , thus maintaining a smooth functioning of the internal market and protecting European citizens and environment. Classifications and labelling also aim to inform consumers and workers on the safe manufacture and use of chemicals. Since EU legislation has assigned the responsibility to assess and manage risks posed by chemicals to the industry, ECHA assists companies in complying with these obligations as well as in making safety information available to users and workers. The Agency also works with national competent authorities to address identified concerns regarding safe use. ECHA also implements the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR), which ensures that sufficient information about biocidal products 97 is available so that consumers can use them safely. The BPR aims to harmonise the market at Union level. The EU authorisation of biocidal products is coordinated by ECHA. Contribution to fostering innovation and competitiveness in the EU ECHA also fosters innovation and competitiveness in the field of chemicals by acting as a hub for building scientific and regulatory capacity at EU level. It provides specific support to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are the bedrock of European growth, and allows companies to protect confidential business information while complying with transparency requirements. Contribution to Europe\u2019s footprint in the international regulation of chemicals The European Union benefits from the most ambitious chemicals legislation in the world. ECHA contributes to increasing Europe\u2019s footprint worldwide by sharing information and experience with the increasing number of countries adopting similar legislation. It collaborates with industry and public authorities which are developing high standards akin to the European ones, especially in Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States. ECHA also promotes EU standards in the international trade of hazardous chemicals by regulating their export by European companies to non-EU countries, submitting them to notification and consent requirements. It shares knowledge on how to best ensure the safe storing, transport, use and disposal in developing countries. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies ECHA cooperates closely with EFSA through information exchange and cooperation on substances raising food safety concerns and with EMA so as to exchange the agencies\u2019 scientific expertise without duplicating activities. ECHA also collaborates with EU-OSHA on the safe use of chemical substances by workers. Easier access to information on 120,000 chemicals ECHA maintains the world\u2019s largest regulatory database on chemicals. ECHA is making this information more accessible to the general public by using info cards. The infocards give a summary of the key information on a chemical substance in plain English. Users can read about the chemicals they are exposed to, where they are commonly used, whether they are hazardous and the precautions that they might need to take.

Contribution to strengthening the EU\u2019s position as a global actor in the world As a Council Agency, EDA contributes to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and in particular to the CSDP through different types of actions and programmes in diverse domains in which Member States decide to participate or not depending on their national priorities. The Agency works in the fields of capability development, research and technology, armament cooperation and related industrial matters. Capability development and armament cooperation EDA works on improving military capabilities between Member States through cooperation in order to cope with the lack of European capabilities, interoperability and cooperation to make the EU a credible security provider that can defend its interests. EDA also supports Member States in the joint procurement of military assets to decrease costs and increase interoperability and harmonisation of their operational needs. Among its portfolio of projects, the EDA is working on four priority programmes for capability development welcomed by the European Council in 2013: \u2022 Air-to-air refuelling: the main purpose of this programme is to facilitate and support the pooled acquisition of tanker aircraft for European air forces that will enable sustained air combat operations (the EU is nowadays very dependent on American capabilities). \u2022 Remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS): RPAS have both civil and military applications (e.g. infrastructure surveillance, firefighting, disaster or environmental monitoring, border control, etc.). The objective of this programme is to have a common approach to technical, regulatory and operational aspects of RPAS and to integrate military drones in European skies. \u2022 Cyberdefence: military operations on sea, air, land and in space are more and more dependent on cyberspace. The objective is to promote cyber awareness and to encourage cooperation to develop cyberdefence along common standards. \u2022 Governmental Satellite Communications are important for both civil and military operations and missions (e.g. diplomatic communication, humanitarian and emergency response, security).

        "\u201cA sustainable, innovative and competitive European defence industry is essential for Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy and for a credible CSDP. It can also stimulate growth and jobs. A solid European defence, technological and industrial base needs a fair, functioning and transparent internal market, security of supply, and a structured dialogue with defence relevant industries. Furthermore, ensuring participation of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the defence sector can improve innovation and investment in the military technologies of tomorrow.\u201d 99 Global Strategy for the EU\u2019s Foreign and Security Policy, June 2016 Furthermore, EDA also works on other programmes where it seeks to enhance cooperation between European Member States, such as countering improvised explosive devices, harmonisation of ammunition qualification, training and exercises, and support to operations. Contribution to innovation and to more competitiveness in the internal market. Research & Technology and industrial matters EDA stimulates greater innovation in European defence industry, which has been under severe financial strain in recent years. It promotes dual use (i.e. civil and military) research and technologies in the field of security and defence. EDA manages many research programmes and projects, enabling cooperation and synergies for Member States. In particular, the Agency implements the Pilot Project for defence research on behalf of the European Commission and supports the Commission and Member States in setting up the Preparatory Action on defence research by 2017. Moreover, EDA reinforces the European defence technological and industrial base. For example, it supports SMEs to gain access to European Structural and Investment Funds. Contribution to a cleaner and more efficient energy EDA launched a cross-cutting energy and environment programme that spans capability, armaments and research and technology aspects. It focuses among others on energy efficiency, sustainable energy and alternative energy sources. It tackles for example the issue of reduction of fuel and energy consumption by deployed forces, and works toward the development of alternative energy facilities at military sites. It also aims at assessing the impact of new technologies and future energy policies on defence capability in order to design strategies in consequence. Together with the European Commission, it also organises a Consultation Forum on sustainable energy in the defence and security sector. Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research The EDA is involved in preparations for the launch of the Commission\u2019s so-called \u2018Preparatory Action\u2019 (PA) on defence research in 2017. Whereas today\u2019s EU multiannual research programme (Horizon 2020) is exclusively dedicated to civilian-focused research, the PA is meant to test defence research implementation and funding within an EU framework with the aim of having it fully integrated in the European Union\u2019s next multiannual framework (2021-2027). In the run-up to the PA, the EDA is currently managing and implementing (on behalf of the Commission) a Pilot Project for defence research which was launched in March 2016 (call for proposals) and through which grant agreements worth almost \u20ac1.4 million are awarded for two defence technological projects and one R&D project. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies SatCen: EDA has been cooperating with SatCen since its inception on several important projects necessitating geospatial information for defence purposes. They also contribute together to the Space Situational Awareness programme and other projects or studies related to maritime surveillance, Big Data exploitation in the space and security domain, cyberdefence, etc. In July 2016, that cooperation was formalized and further strengthened through an exchange of letter between the two agencies. Frontex: EDA is involved in the implementation of the EU Maritime Security Strategy, for example in connecting national maritime surveillance information systems. Such projects have both military and civil applications. EASA: EDA cooperates closely with EASA in its efforts towards the harmonisation of certification procedures for military aviation safety (Military Airworthiness regulations), that are nowadays national. ESA: EDA collaborates with the European Space Agency (ESA) in a wide range of activities related to space-based assets: satellite communication, earth observation, RPAS command and control, as well as protection of space and ground infrastructure. SESAR JU: EDA plays an important role in facilitating coordination between Member States and international organisations (such as Eurocontrol and NATO) with the SESAR Joint Undertaking in order to integrate the military dimension into the management of sky air traffic. ECHA: EDA is working with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and Member States in establishingharmonised standards for mitigating the impact of REACH 100 by introducing exemptions where necessary in the interests of defence.

        "The Agency contributes to achieving the EU\u2019s emissions reduction and biodiversity targets in order to move towards a low carbon, resource efficient and climate resilient economy by 2050. It is particularly useful for providing information on how to enhance emission reductions across sectors such as energy and transport and promote the development of renewable energy in the Union\u2019s energy mix. The EEA contributes to building a resilient Energy Union with assessments on greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment EEA acts at the interface between science and policy: it provides policy-makers with knowledge based on the latest environmental information for them to best shape and implement policies geared towards sustainable development. Using research and innovation to lay the grounds for Europe\u2019s transition towards its long-term sustainability objectives is paramount to the Smart Growth branch of the Europe 2020 Strategy. Measures analysed by EEA have a direct impact on sustainable development, in particular those aiming at the implementation of the circular economy, resource efficiency and waste management and prevention. These contributions also lay the basis for the Resource Efficient Europe and Innovation Union priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy. Further exploiting the potential of green energy is key to enhancing the EU economy\u2019s competitiveness by providing secure, affordable and sustainable energy to citizens and companies. Making economic development less dependent on non-renewable energy and resources also reinforces the economy\u2019s resilience to risks. Contribution to the European footprint\u2019s on sustainable development worldwide The Union is the world\u2019s leading actor in the fight against climate change. Based on EEA monitoring, expertise and information, the Union takes major steps to achieve the objective of limiting the temperature increase. The Agency also exchanges knowledge with international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Energy Agency, the United Nations. The Agency supports EU engagement in international fora with the information necessary to push for sustainable environmental policy developments, such as at the COP21 conference on climate change. Finally, it contributes to expertise and capacity- building in the European neighbourhood. Contribution to a Union of Democratic Change Communicating to citizens about the state and outlook of their environment helps raising awareness about threats and best ways to overcome them. By publishing data and assessments, EEA contributes to policy-makers\u2019 transparency efforts and is committed to informing citizens, thereby thriving for a Union of Democratic Change. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies EEA works on environmental issues with ECDC and ECHA.

Background The CFP aims at regulating fishing so as to protect marine biological resources and to create a level playing field for all actors of the fishing industry. The conservation of marine biological resources under the CFP is an exclusive competence of the Union under the Lisbon Treaty 106 . The CFP foresees the environmentally sustainable management of fisheries by ensuring the traceability, security and quality of products sold in the internal market. It also contributes to the social sustainability of fishing and aquaculture in Europe by establishing fair living standards in the fisheries sector, stable markets and ensuring the availability of food supply at reasonable prices 107 . Contribution to a deeper and fairer Internal market EFCA contributes to the efficient implementation of conservation and management measures within this framework by coordinating fisheries control activities at national level and by supporting the Commission and Member States the monitoring, control and surveillance of fisheries in line with the CFP guidelines. In practice, the agency helps Member States comply with existing measures by coordinating and enhancing control and inspection. It also provides trainings and maintains data and systems on fisheries. Its activities encompasses in particular on compliance with the \u201clanding obligation\u201d laid down in the CFP, which entails landing all catches of species subject to catch limits and minimum sizes made in EU waters or by Union fishing vessels. This requirement is meant to reduce the levels of unwanted catches and discards, which threaten both marine ecosystems and the financial viability of fisheries 108 . EFCA contributes to creating a level playing field in which all fishers can live from their activity, which stimulates the competitiveness and Smart Growth within the internal market. EFCA also participates in the protection of the marine environment and the sustainable management of commercially exploited fish species. It thus promotes Sustainable Growth in Europe.

It assists the Union with carrying out its international obligations relating to control and inspection by assisting the Union and Member States in their relations with third countries and international fisheries organisations. It also cooperates with the competent authorities of third countries in monitoring and compliance with international fishing rules. By doing so, it ensures the EU\u2019s presence in the international fisheries arena, thereby pushing for the adoption of Europe\u2019s high standards at the international level. In particular, EFCA assists the Member States and the European Commission in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which is key in the protection of global marine resources in a sustainable perspective, in line with EU long-term objectives of environmental preservation. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies EFCA collaborates with Frontex and EMSA on the establishment of a European Border and Coast Guard capacity. This structure was introduced in December 2015 to better protect the EU\u2019s external borders by joining management efforts at EU level. In practice, the three agencies regularly exchange information regarding operational activities, share best practices and technological developments in the field of maritime surveillance.

        "EFSA European Food Safety Authority EFSA contributes to ensuring the safety of food and feed products sold in the internal market, by assessing risks and delivering opinions based on scientific data. By informing decision-makers and consumers, EFSA helps protect the health of EU citizens, while reinforcing the functioning of the internal market and supporting EU industry in the remit of its activities. Through its cooperation with health and food safety organisations world-wide, the Agency also contributes to the advancement of science and knowledge on food safety issues. EFSA therefore promotes Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth in Europe through increased consumer health protection. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2002 \u2022 Location: Parma, Italy \u2022 Staff: 447 FTEs (AWP 2016) EFSA\u2019s mission is to \u201cprovide scientific advice and scientific and technical support for the Community\u2019s legislation and policies in all fields which have a direct or indirect impact on food and feed safety. It shall provide independent information on all matters within these fields and communicate on risks\u201d. 110 Background EFSA was set up following a series of food crises in the late 1990s to be a source of scientific advice and communication on risks associated with the food chain. Since it was set up, EFSA has delivered scientific advice on a wide range of issues such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), Salmonella, food additives such as aspartame, allergenic food ingredients, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), pesticides, and animal health issues such as avian influenza. EFSA is committed to safeguarding the independence of its experts, methods and data from any undue external influence and to communicating openly and transparently about its work. Contribution to a deeper and fairer internal market EFSA empowers European consumers by providing information on food and feed safety, animal health and welfare, nutrition, plant protection and health, which allows them to make informed consumption choices, in line with the requirements of the EU Food Law 111 . The agency therefore contributes to the well-being of citizens, a fundamental EU objective 112 . \u201cThe advice that EFSA provides to risk managers underpins the laws and regulations of the EU, as well as evolving policy priorities and needs, to protect European consumers from food- related risks \u2013 from field and factory to fork.\u201d 113 EFSA collects and analyses data and scientific literature to assess risks related to food and feed safety.

        "decision-making by risk managers at EU and Member States level. EFSA communicates with the public on risks to food and feed safety in order to further improve consumer protection through better understanding and awareness-raising. EFSA\u2019s actions create the conditions to guarantee that food placed on the European market is safe and provides independent advice on contentious issues such as GMOs, pesticides, additives and contaminants. This enables the adoption of common standards and measures at EU level, which is a necessary condition to ensure the free movement of food and feed across Member States. Preventing fragmentation reinforces the EU internal market, which is paramount to sustainability and growth. Moreover, EFSA supports the EU industry in the remit of it activities by improving upon competitiveness and promoting new employment opportunities. It does so both directly, e.g. by safeguarding public health, and indirectly, e.g. by strengthening consumer confidence in the food safety system. Contribution to the European footprint on worldwide food safety standards Thanks to EFSA\u2019s work, the EU enjoys some of the highest food safety standards in the world. This means that products shall not be sold on the internal market until it has been proven that they do not present risks for human and animal health. The Union is also one of the major global food and feed traders. EFSA works together and exchanges knowledge with food safety experts in the EU and globally to ensure excellence and efficiency and to maximise the available risk assessment capacity and potential. EFSA believes that the totality of food safety expertise in Europe and internationally is greater than the sum of its individual parts. EFSA\u2019s scientific support extends to EFTA and EU accession countries which have to directly transpose and implement EU food safety regulations to have access to the EU common market. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies EFSA collaborates closely with ECDC, ECHA, EMA and EEA in order to harmonise and rationalise risk assessment at EU level. EFSA also works closely with EU Member States, European Neighbourhood countries and international food safety actors on streamlining methodologies, prioritising research needs and avoiding duplication of work. It cooperates with all stakeholders involved in food and feed safety, from consumers groups to academia, from farmers and distributors to international organisations and third countries.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that of the 100 crop species that provide 90% of food worldwide, 71 are pollinated by bees. Amid growing concern over declining honeybee numbers, EFSA was asked by the European Commission to assess the specific risks to bees posed by neonicotinoids, a group of widely used systemic pesticides. EFSA performed risk assessments on three substances \u00ac\u2013 clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam \u2013 and concluded that all three posed acute or chronic risks to bees. As a result of EFSA\u2019s conclusions, in 2013 the European Commission imposed restrictions on their use across the European Union. EFSA is also leading a major long-term project to assess the way that other \u00abstressors \u00bb \u00ac\u2013 such as parasites, pathogens and malnutrition \u2013 interact with pesticides to affect bees. 114 ",

Contribution to the area of Justice and Fundamental Rights EIGE works on the area of freedom, security and justice and contributes to as well as promotes gender equality and gender mainstreaming (i.e. incorporation of gender considerations in all policy-making processes) in all EU policies and subsequent Member States\u2019 policies. Moreover, it supports the EU Institutions, especially the European Commission, as well as Member States in raising citizens\u2019 awareness on gender equality issues. \u201cEIGE has an important mission to fulfil, and even more so today with the current challenges facing Europe. From the impacts of the financial crisis to increasing migration challenges, internal security concerns and rising intolerance and discrimination, it is more important than ever that the response to these challenges takes into consideration a gendered approach.\u201d 115 Virginija Langbakk, EIGE Director To carry out its mission, EIGE collects analyses and disseminates objective, reliable and comparable information and data to support policy-makers and other stakeholders in the decision-making process in order to achieve gender equality.

        "the fight against poverty. The contribution of gender equality to improve those different aspects is intertwined. Although European women are on average better educated than men, they comparatively occupy less influential or power positions in politics or in the economy. The utilisation of women\u2019s talents and their contribution to the political and economic life or to any other decision-making area are therefore of paramount importance for Europe to remain competitive and for European economic well-being. Women\u2019s engagement in the economy is also crucial to meet Europe 2020 Strategy\u2019s employment goals, hence bringing economic growth. Moreover, increasing women\u2019s economic independence will also contribute to reducing poverty. EIGE furthermore focuses on other related topics such as the eradication of violence against women. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies EIGE is part of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies\u2019 network, and collaborates in particular with FRA regarding the topics of violence against women, migrant and Roma populations for the Gender Equality Index. It also cooperates with other EU agencies, such as: \u2022 Eurofound in the domain of the Gender Equality Index; \u2022 EU-OSHA in order to fill the information or data gaps relative to gender risks in occupational safety and health. EIGE also works together with the EU Institutions and other EU bodies such as the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and Eurostat. EIGE collaborates with national equality bodies and international organisations such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, UN Women and OECD to avoid overlaps and foster synergies where appropriate. Gender Equality Index EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index measures gender gaps in and across all 28 EU Member States. It was launched in 2013 and two years later, was further revised to include a time series that measured progress in gender equality in the EU from 2005 to 2012. This unique measurement tool supports evidence-based policy- making and indicates where political priorities should be shifted to accelerate the process of achieving a gender-equal Europe and the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, such as the target employment rate of 75% overall for women and men. The Index has become increasingly significant in the past years as some Member States have adopted it as their standard monitoring tool within their national or regional statistical systems (e.g. Ireland, Estonia, Luxembourg and the Basque Region). EIGE\u2019s Gender Statistics Database which contains the data used to calculate the Index is a useful tool that can help with monitoring the progress of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The database contains a specific entry point for the Strategy and lists the different indicators that measure the targets, such as the tertiary education rate, broken down by sex and age group (30 -34).

EIOPA European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority EIOPA contributes to Sustainable Growth through its actions towards an efficient functioning of the Single Market, by enhancing supervisory convergence, reinforcing preventive consumer protection as well as by preserving financial stability. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2011 \u2022 Location: Frankfurt, Germany \u2022 Staff: 151 FTEs (AWP 2016) EIOPA aims at \u201cstrengthening European supervisory arrangements with a view to better protect policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries and to rebuilt trust in the financial system\u201d 117 . Background EIOPA was established in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis of 2007- 2008, which revealed shortcomings in the supervision of financial services institutions due to a lack of cooperation, coordination and trust between the national supervisors, as well as an inconsistent application of EU law across Member States. The severe strain on the stability of the financial system caused by the crisis also put at risk the functioning of the internal market. Restoring and maintaining a stable and reliable financial system is therefore a necessary condition to rebuild and preserve trust in the internal market, and hence foster economic growth. Contribution to an efficient functioning of the internal market EIOPA\u2019s core responsibilities are to enhance the financial system stability, to ensure the transparency of markets and financial products and protect consumers, i.e. policyholders and pension scheme members and beneficiaries. In order to achieve those objectives and contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market, EIOPA defined in Single Programming Document 2017-2019 four strategic objectives: 1. Strengthening the protection of consumers. EIOPA strives to ensure transparency, simplicity, accessibility and fairness across the internal market for consumers in order to restore the lost confidence. EIOPA carries out regulatory and supervisory activities in order to make sure that insurance companies provide consumers with quality products and services and with all the information they need and can understand in order to make informed decisions. 2. Improving the functioning of the EU internal market in the field of pensions and insurance. This objective entails similar high standards of consumer protection and supervision of the insurance providers and a consistent application of the regulation. EIOPA contributes to the development of a sound and prudent regulatory framework and to its implementation across the EU, with the purpose of achieving a common supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices. Through for example the provision of trainings, participation in colleges and forums, the delivery of peer reviews and bilateral visits and engagement with National Competent Authorities, EIOPA promotes convergence in the application of high quality supervision within Europe.

        "3. Strengthening the financial stability of the insurance and occupational pensions sectors. EIOPA continually monitors and assesses trends, potential risks and vulnerabilities in order to safeguard the stability of the financial system. The anticipation of risks and their pro-active mitigation is crucial to facilitate and coordinate preventive supervisory actions and further enhance consumer protection. \u201cWe will continue to build a truly European supervisory culture that thanks to its risk-based forward-looking approach promotes financial stability, mitigates possible disruptions in the market and ensures the similar level of protection for insurance policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries as well as other consumers of financial products.\u201d 118 Gabriel Bernardino, EIOPA Chair 4. Acting as a responsible, competent and professional organisation. Following the development of Solvency II regulation, EIOPA is currently shifting from an organisation primarily providing regulatory services, to an organisation supporting quality supervision and convergence within the EU. This requires strong, efficient and effective internal processes. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies EIOPA operates within the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) that has the purpose of ensuring consistent and coherent micro- and macro-prudential financial supervision 119 in the EU. Micro- prudential supervision is carried out by the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) \u2013 i.e. the EIOPA, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) \u2013 , the Joint Committee of the ESAs and the National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Macro-prudential oversight is conducted at the EU level by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) which comprises the European Central Bank (ECB), the national central banks, the ESAs and the European Commission. The ESFS works towards an efficient functioning of the single market thanks to a regulatory and supervisory framework that is applied equally across Europe. While the day-to-day supervision of the financial institutions mainly remains at national level, the three ESAs bring EU-wide uniform rules and harmonise supervisory approaches across the EU. The ESFS also cooperates with other supervisory authorities such as the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) towards the completion of a Banking Union.

On 1 January 2016 Solvency II was implemented in all European Union countries. This is a huge step forward for policyholder protection and the insurance single market in the European Union. For EIOPA as well as for the insurance market this day marked the beginning of a new journey, with the start of ensuring consistent and convergent supervision across the European Union . With the momentum of this important milestone, EIOPA\u2019s main strategic focus shifted from regulation to building a common European supervisory culture. The advice to the European Commission on the development of a simple, standardised and fully transparent Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP) is an important step forward in contributing to the implementation of the European Union Capital Markets Union. Furthermore, EIOPA continues to place the protection of consumers and beneficiaries at its heart by further enhancing and implementing a preventive, risk- based conduct of supervision. 118. EIOPA Annual Report 2015, p. 7. 119. The micro-prudential supervision is the supervision of individual institutions, while the macro-prudential supervision focuses on system-wide risks to financial stability. 118 ",

It thus stimulates climate change entrepreneurship among students and professionals through education activities that seek to foster the development of innovation conducive to sustainable development. The EIT also participates in the effort to develop sustainable energy through EIT InnoEnergy. This partnership aims to facilitate the development of climate- related start-ups. The KIC\u2019s strategy to achieve sustainability entails reducing the cost of energy in the value chain, increasing energy security and reducing CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. This benefits citizens directly by encouraging the supply of cheap, secure and sustainable energy. The work of this KIC is complementary to that of EIT Raw Materials, which aims to develop a cost-efficient, secure, sustainable supply and use of raw materials. Contribution to a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base By enabling turning ideas into new products and services which meet the demands of consumers, the EIT feeds the dynamism of the EU internal market.

Since its establishment in 1995 EMA has recommended approximately 1000 medicines to the European Commission for a marketing authorisation for all EU Member States. Many of these medicines are innovative medicines, including biotechnology products and cell- and gene therapy products. EMA is responsible for the centralised evaluation procedure which allows the marketing of a medicine on the basis of a single marketing authorisation which is valid throughout the Union. Pharmaceutical companies submit a single authorisation application to EMA. The Agency then carries out a scientific assessment of the application and gives a recommendation to the European Commission on whether or not to grant a marketing authorisation. Once granted by the European Commission, the centralised marketing authorisation is valid in all Member States and EEA countries. The use of the centralised procedure is compulsory for most innovative medicines, including medicines for rare diseases. The safety of all medicines that are available on the European market is carefully monitored throughout their entire life span. EMA coordinates the EU system of safety monitoring, which connects all Member States, the European Commission and EMA in a close network. If there is a safety issue with a medicine that is authorised in more than one Member State, the same regulatory action is taken across the Union and patients and healthcare professionals in all Member States are provided with the same guidance. This allows EU patients to benefit from scientific developments while the risks of harm inherent in any medicine are minimised and managed. EMA has been a trailblazer for transparency in public health and pharmaceutical research. The Agency publishes its assessment report and has also started to publish the clinical data on which its recommendations for marketing authorisations for medicines for human use are based on.

EMA has signed cooperation agreements with regulatory authorities (United States, Japan, Australia, Canada, Switzerland) and promotes EU standards across the world. International collaboration in the evaluation and monitoring of medicines is of utmost importance in view of globalised supply chains and the generation of clinical data outside Europe. Information sharing and collaboration allow efficiency gains and also contribute to the convergence of global medicines regulatory standards, in line with safety standards for European consumers. In addition, EMA offers support such as training and capacity building to countries with less developed regulatory infrastructures, thus acting as a reference authority for medicines worldwide. Cooperation with other EU agencies and bodies Aside from its cooperation with national regulatory authorities within the European medicines regulatory network, EMA collaborates closely with its partner EU agencies in related fields. \u2022 Collaboration with ECDC encompasses information and monitoring of vaccines, anti-microbial resistance and antiviral medicines; \u2022 EMA exchanges information and works on risk communication with EFSA e.g. on the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals; \u2022 Collaboration with ECH A entails information exchange on the evaluation and risk management of chemicals, especially for the establishment of residue limits for biocides; \u2022 EMA and the EMCDDA collaborate in the fields of psychoactive substances and abuse of medicines; \u2022 EMA also collaborates with the EEA on issues of common interest. Bringing significant benefits to patients \u2022 In 2015, EMA recommended 93 medicines for marketing authorisation, which include 39 new active substances. These are substances that have previously never been authorised in a medicine in the European Union. \u2022 Man y of these medicines represent therapeutic innovations that can make a real difference to patients suffering from serious conditions such as cancer, diabetes and neurological diseases. \u2022 Most of the noteworthy therapeutic innovations in 2015 took place in the area of cancer. Newly approved cancer therapies deactivate \u2018suppressive signals\u2019 to kill cancer cells, use monoclonal antibodies to direct the immune system towards cancer cells, modulate the activity of genes to treat multiple myeloma or use a genetically engineered virus to kill cancer cells.

Contribution to a safer and healthier internal market EMCDDA has the vision to contribute to a safer and healthier Europe by working as a European hub for drug-related information. In this respect, EMCDDA provides the EU and Member States with independent evidence- based information that enables decision and policy makers to better understand drug issues and take appropriate action. EMCDDDA\u2019s objective, factual, reliable and comparable data also help other stakeholders, such as professionals and practitioners, have an overview of the situation and tackle new areas of research. In order to fulfil its mission, EMCDDA works in three action areas. 1. Communicating evidence and knowledge exchange The main customers of EMCDDA\u2019s information and data are the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, the European Commission, the European External Action Service, the Member States, other EU agencies and international bodies and organisations. EMCDDA collects data and analyses it in order to disseminate it to its customers which allows them to address the drug phenomenon in an appropriate way. EMCDDA carries out strategic and situational analyses and assesses trends, developments and threats of the drug use in Europe. It produces different types of reports on the drug situation: \u2022 The annual European Drug Report (EDR) includes information on trends and developments, statistics, overviews per country and specific analyses. \u2022 The EU Drug Markets Report (EMDR), published every three years and elaborated together with Europol, tackles strategic and operational aspects of trends and developments of the drug phenomenon. This report is published every three years. \u2022 The European Drug Responses Report (EDRR), also published every three years, focuses on the drug responses in the EU and their effectiveness and formulates recommendations for improvement. The first edition will be published in 2017. Next to these main reports, EMCDDA also produces more focused analyses on e.g. a specific emerging topic or a geographical region. Moreover, EMCDDA also contributes to the exchange of knowledge and best practices, for example through trainings.

        "EMCDDA manages the European information network on drugs and drug addiction (Reitox), which is also its main data source. Built as a network of 30 National Focus Points (i.e. all EU countries, Norway and Turkey), Reitox allows EMCDDA to gather information on drugs and drug addiction, regulations and policies in force and responses, but also to broaden the exchange of knowledge through different sectors such as health, justice and law enforcement. 2. Early warning and threat assessment Another action area is the risk and trend monitoring and threat assessment of new psychoactive substances (NPS). Over the last years, the NPS have increased in terms of availability, sorts and number. Those substances result in severe harms and damages and even in death. In this respect, EMCDDA focuses on pro-active data gathering by improving the Early Warning System (EWS), hence enabling early identification of emerging trends, developments and risks and allowing an early response to it. EMCDDA implements the system together with Europol, and with the active contribution of EMA and the European Commission. The EWS includes the monitoring of serious adverse events in the framework of toxicovigilance and new policies, legislation and health and social responses to NPS. It is a key element to enable the exchange of forensic and toxicological analytical data, quick notifications and public health alerts on NPS, as well as risks and illicit markets monitoring and analysis. Moreover, together with its partners (Europol, ECDC and EMA), EMCDDA also detects and monitors emerging and new trends and threats in drug use and drug markets using other different risk and information assessment tools. 3. Situation, responses and trend analysis EMCDDA\u2019s monitoring activities focuses on the drug situation and the responses that are developed to address it, both as far as the demand for and the supply of drugs are concerned. In the area of drug demand, EMCDDA performs monitoring using well-established key epidemiological indicators covering aspects such as the patterns of drug use, the number and profile of drug users requesting treatment, the number of deaths or infectious diseases due to drug use, etc. EMCDDA also covers the issue of misuse of medicines. In addition, EMCDDA performs work on the response side to drug use in order to get a better picture of treatment services in the EU, national estimates on treatment needs and gaps between treatment systems in EU. As far as drugs supply is concerned EMCDDA performs data review on drug seizures, market size and drug-related crimes. It reports on drug prices, purity and contents. Another point of interest is the production facilities\u2019 sites, on which information is collected by Europol. Contribution to an area of justice and fundamental rights Through its work, EMCDDA plays an important role in justice and law enforcement for drug-related issues. In collaboration with CEPOL, Europol and Eurojust, it contributes to the fight against cross-border crimes such as drug trafficking. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies EMCDDA is part of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies\u2019 network and from among its members, it mainly collaborates with CEPOL, Eurojust and Europol , with the purpose of creating a safer Europe. For example, it cooperates with CEPOL on training matters; with Europol on emerging trend analyses and on the EU Drug Markets Report; and with Eurojust on drug trafficking cases. EMCDDA works towards improving health in Europe and collaborates in this respect with ECDC on drug-related infectious diseases evolution and epidemiology, and with EMA regarding pharmacovigilance and misuse of medicines. EMCDDA also works with international partners such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Cooperation between EMCDDA and Europol The EMCDDA and Europol implement the EU Early Warning System (EWS) on new psychoactive substances (NPS) since 1997, when it was established. Under the provisions of the Council Decision 2005/387/ JHA on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances, the EU EWS was strengthened and both agencies, in collaboration with their respective networks, play a central role in detecting NPS, assessing their characteristics and paving the way for eventual control measures. They also work closely together to actively monitor drug markets in Europe, to identify emerging threats and perform strategic analysis. Numerous joint reports are produced under the Council Decision and in addition, two editions of the EU Drug Markets report have been produced in 2013 and 2016. Thanks to a combination of EMCDDA\u2019s drug monitoring and analytical capacity and Europol\u2019s operational intelligence on organised crime, this report provides and analysis of illicit drug market trends, covering all aspects from production to trafficking, distribution and consumption. Illicit drugs remain one of the key threats to the EU\u2019s security and to the safety of its citizens. The latest report analysed the cost for society and its numerous impacts on e.g. the economy, individuals and the environment, as well as its link with other types of criminality and terrorism.

The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2002 \u2022 Location: Lisbon, Portugal \u2022 Staff: 253 FTEs (AWP 2016) EMSA\u2019s mission is to \u201censure a high, uniform, and effective level of maritime safety, maritime security, prevention of, and response to, pollution caused by ships as well as response to marine pollution caused by oil and gas installations\u201d 126 . Background The idea of the creation of a regulatory agency active in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution from ships dates back to the late 1990s. EMSA was finally created in 2002 and its mandate has progressively been enlarged to encompass measures such as the efficiency of maritime transport and quality shipping. EMSA\u2019s work currently articulates around four activity domains that contribute to a safer, more efficient and greener Single Market. Contribution to a safe and efficient Internal Market and EU\u2019s footprint in the world 1. Maritime transport and surveillance \u2013 Information on ships, cargoes and ship movements EMSA acts as a major provider of information to EU maritime stakeholders and, where appropriate, other communities. The Agency has developed and maintains different platforms and information systems for data exchange, e.g. SafeSeaNet, Long Range identification and Tracking (LRIT) and THETIS, which can be used by the Member States\u2019 maritime authorities to monitor maritime traffic and pollution and ensure enforcement of relevant EU legislation. EMSA uses satellite images, provided by the European Space Agency and other satellite operators, to assist Member States with maritime surveillance and pollution detection. EMSA also contributes to optimising the functioning of the Internal Market by supporting the creation of a European maritime transport space without barriers and by enhancing maritime transport logistics. In this respect, EMSA seeks to harmonise and rationalise ship reporting EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET EUROPE IN THE WORLD LEVEL OF EU ACTION EMSA EMSA\u2019s Strategic Objectives EMSA\u2019s Strategic Activities JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES INTERNAL MARKET ENERGY UNION & CLIMATE CHANGE (cid:51)ro(cid:89)iding technical and scienti(cid:564)c assistance to the MS and the E(cid:38) in the (cid:83)ro(cid:83)er de(cid:89)elo(cid:83)(cid:80)ent and i(cid:80)(cid:83)le(cid:80)entation of E(cid:56) legislation on (cid:80)ariti(cid:80)e safety(cid:15) security(cid:15) (cid:83)re(cid:89)ention of (cid:83)ollution by shi(cid:83)s and (cid:80)ariti(cid:80)e trans(cid:83)ort ad(cid:80)inistrati(cid:89)e si(cid:80)(cid:83)li(cid:564)cation Monitoring the i(cid:80)(cid:83)le(cid:80)entation of E(cid:56) legislation through visits and inspections Mariti(cid:80)e trans(cid:83)ort and sur(cid:89)eillance (cid:514) (cid:918)nfor(cid:80)ation on shi(cid:83)s(cid:15) cargoes and ship movements Visits and inspections to (cid:80)onitor the i(cid:80)(cid:83)le(cid:80)entation of E(cid:56) legislation (cid:51)ollution (cid:83)re(cid:83)aredness detection and response (cid:51)ro(cid:89)iding MS and the E(cid:38) (cid:90)ith technical and scienti(cid:564)c assistance and facilitating technical coo(cid:83)eration bet(cid:90)een MS(cid:519) Mariti(cid:80)e (cid:36)uthorities and (cid:90)ith the E(cid:38) Improving coopera- tion with, and between Member States in all key areas (cid:51)ro(cid:89)iding o(cid:83)erational assistance(cid:15) including de(cid:89)elo(cid:83)ing(cid:15) (cid:80)anaging and maintaining maritime ser(cid:89)ices for shi(cid:83) (cid:80)onitoring (cid:38)arrying out o(cid:83)erational (cid:83)re(cid:83)aredness(cid:15) detection and response tasks with respect to (cid:83)ollution caused by shi(cid:83)s and (cid:80)arine (cid:83)ollution by oil and gas installations SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY 125 ",
        "documentation. It has developed the National Single Window, an electronic solution to simplify administrative procedures for ship operators, masters and agents to report ship data only once and make this information available to all relevant authorities. In addition, it provides relevant data to Member States and other EU stakeholders with maritime related tasks through a growing portfolio of Integrated Maritime Services and functionalities. Tailor- made maritime information and situational awareness is made available to support authorities with their respective activities in maritime safety, fisheries control, anti- piracy, border control and law enforcement. 2. Visits and inspections to monitor the implementation of EU legislation EMSA carries out visits and inspections related to maritime safety and pollution prevention in EU and EFTA Member States since its creation. These visits provide the European Commission and EFTA Surveillance Authority with information on the extent to which the EU legislation objectives are concretely implemented, and provide the visited Member States with an opportunity to give their point of view on the effectiveness of EU legislation. Furthermore, EMSA conducts inspections in third countries, related to the training of seafarers, and of Classification Societies recognised in the EU, thereby enhancing ship safety not only for EU registered vessels, but in EU waters in general. Based on the results of the visits and inspections conducted, EMSA carries out horizontal analyses and research on the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the provisions in force. 3. Providing Member States and the Commission with technical and scientific assistance and facilitating technical cooperation between Member States\u2019 Maritime Authorities and with the Commission EMSA assists the Commission and/or Member States with the implementation of various European directives. For example, regarding the directive related to accident investigation in the maritime transport sector, the Agency supports Member States by providing EMCIP, a platform to store accident investigation reports, thus gathering lessons learned and best practises, and through training with the objective of harmonising the way accidents are investigated within the EU. EMSA also provides harmonised training tools for Member States and technical advice to the Commission on port state control, ship safety, marine equipment, maritime security, standards for seafarers, classification societies. The portfolio of training and e-training tools is also available to neighbouring countries, extending the capacity building function to third-countries sharing an EU sea basin. THETIS: Supporting the collective effort to clear seas of substandard shipping To support Member States in ensuring the compliance of ships calling in their ports with EU and international legislation, EMSA set up THETIS. This database provided a targeting mechanism for the selection of ships for inspection, the recording and sharing of the inspection results, and a fair sharing of the burden between authorities. Given its success, the system was extended into THETIS-EU, a single platform to record and exchange information on compliance checks with the Sulphur Directive. This system facilitates Member States\u2019 legal obligations, guarantees a high level of uniformity in inspection and fuel sampling to the industry and ensures the collected information is shared throughout the Union. THETIS-EU will be adapted further to provide a more efficient way of identifying and selecting substandard shipping that could pose a threat to the marine environment and air quality. It is already being equipped with new modules to support the implementation of regulations so that its 900 users will be able to consult, record and exchange data on inspections, annual fuel consumption and verifications while targeting vessels requiring inspection. Contribution to an Energy Union and climate change 4. Pollution preparedness detection and response EMSA takes into account the environmental protection considerations when carrying out its aforementioned activities (i.e. maritime transport monitoring and visits and inspections). Moreover, EMSA provides guidance to Member States and seeks to create a European level playing field in the implementation of environmental legislation and standards. For example, EMSA contributes to the development of enforcement mechanisms for the uniform implementation of the directive aiming at reducing air pollution due to sulphur oxides. EMSA also supports the European Commission in the monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport. Moreover, EMSA works on other environmental aspects such as the port reception facilities required to treat the different types of waste a ship can produce. In addition, EMSA has developed an oil spill response capacity and can provide operational support to Member States in case of pollution in any of the seas surrounding the European Union. For this purpose, EMSA has developed a network of stand-by oil recovery vessels, specialised depots with dedicated pollution response equipment and dispersants. Accidental spills and deliberate discharges can be detected and monitored with the satellite- based detection and monitoring system called CleanSeaNet, available to all EU Member States. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies EMSA has cooperation agreements with i.a. Frontex, EFCA and EUNAVFOR Atalanta and Sophia. EMSA provides tailor-made maritime information and situational awareness to support their respective activities.

The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year : 2004 \u2022 Location: Heraklion & Athens, Greece \u2022 Staff: 84 FTEs (AWP 2016) ENISA\u2019s mission is to \u201ccontribute to securing Europe\u2019s information society by raising awareness of network and information security and to develop and promote a culture of network and information security in society for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector organisations in the Union\u201d 127 Background ENISA was set up in order to raise awareness on network and information security (NIS) challenges within the EU. To rely upon a constantly evolving digital environment for all economic and societal activities requires indeed proper practices, policies, organisations and capacities as far as NIS is concerned. ENISA contributes to this overarching objective, and thereby to a proper functioning of the internal market and ultimately economic growth. ENISA\u2019s activity areas are threefold: the Agency supports NIS policy making and implementation, it formulates recommendations to its stakeholders, and carries out operational work. Through those three activities, it also brings together the NIS community. ENISA works as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity in Europe and supports the EU Institutions, the Member States, the private sector and the citizens in achieving a high level of NIS, the importance of which has been highlighted in the recent EU political agenda \u2013 notably in the European Cybersecurity Strategy (2013), the European Cyberdefence Policy Framework (2014), the European Digital Single Market (2015) and the Network and Information Security directive (2016) 128 . Contribution to the proper functioning of the internal market and to the Digital Single Market ENISA is helping the Union and the Member States to improve their capacity to prevent, detect and deal with cybersecurity issues and incidents. Cybersecurity is essential for safeguarding trust in information systems and communication networks, and therefore for the smooth and efficient functioning of the internal market. A high level of network and information security is also a prerequisite of achieving a European Digital Single Market that has the potential to create EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET EUROPE IN THE WORLD LEVEL OF EU ACTION ENISA ENISA\u2019s Strategic Objectives ENISA\u2019s Strategic Activities (cid:38)loud (cid:9) Big Data (cid:38)yber Security Education & Exercises Data Protection JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES INTERNAL MARKET DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET JUSTICE AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS CSIRT es Incident Reporting (cid:49)ational (cid:38)yber Security Strategies Trainings (cid:55)rust Services E(cid:91)(cid:83)ertise (cid:514) (cid:36)ntici(cid:83)ate and su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort Euro(cid:83)e in facing e(cid:80)erging net(cid:90)ork and infor(cid:80)ation security challenges (cid:38)ritical (cid:918)nfra(cid:16) tructures (cid:9) Services CSIRT Network, Services and co(cid:80)(cid:80)unities (cid:38)yber (cid:38)risis Manage- ment IoT and Smart (cid:918)nfrastruc- tures Standards & certi(cid:564)cation Threat and Risk management (cid:51)olicy (cid:514) (cid:51)ro(cid:80)ote net(cid:90)ork and infor(cid:80)ation security as an E(cid:56) (cid:83)olicy (cid:83)riority (cid:38)a(cid:83)acity (cid:514) Su(cid:83)(cid:83)ort Euro(cid:83)e in (cid:80)aintaining state(cid:16)of(cid:16)the(cid:16)art net(cid:90)ork and infor(cid:80)ation security capacities (cid:38)o(cid:80)(cid:80)unity (cid:514) Foster the e(cid:80)erging Euro(cid:83)ean net(cid:90)ork and infor(cid:80)ation security co(cid:80)(cid:80)unity SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY 127 ",
        "hundreds of thousands of jobs and to foster economic growth. ENISA contributes to this by focusing on four strategic objectives: 1. Expertise \u2013 Anticipating and supporting Europe in facing emerging network and information security challenges ENISA collects, analyses and disseminates information on cyber issues taking into account the current and new technologies and their implementation, such as smart infrastructures (e.g. smart grids, cities, cars and airports), e-health, cloud and Big Data. This enables the Agency to have a view on the future risks and threats and to anticipate them \u2013 for example as far as infrastructures, businesses and citizens\u2019 private data are concerned. 2. Policy \u2013 Promoting network and information security as an EU policy priority ENISA plays an advisory role towards the EU Institutions and Member States regarding the development and implementation of EU laws. The Agency provides to the European Institutions advice, preparatory work or other analyses concerning existing or new NIS policies and laws (e.g. regulations regarding breach notification and incident reporting in the context of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP)). ENISA also strives to promote the NIS aspects in all policies covering (directly or indirectly) digital aspects or the Digital Single Market. Moreover, ENISA collaborates with the Member States and other public and private stakeholders in order to ensure the proper implementation of the NIS policies, according to an EU-wide approach. 3. Capacity \u2013 Supporting Europe in maintaining state-of-the-art network and information security capacities ENISA helps Member States, the private sector, EU Institutions and the citizens (through NIS promotion via different projects) enhance their cybersecurity knowledge, skills and competencies in order to make their networks more resilient and secure. The Agency plays a significant role in assisting member States in transposing the NIS Directive. In particular, as secretariat for the CSIRT network established under the Directive, ENISA actively promotes the exchange and implementation of existing good practices in addition to stimulating discussion on areas in which new challenges are arising. Last but not least, ENISA has been active in supporting capacity building through a training program that is specifically targeted to the needs of the CSIRT community. 4. Community \u2013 Fostering the emerging European network and information security community Simultaneously to its other objectives, ENISA seeks to promote cooperation at EU level regarding NIS-related topics. It fosters collaboration and dialogue between different stakeholders \u2013 such as Member States, law enforcement and data privacy communities, as well as the public and private sector in general. Pan European Exercises Cyber Europe exercises are simulations of large-scale cybersecurity incidents that escalate to EU-wide cyber crises. The exercises offer opportunities to analyse advanced cybersecurity incidents but also to deal with complex business continuity and crisis management situations. Cyber Europe exercises feature scenarios inspired by real-life events, developed by European cybersecurity experts. ENISA is currently organising Cyber Europe 2016, which is the 4th exercise in the Cyber Europe series. Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016) is the largest and most comprehensive EU cyber-security exercise to date. It is a multi-event cyber exercise that involves more than 500 cyber- security professionals from 30 EU and EFTA countries and over 300 organisations. The cybercrisis cooperation activities, which include the pan European exercise (see insert: \u2018success story\u2019), provides an excellent example of how ENISA fosters increased cooperation by working together closely with stakeholder communities to achieve common goals. Contribution to justice and fundamental rights Through its various aforementioned activities, ENISA also contributes to justice and citizens\u2019 fundamental rights. For example, through the organisation of the annual European Cybersecurity Month, the Agency reaches out to a large number of citizens in order to increase their knowledge and skills on how to protect their digital lives. Similarly, ENISA has delivered concrete advice on dealing with data protection and privacy issues and is co-organiser of the Annual Privacy Forum (APF). Cooperation with agencies and others stakeholders ENISA organises joint workshops, trainings and activities with Europol \u2019s Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in order to raise awareness on data protection and exchange knowledge, expertise and information with law enforcement communities. Moreover, Europol contributes with ENISA to the organisation of the European Cybersecurity Month. ENISA is also working together with CEPOL as far as cybersecurity trainings are concerned. Moreover, ENISA collaborates with EBA and the European Central Bank (ECB) regarding the adoption of secure cloud systems in the finance sector. It also work with the EDA, GSA and eu-LISA and other EU Institutions or bodies such as the European Parliament, the Internal Audit Service.

ERA\u2019s mission is to \u201cto contribute to the effective functioning of the SERA without frontiers, in particular by: 1) promoting a harmonised approach to railway safety, 2) devising the technical and legal framework in order to enable removing technical barriers, and acting as the System Authority for the Single European Train Control and Communication System, 3) improving accessibility and use of railway system information, and by 4) acting as the European Authority under the 4th Railway Package issuing vehicle authorisations and safety certificates, while improving the competitive position of the railway sector\u201d. 129 The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2004 \u2022 Location: Valenciennes, France \u2022 Staff: 169 FTEs (AWP 2016) Background ERA works in the framework of the European Commission\u2019s White Paper on transport, the overarching objective of which is to create the SERA. The final goal is to enhance, at EU level, the competitiveness of rail in order to boost the modal shift towards a more sustainable mode of transport, a more efficient spending of public money on rail, the opening of domestic rail passenger transport to competition, and the removal of technical and administrative barriers to encourage market entry. 1. A harmonised approach to safety In order to promote a safe use of rail as a transport mode, ERA facilitates the development of EU railway safety specifications and drives the change to a pro-active EU railway safety culture with common criteria, targets and methods. ERA pays particular attention to ensuring an enhanced safety performance monitoring and to the development of a shared understanding at EU level, based on the results of the Regulatory Monitoring Matrix. ERA will continue working with stakeholders to establish the risk acceptance criteria, in view of defining an acceptable level of risk for the technical systems. With the Fourth Railway Package in force, it will also act as the One Stop Shop (OSS) for issuing EU Single Safety Certificates. 2. Removing technical barriers In a system where responsibilities have been historically shared between railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and national governments, ERA acts as the authority for all EU railway technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) for EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET EUROPE IN THE WORLD LEVEL OF EU ACTION ERA ERA\u2019s Strategic Objectives ERA\u2019s Activities \u2013 (cid:36) (cid:43)ar(cid:80)oni(cid:93)ed Approach to Safety Removing (cid:55)echnical Barriers JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES INTERNAL MARKET ENERGY UNION & CLIMATE CHANGE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY Safety (cid:514) Euro(cid:83)e beco(cid:80)ing the (cid:90)orld leader in rail(cid:90)ay safety Competitiveness \u2013 (cid:83)ro(cid:80)oting rail transport to enhance its market share Ob(cid:77)ecti(cid:89)ity (cid:514) (cid:55)rans(cid:83)arency monitoring and e(cid:89)aluation (cid:36) Single E(cid:56) (cid:55)rain (cid:38)ontrol and (cid:38)o(cid:80)(cid:80)unication Syste(cid:80) (cid:36) Si(cid:80)(cid:83)li(cid:564)ed (cid:36)ccess for (cid:38)usto(cid:80)ers En(cid:89)iron(cid:80)ent and Society (cid:514) improve economic e(cid:605)ciency and societal bene(cid:564)ts in rail(cid:90)ay (cid:42)lobal Reference (cid:514) fostering ER(cid:36)(cid:519)s re(cid:83)utation in the (cid:90)orld Si(cid:80)(cid:83)li(cid:564)cation (cid:514) i(cid:80)(cid:83)ro(cid:89)ing the e(cid:605)ciency and coherence of the rail(cid:90)ay legal fra(cid:80)e(cid:90)ork E(cid:605)ciency (cid:514) optimising ERA ca(cid:83)abilities 129 ",
        "vehicles, infrastructure and operations, in cooperation with EU standardisation organisations. This includes the monitoring of those national rules which are redundant with the TSIs and the gradual process of their \u201ccleaning up\u201d, for the benefit of the final customers. In order to make the vehicle authorisation process more effective, ERA proposes a harmonised accreditation scheme for the notified bodies in charge with the technical checks. With the Fourth Railway Package in force, ERA will also act as the One Stop Shop for issuing EU vehicle authorisations. 3. A single EU train control and communication system (ERTMS) ERA acts as the de facto system authority for the harmonized ERTMS specifications and for their coherent implementation in the railway system. With the Fourth Railway Package in force, it will assume the system authority role formally, also with a specific role in the process leading to the authorisation of ERTMS implementation projects. Building on the successful delivery of the European Train Control System (ETCS) baseline 3, of the Global System for Mobile communications - Railways (GSM-R) specifications and of the harmonized Operational Rules, the focus is progressively moving to the follow-up of the development, testing and implementation, with dedicated attention to the return on experience, both in technical and operational aspects. ERA has been defining the roadmap enabling ETCS communications on IP based radio technologies and works on defining the new radio communication systems by 2018. 4. A simplified access for customers Easy access to rail services, as well as to the relevant rail data are crucial for the passenger and freight customers. The technical specifications for the telematics applications enable operators to permanently locate freight trains and exchange documents related to the carried goods and support the issuing of seamless tickets covering operators in several countries and the exchange of travel-related data. Society is also strongly demanding an improved access for persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility (PRMs) to the stations and trains across the EU. ERA is covering these aspects through a dedicated set of technical specifications (PRM TSI) and the associated inventory of accessibility characteristics for all the train stations across EU. Moreover, ERA develops and maintains different databases and registers that ensure transparency and equal access to documents for the railway stakeholders. For example, it enables them to check their vehicle status, the authorised types of vehicles, or verify the compatibility of their trains with the different routes. Contribution to an efficient Internal Market By removing the technical and operational barriers in the railway system, by fostering harmonisation and standardisation, as well as by providing more effective certification and authorisation processes, ERA is supporting the competitiveness of rail. Its position as regards internationalisation matters is also crucial for ensuring a competitive EU position in the global market. Contribution to Energy Union and climate change By improving rail competitiveness and interoperability, ERA seeks to foster a shift towards a more environmentally friendly and sustainable mode of transport. Moreover, as part of its regulatory work, ERA fosters harmonisation concerning notably energy efficiency and other environmental aspects, such as noise of rail wagons. Contribution to the Digital Single Market Though traditionally less prone to digitalisation, railways are now moving more and more in this direction. ERA promotes the enhanced use of digital technologies (ETCS, automated train operation), the enhanced use of IT tools for better services (OSS, vehicle registers, infrastructure register) as well as the migration towards online distribution of train tickets (with the support of the telematics applications) Collaboration with other agencies and bodies ERA provides support and gives advice to the S2R JU that aims at fostering innovation and research to create a Single European Railway Area and to improve the competitiveness and the attractiveness of the railway sector. It also cooperates with INEA Executive Agency in evaluating rail-related investment projects.

As part of the implementation of the Fourth Railway Package adopted in 2016, ERA is developing a One Stop Shop (OSS) functionality for all applications for vehicle authorisations, for single safety certificates and for the approval of technical solutions of ERTMS Trackside projects at EU level. For the applicants, OSS will be the single entry point where they will submit the application files as well as the source of information on the stages and the outcomes of their applications. In concrete terms, from June 2019, a manufacturer building a locomotive intended to run in more EU countries will have the possibility to request a single authorization instead of authorizing it in each of the concerned Member States. Likewise, a railway undertaking will have the possibility to request and receive a single safety certificate valid in more Member States. While keeping the good cooperation with the national safety authorities, ERA will use the OSS to facilitate the coordination and the exchange of information, as well as to ensure the coherence and transparency of the application processes and certification decisions. Ultimately, this will result in faster and easier processes and lower costs for the applicants, thus contributing to boosting the competitiveness of the railway sector and to achieving the Single European Railway Area. The functional and technical specifications for the OSS will be finalized beginning 201 7. Subject to their adoption by the ERA Management Board, they will be implemented for the first release of the OSS to be used in the shadow running phase from mid-2018. 130 ",

Through its actions towards building a Capital Markets Union, ESMA also contributes to the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union that will increase competitiveness in the euro area. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2011 \u2022 Location: Paris, France \u2022 Staff: 208 FTEs (AWP 2016) ESMA\u2019s mission statement is to \u201cenhance investor protection and promote stable and orderly financial markets\u201d 130 Background ESMA was created in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis of 2007- 2008, which revealed shortcomings in the supervision of financial services institutions due to a lack of cooperation, coordination and trust between the national supervisors, as well as an inconsistent application of EU law across Member States. The severe strain on the stability of the financial system caused by the crisis also put at risk the functioning of the internal market. Restoring and maintaining a stable and reliable financial system is therefore a necessary condition to rebuild and preserve trust in the internal market, and hence foster economic growth. The \u201cFive Presidents\u2019 Report\u201d 130 presents a two-stage roadmap towards the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in order to create a better and fairer life for citizens as well as increase competitiveness within the euro area. The first stage comprises among others the completion of the Financial Union, which encompasses the completion of the Banking Union and the creation of a Capital Markets Union (CMU). The CMU aims at further integrating financial markets. By enhancing the free movement of capital, one of the EU Single Market\u2019s core freedoms, it will not only deepen the internal market for financial services but also benefit the euro area. The CMU has the ambition of complementing traditional bank financing of the economy by better connecting capital to investment projects across Europe that need those funds to grow and create jobs. Deeper and more integrated capital markets will also reduce the cost of capital and increase the competitiveness. By reinforcing cross- border risk sharing, the CMU will improve the capability of the financial system to absorb shocks, hence making it more stable and resilient 132 . \u201cESMA\u2019s supervisory convergence work will be an important building block of the Capital Markets Union (CMU), as consistent application is needed to ensure that the single rulebook on paper becomes a single market in practice.\u201d 133 Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair Contribution to an efficient functioning of the internal market By realising its three intertwined strategic objectives \u2013 i.e. investor protection, orderly markets and financial stability \u2013, ESMA contributes to economic growth.

This activity supports the realisation of the three other activities and builds on, as well as complements, the analyses carried out by other stakeholders (see section on cooperation). Supervisory convergence The objective of promoting supervisory convergence is to guarantee a level playing field of high quality, effective and consistent regulation and supervision, preventing regulatory arbitrage and strengthening international supervisory coordination. This implies the sharing of best practices and efficiency gains for national authorities and the financial industry. Single rulebook The completion of a single rulebook for financial markets enhances Europe\u2019s internal market, creating a level playing field for investors across Europe. This consists of the development of regulatory technical standards and the provision of advice to the EU Institutions on a broad range of areas regarding the EU securities markets, their infrastructure and orderly functioning, as well as key financial market participants. Direct supervision ESMA is the direct supervisor of \u2022 Credit Rating Agencies (CRA), in order to ensure the quality of ratings and protect investors; \u2022 Trade Repositories (TR), to ensure data quality and improve transparency on EU derivatives markets. Contribution to a deeper Economic and Monetary Union that will reinforce competitiveness ESMA\u2019s objectives of enhancing investor protection and promoting stable and orderly financial markets are in line with the CMU\u2019s goals. ESMA encourages alternative financing sources, by working, amongst other initiatives, towards the strengthening and harmonisation of supervision, the increase of the efficiency of EU capital markets and their attractiveness for EU and non-EU investors. Through its four core activities, ESMA already plays an important role towards certain components of the CMU and will further contribute to it throughout its development 134 . Cooperation with other agencies and bodies ESMA operates within the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) that has the purpose of ensuring consistent and coherent micro- and macro-prudential financial supervision 135 in the EU. Micro- prudential supervision is carried out by the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) \u2013 i.e. ESMA, EBA and EIOPA \u2013, the Joint Committee of the ESAs and the National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Macro- prudential oversight is conducted at the EU level by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) which comprises the European Central Bank (ECB), the national central banks, the ESAs and the European Commission. The ESFS works towards an efficient functioning of the single market thanks to a regulatory and supervisory framework that is applied equally across Europe. While the day-to-day supervision of the financial institutions mainly remains at national level, the three ESAs bring EU-wide uniform rules and harmonise supervisory approaches across the EU. The ESFS also cooperates with other supervisory authorities such as the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).

In particular, preparatory work under the new Securitisation and Prospectus Regulations has been launched. The initiatives aim at amending the applicable regulatory framework in order to relaunch the securitisation market, by promoting simple, transparent and standardised securitisation as well as to deepen capital markets through eliminating some of the barriers for companies seeking non-bank funding. Next steps include ESMA\u2019s involvement in the revision of the regulatory framework applicable to managers of investment funds and venture capital which contributes to broadening the scope of potential investors in various EU projects as well as maintaining high- levels of investor protection. Furthermore, with an aim to integrate European capital markets more, ESMA has intensified its supervisory convergence activities as outlined in a dedicated work programme. This contributes to making application of EU legislation by national supervisory authorities more coherent, which in turn helps ensuring the level- playing-field in the financial sector as well as cross-border investments. In addition, it also helps to clarify through guidelines and other tools key issues related to implementation and compliance for market participants. 134.

        "ETF European Training Foundation The ETF contributes to developing partner countries\u2019 human capital in the Union neighbourhood, learning from EU internal and Member States\u2019 policies and experience. For that purpose, the Foundation focuses on modernising vocational education and training (VET) systems in a lifelong learning perspective in order to improve labour markets and economic and social cohesion. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 1994 \u2022 Location: Turin, Italy \u2022 Staff: 130 FTEs (AWP 2016) The ETF\u2019s mission is to \u201csupport its partner countries to harness the potential of their human capital through the reform of education, training and labour market systems in the context of the EU\u2019s external relations policies. It cooperates with partner countries engaged in the EU\u2019s enlargement and neighbourhood policies, as well as in Central Asia 136 .\u201d Background Many of the Union\u2019s Eastern and Southern neighbours are economically and politically unstable. Armed conflicts in these regions fuel increasing migration towards the Union. In this context, the EU enlargement and neighbourhood policies aim at extending peace and prosperity beyond the Union\u2019s borders 137 . Developing human capital in ETF\u2019s partner countries constitutes a significant wing of the Union\u2019s efforts at projecting its internal policies beyond its borders, which benefits both neighbours and EU citizens. These are fundamental objectives of the Union, as formulated in the Lisbon Treaty 138 . The ETF is active in fostering human capital development throughout the Union neighbourhood, which comprises South Eastern Europe and Turkey, Eastern Partnership countries and Russia, Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries and Central Asia. Its policy field of action covers primarily vocational education and training and skills development for competitiveness and territorial and social cohesion. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment and a connected Digital Single Market The ETF\u2019s contribution to the external dimension of the Commission\u2019s jobs, growth and investment policy priority centres on the concept of entrepreneurial continuum. It entails the development of effective policies on vocational education and training (VET) in neighbouring countries at all levels, from sustainable and well-governed institutions to citizens\u2019 participation and empowerment. The Foundation supports the Commission and partner countries in building and improving VET systems in order to reinforce their skills and competitiveness, carry out efficient labour market reforms and reinforce social and territorial cohesion. The ETF also contributes actively to developing the skills dimension of specific policy fields with a strong potential for growth and job creation, namely digital technologies, climate change and energy. Contribution to a new policy on migration The ETF also takes part in efforts to better manage legal migration and in particular its skills dimension. For that purpose, the Foundation provides information on migrant support measures from the employment and skills perspective (MISMES project).

It also informs EU responses to neighbourhood challenges, most of which generate spikes of migration towards the Union. \u201cImproving human capital is fundamental for the competitiveness and cohesion of the EU\u2019s neighbours. Given the increasing interdependence among countries, economies and societies in a globalised world, we contribute to stability and prosperity in the EU neighbourhood.\u201d 139 Madlen Serban, Director The Foundation also facilitates labour mobility within the neighbourhood through the development of mutual trust and recognition of qualifications. With employer involvement, qualifications will also become more relevant to the needs of the labour market. The Foundation\u2019s activities contribute to ensuring that migrants\u2019 skills are better used within the Union and upon return within the partner countries. Contribution to supporting the Union as a strong global actor By projecting the Union\u2019s internal human capital development policies outside its borders, the ETF actively contributes to the Union\u2019s presence on the world stage. The Foundation helps 29 neighbouring countries implement democratic and economic reforms, thus reinforcing the rule of law, economic governance and competitiveness, institutional capacities and transparency in policy-making. An important element is the engagement of social partners and NGOs in the policy development and implementation in the partner counties. It also helps EU Institutions and delegations carry out projects and establishing policy dialogues with partner countries. At the regional scale, the ETF supports the neighbourhood policy and enlargement negotiations priorities by contributing to the implementation and monitoring of their main instruments, namely the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) and the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), for the improvement of VET and employment, labour market reforms, private sector development, competitiveness and youth support. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies The ETF and Cedefop share information, expertise and best practices to support the development of VET systems in the EU and its neighbourhood. The work of the ETF is also complementary with that Eurofound and EU-OSHA on youth employment. The agencies exchange relevant information and occasionally organise common events to inform policy- makers and stakeholders.

It also collaborates with the intellectual property (IP) offices of EU Member States and international partners on the convergence of registration procedures for trademarks and designs across Europe and the world. Also vital in the EUIPO\u2019s work is the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights. The Observatory aims to raise public awareness, deliver training, develop systems and provide evidence-based data on IP protection and enforcement. It runs the Enforcement Database and ACIST, two tools for tackling counterfeit goods, and is also responsible for managing the EU database on orphan works, established by the 2012 Orphan Works Directive. Background The importance of IP as a driver of competitiveness and growth is increasing in the knowledge-based global economy. For companies, this means that their brand is becoming their major economic asset. For developed economies, this means that competitiveness derives from innovation and IP on top of costs and prices 142 . Protecting IP and raising awareness on its importance is paramount to creating an environment conducive to innovation, which is a fundamental objective of the Union 143 and a cornerstone of the EU Agenda reflected in the Innovation Union initiative. The Union has set up an extensive IPR protection system which the EUIPO is in charge of managing. Moreover, in a globalised context where European companies increasingly seek to enter third countries markets, the convergence of IPR protection regimes is necessary to ensure their competitiveness and enforce their IP rights outside the Union. For that purpose, the EUIPO works towards developing a user-driven European intellectual Property network with users and national offices 144 . Contribution to a new boost for jobs, growth and investment Sectors using IP rights intensively account for 39% of the EU GDP and 35% of EU jobs. Moreover, companies that own registered IP rights perform better than those who do not, especially for small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) 145 . The EUIPO is in charge of examining applications and granting these IP rights, in cooperation with Member States national and regional IP offices, and therefore directly contributes to nurturing their growth by protecting their main economic asset. The Office also works on the continuous improvement of the IP system and IP knowledge in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, i.e. lawyers, examiners, users AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET LEVEL OF EU ACTION EUIPO EUIPO\u2019s Strategic Objectives EUIPO\u2019s Strategic Activities (cid:918)(cid:80)(cid:83)ro(cid:89)e o(cid:83)erational e(cid:909)ecti(cid:89)eness JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES EUROPE IN THE WORLD JOBS, GROWTH & INVESTMENT DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET EU 2020 PILLARS (cid:37)uild net(cid:90)ork con(cid:89)ergence (cid:90)ith global i(cid:80)(cid:83)act INTERNAL MARKET Enhance access to (cid:918)(cid:51) syste(cid:80) and (cid:918)(cid:51) kno(cid:90)ledge Managing the Orphan Works Database SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY Granting EU Trade Marks and Registered (cid:38)o(cid:80)(cid:80)unity Designs Euro(cid:83)ean Obser(cid:89)atory on (cid:918)nfringe(cid:80)ents of (cid:918)ntellectual (cid:51)ro(cid:83)erty Rights (cid:918)(cid:80)(cid:83)le(cid:80)enting (cid:36)gency for E(cid:56)(cid:16)funded (cid:83)ro(cid:77)ects in South(cid:16)East (cid:36)sia(cid:15) (cid:38)hina(cid:15) Russia and (cid:918)ndia 140.

        "and the public. It is attentive to ensuring the accessibility of the system for all users, in particular SMEs, by identifying and tackling real and perceived barriers to IP protection, for instance in the application process for trademarks and designs. \u201cWe register around 120 000 EU trade marks and close to 85 000 designs annually, offering intellectual property protection to companies and individuals in a market of more than 500 million consumers.\u201d 146 Raising awareness among citizens and decision-makers on the importance of IP rights further reinforces the efficiency of the system by underlining necessary legislative adjustments and providing the tools to fight counterfeiting. The European Observatory on Infringements of IPR therefore provides knowledge while IT tools are made available for public authorities and rights owners to enforce their IP rights. The Observatory has published studies on the scale of IP infringement and attitudes towards counterfeiting, as well as several sector-specific studies, covering: spirits and wine; recorded music; geographical indications; jewellery and watches; handbags and luggage; toys and games; sport goods; and clothing, footwear and accessories. Contribution to Europe\u2019s global footprint in IPR protection As European companies are increasingly seeking to enter third countries markets, the EUIPO assists them in boosting their competitiveness on the global market and enforcing their IP rights abroad. For that purpose, the European Trade Mark and Design Network (ETMDN) works towards the convergence of practices inside and outside Europe by connecting national and regional IP Offices, user associations and other IP organisations. The EUIPO provides infrastructure and resources to support the implementation of the Network\u2019s projects. The Office further promotes the convergence of IPR protection systems towards European standards across the world by acting as an Implementing Agency for EU-funded programmes in South- East Asia, China, Russia and India. It thus contributes to bringing more consistency and predictability to European companies willing to invest in emerging markets, while facilitating the application of their intellectual property outside the EU. Contribution to a digital single market and a deeper and fairer internal market The Office works towards reinforcing the internal market by protecting and thus encouraging innovation, which allows European companies to develop new products and services which meet consumers\u2019 needs. EUIPO fosters the proper and harmonised functioning of the internal market by granting IP rights valid across all the Member States, thereby complementing the fragmented system of national IP rights. Furthermore, by participating in the creation of new European IP rights, such as non-agricultural Geographical Indications currently being considered, the EUIPO contributes to the establishment of a dynamic single market which reflects fast-paced digital changes and consumer behaviour. It also ensures the accessibility of Europe\u2019s cultural heritage on the Orphan Works Database, which provides information on works whose right holders are not known or located to enable their digitisation and dissemination. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies The EUIPO collaborates with other agencies within an inter-agency Coordination Group on Infringements of IP Rights which includes Europol, Eurojust and Cepol , and exchanges knowledge on the protection of IP rights with the CPVO. Generating savings through tools and databases convergence The EUIPO has developed tools and databases which have significantly increased the efficiency of the European IP Offices implementing them and of the users benefitting from a better service, resulting in time and costs savings. It is estimated that these tools have delivered an economic benefit of \u20ac18.6 million to end users and \u20ac29.8 million to National and Regional Offices in 2015, with \u20ac21 million expected to be generated recurrently every year. In particular, the TMview and DesignView search tools allow users to check for similar trademarks and designs among over 40 million records before submitting an application. As of November 2015, these databases \u2013 the first free alternatives available \u2013 are estimated to have enabled cost savings of \u20ac8.7 million. TMview had served over 17.1 million searches from 151 countries and DesignView, over 1.5 million searches from 141 countries. Usage figures show a rapidly growing interest in these tools.

To address the need for the Schengen Area to move towards more modern and efficient border management by using state-of-the-art technologies, a proof-of-concept exercise aimed at identifying, assessing and testing technical options for implementing the Smart Borders package was initiated by the Commission in 2014, with the support of the European Parliament and the Member States, and carried out by eu-LISA in the course of 2015. The testing phase aimed to contribute to defining the best technical solutions for faster and more secure border-control processes, respecting the highest principles on data protection and fundamental rights. Through the pilot a set of technical options against specific measurable criteria in operational environments were tested. The criteria were accuracy, effectiveness and impact on the duration of border-crossing. The findings of the pilot are reflected in the Sm art Bo rders fin al re port. Subsequent to the pilot, in 2016 the Commission submitted a modified legal proposal for establishing the EU Entry/Exit System that would speed up, facilitate and reinforce border-check procedures for third-country nationals travelling into the Schengen Area. After the adoption of the legal proposal by the co-legislators eu-LISA would be responsible for the development of this large scale IT system.

The Union is therefore committed to improving their working environment. It needs to constantly adapt its approach to occupational safety and health by introducing EU-level measures, providing stakeholders with adequate information and responding to requests addressed in that field. For that purpose, EU-OSHA collects, analyses and provides EU bodies, Member States, social partners and all involved stakeholders with technical, scientific and economic information on occupational safety and health. This data is obtained through the ESENER enterprise survey and OSH overviews and made available via its website. In addition, the agency maintains an online encyclopaedia dedicated to OHS information. EU-OSHA also identifies emerging OSH risks in the context of demographic change, economic recovery and the emergence of new occupational risks. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment EU-OSHA\u2019s activities boost competitiveness by increasing productivity. Indeed, health and safety at work are key drivers of workers\u2019 productivity: poor working conditions drive many people out of the labour force before the official retirement age. This is an increasingly important issue given the ageing of the EU\u2019s workforce. EU-OSHA is working on creating a culture of risk prevention and the promotion of healthier and safer working conditions to ensure that workers\u2019 health allow them to work until retirement age. This contributes to achieving the objective of having 75% of the 20-64 year-olds in employment, while reducing the number of people in poverty and social inclusion by maintaining them in the workforce.

        "efforts aim at reducing the incidence of accidents and diseases at work, whose costs amount to around 3% of the GDP every year. Reducing their incidence through prevention by awareness-raising campaigns, for instance on Healthy Workplaces, reduces the burden on healthcare system, which reinforces their sustainability. Implementing health and safety rules is particularly challenging for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are the bedrock of EU\u2019s growth and employ a growing number of workers. EU-OSHA provides adapted tools for occupational health and safety management. \u201cHigh quality jobs that offer safe and healthy working conditions are essential for people to be able to work longer and so ensure that the employment targets are met.\u201d 156 Dr. Christa Sedlatschek, Director Contribution to the protection of justice and the fundamental rights of workers Informing policy-makers and stakeholders is key to the introduction of measures which ensure the protection of workers\u2019 rights. EU-OSHA\u2019s actions also aim at reinforcing the economic and social cohesion within the Union by guaranteeing citizens the same level of protection wherever they work. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies EU-OSHA closely collaborates with other EU agencies and bodies on issues of common interest: \u2022 Eurofound: the bodies work on health- and safety-related projects to encourage improvements in the working environment; \u2022 Cedefop: cooperation includes joint campaigns, for instance on Healthy Workplaces for All Ages; \u2022 ETF: EU-OSHA\u2019s input contributes to ETF\u2019s work on labour market reforms in third countries; \u2022 ECHA: the Agencies share knowledge on the safe use of chemical substances at work; \u2022 FRA: FRA collects evidence which helps EU-OSHA formulate operational responses and provides proposals for the mainstreaming of fundamental rights in OSH activities; \u2022 EIGE: the bodies collaborate on the gender dimension of OSH issues.

OiRA is an online platform to create free and easy-to-use risk assessment tools for SMEs in any language. It is adaptable to all sectors, from hairdressing to construction. This free tool supports SMEs in improving safety and health in their workplaces by putting into place a step-by-step risk-assessment process, from the evaluation of risks to the implementation and monitoring of measures. It thus helps SMEs overcome the lack of resources and know-how which often prevent them from effectively assessing risks in their workplaces. 156. EU-OSHA Management Plan 2016, p.3. 142 ",

With this aim in view, the tasks of the Foundation shall be to develop and to pursue ideas on the medium and long-term improvement of living and working conditions in the light of practical experience and to identify factors leading to change\u201d 157 . Background EU citizens enjoy among some of the highest standards of living and working conditions in the world. The promotion of their well-being is a fundamental objective of the Union 158 . However, improvements are called for in order to address structural changes and inequalities across Member States. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment Eurofound provides EU and national policy- makers and social partners with data on the evolution of industrial relations, working and living conditions and quality of life in Europe in order to improve and harmonise related policies. It contributes to facilitating the dialogue between social partners, in particular in the context of the European Semester, and also monitoring industrial relations through its online European Observatory of Working Life (EurWORK) and identifying areas for improvement. Eurofound\u2019s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) gathers data across Member States on structural changes which affect labour markets. Eurofound\u2019s analysis of these data feeds into recommendations on how to further improve the functioning and inclusiveness of European labour markets, as well as to foster innovation and job creation. Adapting work and social policies to structural changes, for instance by encouraging the development of digital skills, is a prerequisite for economic recovery and Smart Growth: it stimulates competitiveness and the sustainability of the EU labour market while supporting workers in adapting to change.

        "surveys which provide a detailed overview of working conditions, job quality, quality of life and companies practices across Member States. This comparative information enables Eurofound to identify inequalities in working and living conditions within and between Member States and formulate ideas for upward convergence towards better and fairer conditions for all in the Union. Creating a level-playing field is a prerequisite to the better functioning of the borderless internal market. It encourages labour mobility, which is essential in order to address skills mismatch, while ensuring equal and fair working and living conditions for all Europeans over their life course. Eurofound also carries out anticipatory research on the future of manufacturing in Europe and its industrial and employment consequences. Contribution to the protection of social and fundamental rights of citizens Eurofound formulates policy recommendations aimed at protecting all citizens from exclusion, poverty and social inequalities. For instance, some of its research focuses on ways to increase the integration of women, youth and migrants in the labour market. Eurofound also contributes to safeguarding EU citizens\u2019 rights by monitoring developments in the area of quality of life and public services. These actions promote European citizens\u2019 well-being and cohesion throughout the Union, two fundamental EU objectives 159 . \u201cEurofound seeks both to document and understand change and to develop ideas for the ongoing improvement of the living and working conditions of European citizens.\u201d 160 J uan Men\u00e9ndez-Vald\u00e9s, Director of Eurofound Cooperation with other agencies and bodies Eurofound closely collaborates with sister EU agencies and bodies on issues of common interest: \u2022 Cedefop: the agencies collaborate on joint research and communication activities in the field of employability and skills; \u2022 EIGE: Eurofound provides input for EIGE on the development of the gender equality index in Europe; \u2022 FRA: The two agencies cooperate particularly on their surveys, such as the Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) and the new Fundamental Rights Survey, but also on specific themes such as migrants and asylum seekers. \u2022 EU-OSHA : the agencies work on health and safety projects to encourage improvements in the work environment; \u2022 uropean Training Foundation: the bodies carry out joint research and actions on youth employment. From research to the Youth Guarantee In 2013, Eurofound carried out an in-depth research on young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs) across the Union. It estimated the economic loss arising from their disengagement from the labour market at about \u20ac162 billion, or 1.26% of the European GDP. The results of this research have been used as a source for key EU policy documents aimed at tackling youth unemployment, in particular the European Commission\u2019s initiative on the Youth Guarantee. This consists of a \u20ac6 billion fund aimed at guaranteeing all people under 25 a good-quality job offer, an apprenticeship, traineeship or continued education within four months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. This illustrates how Eurofound\u2019s data collection and analysis translate into concrete measures for bettering the living and working conditions of Europeans. 159.

It works as a support centre for Member States\u2019 law enforcement authorities, and as a criminal information hub by exchanging and analysing criminal intelligence. Through different services, Europol provides operational support to Member States in various domains where EU citizens\u2019 security might be threatened. \u2022 Terrorism: In response to the increasing terrorist threats in Europe, Europol has established the European Counter- Terrorism Centre (ECTC) to bring together Europol\u2019s existing capabilities in the area with a view to enhancing the information exchange through secured, tailored solutions and building the infrastructure for better cooperation. The ECTC provides analytical and operational support to Member States\u2019 investigations including by the setting up of dedicated task-forces. Additionally, the newly established EU Internet Referral Unit (IRU) at Europol tackles online radicalisation. \u2022 Cybercrime: As cybercrime is by definition borderless, Europol has created a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) that combats child sexual exploitation, payment card fraud or other cybercrimes, pooling expertise and intelligence, supporting investigations and promoting EU-wide solutions. \u2022 Irregular migration: Europol coordinates operational activities, supports international investigations, provides forensic or other technical expertise, as well as criminal intelligence to combat irregular migration. In 2016 and in response to the migratory crisis which led to the loss of numerous lives in the Mediterranean Sea, Europol established the European Migrant Smuggling Centre (EMSC) to specifically target the criminal networks which are involved in migrant smuggling. Among others, the EMSC provides analytical and investigation support at the migration hotspots. Upon request, Europol also deploys guest officers from Member States to perform secondary security checks. \u2022 Trafficking in human beings: in order to disrupt the activities of criminal networks active in trafficking of human beings, Europol provides support to investigations and on-the-spot operations, giving access to databases and analytical tools. \u2022 Illicit drugs: in order to protect citizens\u2019 health and security, Europol supports national authorities to dismantle criminal organisations that produce and traffic drugs (heroin, cocaine, cannabis, synthetics) as well as synthetic drugs laboratories. \u2022 Cigarette smuggling: Europol supports customs and other authorities to identify illicit cargo and criminal networks involved in cigarette smuggling.

Furthermore, intellectual property crimes may also endanger legitimate business, investment, innovation and jobs. \u2022 VAT fraud: Europol supports Member States\u2019 investigations, coordinating operations or providing intelligence related to VAT fraud. \u2022 Money laundering: Europol supports worldwide investigations in tracing money laundering. Through its support to law enforcement authorities and its coordination of cross- border investigations in the various domains presented above, Europol contributes to the European Commission\u2019s priority \u201cjustice and fundamental rights\u201d that includes the fight against cross-border crime and terrorism. Through its actions in the field of illegal immigration and human trafficking and smuggling, Europol also contributes to the \u2018migration\u2019 priority. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies Europol is part of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies\u2019 network. It collaborates with most of the agencies of the network on different topics. \u2022 EASO . Europol, together with Frontex, Eurojust and EASO, collaborates on the \u201cHotspot\u201d approach, providing on-the-spot staff and equipment to face exceptional migration pressures. They support the investigation on smuggling and trafficking of human beings and assist national authorities regarding identification, registering and fingerprinting of migrants. \u2022 Frontex. The purpose of the cooperation is to combat cross-border criminal activities through the exchange of information or joint operational activities. \u2022 Eurojust. Europol mainly organises trainings on cybercrime and drugs together with Eurojust. They also support Joint Investigation Teams \u2022 CEPOL. Europol contributes to CEPOL\u2019s courses and seminars. \u2022 EMCDDA. Europol collaborates with EMCDDA on illegal drugs matters, in order to publish early warnings or emerging threats reports. The two agencies produce an annual joint report. \u2022 Europol also collaborates with eu-LISA and FRA in areas of common interest. Beyond the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies\u2019 network, Europol also collaborates with the EU Institutions, other European bodies (e.g. the European External Action Service) and other EU agencies such as: \u2022 EUIPO. Europol collaborates with EUIPO on the topic of intellectual property infringements through the newly set up Intellectual Property Crime Coordinated Coalition (IPC3) at Europol; \u2022 EMSA. EMSA provides Europol with information on maritime traffic; \u2022 ENI SA. Europol and ENISA work together on cybercrime. Moreover, Europol signed cooperation agreements with third countries (e.g. Balkan countries, Turkey, Ukraine, or Russia) to combat international crime. It also collaborates with international organisations such as the World Bank or INTERPOL.

The identified smugglers were mainly from Syria and Greece, but also Palestine and possibly Tunisia. The organised crime group is believed to have smuggled irregular migrants from Turkey (mainly individuals originating from Syria), then facilitating their journeys from Greece to other EU Member States via the Balkan route (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Germany and further northwards). \u2022 Results: 23 suspects arrested in Austria, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The members of the criminal network had set up their headquarters in Greece, where migrants \u2013 either located in Turkey or on their way to Greece \u2013 would contact them for further assistance with their journeys to Northern Europe. All forms of assistance could be provided ranging from transport and supplying forged travel documents, to housing. The migrants paid the facilitators via money-transfer services or simply with cash. This organised crime group is believed to have smuggled around 100 migrants per day and active since 2013.

Contribution to the area of Justice and Fundamental Rights Eurojust operates in the area of freedom, security and justice, which is a core component of the Single Market. It supports Member States in the fight against serious cross-border crime and terrorism, for the benefit of EU citizens. Eurojust supports the competent authorities of the Member States to render their investigations and prosecutions more effective when dealing with cross-border crime. In order to achieve this mission, Eurojust performs operational and strategic work. It works as a centre for operational judicial support with the aim of fostering coordination and cooperation between Member States. It offers operational and legal expertise to national authorities through facilitating the application of EU legal instruments such as the Mutual Legal Assistance, the European Arrest Warrant, the European Investigation Order, or joint investigation teams. Moreover, Eurojust works as a centre of judicial and legal expertise and provides advice to stakeholders, such as EU policy and decision makers, based on operational experience. It also shares best practices and recommendations e.g. on the functioning of joint investigation teams. Eurojust supports Member States\u2019 competent national authorities by coordinating cross-border investigations, prosecutions and the gathering of evidence. It also assists them in the prevention and resolution of conflicts of jurisdictions. Eurojust facilitates cooperation to bring criminals to justice and treats casework in a large number of areas: terrorism, trafficking in human beings, illegal immigrant smuggling, cybercrime, online child abuse, drug trafficking, money laundering, organised crime groups, environmental crime, fraud and corruption, counterfeiting, crime against property or public goods and criminal offences affecting the EU\u2019s financial interests. Beyond providing financial and operational support as well as expertise to joint investigation teams, Eurojust also organises \u2022 judicial coordination meetings to bring together judicial and law enforcement authorities, i.e. prosecutors, judges and police officers, to resolve legal and practical difficulties to operations (e.g. conflict of jurisdiction), exchange information, coordinate ongoing investigations and prosecutions, etc.; EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET LEVEL OF EU ACTION Eurojust Eurojust\u2019s strategic goals Eurojust\u2019s strategic activities Coordination centres Strategic advice to EU decision and policy makers JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES EUROPE IN THE WORLD Joint Investigation Teams JUSTICE & FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Judicial coordination meetings SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY Operational work Function as the centre for operation- al judicial support in the EU Strategic Work Function as the centre of judicial and legal expertise in the EU Advice in casework (experience, best practices, recommendations) 147 ",

ITER brings together seven parties that represent half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 the European Union, Russia, Japan, China, India, South Korea and the United States. F4E also supports fusion research and development initiatives through the Broader Approach Agreement, signed with Japan \u2013 a fusion energy partnership which will last for 10 years. Ultimately, F4E will contribute towards the construction of demonstration fusion reactors. It was set up for 35 years. Background The increased global demand for energy, coupled with the economic, political and environmental risks associated with fossil fuels, has prompted Europe and its international partners to advance fusion energy research towards the construction of the first demonstration commercial reactor. Energy produced by fusion could in this respect contribute to the diversity, sustainability and security of the European energy supply system in the second half of the twenty-first century. For that purpose, Europe has entered two international agreements regarding: \u2022 the Establishment of the ITER International Fusion Energy Organisation (ITER IO) for the Joint Implementation of the ITER Project with China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the USA: ITER is the world\u2019s largest research and engineering project on the viability and sustainability of fusion as an energy source; \u2022 the Joint Implementation of the Broad Approach Activities in the Field of Fusion Energy Research with Japan, which aims at accelerating the development of fusion energy by cooperating on projects of mutual interest, including preparations for new materials testing facilities, as a complement to ITER. \u2022 F4E is in charge of providing the Union\u2019s contribution to these projects, as well as preparing the construction of a demonstration fusion reactor and related materials. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment To provide Euratom\u2019s contribution to ITER and the Broader Approach and enhance fusion technologies, F4E finances research projects through grants and awards numerous procurement contracts to manufacture ITER components to European industry, SMEs and fusion laboratories.

By involving European industry actors, it also contributes to broadening the EU industrial base of fusion technology to ensure its competitiveness in the future fusion market. The organisation\u2019s activities foster innovation and competitiveness in emerging technologies, thereby contributing to the EU Innovation Union initiative and stimulating job creation and growth in Europe. Moreover, by thriving to develop an economically competitive source of energy in the coming decades, the organisation is contributing to the long-term competitiveness of European citizens and companies. Contribution to building a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy F4E works towards developing fusion energy as \u201ca potentially limitless, safe, sustainable, environmentally responsible source of energy\u201d 164 It is therefore committed to ensuring the world\u2019s sustainable development in the long term by replacing polluting fossil fuels with a cleaner source of energy. This directly contributes to the Lisbon Treaty objective of improving the quality of the environment 165 . Furthermore, fusion could significantly reinforce the energy security of Europe and other importing regions as it is a potentially limitless source of energy directly available on anywhere. Its supply would therefore not be contingent upon economic, political, geopolitical or environmental circumstances. Contribution to Europe\u2019s footprint in international research on fusion energy By taking part in international scientific collaboration projects, F4E is instrumental in strengthening international research cooperation. In addition, it encourages the association of third countries\u2019 nuclear fusion programmes with the Euratom programmes, reinforcing this way Europe\u2019s capacity and standing as a leading actor in the emerging field of fusion energy. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies F4E is sharing its information technology (IT) backup infrastructure with EMSA in order to increase its disaster recovery capacity. The organisation also works with other EU agencies on improving its communication towards stakeholders by organising workshops to share good practice and exchange know-how in the field of communication. Supporting European industry and research organisations By 2015, during its 8 years of existence, F4E had already achieved an impressive record in supporting European industry and laboratories: \u2022 400 contracts awarded to industry and SMEs \u2022 150 grants awarded \u2022 Total value over \u20ac3.57 billion \u2022 Supporting over 400 European companies in 20 EU Member States and Switzerland \u2022 Supporting over 65 R&D organisations.

The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Joint Undertaking \u2022 Foundation year: 2008 \u2022 Location: Brussels, Belgium \u2022 Staff: 26 FTEs (AWP 2016) The FCH JU\u2019s mission is to \u201cdevelop by 2020 to the point of market readiness, a portfolio of clean, efficient and affordable solutions that fully demonstrate the potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier and of fuel cells as energy converters, as part of a system that integrates sustainable and secure supply with low carbon stationary and transport technologies\u201d 166 . Background Fuel cells and hydrogen (FCH) technologies hold great potential for energy and transport applications for Europe\u2019s transition towards a low-carbon, competitive economy. Hydrogen as an energy carrier and fuel cells as energy converters offer the possibility to reduce emissions, enhance energy security and stimulate growth in Europe as they allow the integration of renewables in the European energy system. However, the current level of competitiveness and performance of FCH technologies and the lack of infrastructures and regulations deter investments for their large-scale deployment in Europe. A public-private partnership, the first FCH JU, was set up in 2008 to encourage coordination between research and industry and leverage public and private funds to accelerate the commercialisation of FCH technologies. Its work continues with the new FCH 2 JU, which gathers the European Union, over 80 companies and 60 research institutions and universities under the EU Horizon 2020 research programme for 2014-2020. The FCH 2 JU offers a platform for industry-led applied research, development and demonstration activities to foster and demonstrate advancement of European technology applications in transport, energy and portable applications. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment The FCH 2 JU aims at boosting investment to increase the cost-competitiveness and performance of FCH technologies and thereby to encourage their large- scale commercialisation. By fostering the cooperation of all European industry actors, in particular small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs), with the research community, it seeks to let research on FCH be driven by industry needs and thus ensure that results feed directly into industrial, marketable outcomes.

By contributing to the advancement of efficient transport and energy systems including electric passenger vehicles and buses, hydrogen refuelling stations and Auxiliary Power Units for aviation, maritime, rail and the off-road sector, the FCH 2 JU can trigger beneficial impacts for other sectors by reducing energy and transport costs. Contribution to a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy The FCH 2 JU is dedicated to fostering the development and commercialisation of FCH technology applications as a competitive alternative to conventional technologies with negative environmental impact. By boosting the share of renewables in the European energy mix through hydrogen as an energy carrier and the use of fuel cells for transport applications, it directly works towards increasing resource efficiency and climate change mitigation in Europe. This directly relates to the Lisbon Treaty objective of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment 167 and to the EU\u2019s commitment to achieve a low-carbon economy by 2050. \u201cEurope is a technology leader in certain FCH applications and very competitive in others. Notable technological progress has been made by European companies in all sectors, particularly road transport, due in part to consistent and long term public support for projects funded in by the countries, the European Research and Development Framework Programmes and the FCH 1 JU.\u201d 168 Moreover, it contributes to enhancing energy security by promoting technologies which allow the storage and integration of renewable energy sources in the European energy system. The FCH 2 JU therefore plays a key role in the development of the Energy Union. Cooperation with other bodies and agencies The FCH 2 JU collaborates with other stakeholders involved in the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan towards reinforcing supply chains and building industrial capacity to improve resource efficiency, climate change mitigation and energy security in Europe.

fundamental rights a reality for everyone in the European Union\u201d 169 . Contribution to the area of Justice and Fundamental Rights FRA\u2019s objective is to support EU Institutions, Member States and other bodies when they take measures or formulate courses of action within their respective spheres of competence to fully respect fundamental rights. The Agency fulfils its objective by issuing reports and opinions, as well as by raising awareness on fundamental rights issues. The EU recognises rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is legally binding on the EU institutions and on national governments when implementing EU law. In order to realise its mission, FRA gathers data and carries out transnational research and comparative analysis to provide independent evidence-based expertise, conclusions and opinions to EU Institutions and Member States. Furthermore, FRA is carrying out communication and awareness-raising activities in relation to fundamental rights issues in order to ensure the effective impact of its work on policy-making. FRA carries out its tasks, missions and activities along three broad thematic areas, i.e. freedoms, equality and justice, that involve different work streams defined by the Council of the EU every five years, as the Agency\u2019s \u201cmulti-annual framework\u201d. The present framework (2012-2017) includes: Freedoms Under the \u2018freedoms\u2019 thematic area, FRA works towards the promotion and safeguarding of fundamental rights in the fields of: \u2022 Immigration and integration of migrants, visa, border control and asylum; \u2022 Information society and, in particular, respect for private life and protection of personal data. Equality FRA works on different streams within the equality thematic area to ensure equal treatment for everyone: \u2022 Rights of the child; \u2022 Roma integration; \u2022 Racism, xenophobia and related intolerance; \u2022 Discrimination based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION EUROPE IN THE WORLD LEVEL OF EU ACTION FRA FRA\u2019s Strategic Themes FRA\u2019s Strategic Activities Freedoms E(cid:84)uality JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES (cid:45)ustice SINGLE MARKET JUSTICE & FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY Provide independent evidence-based advice (cid:39)ata collection(cid:15) research and analysis Disseminate research results and raise a(cid:90)areness 169.

        "other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. Justice In the justice thematic area, FRA provides expertise and assistance on fundamental rights of: \u2022 Access to justice including judicial cooperation (except in criminal matters) at EU and Member State level, including for marginalised groups; \u2022 -Victims of crime - by promoting their right to have access to justice, and by focusing on specific victims such as victims of gender-based violence and hate crime. The contribution of fundamental rights to the internal market The respect and promotion of fundamental rights underpin many aspects of the Single Market, and represent therefore an enabler to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. For example, the fundamental right to data protection lays at the basis of every development towards a digital society. Ensuring equal treatment for all and, in particular for vulnerable groups, such as Roma, persons with disabilities, etc. contributes to the elimination of poverty and social exclusion. FRA\u2019s work on indicators and monitoring the implementation, outcome and impact of policy measures contributes to evidence-based planning, implementation and evaluation of social inclusion and poverty reduction measures e.g. concerning minorities and persons with disabilities. Furthermore, reporting regularly on the situation of migrants, in housing, healthcare, education, employment and non-discriminatory recognition of qualifications and skills, also contributes to this end. Working on social cohesion through all those different aspects contributes towards Europe\u2019s competitiveness. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies FRA is part of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies\u2019 network, and in 2016 chaired this network. It collaborates with the members thereof (i.e. CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, eu-LISA, EIGE, EMCDDA, Eurojust, Europol and Frontex) in order to help them respect fundamental rights in their respective area of work, e.g. by collaborating on joint initiatives, and by providing their staff with training. FRA also collaborates in a similar manner with Eurofound. FRA collaborates with the EU Institutions, Member States, social partners and civil society organisations, and with international organisations such as the Council of Europe, the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the EEA and Norway Grants.

The Agency\u2019s reporting on the impact of the asylum crisis, which has systematically addressed issues ranging from reception conditions through to manifestations of hate crime against asylum seekers, has furnished key actors with a unique overview of on-going fundamental rights concerns and how the authorities are responding to them. In addition, since the first half of 2016, the Agency has had a small presence of staff in the Greek hotspots who have provided fundamental rights expertise to key actors on the ground, ranging from the Commission and other Agencies, through to local actors. With the provision of timely evidence concerning nine Member States, and with dedicated input in Greece \u2013 which is resulting in practical initiatives, such as training \u2013 the Agency has served to ensure that fundamental rights remain visible with respect to asylum. 154 ",

Frontex European Border and Coast Guard Agency Frontex contributes to inclusive growth within the EU\u2019s Single Market through its work regarding the Juncker Plan priorities \u2018migration policy\u2019 and \u2018justice and fundamental rights\u2019, by increasing operational cooperation in border control. Through its activities and relationships with third countries, Frontex\u2019 work is also relevant for the priority \u201cEurope in the world\u201d. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2004 (2016 170 ) \u2022 Location: Warsaw, Poland \u2022 Staff: 417 FTEs (AWP 2016) The key role of Frontex is to establish a technical and operational strategy for implementation of integrated border management at Union level, and to oversee the effective functioning of border control at the EU external borders. The agency provides technical and operational assistance to Member States through joint operations and rapid border interventions, and ensures the practical execution of measures in a situation requiring urgent action at the external borders. Moreover, Frontex provides technical and operational assistance in the support of search-and-rescue operations for persons in distress at sea, as well as organises, coordinates and conducts return operations. Contribution to the area of Justice and Fundamental Rights At the core of the EU\u2019s Single Market, lies the free movement of goods, capital, services and people. Border controls not only hamper the free movement of persons, they also come with significant economic cost. In order to promote the free movement of people, most of the EU Members States and associate countries 171 created between them a free-travel area without internal borders - the Schengen Area. However, the external borders of this area are still controlled by several national authorities. In this context, Frontex works towards the maintenance of the free movement area. The agency facilitates the operational cooperation between EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries in order to establish common rules, standards and procedures for external border control. In order to fulfil this mission, Frontex carries out different types of activities mentioned below. Situation Monitoring and Risk Analysis Frontex collects, analyses and distributes information related to the situation at the external borders in order to identify potential threats, risks and vulnerabilities (e.g. cross-border crime or irregular migration) and forecast future trends in migration and cross-border crime. The agency publishes daily reports, bulletins and alerts on the current situation, which are useful in emergency situations or during joint operations of EU border guard teams. Frontex also created \u201cEurosur\u201d, an information exchange platform allowing the dissemination of information to Member States and other partners in a more efficient way. As of 2017 Frontex will also conduct stress tests of Member States\u2019 border management capabilities to face pressure at the external borders. If it is determined that help is needed Frontex will propose assistance packages to the Member States concerned.

        "her country of origin on the basis of a just decision. If a migrant who receives a legal decision to leave the EU territory does not do so voluntarily, s/he might be forcibly returned by means of a return flight. Most flights are nowadays organised by national authorities. Frontex is coordinating such initiatives at the European level in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency: joint return flights are organised to repatriate migrants from different Member States to a specific country. Training Frontex develops training programmes and organises training sessions for European border guards to enhance harmonisation of border control goals, methods, standards and terminology. Although countries have different training needs since the nature of their borders differs (land or sea), training is important to improve partnership and effective cooperation between countries, especially during joint operations. Moreover, Frontex has developed training courses to develop specific skills such as countering trafficking in human beings, detection of stolen vehicles or falsified documents, etc. Research & Innovation Technology plays an important role in border checks and surveillance, both as an opportunity and a challenge. On one hand, it makes border control more efficient, easier and safer; on the other hand, it increases criminal techniques to forge or falsify documents. Frontex hence works as interface between the border control profession and the relevant specialised technology industry, research organisations and scientists, transmitting the challenges faced by the former to the latter. Similarly, Frontex monitors new R&D developments to keep border guard authorities updated. Contribution towards a new policy on migration Joint Operations (JOs) at the external borders When a Member State encounters exceptional migratory pressure at its external (sea, air or land) border, Frontex deploys technical equipment and border guards from other Member States to patrol and carry out border checks. These guest officers work together with the officers from the country hosting the operation. Frontex may also deploy screening officers to help in identifying, registering, fingerprinting and checking the status of all migrants against relevant databases. Debriefing officers that collect voluntarily provided information on people smuggling networks could also be working in JOs. In case of emergencies Frontex can also dispatch rapid response teams. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies Frontex is part of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies\u2019 network. It collaborates with \u2022 EASO on topics related to asylum; \u2022 Europol and CEPOL on topics such as trafficking in human beings and drug smuggling; \u2022 FRA to promote fundamental rights in the various aspects of border management; \u2022 eu-LISA on e.g. the fingerprint database. Moreover, Frontex collaborates with EASO, Europol and Eurojust on the \u2018Hotspot\u2019 approach, providing on-the-spot staff and equipment to face exceptional migration pressures. They assist national authorities to identify, register and fingerprint the migrants, as well as support the investigation on smuggling and trafficking of human beings. Frontex has also an agreement with SatCen to be provided with satellite imagery (e.g. of ports or other coastal areas) for the purpose of border surveillance. The agency collaborates closely with EMSA and EFCA on maritime surveillance matters. Additionally Frontex works with international organisations and bodies such as the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Interpol, or the International Organization for Migration (IOM). European coast-guard function In 2015 alone, vessels and airplanes taking part in Frontex-coordinated operations rescued 254 693 persons, which was almost 700 persons per day, on average. In the same year during the maritime joint operations different types of cross-border crime were detected: \u2022 some 106 tonnes of hashish worth more than EUR 160m., 10.3 kg of cocaine, 11.3 kg of heroin and 5.4 kg marijuana worth EUR 1.3 were seized. \u2022 there were 336 million contraband cigarettes worth EUR 38 m. seized and a dozen cases of possible illegal fishing and sea pollution were detected and reported. As of October 2016, Frontex\u2019s mandate covers a coastguard function in areas where border control and coast guard tasks overlap. The agency will use this opportunity to strengthen cooperation with national and European coast guard authorities, including the EU sister-agencies: the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA).

GSA European Global Navigation Satellite Systems Agency GSA is the regulatory agency supporting the European Union\u2019s satellite navigation programmes, Galileo and EGNOS. By contributing to develop GNSS-related technology applications and services adapted to user needs, it fosters Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth in Europe. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Decentralised EU Agency \u2022 Foundation year: 2004 \u2022 Location: Prague, Czech Republic \u2022 Staff: 145 FTEs (AWP 2016) GSA\u2019S mission is to \u201csupport the European Union objectives and achieve the highest return on European GNSS investment, in terms of benefits to users and economic growth and competitiveness.\u201d 172 Background Many sectors of the European economy rely on the availability of global navigation satellite services for applications in transport, logistics, energy and other professional fields. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is \u201ca constellation of satellites providing signals from space that transmit positioning and timing data to GNSS receivers. The receivers use this data to determine location\u201d 173 . The European Union has set up two satellite navigation programmes: \u2022 The Galileo programme is Europe\u2019s GNSS, dedicated to providing a highly accurate global positioning service. Galileo aims to achieve Europe\u2019s independence in satellite navigation under civilian control while also being interoperable with other global satellite navigation systems, the US\u2019 GSP and Russia\u2019s GLONASS 174 . \u2022 The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is a regional satellite-based system which aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of GPS and after 2020 also Galileo information by correcting signal measurement errors and providing information on the integrity of signals. The ultimate goal of these programmes is to translate space technology into services for European citizens and companies. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment GSA contributes to the market development of the European GNSS by supporting private and public research and development efforts, raising awareness of GNSS performance among the public and the industry and promoting GNSS applications and services. These generate technological benefits based on satellite signals in numerous sectors across the European economy. GSA thereby reinforces Europe\u2019s presence in the growing satellite navigation services market. This sector holds strong potential for industry development, job creation and economic growth through new business opportunities and increased competitiveness. The EU\u2019s GNSS programmes already support over 50 000 jobs and Galileo and EGNOS are expected to deliver almost \u20ac50 billion to the economy until 2027. GSA thus contributes to Smart Growth in Europe. Contribution to a connected Digital Single Market The space programmes supported by GSA are instrumental in the creation of a connected Digital Single Market. They are key enablers for new digital trends such as Big Data, autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things, which increase connectivity in Europe.

GSA\u2019s core mission is to ensure that European citizens get the most out of Europe\u2019s satellite navigation programmes.\u201d 175 Contribution to a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy GSA works towards the development and market entry of the EU space programmes, which provide beneficial solutions used by other sectors for the implementation of Europe\u2019s sustainable energy and environment strategies. For instance, outlining fuel- efficient flight paths and landing or enabling precision farming allow reducing the negative environmental impact of many sectors and reinforcing resource efficiency in Europe. Contribution to a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base GSA ensures the security of the European GNSS by providing security accreditations for Galileo satellite launches and monitoring the programme\u2019s activities. The Agency is in charge of EGNOS, which works towards improving the accuracy and reliability of GPS and soon Galileo information, thus the trust of localisation services users. It also strengthens the EU industrial base through considerable efficiency gains: it is estimated that EGNOS and Galileo have contributed to over 800 million hours\u2019 worth of efficiency gains in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, it is key in translating the advances deriving from the EU\u2019s satellite navigation programmes into facilitators for the functioning of the internal market across all economic sectors. By allowing these to benefit all European citizens, GSA is contributing to Inclusive Growth. Contribution to an area of justice and fundamental rights and a new policy on migration The European GNSS operated by GSA will, if the relevant legislation is approved, ensure the precise location of 112 emergency calls, thus contributing to saving thousands of lives in Europe every year. The EU\u2019s space programmes and their applications also help authorities to fight human trafficking and terrorism. Their monitoring capacities are paramount to the efficiency of patrolling, search and rescue initiatives. For these purposes, GSA actively contributes to the development and safe use of the Galileo Public Regulated Services (PRS). These are encrypted navigation services for Member States government authorised users (e.g. emergency services and the police) and sensitive applications requiring high continuity. Contribution to making Europe a stronger global actor Through its contribution to the development of the only GNSS programme under civilian control in the world, Galileo, GSA also guarantees Europe\u2019s autonomy. Finally, its technology applications enable it to play a larger role in global disaster relief and development projects 176 . Moreover, through the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre, GSA plays an instrumental role in averting threats to the security of the Union and Member States and mitigating serious harm arising from the deployment, operation or use of the European GNSS. GSA also includes an autonomous body, the Security Accreditation Board, which takes accreditation decisions for Galileo and EGNOS. Finally, GSA plays a key role in ensuring the security and coordination of public regulated services. These are used in Member States for sensitive applications requiring effective access control and a high level of service continuity, even in crisis situations. Space technologies helping save lives The eCall regulation requires that, as of April 2018, all new models of passenger cars and vans that will be commercialised in Europe be equipped with the automated emergency-Call. The European eCall system, which provides an accurate GNSS location of an accident by using EGNOS and Galileo, will significantly improve the response time of emergency services. It contributes to the market development of services derived from space programmes advances. These foster further democratic involvement from European citizens. It empowers them by offering services such as real-time voting via smartphones or crowd- sourced petitioning.

Background Drug development is a long, expensive and complicated process with numerous bottlenecks. As a result, there are still many diseases and conditions for which there is no cure or little in the way of treatments. IMI 2 JU projects cover the full spectrum of drug discovery and development, from understanding the underlying causes of disease and identifying potential drugs and drug targets, through testing potential drugs for safety and efficacy, to clinical trial design, and monitoring the benefits and risks of medicines and vaccines once they are in use. IMI 2 JU was set up in 2008 as a joint undertaking between the EU (represented by the European Commission) and the European pharmaceutical industry (represented by EFPIA, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations). In its first phase (\u2018IMI1\u2019: 2008-2013), IMI 2 JU had a total budget of \u20ac2 billion, making it the largest life sciences public-private partnership in the world. Half of the budget came from the EU\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7). The other half of the budget came as \u2018in-kind contributions\u2019 from EFPIA companies, who pay for their own participation in IMI 2 JU projects. IMI1 launched over 50 projects, covering areas as diverse as dementia, antimicrobial resistance, diabetes, medicines safety, and education and training. \u201cWith IMI2, we have the opportunity to build on accomplishments of IMI1 and further align medical research programmes and public health priorities. This gains in importance day-by-day as society faces increasing challenges in difficult areas, such as age-related illnesses and chronic diseases.\u201d 178 (cid:39)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:53)(cid:88)(cid:91)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:68)(cid:16)(cid:36)(cid:78)(cid:79)(cid:76) (cid:39)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:16)(cid:42)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:42)(cid:3)(cid:53)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3) and Innovation AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET LEVEL OF EU ACTION IMI 2 JU IMI 2 JU\u2019s Strategic Objectives IMI 2 JU\u2019s Strategic Activities JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES EUROPE IN THE WORLD JOBS, GROWTH & INVESTMENT INTERNAL MARKET EU 2020 PILLARS SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY (cid:918)ncrease the success rate in clinical trials of (cid:83)riority (cid:80)edicines (cid:47)aunching calls for (cid:83)ro(cid:83)osals Managing (cid:83)ro(cid:77)ects under the (cid:26)th Framework Research Programme and (cid:43)ori(cid:93)on (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:19) (cid:38)o(cid:80)(cid:80)unicating to de(cid:80)onstrate the (cid:83)artnershi(cid:83)(cid:519)s added (cid:89)alue to E(cid:56) citi(cid:93)ens E(cid:91)(cid:83)anding the basis of e(cid:91)ternal collaborations and (cid:83)artnershi(cid:83)s Reduce the ti(cid:80)e to reach clinical (cid:83)roof of conce(cid:83)t in (cid:80)edicine de(cid:89)elo(cid:83)(cid:80)ent (cid:39)e(cid:89)elo(cid:83) ne(cid:90) thera(cid:83)ies for diseases for (cid:90)hich there is a high un(cid:80)et need (cid:39)e(cid:89)elo(cid:83) diagnostic and treatment biomarkers for diseases Reduce the failure rate of (cid:89)accine candidates in (cid:83)hase (cid:918)(cid:918)(cid:918) trials (cid:918)(cid:80)(cid:83)ro(cid:89)e the drug de(cid:89)elo(cid:83)(cid:80)ent (cid:83)rocess 177.

        "In 2014, IMI\u2019s second phase (\u201cIMI2\u201d) was launched, with more ambitious goals and a \u20ac3.3 billion budget coming jointly from Horizon 2020 and the industry. Collaboration is key to IMI\u2019s success. IMI\u2019s projects represent a community of over 9 000 researchers from academia, pharmaceutical companies, other sectoral companies, SMEs, patient groups and regulators from across Europe. Through IMI, they are working together to tackle some of the biggest challenges in health research \u2013 challenges of direct concern to the health of European citizens that are simply too big for any single company, university or even country to take on alone. IMI 2 JU facilitates these collaborations by acting as a neutral third party, providing support to all partners during the whole project cycle. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment By creating long-lasting collaborative networks and leveraging additional industry funding, IMI 2 JU is reinforcing Europe\u2019s scientific leadership in medical sciences and boosting the competitiveness of European companies involved in the pharmaceutical sector, especially SMEs. By fostering the sharing of knowledge, resources and expertise among all stakeholders, IMI 2 JU delivers new knowledge and will help to speed up medicines development and allow commercial opportunities based on new products and processes to emerge. IMI 2 JU therefore contributes to the establishment of smart economic growth models based on innovation. Contribution to a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base IMI\u2019s research agenda focuses on areas of public health interest and unmet medical need. Involving citizens and patients at the very first stages of the research and development process is instrumental in better understanding their needs and delivering tailored integrated treatment programmes with maximised effectiveness and minimised risks for patients. In the long run, the IMI\u2019s results should contribute to speeding up patient access to innovative medicines. This would reinforce the ability of the internal market to contribute to all citizens\u2019 well-being, a fundamental objective of the Union 179 and a pillar of the European health policy, Health 2020. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies As many IMI 2 JU projects have consequences on decision making by medicines regulators, IMI 2 JU works closely with the EMA and other regulatory bodies. IMI 2 JU also encourages its consortia to engage in early dialogue with regulators. ECDC is involved in some IMI 2 JU projects. IMI 2 JU works closely with other Joint Undertakings to share best practices and resources, as well as with EMCDDA on the sharing of software.

        "SatCen European Union Satellite Centre SatCen contributes to strengthening the EU\u2019s position as a global actor in the world by supporting the decision making of the EU in the field of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and in particular Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) through its actions in geospatial intelligence, training and capability development. Via its activities fostering innovation and research, it also contributes to job creation, growth and investment in the internal market, and as a result to Smart Growth. The agency at a glance \u2022 Type: Agency under the CSDP \u2022 Foundation year: 2002 \u2022 Location : Madrid, Spain \u2022 Staff: 121 FTEs in 2016 SatCen\u2019s mission is to support \u201cthe decision making of the European Union, Member States, Third States 180 and international organisations by providing products and services resulting from the exploitation of space assets and collateral data\u201d 181 . Contribution to strengthening the EU\u2019s position as a global actor in the world As a Council Agency, SatCen supports EU political, diplomatic and operational actions in the field of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), and in particular Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), within the framework of the Global Strategy for the EU\u2019s Foreign and Security Policy. It provides decision makers with early warning of potential crises in order to enable them to take diplomatic, economic and humanitarian decisions in a timely manner. To facilitate cooperative decision-making, emergency response and intervention planning, SatCen offers three main services. 1. Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) & Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) IMINT addresses the analysis of satellite and aerial data to turn it into intelligence. GEOINT comprises \u201cthe analysis of geospatial information to describe, assess and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on Earth\u201d 182 . Depending on the tasks received from its users (e.g. the European External Action Service, Member States, Frontex, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the UN), SatCen produces reports that can be brief descriptions in case a fast response is needed (e.g. crisis management), or comprehensive studies on complex areas. SatCen\u2019s satellite imagery analyses cover: \u2022 critical infrastructure , i.e. physical or virtual systems and assets that would have impacts on security, health or safety if destroyed (e.g. dams, water treatment facilities, oil fields, pipelines, pumping stations, airports, highway, governmental buildings, etc.); \u2022 military capabilitie s (military camps, airfields, naval bases, etc.) to assess military activity, deployed forces or battle damage; \u2022 weapons of mass destruction in the context of non-proliferation missions, including nuclear fuel cycle, non- conventional weapons and chemical weapons; \u2022 humanitarian aid and disaster relief missions, including the analysis of refugee camps, state failure and insurgency and man-made and natural disasters; \u2022 contingency planning, including analysis of vulnerable areas, disaster assessment, support to evacuation operations or rapid mapping (i.e. the EU 2020 PILLARS AREAS OF EU ACTION SINGLE MARKET LEVEL OF EU ACTION SatCen SatCen\u2019s Strategic Objectives SatCen\u2019s Strategic Activities Training Capability development JUNCKER COMMISSION PRIORITIES EUROPE IN THE WORLD A STRONGER GLOBAL ACTOR JOBS, GROWTH & INVESTMENT Support the decision making of the EU in the field of CFSP and in particular CSDP Geospacial Intelligence SMART GROWTH SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INCLUSIVE GROWTH INNOVATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION, TRAINING, LIFE-LONG LEARNING DIGITAL SOCIETY SKILLS FIGHTING POVERTY COMPETITIVE -NESS CLEAN AND EFFICIENT ENERGY 181.

Training SatCen provides specific training for imagery specialists in the field of GEOINT, IMINT, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), imagery analysis of the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear weapons related facilities and imagery analysis of industrial installations. The organisation of training also aims to exchange experience and knowledge and create cohesion in GEOINT by instilling a common culture and methods between stakeholders. 3. Capability development In order to carry out its mission, SatCen participates in programmes to develop new (or strengthen existing) capabilities. SatCen has actively participated in the development of security applications of Copernicus, the EU\u2019s Earth Observation Programme, including services in Support of EU External Action (to provide rapid geospatial information for crisis prevention, preparedness or response), services for border surveillance (cross-border crime, illegal immigration) and maritime surveillance services (illegal fishing activities, traffic at sea and borders). SatCen participates in the implementation of the Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) Support Framework (SF), a partnership between the Union and its Member States (MS), to improve the protection of EU space infrastructures from man-made space objects. SatCen is the front-desk of the SST SF in direct contact with SST Users, interfacing with MS as service providers. SST is part of Space Situational Awareness (SSA) which \u201crefers to the knowledge of location and function of space objects and space environment, including operational satellites, space debris, near Earth objects and space weather. The development of a European SST capability underpins the exploitation of space assets, a key capability contributing to autonomous access to and sustainability of space for the EU and its Member States\u201d 183 . SatCen support is key for handling the migration crisis One of the EU Operations supported by SatCen is Mediterranean Operation Sophia, the EU\u2019s operation to identify, capture and dispose of vessels and assets used by migrant smugglers or traffickers. With the analysis of satellite imagery, SatCen can identify and monitor departure points and routes that might be used by human smuggling and trafficking networks. SatCen is also supporting the EU Agency Frontex in monitoring coast activity and external border activity related to the migration crisis. The analysis of satellite imagery is used to identify routes, means of transport, patterns of the launch and landing operations and border-crossing activities. Contribution to jobs, growth & investment Research, Technology, Development and Innovation. In the context of Horizon 2020, SatCen is participating in the BigDataEurope project, and in particular in the Big Data in Secure Societies programme, that aims at assessing tools that could enhance the operational capacity to manage extremely large and complex datasets in a timely and efficient manner. Job creation. Copernicus is also a tool to create new applications, new opportunities, new markets and new jobs. Independent studies indicate that by 2030 nearly 48.000 jobs could be created by the application of Copernicus. Knowing that each Euro invested in satellite technology represents a high return on investment, the number of business opportunities is likely to increase in the coming years. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies Among the agencies working on the contribution theme related to Security & Defence, SatCen collaborates with EDA on different activities, among which the participation in Space Situational Awareness, and especially its defence components, as well as for maritime surveillance, geospatial information projects or joint studies. In 2015, SatCen collaborated with the EUISS for a study on space and security. Moreover, SatCen concluded a Service Level Agreement with Frontex on the provision of operational support to monitor coast and external border activity through satellite imagery in the context of the migration crisis.

It is responsible for the execution of the air traffic management Master Plan. Background Fragmentation and reliance on ageing technology leads the European ATM systems to inefficiencies of \u20ac4 billion annually 185 . The 2004 Single European Sky (SES) Initiative aims to increase the sustainability and performance of European aviation through safety improvement, capacity increase, reduction of environmental impact and aviation services cost reduction. The SESAR project, set up in the same year, is in charge of the technological element of this initiative. It is to define, develop and deploy innovative solutions to modernise and harmonise ATM systems throughout the Union. The SESAR JU was then established in 2007 as a public- private partnership gathering the EU and Eurocontrol, industry members, companies involved in ATM, universities, research centres and aviation and ATM experts to coordinate research and innovation efforts in the EU with a budget of \u20ac2.1 billion (2008- 2016). Its research and innovation activities continue under the new SESAR 2020 programme, with a budget of \u20ac1.6 billion (2016-2024), out of which \u20ac585 million come from the European Commission\u2019s Horizon 2020 research programme. Contribution to jobs, growth and investment The SESAR project pools experts and financial resources to overcome the cost inefficiencies of the European ATM system and thus tackle the looming problem of airports reaching their capacity limits. The SESAR solutions are paramount to avoid this upcoming challenge to hinder mobility, which is central to the European growth model, thereby contributing to Smart and Sustainable Growth in Europe. Moreover, boosting the competitiveness of aviation and ATM allows the economic development and job creation in a sector that employs 2 million citizens across the Union.

        "Contribution to a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy The environmental impact of aviation remains a salient issue as the number of flights is going to keep on increasing in the coming decades. The solutions developed by the SESAR JU are geared towards allowing up to 10% reduction in fuel burn and CO2 emissions. In that respect, the project contribute to the Union\u2019s commitment to ensure its transition towards a low-carbon society to protect and improve the quality of the environment 187 . \u201cAviation and ATM matter for the European economy, which is why the SESAR project is so important. There are 27,000 flights passing through Europe daily, representing 26 % of the world market. The sector directly employs 2 million European citizens and contributes EUR 110 billion to EU GDP. It ensures that remote areas of Europe can stay connected and benefit from industries such as tourism.\u201d 186 Violeta Bulc, Commissioner for Transport Contribution to a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base The SESAR JU delivers solutions which significantly increase the performance of the aviation and air traffic management system. For an average trip in Europe, this will soon result in improved safety by a factor of 4, 20 minutes shorter door-to- door travel time, 10kg in fuel savings per passenger and \u20ac15 in ticket savings. It thus considerably improves air travelling conditions for European consumers, facilitates their mobility and strengthens the internal market. Moreover, by offering performance-enhancing solutions to smaller airports, it contributes to territorial cohesion in the Union. The SESAR JU also participates in the development of a Digital Society in Europe through its actions in the field of cybersecurity and data protection. Cooperation with other agencies and bodies The SESAR JU works closely with other EU and European agencies and bodies: \u2022 EASA provides advice on safety deliverables derived from SESAR concepts and is increasingly involved in the regulatory aspect of SESAR activities; \u2022 EDA is involved in developing the military dimension of the SES\u2019s technological pillar, therefore collaborates closely with the SESAR JU; \u2022 ESA cooperates with the SESAR JU on further facilitating the development of satellite-based \u2022 communications for Europe\u2019s air transport system; \u2022 The Clean Sky 2 Research programme and the JU promote greener aviation through airborne flight management and trajectory and environmental modelling to demonstrate the improvements expected from the Clean Sky vehicle technology developments.

However, keeping them open with air traffic services is challenging given their management costs compared to the number of flights they manage. SESAR\u2019s RTS offer alternatives to places where conventional tower facilities and services are unavailable or too expensive to run. High-definition cameras and panoramic screens allow traffic controllers in remote workstations to provide air traffic and aeronautical flight information services in real time by providing a 360-degree view of a given airport. Sensors and controller tools enable them to ensure flights take off and land safely. Validation exercises in Germany, Norway and Sweden have proven the safety and cost-effectiveness of RTS for smaller airports. In 2014, the world\u2019s first RTS in Sundsvall, Sweden, started serving the \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik airport over 150 km away. SESAR thus contributed to a major sh ift in ai r tr affic co ntrol to reinforce territorial cohesion. 186. \u201cSESAR: From Vision to Reality\u201d, p.2. 187.

Background In 2011, the European Commission published a White Paper entitled \u201cRoadmap to a Single European Transport Area \u2013 Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system\u201d that sets out key objectives for railway transport of passengers and freight. The purpose is to address the societal issues of \u201crising traffic demand, congestion, security of energy supply and climate change\u201d 189 by achieving a modal shift from roads towards more sustainable modes of transport such as rail. A crucial initiative within this policy is the creation of a Single European Railway Area that will complete the European single market for rail by removing the remaining administrative, technical and regulatory obstacles in terms of safety, market opening and interoperability. Moreover, Horizon 2020 framework seeks to enhance the competitiveness and attractiveness of the railway sector, to create a single market for rail and to sustain the European rail industry\u2019s position on the global market. Those three objectives can only be achieved through investment in new innovative services, products and service models. In this respect, the S2R JU was established in 2014 as a public-private partnership in order to increase the investment in research and innovation and defragment it. It functions as a platform bringing together different stakeholders from the railway sector (e.g. rail equipment manufacturers, infrastructure managers, railway undertakings) for them to collaborate, coordinate innovation efforts and exchange expertise. Contribution to smart and sustainable growth The S2R\u2019s objectives of achieving a Single European Railway Area, enhancing the attractiveness and competitiveness of the European railway system to create a modal shift and consolidating the European rail industry global leadership are measured against the following key performance indicators: \u2022 double railway capacity, \u2022 increasing reliability and punctuality by as much as 50% and \u2022 halving the life-cycle cost of railway.

Background The so-called \u201cFive Presidents\u2019 Report\u201d 191 presents a two-stage roadmap towards the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in order to create a better and fairer life for citizens as well as increase competitiveness within the euro area. The first stage comprises among others the completion of the Financial Union, which encompasses the completion of the Banking Union (BU) and the settlement of a Capital Markets Union (CMU). The BU comprises three pillars which are based on a single set of prudential rules: the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS). The SRB was created in 2015 as the decision body of the SRM in order to establish and enforce an effective resolution regime of failing banking institutions, and hence avoid future bank bailouts The Board is responsible for preparing resolution plans for around 140 of the most significant European banks. Contribution to an efficient functioning of the internal market SRB\u2019s activity of developing resolution planning is proactive and forward-looking. It aims at enhancing financial stability and therefore at a better functioning of the internal market: in case a BU - Bank is failing or likely to fail, the SRB, in close cooperation with its partners, would apply its resolution via a specific scheme. Moreover, the SRB is managing the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), a fund which is financed by the banking sector and which would be used for the application of resolution tools as a last resort in case a credit institution is being restructured. The role of the SRF is to avoid that the costs of bank failures are borne by taxpayers, but are covered by the industry. The SRF thus helps addressing the issue of moral hazard in finance. Contribution to the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union As presented in the Five Presidents\u2019 Report, the completion of the Banking Union is a step towards the deepening of the EMU. The SRB, as the core body of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), i.e. the second pillar of the Banking Union, therefore contributes to the achievement of a deeper EMU. Moreover, the SRB will support the elaboration of the third pillar of the BU, i.e. the EDIS.

        "\u201cThe Single Resolution Board (SRB) is, together with the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), one of the corner stones of the Banking Union (BU), tasked with writing and enlivening a new vocabulary in banking supervision and resolution within the euro area.\u201d 190 Elke K\u00f6nig, SRB Chair Cooperation with other agencies and bodies The SRB is the resolution authority of the Banking Union, at the centre of the SRM. It collaborates with the National Resolution Authorities of the euro area Member States, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Furthermore, it has been collaborating with the EBA since its creation in order to leverage on its experience of resolution planning in the EU. The EBA has been participating to working groups and various committees.
