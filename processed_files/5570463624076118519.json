        "I (Resolutions, recommendations and opinions) OPINIONS COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS 124TH PLENARY SESSION, 12-13 JULY 2017 Opinion of the European Committee of the Regions \u2014 Local and Regional Dimension of the Horizon 2020 Programme and the New Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2017/C 342/01) Rapporteur: Christophe Clergeau (FR/PES), Member of the Pays-de-la-Loire Regional Council POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS (CoR) A) EUROPEAN RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (R&I): AN AMBITION THAT NEEDS TO BE STEPPED UP BEYOND THE FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME Reaffirming the position of the framework programme in implementing the European Research Area and the Europe 2020 objectives 1. welcomes the great success of European research policy as implemented through the successive framework programmes up to Horizon 2020 (H2020), the largest integrated research programme in the world, based on scientific excellence and the acceleration of innovation; 2. notes that H2020 is the main support tool for developing research and innovation in Europe within the overarching Europe 2020 strategy and for implementing the European Research Area (ERA); 3. reaffirms the relevance of the Europe 2020 strategy , which proposes a consolidated \u2018knowledge triangle\u2019 approach (research \u2014 education \u2014 innovation), with the change in the learning approach and the goal of raising the level of training for all remaining essential, and promoting university-business cooperation; also recommends seeking greater coordination and complementarity with the Erasmus+ and Interreg programmes, including Interreg Europe, which is devoted to interregional cooperation; emphasises that the implementation of the ERA must be pursued and requires that a number of goals be met, of which scientific excellence is a vital and indispensable, but not exclusive, strand; 4. underlines the continued relevance of the ERA objectives and the benefit of still seeking to achieve them, particularly in respect of transnational cooperation, knowledge mobility, a single labour market for researchers and innovators, gender equality, and access to information and science; 5. suggests, in order to develop support for the project to build a knowledge society in Europe, that European talent be identified and researchers\u2019 careers monitored; European pathways for researchers should be established, enabling them to access programmes to support their research career in periods of transition; the involvement of researchers in the business environment should be promoted; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/1 ",
        "6. refuses to limit the budget debate solely to the framework programme: depending on the valuation method, the share of cohesion policy devoted to research and innovation varies between EUR 43 and EUR 110 billion, not including the major contributions from other sectoral policies and the Juncker Plan; For a return to innovation and research as a budgetary and policy priority 7. calls for a return to innovation and research as one of the top priorities in the debate on the future of Europe and the priorities set out in the Rome Declaration ( 1 ), for the horizontal governance of research, innovation and training issues within the EU to be strengthened, and for the EU\u2019s overall fiscal effort in the area of R&I to be stepped up across each of these policies, within the current and the next MFF. In this overall context, and in line with the European Parliament\u2019s draft report ( 2 ) and the report of the independent High Level Group on maximising the impact of EU Research and Innovation Programmes (Lamy Report) ( 3 ), the budget for the framework programme should be considerably increased to at least maintain the growth momentum of the current framework programme ( 4 ). In any event, the necessary promotion of R&I must not undermine the importance of cohesion policy, which remains the EU\u2019s key financing tool for achieving economic and social cohesion and convergence between its cities and regions. The full potential of cohesion and R & D policy measures will need to be harnessed and combined in order to boost regional development; 8. calls for a new collective ambition that focuses not only on scientific excellence in Europe but also on scientific excellence and the innovation capacity of Europe as a whole, by tapping into the full potential of all its cities and regions, helping to strengthen their capacities and promoting open and collaborative innovation; 9. believes such an ambition is particularly necessary in the context of a globalisation process whose effects are not yet contained, above all at local and regional level, and where research and innovation can offer resilience, high added value and long-term competitiveness; 10. aims to promote a holistic approach to European, national and regional funding without which this ambition and the debate on the EU budget would be meaningless; points out the importance of the target of spending 3 % of GDP on public and private R&I that was set for all Member States by the Europe 2020 strategy, which has been stagnating at 2,03 % since 2015 and undermined, among other things, by the decrease in appropriations in many Member States; to that end, considers it essential to continue strengthening R&I systems, taking account of the circumstances in each country and region, by improving the coordination of policies at European level and promoting the necessary reforms at national and regional level, including through the European Semester and the smart specialisation strategies; Clarifying the debate on synergies with other EU policies 11. considers it necessary to clarify the debate on synergies and proposes five operational principles that could be shared between the EU, the Member States, the regions and cities: \u2014 coherence principle: sharing governance and the choice of major objectives, strategies and flagship projects; \u2014 compatibility principle: making it possible to pool and streamline resources simply and effectively by addressing the issue of State aid; \u2014 complementarity principle: ensuring a clear distribution of roles and good continuity of action when funding different strands of projects, and ensuring they receive support both upstream (capacity-building, etc.) and downstream (making use of research results, marketing, etc.); C 342/2 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 1 ) Declaration of the leaders of 27 Member States and of the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission (25 March 2017) http://www.consilium.europa.eu/press-releases-pdf/2017/3/47244656633_en.pdf ( 2 ) Draft report of the European Parliament on the assessment of Horizon 2020 implementation in view of its interim evaluation and the Framework Programme 9 proposal (2016/2147(INI)) ( 3 ) Report of the independent High Level Group on maximising the impact of the EU Research and Innovation Programmes: \u2018Investing in the European future we want\u2019 https://ec.europa.eu/research/evaluations/pdf/archive/other_reports_studies_and_documents/ hlg_2017_report.pdf#view=fit&pagemode=none ( 4 ) \u2018At a minimum, the budget should maintain the average annual growth rate of Horizon 2020, taking the budget foreseen for the programme\u2019s final year as a starting point.

        "\u2014 co-construction principle: establishing a coherent approach based on the idea that financing together means designing together and managing together; \u2014 ecosystems principle: recognising the role of local collective initiatives; B) REVAMPING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME WHILE RETAINING ITS STRUCTURE An open, collaborative programme for the benefit of all 12. points out that the European added value of the framework programme is primarily based on its collective and collaborative dimension and on its contribution to creating a network of researchers and innovation ecosystems. This dimension should continue to take precedence over support for individual projects; 13. is concerned about the decline in the average success rate of the calls for proposals, which is lower than for the previous framework programme and seriously impedes its dissemination in cities and regions. The competition necessary in a drive for excellence should not lead to exclusion and excessive concentration; 14. believes it is vital to maintain the openness of the framework programme in order to ensure its availability right across Europe and its regions, as well as to its citizens; calls for greater innovation in the framework programme\u2019s tools in order to combine excellence, inclusion and participation; 15. notes the importance of maintaining a balance between basic research and research closer to the market, but also between free research and research as a response to questions raised by society and economic operators, in order to target both incremental innovation as well as disruptive innovation, as both are capable of creating new business opportunities and jobs; 16. notes the primacy currently afforded to projects with high technology readiness levels (TRL), which prioritises incremental innovation by encouraging researchers to focus on mature ideas that can be brought to the market within a short time span; at the same time, argues that support for projects at lower TRLs is also important for bringing more innovation to the market; stresses the importance of disruptive innovations that are based on lower TRLs and enable new products and services to be released on the market quickly. In any event, helping SMEs access the market and creating sustainable jobs should be key priorities of innovation policy. This should be the role of a European Innovation Council; 17. calls for better account to be taken of all forms of excellence and innovation, and points out that non-technological innovation and social innovation create a need for new knowledge that can configure new areas of excellence; 18. calls for full recognition of social innovation, which means novel ideas (products, services and models) that make it possible to meet societal needs in the broad sense of the term; 19. emphasises that research and innovation is not targeted exclusively at companies but also concerns public policies, health, culture and community life, as well as the social economy and new economic models, which contribute to the creation of new partnerships, new activities and new social relationships. Therefore, the exploitation of innovation output should focus not only on the concept of a product with an economic value on the market but also on the concept of a service with a social value for citizens; A new approach to excellence 20. highlights that the term excellence is used to refer to very different realities; suggests distinguishing between the following challenges which the framework programme must help address: \u2014 scientific excellence, based on the principle of collaboration followed by that of competition; \u2014 the excellence of scientific and innovation projects, characterised by their impact and their contribution to knowledge transfer; \u2014 the excellence of innovation ecosystems and joint efforts between different operators; \u2014 the excellence of Europe as a whole and its overall capacity for innovation; A new approach to the impact of projects 21. when assessing the impact of projects, both in the ex-ante phase in the case of proposals and the ex-post phase in the case of approved projects, suggests taking the following into consideration: 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/3 ",
        "\u2014 the scientific impact, predominantly measured by citations; \u2014 the impact through the dissemination and ownership of the project results; \u2014 the impact through open and collaborative innovation and the development of new products and services, particularly by SMEs; \u2014 the impact on regional innovation ecosystems and their three pillars (research \u2014 education \u2014 innovation), and on cities and regions and their inhabitants, in particular on employment and well-being; A new approach to the position of cities and regions within the framework programme 22. suggests, in order to help promote excellence in all its forms, that cities and regions be given a greater role in the future framework programme : \u2014 partners for the overall governance of R&I policy in Europe and for the framework programme; \u2014 at the heart of the European excellence networks of hubs and innovation ecosystems; \u2014 participants in projects with facilitated involvement; \u2014 main actors involved in innovating, exploiting and disseminating the results of H2020; \u2014 leading role in the ongoing dialogue between science and society. Transforming societal challenges to enhance their relevance and impact 23. calls for the introduction of two new societal challenges to develop excellent scientific output on major challenges for the future of European societies: \u2014 tackling the challenges of the European skills agenda: life-long learning within the European social and performance- based model; \u2014 the territorial dynamic of value creation, innovation and employment, social links and sustainable development, including in connection with the demographic challenges facing the regions of the European Union; 24. calls for interdisciplinarity, the human and social sciences, and risk-taking to be given more emphasis in the context of societal challenges, in order to catalyse new ideas and solutions, particularly through the introduction of undefined calls for projects; 25. encourages the adoption of a new, complementary approach based on missions, in order to carry out exploratory work and large-scale projects, as well as on cross-cutting focuses, using the model of smart cities, environmental questions, or maritime and marine research questions; to this end, reiterates the Committee\u2019s call for a target to be set, in the next framework programme, for 10 % of projects to have a significant impact on marine and maritime research ( 5 ); For means of participation that encourage a greater diversity of projects 26. is surprised that many opportunities existing under the current rules are not sufficiently tapped and suggests several areas for improvement: \u2014 wider, more open calls for proposals that allow new approaches to be put forward; \u2014 greater interdisciplinarity when drafting calls for proposals in order to draw on the entire body of knowledge available, technological or otherwise; \u2014 greater inclusion of the human and social sciences, which is currently lacking; \u2014 greater bottom-up support for networks and initiatives; \u2014 more clarity and accountability at all stages of the evaluation and selection of projects and allocation of funding, and in feedback, so that projects can be adjusted with a view to the next application succeeding; C 342/4 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 5 ) Opinion of the European Committee of the Regions, A new stage in the European policy on blue growth (CDR 6622/2016) ",
        "\u2014 an incentive to include more new entrants in the calls for proposals aimed at first-time participants; \u2014 increased and consistent use of \u2018cascade funding\u2019, which is a method of reaching people who are not well aware of the framework programme; \u2014 introduction of simplified procedures aimed at cutting unnecessary red tape for end users; 27. calls on the Commission to present those elements of its assessment that justify the high level of funding for large enterprises under Horizon 2020 given that their R & D expenditure has increased only slightly, and consequently to propose changes for the next framework programme; 28. insists on the need to fund research activities with grants; deplores the trend towards replacing grants with loans but acknowledges that projects with high levels of technological maturity that are close to market activities should be able to avail of such loans, among other tools; 29. considers that the development of financial instruments to support the objectives of the framework programme is justified only if they can be used, in partnership with financial institutions, to hedge against high risks where there is market failure, based for example on the InnovFin model; regrets the current limited use of the Juncker Plan to protect against this type of risk; 30. draws attention to the need to improve the financing of innovation projects for SMEs, with the focus on Industry 4.0 programmes as a better way of structuring the EU industrial fabric, while also creating domestic demand for technology that promotes European development; C) A FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME SUPPORTING R&I ROOTED IN ALL CITIES AND REGIONS Promoting an excellence-based approach that is firmly rooted in the cities and regions 31. notes that scientific excellence is embedded in innovation hubs and ecosystems. The majority of entities benefiting from Horizon 2020 (universities, research bodies, SMEs, civil society organisations) are solidly rooted in their cities and regions, whose assets contribute to the quality of science. This fact must be fully reflected in the framework programme; 32. points out that the territorial dimension must be taken into account as a matter of course when any policy is being framed, because smart specialisation strategies (RIS3) provide resources for science stakeholders and businesses, and create value for cities and regions, as well as for citizens; 33. points out that RIS3s have been adopted and developed by regions as a way of structuring investment in research and innovation to further economic growth, in tandem with other regions, and that coordinating regional and European investment on structural projects in relation to smart specialisation increases the impact of the framework programme and avoids financing projects that are not relevant to local circumstances; 34. emphasises that the framework programme must help to strengthen R&I capacity in cities and regions so that they are helped to climb the \u2018stairway to excellence\u2019, e.g. in smart specialisation, and to promote the ability of all regions to take part in H2020 by contributing high-quality projects; 35. notes the importance of cities as innovation hubs that play a key role in producing excellence; also notes that if science is too concentrated in innovation hubs, this may undermine the search for spillover effects on the economy and society, and points to the need to develop pockets of excellence away from the main centres; points to the crucial role played by regional policy in this area; Forming a new alliance between EU research policy and the cities and regions 36. advocates a new partnership for R&I excellence in Europe \u2014 between the EU, the Member States, cities and regions \u2014 based on enhanced multilevel governance, compliance with the subsidiarity principle, a shared open innovation culture and development of grassroots initiatives in a bottom-up approach; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/5 ",
        "37. would like the framework programme to do more to strengthen regional innovation hubs and ecosystems, with more support for technology transfer networks, and for a new \u2018territorial connections\u2019 action to be set up to recognise and fund regional excellence networks through the framework programme, along the lines of the Vanguard Initiative; 38. calls for pioneering regions to form European consortia with a view to creating ground-breaking innovations throughout Europe. Identifying opportunities for collaboration, mapping parts of the value chain, and identifying key stakeholders and capabilities through smart specialisation are key steps in the process of creating EU added value; Bridging the innovation gap between regions and between Member States 39. is disappointed that halfway through its term, Horizon 2020 is undermined by low participation among the EU-13 countries ( 6 ) , and points to the differences in participation at regional and local level . It is important to make the framework programme \u2014 and not just cohesion policy \u2014 work across all the Union\u2019s cities and regions so as to support the best pioneers of excellence and ensure their access to European collaborative efforts; 40. would like the Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation in Horizon 2020 programme to be continued and broadened accordingly, and calls for a special approach in the case of regions in countries that are not eligible for the programme whose R&I is very underdeveloped, which means most of the outermost regions, without losing sight of excellence as a fundamental criterion; highlights the low share of H2020 resources mobilised for this programme (1 %), notes the absence of any significant change in access to the framework programme, and is surprised that the countries that are the major beneficiaries of H2020 are also the main beneficiaries of the Spreading Excellence programme; believes that this undermines the legitimacy of the framework programme, and calls for new initiatives; 41. recommends an integrated approach to the \u2018stairway to excellence\u2019, based on a coordination plan for each country and region so that action is taken on the necessary reforms, building centres of excellence that are open to all, combating the brain drain and participating fully in European research networks. This coordination plan would be co-financed through regional, national and European funding, including Horizon 2020 resources and the European Structural and Investment Funds; 42. to this end, suggests that access to EU cooperation be stepped up: \u2014 by boosting support for research and technological development infrastructure, and by creating more ERA Chairs to attract promising researchers and leading scientists; \u2014 by strengthening incentives to accept new participants in projects submitted and opening up selected projects to new, complementary stakeholders; \u2014 by increasing support to SMEs for the creation of RDI units and the recruitment of technology professionals and researchers by them; \u2014 by increasing the support for the creation of internal structures by SMEs that enable them to participate in research and/ or innovation networks; D) SUPPORTING JOINT AND SHARED INSTRUMENTS TO PROMOTE SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE AND INNOVATION Networks of European stakeholders as sources of excellence and innovation 43. underlines that in accordance with EU values cooperation within networks should come before competition within the framework programme, and draws attention to the importance of such networks as sources of projects and of excellence; 44. in this connection, highlights the relevance of the Regions of Knowledge programme included in the 7th Framework Programme, which allowed for meaningful interaction with regional policy by helping to initiate long-term cooperation between local knowledge triangle players, involve the private sector (including SMEs) in framework programme projects, support transnational cooperation between innovative ecosystems and integrate local and regional players into the ERA; C 342/6 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 6 ) The main Member States benefiting from the Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation programme are: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia (more information on the programme here). ",
        "45. calls for an ambitious policy to develop cooperation networks: \u2014 between researchers, teams or laboratories, and between research infrastructures in order to frame research questions and propose calls for projects and projects; \u2014 between hubs, pilot projects and demonstrators; \u2014 between a wide variety of stakeholders, including cities and regions, and regional innovation hubs and ecosystems, in relation to RIS3; 46. points to the considerable potential for supporting these initiatives under Horizon 2020, and has concerns about their meagre resources and limited use; calls for coordination and support actions (CSAs) to be more intensively used, while encouraging better recognition of innovative initiatives implemented by cities and regions through the framework programme; also calls for support for interregional cooperation around the RIS3 to be strengthened, as part of both H2020 and cohesion policy; Expanding the co-construction of R&I programmes with the cities and regions 47. notes that involvement of cities and regions in implementing Horizon 2020 has increased since the programme was launched, with more and more partner regions for the joint programming tools such as ERA-NET schemes, Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Cofund actions, and public-private research and innovation partnerships such as the Clean Sky initiative; 48. is in favour of developing these co-constructed projects, and urges that the implementing rules be simplified and harmonised and that, for example, it be made easier for regions to take part in Joint Programming Initiatives (Article 185 TFEU), subject to the Member States\u2019 agreement; 49. calls for further simplification of the handling of aid; continuation and extension of the centralisation of subsidies and aid via a single information portal; programme information, procedures and the participant portal\u2019s aid management platform should be in all official EU languages, in order to facilitate participants\u2019 access; 50. supports the mechanisms for granting an EU \u2018top up\u2019 to the framework programme in order to support local excellence initiatives that mobilise substantial and diversified funding; 51. believes that experience with the smart specialisation strategies and their implementation offers very useful feedback for steering H2020 and the future framework programme, and for framing the work programmes setting out the areas eligible for financing; calls on the authorities involved in this work to do more to include the local level in this process, in order to improve consistency with grassroots challenges; 52. considers it crucial that the various challenges of the Horizon 2020 programme take into account the socioeconomic impact on regions, starting with the design, planning and identification of areas for programme funding, so that their choice contributes effectively to improving the quality of life in all European regions; 53. suggests that all the provisions of the framework programme be reassessed in the light of the subsidiarity and complementarity principles so as to strengthen coordination between the various stakeholders in terms not just of co- financing but also of a reassignment of roles, focusing the activities of the framework programme on areas offering European added value; 54. recommends transforming the \u2018seal of excellence\u2019 granted to the best unsuccessful applications under the SME instrument, so that this becomes a real partnership facility piloted jointly by the EU and the regions to coordinate their activities as effectively as possible before and after the submission of applications. This principle applies to the other measures covered by the seal of excellence, such as the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions and European Research Council grants, and any other projects that help create synergies; Enhancing spillover effects, innovation and knowledge dissemination in partnership with the cities and regions 55. highlights the role of local authorities as test beds and early adopters via public procurement; calls for relaxation of the regulatory framework for these activities and simplification of the system for supporting innovative public procurement, which is currently underutilised and whose rules are not well enough understood by contracting authorities; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/7 ",
        "56. reiterates the importance of a 360 o approach to innovation that is both incremental and disruptive, technological and non-technological, design- and user-led innovation, social innovation, and open and collaborative innovation; points out that locally established hubs and ecosystems are the main factors in innovation, transfer and value creation activities; calls on the Commission when setting up the European Innovation Council (EIC) to take into account the role played by local authorities in these matters and to involve them in future EIC tasks; 57. proposes introducing in the next framework programme a new structure for the SME instrument, whose programming and implementation conditions would involve local authorities upstream and downstream in order to gear it better to smart specialisation and local financing and to mitigate the discouragement effect associated with its very low success rate; 58. opposes any suggestion of transferring part of cohesion policy funding to measures under the framework programme in order to finance more projects automatically or to support these \u2018excellent rejects\u2019; wishes to defend the autonomy of regional authorities and to promote the proposed approach based on co-construction and the strengthening of complementarity and cooperation; 59. emphasises the need to consider spillover effects, and issues of dissemination and ownership of project results, from the moment projects are set up. The current impact of projects is limited in these respects, and EU and local programmes should therefore be developed specifically for these activities. Cities and regions should be more involved in using and disseminating the results of projects under the framework programme; 60. also supports the development of instruments designed to support the path of a proof of concept to the market, e.g. the Fast Track to Innovation pilot, or the organisation of new industrial sectors through the INNOSUP initiative and its cluster-facilitated projects for new industrial value chains, and would like these to be expanded; 61. a mix of support tools for clusters dedicated to groups of enterprises rather than to individual ones should be developed to enable cross-sector approaches and collaborative EU partnerships. Furthermore, the role that clusters can play as bridges between actors within regions and outside, as channels for business support to SMEs, should be reflected in EU policies; 62. calls on the Commission to assess the impact of the reforms introduced in 2013 to promote synergies between H2020 and the ESI Funds; 63. feels that there is not enough focus in the second pillar on emerging industries, and is concerned that inadequate support is being given to the networks of excellence of innovation hubs and ecosystems geared to industries of the future, such as the Vanguard Initiative. The persistent difficulty of financing industrial pilot projects and large-scale demonstrators is worrying, and the European Commission is urged to boost funding and consider new actions in this area without delay; 64. suggests creating a programme to support demonstration infrastructure in order to promote the networking of testing sites, demonstrators and pilot projects, based on the model for networking research infrastructure; Developing the relationship between science and society in cooperation with the cities and regions 65. notes that, with the concept of progress currently being challenged and debated, the relationship between science and society must be at the heart of the debate on the future of European R&I, whether this concerns the areas of research focus, the conditions for carrying out projects, or the choices made regarding the development of new social and technical applications of science; 66. thus advocates promoting trust in both science and progress, while developing a sustainable development approach; will therefore defend the precautionary principle, which is a principle of prudence whereby action is taken in full awareness of risk; 67. highlights the major challenge that open science currently represents, through open access to research findings and publications, the availability of information to the general public that is both reliable and from different sources, and the debate with the public and stakeholders; C 342/8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "68. considers that between open science and objective-driven science there should be a space for dialogue between scientific and economic players, as well as civil society, to discuss and formulate new scientific questions together, while at the same time respecting each other\u2019s independence; 69. stresses the urgent need to commend science, technology and all related professions, including those in industry, to young people and their families, with particular emphasis on encouraging women to embark on scientific and technological careers; 70. laments the lack of resources earmarked for the Science with and for society programme, its fragmentary nature and consequently limited impact, and calls for priority to be given to actions with European added value and with real cooperation between stakeholders, Member States, cities and regions; International dimension of the framework programme 71. defends the principle of open science but wishes to preserve the specific nature of the framework programme, including in the context of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU; hopes that this withdrawal does not lead to a decrease in funding for the framework programme, while understanding that the issue will be dealt with as part of the comprehensive negotiations with the United Kingdom; 72. calls for a strengthening of international cooperation under the framework programme, including with associate partners and emerging countries, but also as part of neighbourhood policy or sea-basin strategies such as the one for the Mediterranean.

GENERAL COMMENTS 1. welcomes the European Commission\u2019s approach of involving the European Committee of the Regions in the foresight exercise for the CAP after 2020; observes that agriculture, food and rural areas are facing major challenges which make carrying out a reform of the CAP necessary; 2. stresses that the CAP has played and must continue to play a fundamental role in European integration; the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union remain valid as part of the review process which we are facing; 3. notes that the agricultural sector is the second biggest industrial employment sector in the EU employing 22 million farmers and 44 million people in the rest of the agri-food chain and providing more than 500 million Europeans with the highest quality food supply at affordable prices. The impact that agriculture has on jobs is even greater if we include the production, repair and marketing of agricultural machinery and the production and marketing of farm inputs; 4. argues that the CAP should be turned into an agricultural policy that is fair, sustainable, high-quality and based on solidarity for the benefit of farmers, regions, consumers and members of the public; considers that only a strong and common European agricultural and food policy can guarantee food security at European level and ensure that rural areas are dynamic; 5. notes that arable and livestock farmers are the key players in and the main recipients of the CAP. Without their support it is not possible to implement the measures by which we seek to achieve the desired outcomes. The CAP must take into account their role and their commitment, and in particular the need for agricultural and livestock farms to be economically sustainable in order to ensure decent living conditions, while also maintaining a vibrant rural environment with an adequate level of employment; 6. believes that the future design of the CAP should take European consumers into consideration. Informing the public of the benefits of the CAP, ensuring food security and guaranteeing environmental protection are challenges that European consumers should face together; 7. believes that, with a view to making farming attractive and ensuring safe and high quality European agriculture, regulated markets could ensure better pay for farmers by employing public and private management tools and measures which stabilise agricultural prices and prevent unfair trade practices; also believes that the position of farmers needs to be strengthened vis-\u00e0-vis other stakeholders in the sector; 8. recognises that the economic, social, environmental, regional and international legitimacy of the CAP is key to its survival. The European agricultural sector has some key qualities that form the basis of its competitiveness: innovativeness, robust logistics and infrastructure, considerable diversity, the significant natural, cultural and historical assets of agricultural areas, the large number of family-run farms, and a highly developed culture of entrepreneurship, as well as products that conform to strict environmental and health rules. All of these qualities offer potential that we need to make more use of, via a targeted CAP, in order to further strengthen agriculture and rural areas; 9. believes that the CAP urgently needs reform so as to be more in tune with public expectations and to legitimise its budget, which is much sought after in a context of static budgetary resources; 10. is convinced that the success of the CAP is founded on unity, and that there must be no shift away from this towards renationalisation in the future, while also hoping that the regions will be strengthened in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity. In retaining its character as a common policy, the CAP must be flexible in order to take account of the different circumstances in agriculture, particularly those of the Mediterranean and outermost regions; C 342/10 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "11. draws the European Commission\u2019s attention to the growing interest among consumers in locally produced, high- quality and fair priced food that meets animal protection standards and has a high environmental and social value, as well as creating jobs and added value; this is also evident from the increase in demand; 12. believes that the traceability of modes of food production, which is a safety guarantee for consumers and producers, must be enhanced and sustained; 13. notes farming\u2019s lack of economic appeal as a career in many areas of production and subsectors, which exacerbates the problem of an age pyramid that is very unconducive to generational renewal ( 1 ); the fact that few young people are taking up farming represents a threat to the continuation of European family-based agriculture and the vitality of rural areas; believes that measures should be introduced to support the entry of young farmers into the sector; 14. notes that the CAP, despite having a significant budget, is associated with a considerable decrease in agricultural employment (the number of farms in the EU fell by 20 % between 2007 and 2013); notes that the CAP budget has fallen in percentage terms over the last 30 years, from 75 % to 40 % of the EU\u2019s budget; 15. stresses that agricultural production should be promoted by the CAP, as provided for by the Treaty, by giving farmers the means to generate their income essentially from the market, at a reasonable and justified cost for European citizens and consumers; points out that numerous studies have demonstrated that the CAP has contributed to the concentration of agricultural production in certain regions at the expense of others, undermining the EU\u2019s territorial cohesion goals; 16. believes that the CAP must reflect the various agricultural and climate-related circumstances in Europe, especially those of less-favoured areas, such as grassland hilltops, mountain regions, the Mediterranean, north polar regions and outermost regions. The CAP must take account of their functions in safeguarding the land and protecting the soil, and in providing support for maintaining rural communities and their cultural values as well as their role in maintaining an active social system in these regions; 17. recalls that, despite warnings by the European Court of Auditors, the distribution of public support among farms and Member States remains very unequal; notes that the allocation of direct payments on the basis of surface area has resulted in farmland and direct payments becoming heavily concentrated; the latter should take greater account of the range of farming models, levels of income, added value produced and jobs provided and should ensure that farming is maintained in all regions; 18. notes that a great many farmers have a very low income that is below the poverty threshold, and that this contradicts the Treaty of Rome\u2019s aim of ensuring \u2018a fair standard of living for the agricultural community\u2019 (Article 39) and that it is necessary to make farming incomes more secure (prices, direct aid); 19. considers that CAP subsidies should only be provided to producers who are actually engaged in agricultural activity, and not to inactive farms that only generate a negligible agricultural income; 20. notes that, too often, farmers are forced to sell their products at prices that are below their production costs, leading to a spiralling reduction in costs and prices; 21. supports the conclusions of the EC Agricultural Markets Task Force of November 2016 and calls on the European Commission to propose a legislative proposal to fight unfair trade practices; 22. notes that the export of EU genetic resources, and animal breeds in particular, is contributing to the genetic erosion of important indigenous breeds, particularly in third countries, and contradicts UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 on preserving biodiversity, in particular genetic resources with food security implications; 23. believes that, as demonstrated by the CoR study on the Market Responsibility Programme in the dairy sector, market regulation is for many sectors more effective and less costly than the retroactive triggering of crisis measures and would therefore enable the CAP budget to be put to better use; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/11 ( 1 ) Opinion of the European Committee of the Regions on Supporting young European farmers (OJ C 207, 30.6.2017, p. 57).

        "24. considers that income insurance schemes could benefit insurance providers rather than farmers and prove expensive for taxpayers in the event that prices fell sharply, without addressing price volatility. A study should be carried out and an assessment made of the insurance regime introduced in the United States; the specific case of outermost regions, which are subject to particular market conditions, should be examined; 25. considers that there is a need for a clear and stable legislative framework which guarantees arable and livestock farmers the legal certainty they need to be able to make economic decisions in the medium and long term; 26. stresses that the EU, which is now the world\u2019s largest importer and exporter of food, has increased its dependence on third countries and developed a trade policy that contradicts its aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions; 27. notes that an increasing proportion of those agricultural products that were previously produced in Europe are now imported from countries with low labour costs, which puts EU food products at a substantial competitive disadvantage in terms of price; 28. notes also the positive aspects of EU exports for the economy, in terms of agricultural and food products with high added value, which create income and employment in the European agriculture and agri-food sector; 29. notes that cooperatives and producer organisations and the integration of producers in certain forms may play a key role in the agri-food sectors, allowing the farmers to concentrate supply, reduce costs, provide a number of services and strengthen their position in the food chain; 30. notes that EU exports of surpluses (milk powder, chicken, tomato pur\u00e9e, etc.) at prices below the cost of production in Europe and in Africa reduce the productive capacity of African countries and encourage rural populations to emigrate, contrary to the EU\u2019s commitment to take account of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 in its \u2018policy coherence for development\u2019; also observes that the European Union is the biggest importer of foodstuffs from developing countries, creating jobs in the agri-food sector in these countries; notes however that European imports (fruit, vegetables, lamb, etc.) at prices below the cost of production in Europe reduce productive capacity in the EU and may entail food security risks; 31. notes that agricultural prices in Europe are increasingly linked to the price of the lowest bidder on the world market and that European farmers are therefore subjected to greater competition, despite the fact that they must comply with more stringent environmental and health standards; 32. stresses that the added value of agricultural production has been largely extracted upstream and downstream, with the position of agricultural producers vis-\u00e0-vis agro-industry and distribution being in many cases too weak; improved coordination along the chain between the agricultural sector, the agri-food industry and the commercial sector must lead to improved distribution of profit margins; 33. notes that rural areas are falling behind urban areas and that this gap is all the more worrying as it is still growing, partly because the development of big cities and capitals is picking up pace ( 2 ); 34. regrets the accelerated loss of biodiversity on farmland and in the wild, which threatens the resilience of our agricultural systems and natural areas; 35. is concerned that erosion and soil degradation due to unsustainable farming practices put the fertility of the soil at risk, and that the increasing encroachment of urban areas onto farmland takes up the space that is needed to maintain food security in Europe; 36. takes note of the agricultural pollution of certain water tables and rivers, as well as the occasional overuse of these waters for irrigation purposes; 37. stresses that global warming is already having a significant agricultural impact, which makes it all the more urgent to redirect production methods; C 342/12 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 2 ) \u2018Investment for jobs and growth.

        "38. highlights the need to invest in digital innovation which can have a positive impact on issues such as sustainability, food safety, resource efficiency, waste reduction and short supply chains, etc.; at the same time, points out that the economic and social effects of such developments with regard to family farming must be carefully studied; and is concerned about the potential use of big data by private companies, which may result in farms being placed under technical and financial supervision; 39. notes that the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union is likely to lead to a reduction in resources for the CAP as well as a loss of EU markets in the UK; calls on the United Kingdom and the EU to maintain close trade cooperation in the sphere of agriculture and food; 40. points out that the share of the EU budget devoted to agriculture \u2014 despite being only 0,7 % of European GDP in 2014 \u2014 is just enough to build a genuine common European policy that is of strategic importance for food security, but that, where rural development and the second pillar are concerned, the resources are not enough in some spheres, and the CAP\u2019s new objectives should therefore be taken into account in the future budget; 41. rejects the idea of co-financing for the first pillar of the CAP, which would undermine the position of the CAP as the sole integrated EU policy, effectively renationalising it, and would put at a disadvantage farmers in the poorest EU countries who are the most dependent on EU funding; 42. notes that the cost to public health of certain diets that cause obesity, diabetes, etc., and certain agricultural practices (overuse of antibiotics in some livestock farms, cocktails of pesticides, etc.) is much higher than the CAP budget; points out that closer coordination of agricultural and food policy is needed; 43. recommends raising awareness about and encouraging the consumption of foods which are part of a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, through specific programmes that support wine, fruits and vegetables, and apiculture, while also improving the quality and added value of these products; 44. bears in mind the specific features of the outermost regions; given that transposing the European farming model to these regions would not work, Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) expressly allows the Council to adopt specific provisions for adapting EU legislation, including the CAP, to the outermost regions\u2019 circumstances. Here, the post-2020 CAP should retain the differentiated treatment for the outermost regions, by means of necessary adjustments to the EAFRD, POSEI, state aid and other instruments that may be introduced; II. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 45. proposes that the future European agriculture policy after 2020 should be structured around the following objectives, which are widely shared: a) continuing to be viewed as a key policy for the European project; b) pursuing the objectives set out in the TFEU and being endowed with an adequate financial package; c) developing sustainable and prosperous agriculture anchored in the diversity of rural areas; d) guaranteeing the food security of the European population at fair prices; e) providing a healthy, nutritious, varied and high-quality diet, promoting the development and consolidation of local chains and paying particular attention to social solidarity and to measures preventing food waste; f) applying the principles of the circular economy and the bioeconomy to permit economically profitable activity in rural areas; g) stabilising markets and strengthening the position of farmers on the markets; h) ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers, in particular through a fair and sufficiently stable income; i) guaranteeing the renewal of the largest possible number of farms, which underpin the dynamism of rural areas, and supporting young farmers in particular; j) guaranteeing access to funding, knowledge transfer, vocational training and fewer administrative obstacles; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/13 ",
        "k) not destabilising the agricultural economies of third countries; l) ensuring that all agricultural production methods are based on practices that take care of the health of both farmers and consumers, while also protecting agricultural genetic resources and the environment, including the aquatic environment, by enhancing biodiversity both in the wild and on farmland, and that uphold animal well-being and reduce global warming; m) maintaining and protecting agricultural soils over time in quantitative terms by resolutely tackling the soil consumption rate, and improving its quality, fertility and biodiversity by promoting appropriate agricultural practices; n) promoting products of designated origin (PDO, PGI) or other quality systems that would generate added value for the chain and the area, making it possible to keep local production systems alive and contribute to promoting rural identity and cultural and gastronomic heritage; o) distributing the public funds of the common agricultural and food policy (CAFP) more fairly among farms and Member States according to objective, non-discriminatory criteria, based on their ability to contribute to the EU\u2019s sustainable development objectives, (including accelerating the equalisation of direct payments across the Member States); p) applying the proportionality principle to the monitoring system to which farmers are subject; q) strengthening the second pillar of the CAP, which aims to improve living conditions in rural areas and to improve the competitiveness of rural areas as a whole; r) promoting economic, social and environmental development of all rural areas; s) addressing the challenge of depopulation and ageing across many rural areas as a consequence of the lack of living and working opportunities, especially for young people and women; 46. notes that the complexity of the CAP makes it difficult, or even risky, for individual entrepreneurs and farmers to apply for subsidies. and that simplification is necessary to ensure the continued acceptance and attractiveness of the CAP. The process should be simplified and accelerated, including by streamlining paperwork, for low-value transactions in particular; 47. hopes that the CAP budget will be kept at a sufficiently high level, consistent with the principles set out in the EU treaties and with its status as the only integrated EU policy, to meet the needs of European agriculture and of rural areas and communities and to respond to the demands made by society; 48. notes that many of the challenges mentioned above concerning climate, energy, food production and biodiversity can be tackled by the agricultural sector. However, it will be necessary to provide financial support for technical initiatives and innovative solutions, both entrepreneurial and cooperative, in order to speed up the transition; 49. draws attention to the need, regarding direct and area payments, to concentrate resources particularly on small and family-run farms, while for large farms affected by the capping of aid the priority should be financial solutions; 50. calls on the European Commission to carry out a detailed assessment of the results of the current CAP when it comes to applying the objectives assigned to it in the EU Treaties in terms of agricultural income and market stabilisation; 51. recommends tackling the volatility of agricultural prices, providing market-driven income opportunities for farmers and making food chains fairer ( 3 ); 52. calls, on the basis of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, for the treatment accorded to agriculture in the outermost regions under the POSEI scheme to be maintained, in accordance with the view expressed by the European Commission in its report to the European Parliament and the Council of 15 December 2016 (COM (2016) 797); C 342/14 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 3 ) Opinion of the European Committee of the Regions on Regulating price volatility of agricultural products (OJ C 185, 9.6.2017, p. 36).

        "53. calls for increased support for vineyards, olive groves and livestock farming on steep slopes or mountains, disadvantaged, low-yield areas and outermost regions, and for types of agricultural management that help to improve the biodiversity of mountain meadows and pastures; 54. calls on the EU to use its influence as the world\u2019s largest food importer and exporter to change the international agricultural trade rules introduced in 1994 (WTO) so as to encourage greater fairness and solidarity in trade relations; notes that volatility is a challenge for European agriculture and urges the European Commission to consider measures to mitigate risks arising from increased exposure to the world market; 55. thinks that an approach in which agricultural revenue is based more on the market than on subsidies can bolster the economic recognition of the job of farming, making it more attractive; to this end advises the EU to regulate its agricultural markets so as to prevent surpluses and shortfalls and stabilise agricultural prices at satisfactory levels; 56. proposes that an annual precautionary savings fund be introduced, to be carried over to the following year if it is not spent in its entirety ( 4 ); 57. calls on the Commission to guarantee fair conditions in bilateral trade agreements and partnerships entered into with third countries; to this end, views the duty to stop exporting agricultural and food products at prices below the average production costs in Europe as a result of public aid as being connected to the right to protect the EU from cheap imports that frustrate its production capacity or do not meet European production standards; 58. underlines the importance of short regional and local chains, both because they are more environmentally sustainable as they generate less pollution from transport, and because they promote farming that showcases local quality, tradition and economic and cultural heritage; 59. calls on the EU to revamp the agriculture sections of bilateral \u2018free\u2019 trade agreements and economic \u2018partnerships\u2019 with third countries. These agreements should have adequate resources and priority should be given to labour-intensive family farms, with a focus above all on local and regional markets and short supply chains; also calls on the EU to properly reflect the interests of its agriculture sector in trade agreements, in order to minimise the threats for European production, by identifying a strategic list of products which may be vulnerable to excessive pressure; requests that such products which may be sensitive to liberalisation are given appropriate special and differential treatment in trade agreements; 60. suggests that a review should take place of EU competition law so as to allow all stakeholders in a given sector, including consumers and public authorities, to decide on a fair distribution of the added value and profit margins along the value chain and to allow farmers to move towards a fairer position in the food chain and to strengthen their position on the market; 61. calls for a review of EU law on awarding public contracts in the mass catering sector, incorporating a locality clause for food supply; also calls for a greater exchange of good practices between local and regional authorities, with a view to promoting local food supply, a local market for organic farming products, and small-scale processing that provides rural jobs; 62. calls for research funded by the EU budget and the EIB on agricultural and rural cooperation to be geared in particular towards the following aims: a) the sustainable efficiency of production processes and farms; b) high-quality and environmentally-friendly production methods; agroecology; c) restoring degraded agricultural soil fertility and biodiversity; d) social innovation in rural areas: local public services for agricultural production methods, small-scale processing and local distribution of agricultural products; e) technical innovations that increase the autonomy and resilience of farms; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/15 ( 4 ) CoR Opinion (OJ C 185, 9.6.2017, p. 36).

        "f) sustainable forest management; g) farming practices aimed at combating climate change; h) animal welfare and sustainable solutions for plant and animal diseases; i) technological applications for on-the-spot-checks aimed at simplifying methodologies and making them more effective; 63. calls for a switch from a direct payments per hectare approach to one based on direct payments per hectare capped and modulated per agricultural worker \u2014 understood as an active farmer \u2014 in order to: a) maintain and develop agriculture in agro-climatically disadvantaged areas, including mountain areas, which have higher production costs or have a geographical disadvantage, such as the outermost regions; b) support small family farms often with a production volume too low to secure a sufficient income from farming, but which play an important role in revitalising rural areas, emphasising that greater support for the first hectares is crucial to small farms, especially in mountain areas; c) support the setting-up of young farmers; d) in all regions, support the gradual transition towards production methods that are: more resilient, more autonomous, lower-input, free from chemical pesticides and that protect health; and which: reduce global warming, promote biodiversity, improve water quality and respect animal welfare; e) reinforce the development of organic farming; f) boost agriculture in areas with high environmental value; g) support utilisation of indigenous breeds and varieties to support high added value artisan and specialist food products; h) support the development of high-quality regional chains with high added value; 64. calls, as part of greening, for environmental measures and aid for environment- and climate-friendly practices to be gradually reinforced by means of: a) crop rotation, including of leguminous plants, in order to make EU livestock less dependent on plant protein imports and reduce nitrogen fertilisers, which are energy-intensive as well as being major producers of greenhouse gas emissions; b) upholding the ban on ploughing permanent grassland, in order to encourage biodiversity and carbon sequestration in the soil; c) maintaining ecological focus areas in which the cultivation or use of plant protection products is prohibited, to help prevent biodiversity loss, but allowing limited extensive grazing, which helps to enrich the soil and is of benefit to livestock farmers; d) the availability of specific instruments to prevent risks related to climate change; e) the introduction of compensation aid, easily accessible and serving to incentivise additional commitments in Natura 2000 areas that have additional commitments related to biodiversity, in high nature value areas and in areas where protected large predators are present; f) other greening measures at regional level; 65. recommends that any award of direct payments to an undertaking that has not respected the social standards in place in its Member State should be reduced, in order to protect the rights of agricultural workers; 66. calls for a strengthening of the second CAP pillar and an increase in rural development budgets; also calls for a greater degree of subsidiarity enabling Member States to transfer funds from the first to the second pillar; C 342/16 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "67. draws attention to the great contribution made to achieving CAP goals at local and regional level by Community-led Local Development (CLLD) and the LEADER method and therefore recommends that up to 20 % of funds earmarked for the implementation of the second pillar be spent on this under national and regional programmes implementing the CAP; 68. reiterates that the Member States and regions should be given more power to regulate farmland and set restrictions to that end, particularly to tackle Europe\u2019s land-grabbing and concentration phenomenon, which is limiting young farmers\u2019 options with regard to setting up a farming business ( 5 ); 69. calls for a sufficient share of funds to be set aside for the development of rural areas, by boosting the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), to ensure the harmonious and integrated development of these areas, including the provision of local infrastructure; supporting SMEs, village renewal and wider economic diversification; 70. recommends that the EU pay special attention to the outermost regions, where the farming sector is fundamental for job and wealth creation as well as for boosting the development of the agri-food industry, research and innovation, steps to safeguard and promote high quality areas of land subject to spatial planning, and efforts to combat climate change; 71. proposes that the second-pillar funds should be primarily aimed at: a) bringing farmers and consumers closer together by means of short supply chains; b) support for farmers whose production methods go above and beyond the minimum environmental standards, so as to encourage farming with a high ecological value; c) support for the development of environmentally-friendly cultivation techniques, while also maintaining ecosystems of high environmental value and encouraging afforestation of land as a carbon sink; d) support for the promotion of innovation and research in favour of more sustainable production and processing methods; e) the adaptation of farmers to the markets (e.g. information and advisory services, farm management services, training, etc.); f) support for sustainable modernisation of agricultural product processing chains, developed alongside production chains, in a way that does not harm the environment or consumer health and which ensures a fair distribution of added value; g) initiatives promoting farmers who set up cooperatives or producer organisations; h) risk management advice to address climate and health contingencies; i) sustainable investment to adapt the products of family farms to match consumer demand; j) support for sectoral development that has an official agricultural quality label; k) small-scale processing of local agricultural products; l) caterers being supplied with organic and local products; 72. proposes shifting from a \u2018service desk\u2019 approach to a \u2018contract\u2019 approach between specific types of farms, sectors and areas; starting with a few objectives (quality, productivity, sustainability), proposes supporting innovation projects designed to this end and capable of producing a significant impact on jobs; Synergies between EU funds for rural development 73. proposes strengthening EU financial support for rural development, which has decreased significantly in comparison with the previous programming period, while maintaining sufficient funds available under the first pillar; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/17 ( 5 ) Opinion of the European Committee of the Regions on Supporting young European farmers (OJ C 207, 30.6.2017, p. 57).

This means that the CAP needs to target not only farmers. The LEADER initiatives provide opportunities for rural and peri-urban players to collaborate and innovate, and this must continue; 78. calls for a thorough assessment of the Structural Funds supporting the development of rural areas and promoting comprehensive policies to boost these areas by improving connectivity in terms of both transport and digital broadband, balanced with environmental protection, by means of the \u2018rural proofing\u2019 mechanism recommended in the Cork 2.0 Declaration ( 7 ); 79. stresses that balanced territorial development must provide adequate support for rural and peri-urban areas in the hinterland, as well as disadvantaged areas (e.g. mountainous, border areas or other areas with natural or demographic challenges), in order to secure the necessary investments in growth, jobs, social inclusion and environmental sustainability; 80. calls for the improvement of rural-urban links, whereby smaller towns and rural municipalities are fully involved, so that EU policies do not encourage a competitive relationship between urban, coastal and rural dimensions; 81. welcomes the European Commission\u2019s Smart Villages initiative, and the European Parliament\u2019s part in the success of the process, and proposes that this concept be extended to Smart Rural Areas; also asks to be able to play as big a role as possible in discussions on establishing a local and regional framework for action in connection with this initiative; C 342/18 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 6 ) European Committee of the Regions opinion on Innovation and modernisation of the rural economy (OJ C 120, 5.4.2016, p. 10).

Welcomes the European Commission\u2019s commitment to making an active and constructive contribution to reaching the strategic objectives set out in the 2030 Agenda, paving the way for tackling a number of key and integrated global challenges; 2. notes that the planning document, adopted as a communication by the Commission on 22 November 2016, proposes a very ambitious and wide-ranging strategy which focuses on sustainable development; 3. acknowledges the Commission\u2019s efforts to link the Agenda with the Europe 2020 Strategy and thereby with the European Structural and Investment Funds; given the complexity and the multitude of different reference frameworks, underlines the need for policy coherence, mainstreaming and a consistent governance framework; 4. highlights that in order to achieve results it is essential to involve all levels of government in the decision-making process, particularly local and regional authorities (LRAs); General comments 5. notes that, as the policies of the European Union (EU) must comply with the principle of subsidiarity, the sustainability objectives are directly related to the responsibilities, competences and functions of subnational levels of government; 6. insists that local and regional authorities \u2014 regions, provinces, counties, districts, metropolitan cities, small cities and municipalities \u2014 are fully-fledged policy-makers, tasked with identifying the most appropriate levels and methods of government for linking the overarching EU and UN objectives with those of local communities; 7. stresses that out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, two require local governments to perform key tasks, namely SDGs 10 and 11. The former aims to reduce inequalities between territories, while the latter relates to carrying out essential functions in the areas of urban planning, transport, social welfare and sustainable lifestyles; 8. points out in this context that the Communication does not examine the need to measure progress on attaining the SDGs, either at UN, European and national level or at subnational level; calls therefore on the European Commission to bear this dimension in mind when developing further the indicators used to measure progress and to involve local expertise and existing networks; 9. highlights the additional priorities stemming from the integrated performance of functions with a cross-cutting impact on other strategic objectives, such as the Urban Agenda, social inclusion, EU climate and energy policy, emissions reductions, disaster risk reduction, environmental policy, the circular economy, mobility, smart specialisation and smart cities (smart lands), the subject of the Bratislava summit and the Covenant of Mayors on climate and energy; C 342/20 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "10. proposes capitalising on the mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) in order to ensure overlap between the 2030 Agenda and Europe 2020, by reviewing the key guidelines and gearing them to the new SDGs from the outset; 11. welcomes the efforts made in the working document accompanying the Communication on Key European action supporting the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SWD (2016) 390 final) to align the Europe 2020 Strategy with the objectives of the 2030 Agenda, building on the connections between the three pillars, the seven flagship initiatives, the five objectives linked to the Europe 2020 priorities and those linked to the eleven thematic Cohesion Fund objectives; 12. stresses that in any event, if they are to be achieved, the objectives set out by the Commission in its communication on a sustainable European future will all have to be deployed locally. In this regard, recommends embedding the Agenda 2030 objectives at local level, as this is the only way of making a real and lasting impact on people\u2019s lives; 13. agrees with the fact that the complexity of different levels of government calls for guidance and monitoring, bringing the benefits of policy evaluation and institutional innovation (measuring the effects) to the decision-making process; 14. takes the view that some of the linkages between the Juncker Commission\u2019s priorities and the SDGs are in areas of significance for LRAs. This is especially the case with the employment priority, in that it covers the same competences as those referred to in SDG 4 (training and education), an area where local and regional bodies exercise considerable powers, especially where the costs of transition to a sustainable Europe are concerned; 15. hopes that the Commission\u2019s Investment Plan also covers tangible and intangible assets within the remit of local and regional bodies (social protection, IT, mobility, energy and telecommunications networks, waste disposal, integrated water management, etc.), many of which dovetail with various SDGs (including Nos 8, 9, 12 and 13); 16. points out that Commission priority No 3, A resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy , also interfaces with a range of SGDs in an area of interest to LRAs. The same applies to SDGs 5, 7 and 13, where LRAs are both beneficiaries and protagonists in policies designed to combat climate change, as well as those designed to ensure a sustainable, universally accessible energy supply and to protect social rights, which rely on services provided at local level if they are to be guaranteed; 17. notes that priority No 7, which aims to create an area of justice and protection of fundamental rights based on mutual trust, includes policies on gender equality, in which LRAs can play a significant role, fully commensurate with SDG 5 as well as the need to win back people\u2019s trust in the European institutions; 18. reiterates that disaster resilience is one of the key aspects of sustainable development and calls on the institutions of the European Union to ensure that this principle is one of the central pillars of future sustainable development measures in Europe ( 1 ); 19. notes that priority No 8 seeks to tackle migration on an unprecedented and global scale, bringing it fully into line with SDGs 1 and 10 and involving many cross-cutting LRA competences, which are very often under immense pressure to manage migratory flows of an exceptional nature; Specific comments 20. observes that, in contrast to Cohesion Policy, it may not always be possible to place the action taken to achieve the SDGs in a framework of integrated policies. It is therefore vital to set priorities that correspond to the most pressing needs, adopting a dynamic approach in the interests of attaining all the objectives in the long-term. It is thus essential to take account of the CoR\u2019s proposal on the need to approve a code of conduct for the involvement of LRAs; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/21 ( 1 ) COR 5035/2016; COM(2016) 739 final. ",
        "21. points out that the objectives, require a balance to be struck between current needs and those of future generations, as well as between the needs of the different levels of government. The latter is essential for reducing burdensome transition costs to be shouldered by LRAs. If costs are not sustainable this may pose a threat to the public acceptance and effective implementation of the measures in question, in particular threatening the ability of more marginalised (internal) areas to contribute to global sustainability and more generally to the durability of the SDGs; 22. notes the time mismatch between European (2020) measures referred to in the communication and the 2030 Agenda, while hoping that additional economic and financial instruments will be made available and that the objectives will be redefined throughout the entire duration of the reference timeframe, in line with those of the Agenda; 23. regrets that the communication does not include an assessment of potential risks in the implementation phase of the 17 SDGs. This could be of great assistance in equipping LRAs with appropriate tools to deal with any problems that crop up in the course of implementing policies related to the goals. Ensuring that all indicators are geared to the local level is crucial for ongoing monitoring of trends in inequality \u2014 including through the use of indicators other than GDP, such as qualitative indicators capable of measuring the fairness of development and social progress in the regions; 24. highlights that if a subset of local and regional level objectives is to be achieved, it will have to be properly funded. The necessary resources could be made available by means of specific transfers from the national level, but also by conferring greater budgetary powers on local bodies; 25. believes that there is a need to promote platforms and initiatives that allow LRAs to share good practices and make use of know-how already made available by established bodies, such as the UNDP Live Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform, to prevent the Agenda from being used as an opportunity to recentralise policies. To this end, the CoR looks forward to the launch of the multistakeholder platform announced by the Commission in order to facilitate the roll-out of the universal elements contained in the Agenda at local and regional level, and, above all, to promote the exchange of good practice and the sharing of progress made by the most dynamic European regions; expects to be associated to this platform in the appropriate manner in its institutional role as the assembly representing local and regional authorities; 26. recognises that improving living conditions in the EU will depend, in addition to our ability to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion, on well-being and security in the neighbouring countries. In this respect, in line with the new approach set out in the Commission\u2019s communication on a new European Consensus, strongly urges stepping up support for decentralised cooperation with and development of third countries, by promoting the use of LRA platforms for information and discussion on development: the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly (ARLEM) and the Conference of Regional and Local Authorities for the Eastern Partnership (CORLEAP), the biennial Assises of decentralised cooperation and the atlas of decentralised cooperation, which provide partner countries with the opportunity to meet, talk and exchange good practice; 27. endorses the Commission\u2019s position on the Urban Agenda for the EU adopted with the Pact of Amsterdam in 2016, which will be implemented in cooperation with LRAs in order to cover all aspects of sustainable development and contribute to the implementation of the global New Urban Agenda; 28. deems it necessary for strategies in support of sustainable urban development and horizontal and vertical cooperation, within a participatory governance system, to take account of the diversity of cities and of the importance of social innovation and future-oriented planning, by employing an integrated and coordinated approach, particularly when addressing key challenges with the aim of improving quality of life in cities; 29. recommends analysing the 2030 Agenda to ensure that its objectives are consistent with the European development model, based as it is on local production systems (clusters), comprised mainly of SMEs. To this end, hopes that the development models also pay particular attention to the development of smaller urban centres, as an excessive concentration of local and regional development can end in the trap of underdevelopment, which, in turn, may result in marginalisation and population decline; C 342/22 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "30. values the fact that the communication highlights the various facets of sustainable development \u2014 social, environmental and economic \u2014 as pillars upon which the Commission\u2019s policies must converge in order to provide solutions in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals and the 13 sectoral policies adopted under the 2014-2020 MFF. Believes, however, that in the face of new global challenges, local development must be given a boost by adding a local and regional dimension; 31. emphasises that LRAs must be recognised as key players in policies, due to their proximity to citizens and their potential to contribute to rebuilding consensus on the European institutions and the European project. Multilevel Governance is the ideal approach for policies that aim to build a sustainable future and combine the 10 Commission priorities with the 11 thematic goals of the Cohesion Funds and the 17 SDG goals of the 2030 Agenda. Enhancing the impact of policies under the social pillar 32. reiterates that centrally-managed, top-down policies and programmes are not the best methods to address the complexities of sustainable development and to tackle poverty. Instead, LRAs should be given the responsibility and autonomy required to respond properly to major social issues; 33. stresses the need to strengthen policies enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union with sustainable social policy planning that involves all tiers of governance. This is the only way to ensure access for all to basic services and permit a response to new demands posed by demographic change using local policies geared to facilitating active and healthy ageing; 34. highlights that the Commission should work towards policies that aim to promote people\u2019s health as a prerequisite for social inclusion, improving living conditions in urban and suburban areas, as well as guaranteeing access to public services, recreational activities and sport \u2014 including for disabled people \u2014 and promoting preventive healthcare for all, including older people, migrants and other demographic groups that are at risk of poverty and social exclusion; encourages Member States and local and regional authorities to do the same; 35. considers the potential of the social economy to be in creating jobs and tackling unemployment among young people and women. It is therefore essential that the Agenda draw attention to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), the need to create empathy among young people and entrepreneurship. Moreover, the new strategy must \u2014 by adopting a cross-cutting approach \u2014 include the different facets of sustainability and the new prospects offered by creativity; 36. considers it necessary to include culture in the 2030 Agenda, clearly underlining the role that it plays in relation to sustainable development and job creation by furthering the construction of shared European ideals to be disseminated worldwide: the aspirations and principles of democracy, social justice and solidarity. Culture contributes effectively to inclusive development strategies and has a considerable impact on SDGs and improving education systems by fighting social exclusion and poverty, removing the causes of inequality, facilitating equal opportunities and dismantling generational and demographic disparities; Enhancing the impact of policies under the environment pillar 37. stresses that seemingly global issues, such as climate change, reduction of CO 2 emissions, energy saving, renewable energy production, protection of biodiversity, reduction of resource exploitation, integrated transport and the circular economy, are actually conditioned by local policies and action. To this end, recommends that particular attention be paid to environmentally-friendly production; 38. considers it necessary, given the wide range of sectors involved, to adopt an integrated and cooperative approach between multilevel governance and the environmental stakeholders concerned. In this respect, the concept of cohesion builds bridges between economic effectiveness, social cohesion, cultural development and environmental balance, putting sustainable development at the heart of policy-making; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/23 ",
        "39. agrees that human activity and climate change are putting increasing pressure on marine ecosystems. As such, consideration should be given to the measures taken by the Commission to make the oceans safe and clean, to ensure that they are managed in a sustainable manner and to support the implementation of the Blue Growth Agenda, which aims to capture the potential of Europe\u2019s oceans and seas to create jobs, economic value and sustainability. Furthermore, reiterates that innovation in the blue economy can help in ensuring an efficient and sustainable use of precious marine resources ( 2 ); 40. calls for a commitment on the part of all the institutions to minimise food waste and to recover waste, thereby driving investment and employment in the wider context of the green economy. The EU must make a firm commitment to discarding the linear economic model in order to boost the circular economy, as highlighted previously by the CoR in its opinions Towards a circular economy: review of EU waste legislation, Legislative proposals amending the waste directives and An EU action plan for the Circular Economy ; Enhancing the impact of policies under the economic pillar 41. takes the view that development models, shaped by new competitive factors, including networks interconnecting an infinite quantity of data with an unlimited number of users, reflect a clear disconnect between the need for businesses to reduce the time to market and the time spent on consensus-building and bureaucratic formalities. LRAs are the appropriate level to bring policy decision-making up to the speed dictated by the markets; 42. calls for real support for development models and, in particular, support for intangible networks that influence new local competitive factors and the transition to new production models by facilitating access to an infinite number of data; 43. thinks it is high time to develop strategies that activate structural policies so that the core development pillars embrace the radical change in the production model, favouring sustainable production \u2014 including with incentives \u2014 until innovation makes the transition to the circular economy economically viable. It is clear that such policies not only help to overcome the onerous new challenges posed by globalisation, but also constitute a clear response to the trade-off between social demands that pit the environment against jobs; 44. recognises that globalisation, driven above all by improved mobility of persons, products and data, is fuelling international competition not only between firms, but also between regions. Resolute action is therefore needed to address the factors determining regional competitiveness, such as social and institutional capital, infrastructure and innovation, in order to revitalise European economies; 45. reiterates that LRAs have a crucial role to play in the relationship between public-private partnerships, as they are able to recognise the diversity of forms of development able to generate investments that make the most of the local resources inherent in each region; Enhancing the impact of policies under the territorial dimension pillar 46. regrets that the concept of \u2018territorial capital\u2019, as defined by the OECD in 2001 and taken up by the Commission in 2005, is completely missing from the Commission communication. By way of a reminder, the concept refers to a set of local assets \u2014 natural, human, artificial, organisational, relational and cognitive \u2014 representing a region\u2019s competitive potential; 47. notes that the crisis and the effects of globalisation have had a profound impact on relations that guaranteed cohesion between the territories, creating rifts (between city and countryside, centres and peripheral areas) and altering the dynamics of societal development. With this in mind, we must bear the cost of transforming old territorial policy models, characterised by a functional approach which considered the area simply as a space, into a new institutional matrix granting the regions the role of collective player; 48. The Pact of Amsterdam places the role of urban policies that aim to implement measures to boost social cohesion and economic development at the centre of growing interest, in the belief that cities can contribute positively to the process of innovation; C 342/24 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 2 ) COR 2203/2012. ",
        "RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES 49. highlights the fact that LRAs play a key role in protecting and developing urban environments, rural areas and the common heritage, and can make a contribution to what the 2030 Agenda describes as a \u2018transformed world\u2019 by being proactive and committed to: a. improving their own strategic management capacity; b. fostering a civil society that is aware and has high expectations; c. developing integrated urban and territorial planning; d. promoting local economic opportunities to create decent jobs and social cohesion; e. promoting regional sustainable development plans/strategies, linking the SGDs to policy objectives, and revising and adapting programmes so that they respond to the challenges of sustainable development, thereby contributing to the formulation of National Reform Programmes (NRPs); f. guiding the transition towards a low-carbon economy and towards resilient cities and regions; g. supporting the development of sustainable urban mobility plans; h. recognising and promoting the role of culture in sustainable development and enhancing the local heritage, creativity and diversity; i. encouraging economic, social and cultural stakeholders, universities and scientific research centres and individual members of the public to take part in designing plans and initiatives to meet the SDGs, in cooperation with the Joint Research Centre involved in the \u2018Science meets Regions\u2019 initiative; j. promoting educational programmes for sustainable development in schools and cultural activities which address the problem of sustainability; k. including \u2018fair and sustainable well-being indicators\u2019 in the regional law-making cycle and regional budgets; l. establishing partnerships in the context of decentralised cooperation for development; 50. recalls that LRAs are able to develop forms of participatory democracy, in particular through the inclusion of women, young people, older people and minorities, as a basis for planning and implementing integrated strategies for economic development at local level; RECOMMENDATIONS AT NATIONAL LEVEL 51. advocates a bottom-up approach, establishing an appropriate legal framework and allocating sufficient resources. A new system of this kind can only be successfully created through ever deeper decentralisation in the various EU Member States. National governments should: a. promote shared governance and genuine decentralisation, which allows for the participation of all players involved not only during the upstream stages, but also in the downstream ones; b. design coherent, integrated urban and regional policies in consultation with subnational governing bodies, particularly when developing the NRPs; c. reorganise subnational financing arrangements to ensure that sustainability is matched by funding; d. involve local and regional bodies in the follow-up to the SDGs, backed up by precise regional data; 52. emphasises that national governments must involve the LRAs and cities, preferably through a bottom-up approach, in planning local activities to achieve the SDGs, taking into account strengths and weaknesses on the basis of the principles of \u2018no-one left behind\u2019 and efficient spending; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/25 ",
        "RECOMMENDATIONS AT EU AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 53. believes that if global policies and agreements are to reap the full benefit of local commitment and experience, LRAs must be an integral part of the structured dialogue and governance, and not a mere stakeholder. Their work in organising and producing informed input must be acknowledged as being part and parcel of the decision-making process by, for example: a. including organised networks of LRAs in the governing bodies of international development organisations; b. strengthening financing instruments and reviewing local sustainable development policies; c. encouraging decentralised development, including with non-EU countries, and sharing lessons learned and knowledge to foster innovation; 54. asks the EU and national authorities to set aside resources to cover ex ante and ex post impact assessments of policies relating to sustainable development. This will call for improved coordination of all policies implemented, both by the EU and Member States and by the LRAs; 55. calls on the Commission to use NRPs \u2014 which have already been formally included in the programming of the Cohesion Fund \u2014 in an even more strategic and operational manner, by making practical use of instruments that have already been adopted to support sustainable development. This would make it possible to highlight, within the European Semester framework, not only the reforms that are planned and promoted at national level to implement the SDGs, but also those relating to the local and regional dimension; 56. recommends that European and international levels of government coordinate the complex system of world relations, by keeping regional outbreaks of tension in check and supporting the transformation and restructuring of institutional and productive assets inherited from the last century. Local bodies should be granted the necessary powers to be able to transform fragile geo-economic balances into development opportunities to revitalise the competitiveness of local production systems on the global market.

        "Opinion of the European Committee of the Regions \u2014 Migration on the Central Mediterranean route (2017/C 342/04) Rapporteur: Hans Janssen (NL/EPP), Mayor of Oisterwijk Reference document: Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council Migration on the Central Mediterranean route \u2014 Managing flows, saving lives JOIN(2017) 4 final POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS (CoR) Introduction and context 1. recognises that this EU communication is an important element of broader EU policy reform. It has the added value of proposing concrete measures to complement the strategic guidelines of the council of 2014 in which European leaders agreed to offer a pathway for future policy development in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, including on immigration and asylum, in the coming years; 2. considers that, in such a sensitive and strategic area, the EU Member States and the European Union institutions should continue to shape a strategy for the region in the context of the latter\u2019s relations with the European Union and, as a consequence, a genuine migration policy, and assume political responsibility for its implementation in the interests of the peoples of Europe while taking into account the specific characteristics of the Member States and of the countries of origin, and the rights of migrants according to international and European conventions; 3. recognises that migration and development policies are closely linked. International, national, regional and local cooperation is crucial for making a common European migration policy a reality, and for implementing the European Agenda for Migration; 4. advocates the adoption of a holistic approach to the management of migration, allowing for more decentralised and efficient management of migration movements. This decentralised management will guarantee equal treatment and rights; 5. stresses the utmost importance of reducing the number of deaths at sea in the attempt to cross to Europe and the need to continue and expand efforts to rescue people in distress; expresses its deep sorrow for the hundreds of lives already lost and commends all the countries and organisations involved in trying to prevent this human tragedy ( 1 ); reiterates that the development of additional safe and accessible legal pathways for migration to the EU, such as humanitarian visas, resettlements and increased family reunification, must be part of the efforts to create a comprehensive and humane migration policy; 6. welcomes the additional measures that this Joint Communication has brought to strengthen initiatives along the Central Mediterranean migration route, including in and around Libya. In view of the high number of lives lost at sea and along the Central Mediterranean migration route, the question of managing flows and saving lives remains a top priority; 7. believes that multilevel governance is a prerequisite to achieving optimum results. In this framework, it is crucial that the EU, national and sub-national authorities work in close cooperation with local and regional authorities in the countries of transit and with civil society, migrants\u2019 associations and local communities in the host countries and are receptive to their input; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/27 ( 1 ) CdR 5728/2014, Opinion on \u2018The efforts to promote genuine solidarity on a real European migration policy\u2019, rapporteur Fran\u00e7ois Decoster (FR/ALDE). ",
        "8. underlines that the success of these actions requires close cooperation with the relevant partners in the countries along the Central Mediterranean route and concerted efforts by the EU institutions and Member States, as well as cooperation with international organisations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Warns that some of the proposed actions can only be successfully implemented if the situation on the ground allows for it. These actions should be seen as complementary to the substantial number of initiatives already being implemented by the EU and its Member States, notably under the European agenda on migration and the Migration Partnership programme ( 2 ); 9. wishes to express its appreciation of the efforts made by Italy, Malta, Greece, Cyprus, France, Spain and Portugal, which have already connected their Eurosur national coordination centres for border surveillance to the Seahorse Mediterranean Network; 10. acknowledges that the Central Mediterranean route has become the dominant route for migrants and refugees attempting to reach Europe. Over 180 000 people were detected on the Central Mediterranean route in 2016, the vast majority of them reaching the continent via Italy. Almost 90 % of those on the route depart from Libya, where the unstable political and economic situation provides the opportunity for smugglers to expand their activities; stresses the urgent necessity to reduce the numbers of crossings and to stop dinghies and boats from leaving illegally to reach the EU. Underlines the importance of preventive actions at all level of governments; 11. notes that smugglers and traffickers themselves contribute to the instability in Libya by their actions and human rights abuses, increasing the vulnerability of migrants. Finding a lasting solution to Libya\u2019s governance and security challenges continues to be a key priority for the European Union, its Member States and international partners, as it is a prerequisite for sustainably managing the current situation; 12. observes that the majority of migrants in Libya are third-country nationals, with the largest proportion originating from sub-Saharan African countries. An effective approach therefore also has to take into account actions to the south of Libya; 13. underlines the added value of the measures announced in the communication: expanding training programmes for the Libyan Coast Guard, ensuring sustainable sources of funding to cover training needs in the future, taking firm action to step up the fight against smugglers and traffickers and providing incentives for the participation of Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt in the Seahorse Mediterranean Network to ensure sub-regional buy-in; underlines that in all these activities, the rebuilding of respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law to the benefit of migrants and local populations must be a key priority; The focus on Libya: needed but vulnerable 14. reiterates the need for serious engagement with the Libyan authorities to ensure that conditions in centres for migrants are improved, paying particular attention to vulnerable persons and minors, ensuring close cooperation with, and effective monitoring of the standards by, the International Organisation for Migration and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; 15. welcomes stepping up work and engagement with Libyan municipalities to promote alternative livelihoods and support the resilience of local communities hosting migrants, as well as increasing technical cooperation so that Libyan municipalities can define development strategies for their areas and improve support services for the local population; 16. underlines the need for a medium- and long-term cooperation strategy to provide support and back-up for Libya\u2019s local and national authorities, enabling capacity building for managing their areas; 17. encourages promoting border cooperation, dialogue and exchange of information between Libya and its southern neighbours, including using the Africa-Frontex Intelligence Community to full potential; 18. notes that in undertaking joint actions with Libya, the risk that other routes could develop in neighbouring countries needs to be minimised; welcomes therefore a comprehensive regional approach by increasing cooperation with Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria, deepening dialogue and operational cooperation on migration with these countries.

        "to these countries to develop their own functioning asylum systems and support to those in need of international protection is needed; 19. bearing in mind the different projects and programmes of the EU in the region, targeting interrelated matters, it is vital to coordinate these initiatives if they are to be efficient as part of steps to secure the above-mentioned goals; 20. notes that so far, the common EU response to irregular migration has taken the form of state-centred security approaches that mainly focus on combatting smuggling practices through collaboration with state authorities; 21. calls for greater attention to be devoted to the different local political economies involved in irregular migration. Actors involved include transport companies that facilitate the irregular movement of migrants, local populations that provide food and lodging to earn a living, local security forces that increase their income through bribery and road taxes, political elites that use the financial resources earned through the facilitation of irregular migration to buy political favours and influence, armed groups that feed off human smuggling and exploitation to strengthen their position, etc. Understanding these different actors and their relationship to local governance and stability/conflict dynamics, and ensuring they are involved in the discussion of strategies to stabilise and build a future for their country, is a necessary prerequisite for effective migration management; 22. therefore welcomes the suggestion that existing socio-economic support for municipalities along the migratory route could be reinforced, involving them in the implementation of strategies for enabling the local population to have better living conditions and as a consequence, better prospects for the future of their area; 23. stresses that properly designed migration policies could contribute to alternative livelihoods and higher quality institutions in the long term \u2014 thereby addressing some of the root causes of migration from within. To ensure such effective policy formation, current migration policies need to be reconciled with the fact that issues of governance and stability are at the root of trans-Saharan irregular migration; 24. reiterates that irregular migratory routes cross many countries in the region where state authorities are weak or absent. Libya is an obvious case in point. Several reports have shown that proceeds from illicit smuggling and trafficking empower irregular armed forces that operate as de facto authorities on the ground, enabling them to act as spoilers in the larger conflict resolution processes. Even in those cases where formal state authorities do still exist, collaboration with such actors in the fight against irregular migration is an inherently political enterprise that may end up entrenching the interests of state-aligned smugglers and irregular armed forces. In the midst of fragmented sovereignty, neutral interlocutors do not exist. 25. stresses that climate change and natural disasters can be factors leading to migration and displacement of people. Furthermore, calls for investment in building disaster risk resilience as a preventive action to tackle the root causes of migration; Improving migration management in Libya 26. encourages continued efforts towards systematic engagement with the Libyan authorities, with a focus on border management, countering irregular migration and addressing the human rights and the needs of migrants in Libya, including developing, in cooperation with civil society, alternatives to detention of migrants which should only be used as a measure of last resort and only under conditions that meet international humanitarian and human rights standards. Training and logistical support on these issues should be an important element of capacity building programmes supported by the EU; 27. suggests exploring with UNHCR the feasibility of taking practical steps to resettle migrants in need of international protection from Libya to EU Member States and other international partner countries; 28. calls for reinforcement of the pilot initiative aiming at community stabilisation in areas affected by internal displacement and transit of migrants, including cooperation in the definition of strategies for their areas, aimed at ensuring human dignity in the country in which they live, inter alia by creating job opportunities for persons in need of protection, 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/29 ",
        "which would have the added benefit of facilitating their acceptance by host communities; and also cooperation in steps to improve public support services and facilities for local populations, amongst other things; 29. advocates enhancing ongoing assisted voluntary returns from Libya to countries of origin, if the situation on the ground allows for it and in coordination with international partners, in particular the IOM; Local governments: vital part of the solution 30. welcomes the recognition of local and regional authorities as important actors in solving and managing migration issues, saving lives and fighting crime; 31. reiterates that cities are lead actors on the stage of global migration, and are also most directly affected by its negative consequences. Local governments have immediate responsibility for the living conditions, successes and challenges of immigrants. Local governments can succeed where many national governments are challenged and even fail ( 3 ); 32. underlines the role of local authorities in countries of origin, transit and destination in migration policy, especially in relation to integration and social cohesion. Local authorities are clearly in the front line in addressing migration challenges, given their mandate, their presence \u2018on the ground\u2019 and their experience in handling the day-to-day realities of increasingly diverse societies. After all, migration is an area of shared competence that is managed at every level \u2014 EU, national, regional and local. At the same time it is important to take local and regional situations into account so as to ensure that reception of migrants is as good and sustainable as possible and that migrants therefore integrate successfully; 33. believes that the EU should make the most of the potential and experience of the regions that make up its southern sea border \u2014 both in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic \u2014 as special links in developing mutually beneficial relations with third countries; 34. underscores the need to strengthen local communities in particular in Libya, in line with the Malta Declaration by the members of the European Council on the external aspects of migration ( 4 ) and supports therefore projects such as the Nicosia initiative; calls on the European External Action Service and the European Commission, in cooperation with the CoR and association of local or regional governments, to explore the possibilities for similar projects in other countries; 35. recognises the added value of the Nicosia initiative as a capacity building project in support of Libyan municipalities carried out in partnership with European local and regional authorities and with the financial contribution of the European Commission. Points out that this initiative should be bolstered in such a way as to boost the effectiveness of its measures and generate better outcomes, nonetheless bearing in mind the need to be alert to the complex setting as regards the issue of legitimacy in Libya and to remain sensitive to any political implications; 36. recognises that the capacity of local authorities along the Central Mediterranean route are not well developed. The challenge becomes more complex when attempting to respond to differing needs, especially in an economically fragile climate. Local authorities must have the tools to assess the most urgent needs of different migrant groups, particularly unaccompanied children and adolescents, and women; 37. emphasises the need to pay greater attention to child protection. There has been a record number of refugee and migrant deaths in the Central Mediterranean over the past 3 months, including an estimated 190 children. We join the call of UNICEF on the EU and its Member States to commit to protecting refugee and migrant children, especially those who are unaccompanied, from exploitation, violence and child trafficking and strengthening child protection programmes in Libya; 38. clarifies that EU support for local authority capacity development entails not only increasing the technical capabilities of local authorities, but also ensuring the efficient provision of basic needs and services. Empirical evidence suggests that decentralised management of social services and public goods provide optimal \u2018value-for-money\u2019 in development planning and delivery; 39. advocates promoting decentralisation and local governance programmes, in line with national poverty reduction strategies; C 342/30 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 3 ) CdR 9/2012 fin, Opinion on the \u2018Global approach to migration and mobility\u2019, rapporteur Nichi Vendola (IT/PES).

        "40. insists that coherence and interplay between national migration policies and local initiatives in providing services and protection to migrants and promoting their social inclusion, when they are entitled to international protection, is an area that merits further attention. As a minimum, local governments need the authority and resources to respond appropriately to the needs of migrants in the communities under their jurisdiction. Ideally, they should be able to operate in an overall policy environment that favours an inclusive approach when the right conditions are in place; 41. notes that Libya has experienced political and social turmoil over the past 6 years as a direct result of the events of the Arab spring. The overall crisis in which Libya has found itself since 2014 has caused utter chaos and a steep deterioration in living conditions throughout the country. The near absence of the state and the very limited means at the disposal of the municipal councils make institutional weakness a considerable obstacle to stability and development. At the same time, the country has opted for reforms establishing a decentralised governance system approving Law 59 (on local governance) in 2012 which, despite the instability in the country, remains a reference point in all Libyan parties, no matter what their political affiliation; 42. stresses that many young people from Libyan cities have become involved in the \u2018migration business\u2019, as it is a highly lucrative source of income. Young people who have participated in armed conflict and militia activities are particularly difficult to integrate. The traditional social organisations (tribes, families, schools and institutions) have difficulty in dealing with youths. Drugs and criminality are widespread. The absence of specific youth policies has made the situation worse for young people; 43. emphasises the fact that municipalities not only in Libya but in the different countries along the Mediterranean route can play an important role. As institutional and legitimate actors responsible for local issues, they are called upon to make an important contribution to stabilisation. Local economic development, coordination with security actors and efficient policies for youth and migration are the pillars of such a role. But local governments need a great deal of assistance in order to be able to shoulder these responsibilities; 44. advocates programmes to contribute to strengthening, empowering and rendering more effective local governance in Libya and other countries along the Central Mediterranean route by focusing on three dimensions of local governance: management, service delivery and participation. Efforts should also be made to increase local economic prospects, social life and political inclusion of highly educated young people in inland rural areas, cities and towns, in order to attenuate factors leading to radicalisation and migration; 45. stresses that it is possible to create traction at local level for improved governance despite the de facto lack of capacity of local governments at this stage, and advocates for the vital necessity to support local governance as this will inevitably promote stabilisation and create the conditions for future reconstruction, a prerequisite for efficient and sustainable migration management in Libya; 46. underlines the importance of women\u2019s participation and youth engagement, something that should remain crucial in the various support activities, especially through the involvement of active civil society organisations (CSOs) and independent politicians; 47. insists on the added value of targeted objectives in reducing the negative effects of the various forms of migration, displacement and unrest by increasing the economic attractiveness of rural areas and activities in support of municipalities in their new mandate, in keeping with decentralisation measures; 48. acknowledges that the tragedy starts in the countries of origin, not in the sea. Thus encourages the EU to contribute to local economic development in the countries along the Central Mediterranean route by supporting municipalities in their role of local development actors and by enabling the participation of young people and women in local affairs and socio- economic activities; 49. offers its further support in designing and implementing the EU\u2019s migration policy, also drawing on the knowledge and expertise of the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly (ARLEM).

While there are a range of general worldwide or sea-based agreements, such as UNCLOS and specialised agreements particularly under the IMO, there is a considerable degree of fragmentation. In that context, the role of the EU is both to lead by example and to offer incentives so that non-EU partners replicate the high standards that exist within EU marine policy. Such incentives, including capacity building, could potentially be included in international agreements on trade and development programmes that the EU negotiates with third countries; C 342/32 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 1 ) Council Conclusions of 3 April 2017.

        "8. notes that the EU and Member States have concurrent powers on international relations, inclusive of marine-related issues. This requires robust coordination between levels of government, and ensuring that EU and national positions in international forums have undergone territorial impact assessment so that the interests of the competent local and regional authorities are fully embedded in them; 9. stresses that many issues related to ocean governance are inevitably local, due to resource extraction, economic benefit for coastal areas, fishing communities and ports, or their environmental impact on Europe\u2019s coasts and seas. Environmental and climate policy and economic decisions concerning oceans elsewhere in the world affect EU local and regional authorities. This requires significant investment in maritime spatial planning and supporting governance at the local/regional level; 10. stresses that marine policy is directly linked with inshore economic, environmental or spatial planning policy. How local and regional authorities manage inshore policies will have a direct offshore effect. Often, on issues such as windfarms, offshore activity has been perceived as the easy solution for activities being resisted inshore; 11. highlights that local and regional authorities have competences and positive experiences in managing a range of areas such as fisheries, shellfishing and aquaculture; subsidies (e.g. for inefficient fleets), economic and environmental policies (e.g. marine litter) and inspections (e.g. vehicle inspection) that have a positive or negative impact in other territories outside the EU. They are also often part of port authorities; 12. recalls the recent research work undertaken by the CoR ( 6 ) and OECD ( 7 ) on the ocean and blue economy. Insists, in line with the \u2018Better Regulation\u2019 agenda, that it is necessary to conduct prior impact assessments, including territorial impacts, to define the possible threats from all sectors, possible mitigation measures and expected socio-economic consequences before introducing new legislation, authorising new extractive technologies or defining new Marine Protection Areas; 13. recalls the new UN Sustainable Development Goals signed by all EU and UN Member States. Ocean governance concerns Sustainable Goal 14 on Life Below Water and Goal 13 on Climate Action, and also Goal 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities. The Committee welcomes the Commission\u2019s plan to translate these goals into various EU policies ( 8 ), as it could be a good basis for building a common understanding at international level that goes beyond sectoral solutions for sustainable ocean governance; 14. believes, conversely, that the entry of ocean-sourced goods and commodities from third countries into the EU Single Market should be conditional to the fact that these countries progressively converge towards higher EU standards, such as for instance on banning of discards at sea; 15. believes that the three priority areas, broken down into 14 actions, set out in the joint communication form a relevant basis on which to undertake further action at EU and international level on ocean governance. While the communication primarily relates to the international component of maritime policy, there is a local and regional angle, in terms both of competence and of direct territorial impact and the degree of specialisation and dependence on the ocean; Priority area 1: Improving the international ocean governance framework 16. notes, concerning Action 1 on filling the gaps in the international ocean governance framework in order to improve the legal framework and provide a level playing field, that there is already an extensive legal framework at international level covering marine limits, navigation, archipelagic status and transit regimes, exclusive economic zones, continental shelf 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/33 ( 6 ) Alexander Charalambous et al., Developing Blue economy through better methodology for assessment on local and regional level , Committee of the Regions, 2016. http://cor.europa.eu/en/documentation/studies/Documents/order%206203_Blue%20Economy_form_WEB. pdf ( 7 ) OECD, \u2018The Ocean Economy in 2030\u2019, 2016. http://www.oecd.org/futures/oceaneconomy.htm ( 8 ) COM(2016) 740 final.

        "jurisdiction, deep seabed mining, the exploitation regime, protection of the marine environment, scientific research, and settlement of disputes; recalls in that respect that existing administrative boundaries and the cultural and traditional specificities of European local and regional communities should be taken into account for the purposes of shaping ocean governance policy; 17. believes that EU policies are already robust on issues concerning fishing regulation, maritime spatial planning and macro-regional strategies. In some countries strategic land-use planning is an important policy tool for local land and water spatial planning. Local authorities are already responsible for planning in relation to coastal areas and territorial waters. Strategic land-use planning should not be compromised by the governance or legal framework proposed by the European Commission. The main challenge both at EU level and, particularly, worldwide is lack of control and robust implementation. Leading by example, the EU is therefore in a position to introduce reciprocity requirements and offer incentives when negotiating new international rules with third parties and organisations. This global initiative for enforcement of those rules is needed in order to ensure a level playing field for all countries, regions and economic operators; 18. agrees, with regard to Action 2 , that promoting regional fisheries management and cooperation in key ocean areas to fill regional governance gaps will improve the position of EU fisheries and help others to reach the high standards that are in force within the EU; 19. is concerned that the Commission guidance on seabed mining would act as a deterrent to focus on the EU resource efficiency plans, the more so as the technology for exploitation of natural resources is untested and has the potential to damage the natural environment. Calls for coordination with Member States\u2019 negotiations at the International Seabed Authority; 20. recommends in that respect that the EU should campaign and provide incentives for other countries and organisations to introduce the European system of yellow and red cards as a model for tackling illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on a global scale, including blacklisting and export bans resulting from non-compliance. The Committee calls for current plans for an electronic tool for managing catch certificates to be speeded up. Such measures would boost the industry in those regions that apply the provisions strictly; 21. believes that Action 3 on improving coordination and cooperation between international organisations and launching Ocean Partnerships for ocean management will benefit regional maritime hubs through better international exposure; 22. considers that local and regional centres of competitiveness and excellence, particularly in areas with a strong maritime dimension, including the outermost regions, can play a crucial role and need to be financially supported in developing international research teams and technology transfer platforms in support of the EU\u2019s work in Ocean Governance; 23. is opposed to the idea of creating new international rules and organisations from scratch. The Committee agrees with the Commission that it is more sensible to improve the current governance and enforcement system by focusing on inefficiencies and enhancing international coordination. In that respect, it is important to ensure, before launching new measures within a specific framework (e.g. oil exploration), that the knock-on effect in other policy areas and sectors (e.g. fishing) is properly understood; 24. recommends, with regard to the management of biological biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, that the EU improve coordination with EMSA ( 9 ) and the EFCA as well as closely involving European regions in coordination actions and consultation with adjacent European regions; 25. believes that ocean governance is part of the EU\u2019s multilevel governance and thus requires the pooling of national and EU resources for capacity building, inspection, enforcement, deterrence and prosecution of all entities violating the C 342/34 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 9 ) EMSA: European Maritime Safety Agency (http://www.emsa.europa.eu/).

        "existing legal frameworks. This requires the involvement of the competent local and regional authorities with respect to Action 4 on capacity building, as this will directly benefit coastal and maritime regions in many technical and administrative aspects; 26. stresses that Action 5 on ensuring the safety and security of seas and oceans is crucial for seafarers, businesses and port operators, and a key element in the fight against forced labour and trafficking in human beings. The EU should continue to be the lead jurisdiction in this area, with the most comprehensive legal framework for safety and security at sea and in ports, and to use its considerable international leverage to encourage reciprocal arrangements in other parts of the world; 27. believes that the cooperation between national authorities and Frontex, EMSA and EFCA must result in joint maritime surveillance capability with the EU providing, where applicable, state of the art vessels and technology to effectively enforce surveillance; Priority area 2: reducing pressure on oceans and seas and creating the conditions for a sustainable blue economy 28. believes, with regard to Action 6, that it is imperative to implement the COP21 Paris UN Climate Agreement in order to mitigate the harmful impact of climate change on oceans, coastlines and ecosystems, and to address future costs of global warming and rising oceans. Global climate goals require local adaptation measures, as most climate impacts are local impacts. Therefore, as recently stated by the CoR ( 10 ), local and regional authorities have a crucial role to play in the preparation and implementation of national, EU and international adaptation frameworks dealing with the consequences of climate change in the world\u2019s oceans. Specific capacity and financial support needs to be provided to that end to all regions, including the outermost regions given their strategic locations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and in the Caribbean Sea. Moreover, in order to comply with the Paris Agreement, it is essential not only to incorporate climate change adaptation measures into maritime management, but also to leave a substantial amount of the existing fossil fuels underground. To this end, considers that in the interests of consistency, Action 6 should be strengthened through the inclusion of measures to prevent new oil exploration in sensitive areas in European seas; 29. stresses that Action 7 on fighting illegal fishing and strengthening the sustainable management of ocean food resources globally directly benefits the EU\u2019s fishing industry. This entails strengthening the existing regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) and ensuring their full operability, and requires the European Commission to have a better mandate to negotiate and support RFMOs; 30. agrees, in line with Action 8 , that fishing subsidies that harm the environment both in the EU and in third countries should be phased out. Appropriate incentives and palliative measures need to be defined to ensure the viability of communities that are heavily dependent on fisheries both in the EU and elsewhere; 31. believes that Action 9 on fighting marine litter and the \u2018sea of plastic\u2019 is one of the most relevant initiatives in this proposal. This directly benefits tourism and fisheries. If people continue to dump plastic in the natural environment at the current pace, the sea will contain more plastic than fish by 2050. The existing powers of local and regional authorities with regard to waste management and prevention can make a crucial contribution. Local authorities play an important role in terms of their capacity to recover energy from the incineration of recovered plastic. Some 28 % of waste in the EU currently goes into landfill. A robust EU environmental framework for prevention, including a possible EU ban on microplastics, needs proper enforcement at local and regional level, and continuing investment in cleaner technologies including the development of tailor-made local and regional marine litter prevention policies. This should include further progress towards a common regime not only for port reception facilities but also for fees for ship-generated waste and cargo residues, so as to discourage ships from discharge them before docking at ports. While Europe\u2019s regions and local authorities are among the largest emitters of marine litter and plastic they are also affected by litter coming from outside the EU, meaning that international cooperation is essential; 32. welcomes the European Commission\u2019s initiative to fight ocean pollution and marine litter in particular, but notes that this is a first step in achieving cleaner oceans and that the EU and Member States can lead the way by introducing a joint plan for the eventual removal of harmful substances at sea such as munitions, chemicals and nuclear materials.

        "Committee therefore underlines in this regard the importance of pilot projects which can develop and showcase European capabilities, technology and commitment to peace. Such projects can be a source both of technology exports and of know- how that can be leveraged with third countries and organisations as an incentive for the introduction of similar policies elsewhere; 33. believes that such a joint plan on ocean pollution can also bring tangible benefits for maritime regions and communities, not only directly in terms of know-how, expertise and increased civil protection capabilities in search, rescue and recovery but also more widely in the form of a resulting increase in income from tourism and fisheries, wider economic development, and a cleaner environment and health benefits, not only for Europe\u2019s coastal areas but also for adjacent regions and the entire ocean ecosystem; 34. notes that Action 10 on promoting maritime spatial planning (MSP) at global level, including possible IOC- UNESCO international guidelines on MSP, is consistent with earlier CoR opinions highlighting the EU\u2019s advanced policies on MSP and the contribution of local and regional authorities. This is also an opportunity for EU companies to provide related services and products worldwide; 35. agrees in that respect with Action 11 , which aims to achieve the global target of conserving 10 % of marine and coastal areas and promote the effective management and enforcement of marine protected areas (MPAs) to effectively create \u2018ocean parks\u2019 . Current studies of similar projects in Australia show benefits for tourism and fisheries in neighbouring regions that can be replicated elsewhere, including parts of European shores. In this connection, the Committee highlights the importance of involving and empowering local stakeholders when identifying and managing MPAs. Indeed, under- resourced MPAs or limited availability of scientific data can be a significant barrier to sustainable economic development, e. g. marine energy, ports and harbours; Priority area 3: Strengthening international ocean research and data 36. believes, concerning Action 12 , that a coherent EU strategy on ocean observation, national fisheries data and marine accounting will boost data services and observation. In that respect existing EU and international platforms for ocean and seabed mapping such as EMODnet or the \u2018Copernicus\u2019 programme of ocean observation need to be integrated and made interoperable. Initiatives such as IPBES (a global platform and intergovernmental body open to all UN Member States that aims to strengthen the link between science, politics and local knowledge in decision-making related to biodiversity and ecosystem services) should be encouraged, including the development of new tools such as a Nordic IPBES, the EU\u2019s MAES (Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services) and ESMERALDA (Enhancing Ecosystem Services Mapping for Policy and Decision Making); 37. considers that the combination of different existing and future databases builds an interdisciplinary body of marine knowledge and data that cuts across multiple fields, such as environmental protection, fisheries and aquaculture, disaster relief, first response and rescue services, border control and migration monitoring, and transport. The Committee sees no need to add more databases; rather existing databases can be coordinated so as to be useful for the Member States; 38. stresses that having compatible, redundant and overlapping databases and collection of marine knowledge and ocean mapping requires more synergies not only between the various EU and competent national institutions but also with other Member States and international organisations, as common data must be the starting points for developing common, trans-oceanic responses; 39. insists that marine knowledge must not be just an endeavour for the public sector; the private sector, fishing and sea cargo companies, marine engineering, telecommunications, biotechnology and marine oil and gas exploration companies can play a crucial role in collecting and sharing the environmental data that they gather during their own activities at sea. The EU and other international bodies must provide incentives and facilitate this so that it does not add an unnecessary burden; C 342/36 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "40. reiterates its call on the European Commission to promote best practices for the use of public-private partnerships in the blue economy ( 11 ). Such promotion should take into account the potential offered by small and medium-sized businesses and limited administrative capacity of some of the relevant national authorities; 41. highlights the asymmetric territorial impacts of many of the challenges facing our oceans, which mean that multipolicy marine data needs to be made available for local and regional authorities in a way that is easy to access and use; 42. calls, in line with earlier CoR opinions on Blue Growth ( 12 ), for more investment in \u2018blue\u2019 science and innovation ( Action 13 ) and underlines in this regard the importance of professional education and skills for seafarers, developed in close cooperation with marine industries; 43. supports the development of international ocean research, innovation and science partnerships, which should be designed to boost regions that are investing in marine research and innovation ( Action 14 ). In this connection European policies and programmes such as Horizon 2020, as well as the EMFF, LIFE, the CEF and the ERDF, can be put to good use to develop ocean research and innovation partnerships, including with third countries; 44. recognises the important role the Blue Growth strategy can play in this area, and calls for strategic initiatives to be promoted at local and regional level, and for best practices and successful projects to be disseminated and implemented in other regions, with special focus on applied research and innovation in the area of maritime and coastal activities; Final recommendations 45. believes that ocean governance affects local and regional authorities in a very asymmetric way, presenting challenges that very often they are not equipped to meet. At the same time changes in regulatory frameworks, fishing or natural resources exploitation in other parts of the world can have a direct economic or social effect in European coastal communities and those areas that are significantly dependent on ocean-related activities; 46. considers, however, that Europe\u2019s local and regional authorities have a proactive role to play in introducing sustainable policies to prevent overfishing and marine pollution, contributing to EU multilevel governance and campaigning for the EU and Member States, which have jurisdiction over 10 % of the world\u2019s oceans, to lead by example in international ocean-related negotiations; 47. requests, in line with the existing Inter-Institutional Agreement and the \u2018Better Regulation\u2019 package, that a Structured Dialogue on Ocean Governance be regularly co-organised by the Commission, Council, Parliament and CoR to jointly develop new marine-related policy initiatives with active input from representatives from the affected coastal and marine regions and communities of the EU, in particular island, isolated and outermost regions, or their directly mandated representatives, potentially encompassing the existing Stakeholder Forums of the various sea-related EU macro-regional strategies and representatives from the RFMOs.

        "Opinion of the European Committee of the Regions \u2014 People-to-people and small-scale projects in cross-border cooperation programmes (2017/C 342/06) Rapporteur: Pavel Branda (CZ/ECR), Deputy mayor of R\u00e1dlo municipality I. GENERAL COMMENTS 1. More than one third of EU citizens live and work in Europe\u2019s border regions. Those borders have a direct and indirect impact on their lives. Cross-border cooperation (CBC) has proved to be the most effective tool for overcoming the barrier effect and the dividing role of borders, integrating border areas and increasing the quality of life for border regions\u2019 citizens. 2. European Territorial Cooperation plays an important role in removing border obstacles and fostering CBC. In the period 2014-2020, more than EUR 10 billion will be invested in cooperation between regions, of which around EUR 6,6 billion will go to cross-border regions. 3. The Interreg A projects have achieved many tangible outcomes for many European citizens in very diverse territories all over the EU. An important and successful tool in CBC programmes ( 1 ) are people-to-people and small-scale projects, designed to foster the convergence of bordering regions and initiating grassroots contact among people. 4. People-to-people (P2P) and small-scale projects can be defined by their size, duration and content. Small-scale projects are usually smaller in size than regular big projects (e.g. maximum size of EUR 100 000 ( 2 )). They can also have a limited duration and their main focus is to finance initiatives in many different areas of CBC with a local impact, in order to support the main thematic objectives of EU programmes (including trust-building, creating favourable framework conditions and a bottom-up approach and initiating new partnerships). People-to-people projects are small-scale projects focusing primarily on promoting contacts and interaction between people on different sides of the border. These usually have a smaller budget and also a limited duration. The activities of the project happen in smaller geographic areas (commonly at Euroregional level) and their approaches are commonly place-based. 5. People-to-people (P2P) projects and small-scale projects are carried out in a wide range of fields such as culture (e.g. learning the neighbouring language), sport, tourism, education and vocational training, economy, science, environmental protection and ecology, healthcare, transport and small infrastructure (cross-border gaps), administrative cooperation, promotional activities, etc. 6. P2P and small-scale projects are accessible to a wide range of beneficiaries: municipalities, NGOs (numerous types of associations, platforms, networks, foundations, churches, etc.), educational institutions (schools, vocational training centres and universities), research and business-support institutions, among others. 7. These projects have been supported by several generations of CBC programmes. In the current period, P2P and small- scale projects in 19 CBC programmes (approximately in one third of them) are mainly being supported through a Small Project Fund (SPF) or similar instrument (sometimes called micro-projects, disposition fund, or framework project to support small projects/initiatives). These SPFs usually take the form of an \u2018umbrella project\u2019 under which several smaller sub-projects are implemented. 8. In general, the funding has been rather low \u2014 from 1,5 % up to 20 % of the allocation of the programmes (lower in the old EU, while in the new Member States and along the \u2018old\u2019 external borders the demand has been much higher). C 342/38 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 1 ) It is noted that similar cross-border initiatives exist also outside of CBC programmes (e.g. at French borders between the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es- Orientales department/Generalitat de Catalunya, etc.), which may also provide valuable input. ( 2 ) Size of projects for which omnibus regulation suggests simplified cost procedures. ",
        "9. Independent studies dealing with CBC and all Interreg evaluations ( 3 ) to date confirm that in Interreg A programmes the best qualitative results are not achieved primarily through flagship projects, but, rather, success is determined by the variety of different genuinely cross-border projects addressing region-specific needs while directly involving citizens, local authorities and civil society organisations. Quite often the management of these Interreg A programmes (sub-programmes) is decentralised. From the beginning of Interreg (1990), the programmes with the best evaluation results have often been those managed in a decentralised way, many of them including support to P2P projects and small-scale projects. 10. Despite their positive impact, these projects face some major difficulties. They are not anchored in the regulations, and bigger projects are often preferred by managing authorities as being more cost-effective (the higher administration cost of P2P projects) and having a measurable impact. It is also difficult to link the soft effects of such projects to indicators related to the EU2020 strategy focusing on jobs and growth (lack of methodology and suitable evaluation indicators). 11. The main objective of this opinion is to provide an evidence-based list of the benefits and added value of such projects and their decentralised implementation through Euroregions and similar structures such as EGTCs; to provide recommendations for their further simplification; and, ultimately, to put forward specific proposals for future CBC programmes, thus contributing to the debate on the future of cohesion policy post-2020. II. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS (CoR) Added value and benefits of people-to-people and small-scale projects 12. considers that P2P and small-scale projects in general have a great European added value and contribute considerably to the overall objective of CBC programmes by means of overcoming border obstacles and integrating border areas and their citizens. The following specific benefits of such projects should be underlined: \u2014 Helping to develop larger projects and substantially supporting effective cooperation within the whole CBC programme by: \u2014 improving the necessary professional and intercultural skills of beneficiaries and building capacities at local and regional level, \u2014 covering the areas of legal and administrative cooperation, \u2014 providing room for experimentation \u2014 small-scale projects are great instruments to test innovative ideas and tools in CBC, and \u2014 serving as \u2018incubators for bigger projects\u2019 \u2014 contributing to greater quality in big projects through prior testing in small projects. \u2014 Learning about the culture of neighbouring areas. Promoting intercultural skills among the citizens of border regions. \u2014 Promote the ability of people to study, work and do business across borders. \u2014 Facilitating communication between people. These projects often help overcome the language barrier by stimulating language learning. \u2014 Developing interpersonal contacts and building up partnerships. Many cross-border partnerships (also of smaller organisations) are initiated and then developed into long-term cooperation by P2P and small-scale projects. \u2014 Mobilisation of wider civil society and even encouragement of a cross-border civil society as an important contribution to territorial cohesion. \u2014 Exchange of experiences. These projects create a great platform for sharing experiences and best practices between all CBC players from civil society to local and regional authorities. 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/39 ( 3 ) For instance: DG for internal policies: Territorial Governance and Cohesion Policy, European Parliament, Brussels, 2015; Panteia and partners, Ex-Post Evaluation of Interreg III 2000-2006, European Commission, 2010. ",
        "\u2014 Addressing local problems. Finding local solutions. P2P and small-scale projects help implement common visions. Many problems can be solved only through cooperation at local level. \u2014 Dealing with topics of everyday relevance (e.g. ensuring better public services) and apolitical approach to forming people\u2019s own present and future. \u2014 Building trust. There is a lack of trust in Europe today. These tangible P2P projects are a great instrument in restoring trust across borders and in Europe. They constitute an investment for the future. \u2014 Removal of stereotypes and prejudices caused by the sometimes-difficult history of border areas or even present developments. CBC and especially people-to-people projects help heal the \u2018scars\u2019 produced by borders. They advertise the principle of tolerance and respect. They can play a significant role in reconciliation along the problematic borders in the Western Balkans and in the countries of the Eastern Partnership. \u2014 Promoting the European idea. It is in the cross-border interactions of people and in working together with your neighbours where the benefit of European integration is felt. These projects supported by the EU can help regenerate enthusiasm about Europe; Advantages of decentralised management 13. sees nevertheless advantages for increased partnerships where the size of the eligible territory is bigger, however is aware of the possible negative impact: it is harder for the programmes to reflect the specific needs of different parts of a large territory. There is a tendency to support larger projects and this support becomes less accessible for local/regional players; 14. suggests that decentralised management of such programmes, for example through promotion of sub-programmes and also enabling the financing of small-scale and P2P projects, is the best solution to this trend that would keep the programmes closer to the citizens; 15. points out the advantages of Small Project Funds (or similar instruments funding P2P and small-scale projects) being managed in a decentralised way: \u2014 Developing projects instead of just administering projects. Decentralised management is conducive to: working with potential applicants on the ground and helping the projects to succeed, connecting partners across borders, developing project ideas, helping convert these ideas into actual project applications, monitoring the projects, focusing on prevention and helping correct mistakes, etc. \u2014 Closeness to applicants. This is especially important for smaller municipalities, civil society, non-profit organisations, etc. \u2014 Accessibility of funding. For such smaller projects it is easier to secure co-financing and pre-financing. Application procedures are often simpler than for big projects. \u2014 Flexibility. This instrument is suitable for addressing specific local issues that could be changing; 16. is aware that this approach may result in comparably higher administration costs. It should be stressed that, in addition to the usual project administration, many other activities take place (e.g. raising awareness, advice for preparation, implementation and accounting). Without this decentralised care and bottom-up approach such projects are difficult to realise; Role of Euroregions and similar cross-border structures 17. notes that the advantages of decentralised implementation of P2P and small-scale projects are best achieved through the involvement of Euroregions and similar cross-border structures ( 4 ). They could also have the legal form of an EGTC, which are very suitable for such a role; C 342/40 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 4 ) The importance of Euroregions in developing CBC was stressed in the European Parliament resolution on the role of \u2018Euroregions\u2019 in the development of regional policy (2004/2257(INI)). ",
        "18. recommends that, in order to ensure successful implementation, these structures should have considerable experience in CBC at local and regional level. They should be: \u2014 permanent, \u2014 cross-border ( 5 ), \u2014 of a public nature ( 6 ): composed mainly by local and regional authorities, \u2014 focusing on cross-border cooperation as their main objective, and \u2014 experienced with EU programmes and projects; Simplification as a prerequisite for successful implementation of small projects 19. emphasises that in order to preserve the added value of P2P and small-scale projects and their decentralised management, these projects and procedures must be very simple; 20. points out that the position of the CoR was expressed in its opinion on Simplification of ESIF from the perspective of local and regional authorities ( 7 ). Recommendations regarding CBC such as removal of ETC from the area of application of State aid rules, or a more flexible approach in applying the thematic objectives of EU2020, are even more relevant for P2P and small-scale projects; 21. states that simpler procedures have to be proportionate to the sums concerned, both for the management of these projects (administration, financial management, control mechanisms, etc.), and for the target groups (reduction of administrative burdens, target-oriented advance information, application of once-only principle ( 8 )). These simpler procedures must be applied in all phases of the project cycle; 22. recommends that during control, monitoring and audit, it is necessary to focus more on the content and the results and not merely on the processes; 23. appeals to all shared management levels to enable and to use suitable simplified cost options as the main approach regarding P2P and small-scale projects. Despite the necessary control of public funding, the CoR calls for the use of the once-only principle, lump sums, flat rates and simplified statements of costs (e.g. standardised unit costs) to be promoted as regards accounting for these projects; Communication of the results \u2014 evaluation of Small Project Funds 24. believes that in the light of the current situation in the EU (growing nationalism, UK withdrawal from the EU, migration crisis, economic and monetary difficulties) there is clearly an increasingly strong need to communicate the specific benefits and added value of EU action. Cross-border cooperation and especially the P2P and small-scale projects are among the most tangible examples of such specific benefits and added value in the everyday life of citizens. Here EU funds have clear positive effects in the real life, prospects and perceptions of EU citizens; 25. suggests that efforts should be made by all players to increase the visibility of the results and benefits of such projects \u2014 not so much in the border regions where they are obvious but at the national (Member States) and European levels (EU institutions) that make decisions about cohesion policy. This opinion, together with a brochure containing specific project examples, aims to contribute to these efforts. Communication of these results may also be facilitated by European Cooperation Day; 26. recognises the need to implement a specific methodology to evaluate Small Project Funds (and similar instruments) supporting P2P and small-scale projects. Given the \u2018soft\u2019 nature of P2P projects, it is clear that standard outcome indicators are not suitable for such evaluation (e.g. for measuring the level of trust or overcoming prejudices). Here it is suggested that just the fact that cross-border cooperation between citizens and institutions of border regions takes place is a positive result 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/41 ( 5 ) De facto not always de jure . ( 6 ) According to the Public Procurement Directive, not necessarily founded under public law. ( 7 ) COR-2016-00008-00-00-AC-TRA.

        "in itself (similar to the growing number of students studying abroad thanks to the Erasmus programme). The number of participating citizens and cooperating partners should be sufficient. Small-scale projects shall contribute to the indicators of the given investment priority but also with these projects that are not purely P2P, the aspect of cooperating partners and number of persons actively involved in the CBC should be considered, as it builds the capacity of such partners to further develop such cooperation in the future. It extends the scope of EU-driven operations with a place-based approach and focused on the citizens, who become committed players to build up more Europe on the ground. Very often, the professional and intercultural skills acquired by members of the cross-border project teams are more valuable than the result of the project as such (small-scale investment); Recommendations for future CBC programmes post-2020 27. recommends that people-to-people projects and small-scale projects be anchored in the regulations governing EU support for cross-border cooperation as a legitimate instrument in CBC programmes and calls on the Commission to make the necessary provisions in the proposal for the next generation of regulations; 28. also recommends that people-to-people and small-scale projects be encouraged by the Commission to be part of the CBC programmes, especially where there is the demand for such projects at local and regional level. Sufficient allocations should be secured to satisfy this bottom-up demand. Special attention should be paid to the borders that will be affected by UK withdrawal from the EU ( 9 ) where solutions for continuing cooperation with UK local and regional authorities and other partners should be found; 29. points out that the full benefits of such projects can be achieved through decentralised management either through Small Project Funds, or any similar instrument or directly by steering committees on the ground. It is essential that each border region is free to use its existing instruments and procedures that have proved effective for many years, ensuring the continuity of such funding with the overall objective to keep the programmes closer to the citizens; 30. recommends that Euroregions or similar structures and EGTCs should be the framework to guarantee the decentralised implementation of P2P and small-scale projects, ensuring their continuity and taking into account the already existing roles of such structures (e.g. \u2018umbrella project\u2019 recipients) that have proved useful. In border areas where these structures are not present, their creation should be encouraged or other suitable solutions should be found respecting as much as possible the principles stated above; 31. emphasises that in order to preserve the added value and benefits of people-to-people and small-scale projects, they and their management must be kept as simple as possible. More emphasis should be placed on content than on procedures, and simplified cost options should be preferred; 32. points out that P2P often bring together partners in public or semi-public services, they alleviate the effect of differences in regulation and financing between organisations in different Member States. However, beyond temporary project funding, successful P2P projects should be able to be continued by structural funding. More effort should be made in the next programming period to feed experiences at the border to national legislators. Member States should be engaged in a border-compact to reduce border effects resulting from national regulation and financing; 33. calls on the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament to take these specific recommendations into account and include all necessary rules to implement them when preparing legislative proposals for the next generation of CBC programmes, setting up these programmes and during their successful implementation. This will ensure that the benefits of European integration are felt strongly among the citizens of Europe\u2019s border regions. Brussels, 12 July 2017.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMENDMENTS Amendment 1 Recital 1 Text proposed by the Commission CoR amendment The objective of this Directive is to remove obstacles to the exercise of fundamental freedoms , such as the free movement of capital and freedom of establishment , which result from differences between national laws and proce- dures on preventive restructuring, insolvency and second chance. This Directive aims at removing such obstacles by ensuring that viable enterprises in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frame- works which enable them to continue operating; that honest over indebted entrepreneurs have a second chance after a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time; and that the effectiveness of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The objective of this Directive is to remove obstacles to the exercise of freedoms linked to the single market , which result from differences between national laws and proce- dures on preventive restructuring, insolvency and second chance. This Directive aims at removing such obstacles by ensuring that viable enterprises in financial difficulties have access to effective preventive restructuring frameworks which enable them to continue operating; that honest over indebted entrepreneurs have a second chance after a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time; and that the effectiveness of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures is improved, in particular with a view to responding to the requirements of worker consultation (Article 27 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights) and shortening their length. The preventive solutions some- times referred to as \u2018pre-pack\u2019 are part of a growing trend in modern insolvency law which favours approaches aimed at the recovery of a company in difficulties or at least saving the parts of it which are still economically viable, rather than the traditional approach of liquidation. 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/43 ",

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS (CoR) 1. welcomes the European Commission\u2019s communication on \u2018Europe\u2019s next leaders: the start-up and scale-up initiative\u2019 as a development and extension of the Small Business Act; at the same time calls on the Commission to update the Small Business Act and to maintain its homogeneity; 2. agrees with the concerns expressed in the communication that the continuing excessive fragmentation of the single market (including the digital single market) might constrain the growth potential of start-ups and scale-ups; 3. restates its full support for measures aimed at developing innovative entrepreneurship and dismantling the obstacles to its development; 4. points out that start-up and scale-up businesses tend to accommodate flexible forms of employment, including teleworking, flexible working hours, temporary agency work and employee leasing, contract work and work- and job- sharing. When presented as a genuine option for the employee, such forms of employment can have a positive impact of achieving a work/life balance and help to address long-term unemployment; 5. emphasises that cooperation between European, national, regional and local public authorities is of great importance to creating conditions enabling start-ups to scale up; 6. calls on the Commission to take steps to encourage Member States to ensure that all levels of education (both business and non-business) take greater account of subjects such as creativity, entrepreneurship, economics and finance; 7. stresses the role played by regions\u2019 and cities\u2019 achievements in the innovation-driven development of the world economy due to the fact that they are able to adapt in a flexible way to evolving market, technological and cultural circumstances; 8. points out that support for innovative operators with particularly fast growth rates has an effect on other market operators. Together with the current trend of efforts to promote the circular economy, the social economy and the sharing economy ( 1 ), support measures and legal facilitation will produce synergies, thus contributing to the development of societies as a whole; 9. emphasises that measures to more closely link sectoral strategies, intertwining research, business and public authorities at all levels, will be crucial to ensuring that the objectives achieved have a common denominator; Removing regulatory, informational and legal barriers 10. emphasises that the heterogeneity and instability of EU Member States\u2019 laws are one of the key problems constraining the expansion of European start-ups ( 2 ); 11. encourages the Commission to attempt to clearly define start-ups and scale-ups, and to further streamline legal solutions for SMEs; 12. agrees with the current analytical line developed in the Horizon 2020 programme (concerning the possibility of making use of expert recommendations) and in the work of the European Observatory for Clusters and Industrial Change; 13. proposes revising the set of tools and measures after three measurement cycles so as not only to collect illustrative data on start-ups and scale-ups, but also to develop research on qualitative aspects, which will make it easier to identify problems; C 342/46 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 1 ) The local and regional dimension of the sharing economy , rapporteur: Benedetta Brighenti, ref.: CDR 2698/2015; Collaborative economy and online platforms: a shared view of cities and regions , rapporteur: Benedetta Brighenti, ref.: CDR 4163/2016; The role of the social economy in restoring economic growth and combating unemployment , rapporteur: Lu\u00eds Gomes, ref.: CDR 1691/2015.

This fragmentation constrains SMEs\u2019 \u2014 and especially start-ups\u2019 \u2014 development and cross-border trade; 16. suggests that the Commission make additional funds available to help start-ups develop and implement strategies for protecting intellectual property rights; Further economic activity \u2014 second chance 17. recognises the problem of ineffective and excessively long business insolvency proceedings in EU Member States that deprive many honest but over-indebted entrepreneurs of a second chance; 18. welcomes the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventive restructuring frameworks, second chance and measures to increase the efficiency of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures and amending Directive 2012/30/EU, of 22 November 2016 (COM(2016) 723) \u2014 which aims to reduce the key barriers to the free flow of capital stemming from differences in Member States\u2019 restructuring and insolvency frameworks; expresses the concern, however, that the proposal is limited to financial aspects, with employed workers treated as creditors of a company on the same footing as banks or other investors, and that the recovery of a company is presented purely as a financial reorganisation of stakeholders; 19. finds the Commission\u2019s argument for the added value of implementing the proposed legislative solutions at EU level convincing and therefore considers the proposal for a directive consistent with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality; 20. expresses concern that the current inability to harmonise Member States\u2019 legal systems relating to insolvency proceedings means that this legislative instrument will not make a meaningful contribution to increasing the number of start-ups remaining on the market for longer than two to three years; 21. recalls the adoption on 20 May 2015 by the European Parliament and the Council of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings in the various Member States and supports the approach whereby insolvency proceedings are no longer to be seen merely in terms of liquidation, but as a tool for ensuring that the resources of the company \u2014 including its employees\u2019 right to work \u2014 are preserved and, as far as possible, ensuring the company\u2019s survival. Also welcomes the establishment, by June 2019, of a digital system of interconnected insolvency registers to be set up in each Member State, and which it will be possible to access free of charge through the European e-Justice Portal. Nonetheless draws attention to the fact that additional support is needed to increase the specialisation of judges and the professionalism of practitioners involved in such procedures; 22. welcomes the European Parliament legislative resolution of 5 April 2017 on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Money Market Funds (COM(2013)0615) and the proposed establishment of a new category of money market fund (MMF), the low-volatility net asset value (LVNAV) MMF specifically designed for small companies in the real economy; 23. calls on public authorities at national, regional and local level to initiate or become actively involved in: \u2014 campaigns to raise public awareness of what it means to fail when pursuing business success, \u2014 campaigns to promote a culture of rescuing businesses rather than liquidating them, \u2014 campaigns to promote an early warning tool, \u2014 measures to promote economic and financial education for entrepreneurs, primarily aimed at future entrepreneurs or start-ups with a view to improving their level of knowledge and changing their approach to the various sources of capital, 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/47 ",

In this regard, suggests that the Commission take measures to support the networking of leading regions with regions that have economies based on agriculture; 34. although much still remains to be done, welcomes the progress that has been made in terms of entrepreneurship in less-developed regions, and suggests that the Commission continue supporting the current initiatives to promote business development in these regions and that it consider implementing new ones, such as a separate instrument dedicated to networking projects; 35. underlines that additional measures to strengthen and network actors working to promote entrepreneurship in traditional economic sectors, including the craft sector and the cultural and creative industries, rural and peripheral regions, and peri-urban areas would be highly desirable; C 342/48 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",

Local and regional authorities are in the closest proximity to local entrepreneurs and it is worth taking advantage of their significant expertise about local business environments; 45. considers that, with the digital single market, competition will take on a new dimension and every region will have to compete with other European entities that benefit from the same legal bases. This, therefore, is an opportunity for start- ups that have not had particularly good opportunities to date to internationalise and access new cross-border markets; Access to finance 46. points out that start-ups\u2019 and scale-ups\u2019 recourse to innovative and non-standard solutions means that the effects of implementing them can only be predicted to a limited extent. This also makes it more difficult to access funds from regular programmes; 47. recommends that the Commission should loosen the financing system so that it can be more flexible towards innovative ideas, and that it should encourage bodies that distribute European funds to be more attentive to the selection of experts; 48. welcomes the Commission\u2019s idea of creating a European venture capital fund of funds, which might reduce the market fragmentation of venture capital funds in the EU; 49. proposes launching analyses of the possibility of bringing in local venture capital in local and regional authorities; 50. calls on the Commission to promote differentiation between the various sources of funding; venture capital funds, private equity and business angels are still underdeveloped in Europe; 51. commends the proposal to increase the budget for COSME and, with the proviso that no funds are diverted away from the Connecting Europe Facility or the Horizon 2020 programme, in principle also the proposal to increase the budget for EFSI, which allows for additional financing for SMEs in the start-up and scale-up phases.

        "to promote integration and partnerships between SMEs and start-ups; 52. welcomes the direction of the Commission\u2019s measures that aim to create additional incentives for venture capital financing, e.g. by making it possible for private funds or local and regional authorities\u2019 funds to benefit from public guarantee when raising debt financing, as this can contribute to increasing equity and debt investments in start-ups and scale-ups; 53. calls for a non-financial support programme for start-ups and scale-ups to be developed at EU level, which will enable new markets to be explored, contributing to an increase in the number of jobs and the further development of innovation within the EU; 54. considers it necessary to enhance a structured European investment ecosystem by means of economic and fiscal support measures that attract and encourage private investment in innovative companies, so that they can develop and grow in optimal economic and financial conditions and achieve a high degree of competitiveness. To this end, it is particularly important to strengthen alternative financing instruments (risk capital, equity loans, guarantees, etc.). A genuine simplification of how financial instruments co-financed by the Structural Funds are implemented is therefore needed; 55. draws attention to the intensive development of crowdfunding platforms as an alternative source of financing for innovative solutions created by start-ups; 56. calls on the Commission to analyse the opportunities and risks of crowdfunding for European society, in particular those that directly impact investors who might not have the same access to information and might be less prepared for this kind of transaction compared to professional investors; 57. points out that a well-designed regulatory framework governing how crowdfunding platforms operate across the entire EU will enable the potential of this source to be fully harnessed. Standards ensuring that investors\u2019 interests are protected should be an integral part of this framework; 58. supports the strengthening of Startup Europe and the expansion of its scope beyond the ICT sector and web start- ups. In this regard, the Committee would recommend further simplification in order to provide increasingly smooth and effective guidance to start-ups that want to access the numerous possibilities offered by European programmes; Start-up activity in areas of particular social importance 59. calls on the European Commission to adopt a strategy \u2014 based on existing areas of particular interest such as the silver economy, social entrepreneurship, and the triple helix model \u2014 relating to innovative and socially-focused business initiatives that enhance quality of life, so that the system of incentives supports bottom-up activities and social creativity; 60. draws attention to the scope for cooperation between start-ups and scale-ups, on the one hand, and large businesses, on the other. It is important to apply good practice from EU regions, where cooperation leads to synergies between businesses of different sizes and from different sectors; 61. welcomes the Commission\u2019s assurance that it will launch a Social Innovation Challenge Platform; 62. points out that linking such a platform with the public procurement system could produce added value, potentially affecting social enterprises\u2019 growth rate. However, the system would need to be made more flexible so that problems can be solved creatively \u2014 i.e. in an optimal way, from the point of view of the final beneficiaries \u2014 and not predictably, in terms of structural indicators.

The prerequisites are intelligent transport systems (ITSs) and infrastructure. It is also important to take account of ecosystems reflecting local environmental characteristics and ensure the involvement of LRAs in the implementation phase; 5. highlights that European cities and regions, by playing an active role in establishing smart telecommunications and transport infrastructure, may ensure the efficient use of connected and automated vehicles along the corridors of the TEN-T network which crosses the borders and territories of the Member States within urban areas in delivery of SUMPS and regional sustainable transport master plans; 6. acknowledges that IT solutions shape transport business models and patterns. LRAs should apply easy to use, inclusive IT solutions in order to deploy ITSs in their \u2018smart city\u2019 and area mobility developments; 7. draws attention to the need for simplified databases and interconnection among them by proposing development of European standards which can facilitate interoperability of data, services and technical solutions at all levels. This data should be provided and guaranteed by the relevant regional transport authorities within a single data compression system; Fair and efficient transport pricing 8. considers that LRAs have significant legal and financial competences in their own right (e.g. using parking spaces, bus lanes, procurement benefits, \u2018green\u2019 registration plates or tariff reductions on tolls) that can influence consumer preferences and choices, encouraging the use of alternative fuel vehicles.

        "by the conditions imposed on the use of the ESI Funds as they do not allow subsidies to be granted for the renewal of private vehicle fleets. The effect of this is that renovation is delayed and opportunities for transport efficiency and competitiveness and better air quality in cities, by means of energy and environmental improvements, for example in taxi services or last mile deliveries, are being missed; 9. highlights that, for pricing purposes, information on transport available from different mobility-related sources must be harmonised. Integrated ticketing still faces obstacles against its wider use as modes of public transport differ in terms of profitability. The cost of introducing integrated pricing may decrease or turn the overall financial profits of a given transport mode into overall financial losses; 10. warns that despite the considerable efforts and resources that have been mobilised to support public and multimodal transport, information available to passengers using multimodal transport is entirely inadequate. The situation is even worse with regard to ticketing services. This is not because it would be impossible from a technical point of view to provide detailed and user-friendly information on multimodal transport or services, or to provide users with information on ticketing; rather, it is due to the unwillingness of public transport operators to provide information and services. The EU should therefore pass legislation making it mandatory to publish timetables and other travel information and to make this information fully accessible to all EU citizens in such a way that they can all use it as easily and effectively as possible; draws attention in this connection to the European Committee of the Regions opinion on Multimodal travel information, planning and ticketing services, CdR 4895/2014; 11. all transport modes should contribute, in proportion with the amount they pollute, to the external costs that they cause, following the polluter pays principle; 12. points out that power grids, electricity storage, trade, and the management of public infrastructure will all need to be modernised, along with transport rules and vehicle taxation, to be properly equipped for new and innovative transportation modes, including battery or hydrogen fuel cell. In this regard, interoperable and easy payment solutions for charging these kinds of electric vehicle are also recommended; 13. draws attention to the fact that the tax exemption system applied to aviation fuel and international flight tickets represents a clear market distortion in the transport sector. Calls for EU Member States to discuss the existing international fuel taxation system with the International Civil Aviation Organisation so as to ensure consistency with international climate change commitments, without prejudice to recognition of the specific features and interests of outermost regions; Promoting multimodality 14. encourages, in the context of SUMPs, multimodality and coordinated use of low- or zero-emission urban-regional transport and logistics, and rail, maritime and river transport. In particular the shift from road transport to other, lower emissions modes would have significant potential in terms of lowering emissions. In any case, modal shift solutions involving low-emission mobility should receive high priority, for instance, by reconsidering existing hidden or open subsidies to road transport; 15. calls for a new approach to short sea shipping by developing the use of ecological bonus schemes and considering motorways of the sea as infrastructures which should be subject to an adapted approach in relation to state aid controls. This approach is particularly crucial for areas which remain peripheral to European transport corridors; 16. in this regard, specific thought should be given to urban nodes and logistic platforms as defined by the TEN-T (basic and general network) and by the 2013 CEF Regulation, given their role as a cornerstone of sustainable and intermodal mobility at Member State, regional and EU level. It is therefore proposed that a debate on this issue be held in the various European forums on multimodal corridors where the question of nodes is specifically addressed; 17. supports the EU playing an active role in the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation to reduce emissions of the maritime and aviation sectors.

        "SCALING UP THE USE OF LOW-EMISSION ALTERNATIVE ENERGY FOR TRANSPORT An effective framework for low-emission alternative energy 18. encourages, by supporting the development of the energy sector, the introduction of alternative energy sources in transport, paving the way to \u2018zero-emissions\u2019 transport; 19. underlines that Member States, regions and municipalities are encouraged to invest in alternative energy for transport through non-reimbursable grants under the cohesion policy, while complying with the principle of technological neutrality laid down by Directive 2014/94/EU on alternative fuels infrastructure; 20. advocates a broader uptake of advanced renewable biofuels that are produced in an environmentally friendly manner and generate lower carbon emissions than traditional fossil fuels, in order to decarbonise the transport sector. In this connection, non-food (synthetic) or feed-based biofuels should be given priority. The expected positive impacts are work opportunities and job creation in rural and less developed areas, in addition to producing extra economic value added. As advanced biofuels are currently not considered competitive sources of energy without support, their production should be subsidised to compete with fossil fuels or food-based biofuels; 21. points out that the Directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure ( 2 ) has already set out mandatory requirements regarding the use of electricity, natural gas and hydrogen to fuel vehicles; 22. stresses that alternative energies, biomethane and biofuels currently available will partly replace conventional diesel- or petrol-powered vehicles. This enhances energy security by reducing demand for conventional fuels; 23. calls for a widely acceptable definition of biofuels and the adoption, in connection with this, of a set of criteria on sustainability and carbon dioxide reduction that would boost legal certainty, and support law enforcement and investment decision-making in production and use of biofuels; 24. advises that it is important to take into account specific national, regional and local situations, and the different raw materials available locally and regionally. The total energy balance (including fuel production) should be taken into account when regulating use of alternative fuels from renewable resources; 25. emphasises that from a regional and local point of view the ideal low emission alternative energy should be locally produced, and stored and used/consumed locally, too. Producing low emission alternative energy and storing it for local consumption is even more important for remote regions such as islands and the outermost regions, in order to reduce their external dependency; The roll-out of infrastructure for alternative fuels 26. stresses that low- or zero-emission mobility is expected to revolutionise transport in terms of networks, vehicles and fuels. The prerequisite of that is cheap, accessible energy and fuels. In addition to electric and hydrogen engines, which offer a non-polluting option, advanced biofuels which do not compete with foodstuff production and are produced in an environmentally friendly manner have an important role to play in the achievement of the emission reduction targets. Hence the focus should be mainly, but not exclusively, on developing affordable charging infrastructure for electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, given the gas\u2019s fuel function and storage capacity. However, support should also be given \u2014 in the form of financial incentives \u2014 to low emission technologies using, for example, advanced biofuels; 27. recommends that binding deadlines be set for all levels of public administration by which tenders for the purchase of new vehicles for their fleets and public transport service concessions must be exclusively for alternative energy vehicles; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/59 ( 2 ) Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure.

Electric transportation infrastructure needs to be constructed along the strategic routes linking regions of Europe as cross-border electric mobility (e-mobility) may overcome internal market fragmentation. Most European islands, for example, represent an ideal location for e-mobility on account of their size. Appropriate deployment of recharging infrastructure could quickly contribute to the large-scale take up of electric mobility in these regions; 31. stresses that locally produced and stored electric energy could provide a stable and inexpensive fuel source to accelerate the transition to low-emission e-mobility. The gradual roll-out of such mobility can address its competitive disadvantage compared to conventional fuels. Decentralised electricity storage integrated into the grid can offer additional services to the electricity system such as helping to overcome the mismatch between the energy supply from renewable sources and the demand for energy at periods of high and low demand or helping to regulate frequency. To this end, it is also necessary to facilitate the active involvement of consumers in managing the electricity system, for example through demand aggregators, removing existing legislative barriers; Interoperability and standardisation for electric mobility 32. shares the EC\u2019s view on introducing common technical and technological standards, taking into account the needs of different Member States and regions. Standardisation will drive interoperability between local transport systems within individual regions and between different regions; 33. is concerned that the development of national implementation plans for the roll out of alternative fuels infrastructure is being done, in most Member States, without the active contribution of the competent regional and local authorities in spite of these plans being a clear case where multilevel governance is needed, and that plans to promote e- mobility are receiving insufficient political and budgetary support; 34. points out that electric vehicle charging stations are to be standardised and calls on the EC to support the roll-out of electric charging stations by developing standards enabling integration of fuelling stations into existing buildings/facilities in keeping with the current legislation in each country; MOVING TOWARDS ZERO-EMISSION VEHICLES Improvements in vehicle testing to regain consumer trust 35. welcomes the recent arrangements for measuring and verifying emissions of harmful substances from vehicles, so as to ensure that the environmental performance of vehicles is transparent and reliable. This will help to implement limits on air pollutant emissions and increase consumer confidence. Emission threshold values for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles must be appropriate to ensure the attainment of the objectives and agreements concerning emissions of pollutants and human health; 36. supports the drafting of new guidelines on vehicle labelling, as this helps avoid misleading consumers. Rules on how values measured via the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedures (WLTP) and the old procedure (New European Driving Cycle \u2014 NEDC) need to be clarified and should be displayed. Amending not only the guidelines, but also the Directive on labelling ( 3 ), should be considered.

With regard to long-distance freight transport, proposes that the transition of lorry fleets from diesel to natural gas be speeded up, as this is the only fuel capable of replacing diesel, with almost zero polluting emissions and less carbon content than diesel; 39. welcomes efforts by the EC to promote the Clean Bus Deployment Initiative in the EU, with a view to supporting better information exchange and market scale by providing a platform for cities, regions, operators and manufacturers. It strengthens the confidence of European bus manufacturers in the future demand for clean, alternatively fuelled buses, makes better use of forthcoming public tenders and is more effective at seeking financing solutions for larger tenders through e.g. the European Investment Bank; 40. thinks it necessary to increase EU aid intensity, to improve synergy among the financial resources from the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and the European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds, and to make use of subsidies. This would facilitate the rapid replacement of current, polluting public transport fleets and ensure the best use of all available EU funding; Air transport and track-based transport 41. emphasises the advantages of track-based modes of transport operated using renewable electric energy or alternative fuels, provided they are economically sustainable; 42. points out that the necessary infrastructure must be put in place both locally and regionally, in those regions where rail is less developed, so that they can make use of rail transport under the same conditions as the rest of the Member States with a view to creating a Single European Railway Area; AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR LOW-EMISSION MOBILITY Energy Union: linking the transport and energy systems 43. is pleased to note that the strategy is considered as a good step within the 2030 climate and energy framework adopted by the Council of the EU on 23-24 October 2014 ( 5 ), and with the Paris Agreement adopted on 12 December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( 6 ), by linking two major players within the EU: transport on the demand side, and key players in the field of energy production and transmission on the supply side; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/61 ( 4 ) Directive 2009/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of clean and energy- efficient road transport vehicles.

By investing in research and innovation, regions and municipalities can support low-emission renewable energies, smart grids and sustainable urban transport; 47. supports capitalising on the results of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (H2020) for more innovative low-emission mobility solutions involving services/investments; 48. encourages the development of innovative technologies for LNG tanks in ships and passenger coaches to optimise the efficiency of storage of this substitute fuel and calls for the financing of demonstration on freight and passenger vessels and long-distance passenger coaches to this end; 49. also encourages the development of innovative technologies enabling the use of biofuels such as methanol which is produced from the processing of waste, including in the engines of cargo and passenger ships and therefore calls for funding for this; 50. also calls for funding for dock electrification, and above all, a binding regulatory framework that applies in all EU ports; Digital technologies: Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), connected and self-conducting vehicles 51. notes that IT solutions promote mobility based on the combined use of all modes of transport for passengers and freight (e.g. integrated ticketing and toll systems, intermodal freight transport documents, electronic route planning, real- time passenger information, etc.); 52. notes that the emergence of connected and automated (self-conducting) vehicles using digital technology may offer many opportunities for tackling the negative effects of transport and for providing public transport in more sparsely populated areas; calls strongly for measures on connected and automated driving to be implemented, in accordance with the Amsterdam Declaration ( 8 ); welcomes the adoption of the EU strategy on cooperative intelligent transport systems on 30 November 2016 in this regard ( 9 ); calls in this connection for a more coherent vision of innovative sustainable transport developments and for stronger links between the Commission\u2019s various closely related work packages and communication concerning them; 53. stresses that European regions want to be involved in establishing smart telecommunications and transport infrastructure. By doing so, connected and automated vehicles can be used efficiently and without hindrance along the corridors of TEN-T, and in urban and rural regions; 54. emphasises that the proportionality and subsidiarity principles should empower LRAs to decide if and how to deploy ITSs and clean vehicles, as recognised by the EU Urban Mobility Action Plan, to decrease their transport emission and congestion problems, and to promote social inclusion; C 342/62 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 7 ) Clean Energy for All Europeans \u2014 unlocking Europe\u2019s growth potential.

        "Skills 55. recognises that the shift towards low-emission mobility creates challenges for the labour market, and therefore it is a priority to ensure that the workforce is retrained for new jobs. Despite high unemployment rates, there is a shortage of staff in many important areas of the transport sector as result of a lack of digital skills; 56. regrets that the proposals set out in the previous 2009 communication on urban mobility as regards local authorities developing sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs) are not included in the current communication. Therefore highlights the need to make it clear, both within this strategy and in the initiatives and acts implementing it, that the integrated planning of cities is a key factor in developing sustainable mobility, including through the design and implementation of sustainable urban mobility plans; 57. stresses the importance of dual training systems, proposes intensive exchange of experience between EU regions on good practices in the area of low-emission mobility, involving vocational education and businesses; Investment 58. welcomes the fact that innovation and development of infrastructure are at the heart of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) objectives for incentivising combined (public-private) investments for transport and infrastructure. EFSI, in combination with non-reimbursable grants from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), could provide for more intensive participation of local and regional levels in such projects, be they on a small or large scale; 59. proposes increasing the amount and share of funds for low-emission transport in Horizon 2020, as well as in the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), when planning the next Multiannual Financial Framework. CEF should be further promoted as it offers considerable leverage: every euro of CEF grant spent generates EUR 3-3,5 in low-emission transport investment; 60. points out that public-private partnership-based developments, and those carried out by public authorities, in cities and regions could provide the necessary leverage for the effective funding and operation of low-emission mobility solutions; also proposes that the use of EFSI and ESIF for local, innovative and low-emission transport solutions should be prioritised. Non-reimbursable grants should be made available for the above purposes in the post-2020 Strategic Reference Framework; 61. highlights that LRAs have a key role in stimulating local energy production, as well as in integrated and intelligent energy grids. ESIF should facilitate necessary investments through non-reimbursable grants, primarily in the less developed EU regions which lag most behind; 62. notes that the Investment Plan for Europe also provides public financing for low-emission transport projects and smart grids between early 2015 and the end of 2017; Action by cities 63. proposes that urban and interurban planning practices of European towns and cities should, within SUMPs, include the designation of areas for low-emission transport and mobility. Active transport (cycling and walking), public passenger transport solutions, car sharing and pooling should be given preference in urban planning; therefore calls for a forward- thinking EU transport investment policy, that should improve public health and that invests, with full consideration of the Paris Agreement at COP 21, at least 10 % of the EU\u2019s transport funds in cycling in those regions where oreographical conditions allow; 64. proposes prior study of the mobility generated by urban and regional planning in metropolitan areas. The density of cities and their metropolitan areas needs to be increased in order firstly, to reduce the need for movements by motor vehicle by bringing services closer to the population and secondly, to enable improvement of public transport networks, by boosting their social and economic efficiency and their use; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/63 ",
        "65. stresses that spatial planning is a very important element in low-emission mobility. It is settlement structure and the design of the urban environment that provide the topographical conditions enabling low emission mobility to develop over the long term. It is recommended, where the LRAs have spatial planning powers under the Member States\u2019 legal or constitutional systems, that their regional, supramunicipal or metropolitan operational plans include initiatives of this type\u037e 66. acknowledges that cycling, in accordance with the CoR opinion on \u2018An EU roadmap for cycling\u2019 ( 10 ), should be strengthened as a transport mode by increasing the role of EU public funding made available for cycling transport projects and reiterates its call for an EU Roadmap for Cycling to be included in the Commission Work Programme 2018. As active promoters of cycling and, in that connection, of green procurements too, municipalities can enhance their own role in the fight against climate change by participating in initiatives such as European Green Capital or Science Meets Regions. Proposals could be put forward to integrate specific, major sections of cycling transport routes into the TEN-T network; 67. highlights that, in accordance with the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive ( 11 ), new buildings erected in the EU should include electric vehicle charging points (preferably with storage facility). Similarly, refurbishment of blocks of flats should involve such construction activities ( 12 ); 68. notes that the installation of smart charging systems in buildings could help to ensure that power grids remain flexible, i.e. the energy stored in batteries of electric vehicles could be uploaded to the network. A holistic approach is required that, for instance, treats electric vehicles as integral parts of the building stock; 69. highlights that cities and towns, are the main transport stakeholders in terms of population centres and notes that urban mobility problems cannot be solved with a sectorial approach only. Therefore recalls the real added-value for LRAs when drafting their Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs ( 13 )) at the same time as their Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAP), for account to be taken of the link between the urban dimension of transport policy and the broader concept of spatial planning which include an inventory of the real and the ideal local energy mix. These local efforts could receive professional guidance and assistance by the Covenant of Mayors, in order to create more inclusive local transport with less air and noise pollution; 70. similarly, where the regions have spatial planning powers under their legal or constitutional systems, it is recommended that their sustainable urban and interurban mobility plans include initiatives of this type; 71. proposes that thematic European city networks be established for the promotion of low-emission mobility. Such networks would enable local enterprises and even the general public to be more involved in implementing low-emission mobility developments, for example by providing shared mobility services. By using up-to-date IT solutions, these city networks can also mobilise relevant target groups for the wider delivery of low-emission mobility. Brussels, 13 July 2017.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMENDMENTS Amendment 1 Proposal for a Regulation Recital 6 Text proposed by the Commission CoR amendment Long-term care benefits have so far not been included explicitly within the material scope of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 but coordinated as sickness benefits , leading to legal uncertainty both for institutions and persons claiming long-term care benefits. There is a need to develop a stable legal framework appropriate to long-term care benefits within the Regulation to include a clear definition of such benefits . Long-term care benefits have so far not been included explicitly within the material scope of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 but coordinated as sickness benefits. There is a need to develop a stable legal framework appropriate to long-term care benefits within the Regulation. Reason Increased coordination of long-term care benefits is to be welcomed. Moreover, it is not currently possible to draw a clear and uniform distinction between nursing and long-term care benefits, as the rules of the various Member States differ. Further coordination requires that long-term care benefits be recognised and developed in all Member States as a form of benefit complementary to sickness benefits. At present, therefore, adaptation of Article 34 should be preferred to the introduction of a separate chapter covering long-term care. 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/65 ",

The verification of the legal right of residence should be carried out in accordance with the requirement of Directive 2004/38/EC. For these purposes, an economically inactive citizen should be clearly distinguished from a jobseeker whose right of residence is conferred directly by Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In order to improve legal clarity for citizens and institutions, a codification of this case law is necessary. \u2018(5a) The Court of Justice has held that Member States are entitled to make the access of economically inactive citizens in the host Member State to social security benefits, which at the same time constitute social assistance within the meaning of Directive 2004/38/ EC subject to a legal right of residence within the meaning of that Directive. The verification of the legal right of residence should be carried out in accordance with the requirement of Directive 2004/ 38/EC. For these purposes, an economically inactive citizen should be clearly distinguished from a jobseeker whose right of residence is conferred directly by Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In order to improve legal clarity for citizens and institutions, a codification of this case law is necessary. Reason The CJEU has held in its judgments referred to above that social security benefits which, pursuant to Article 70 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, qualify as special non-contributory cash benefits shall also be considered to constitute social assistance benefits within the meaning of Article 24(2) of Directive 2004/38/EC. To the extent that they also constitute social assistance benefits, the Member State competence provided for there will apply. The proposed amendment seeks to clarify this.

Such a person shall receive benefits in accordance with the legislation of the Member State of residence as if he or she had completed all periods of insurance under the legislation of that Member State. Those benefits shall be provided by the institution of the Member State of residence. Reason The exception has no effect if no entitlement arises from a short (less than twelve months) period of employment. It would then be superfluous. If, however, an entitlement were to arise, i.e. in connection with periods of employment in other Member States which are to be taken into account under Article 6, it would need to be shown why the Member State of residence should be required to provide the benefits, given that other Member States had received the contributions.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS (CoR) General comments 1. expresses its support for free and fair labour mobility and therefore welcomes the revision of the rules on coordinating social security against the background of the increasing mobility of EU citizens within the EU; 2. notes that the free movement of workers, being negative single market integration, has to be complemented by coordination of social security, which is positive integration, in line with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the case law of the European Court of Justice (CJEU); 3. considers the European Commission\u2019s proposal for a Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems and its proposal for a Regulation (EC) No 987/2009 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 to be generally appropriate and helpful and therefore approves them; 4. would remind the Commission about its better regulation initiative and points out that the complex set of rules in Regulations 883/2004 and 987/2009 must remain understandable so that the legal situation is clear to both the authorities and the public; 5. stresses the importance of regional advisory and support networks for mobile EU citizens. These are essential to prevent the exploitation of mobile workers and organised fraud. The CoR calls for these networks to be strengthened; 6. stresses that the Commission\u2019s proposal is necessary in order to ensure freedom of movement of workers. Due to the clear legal basis in TFEU Article 48, there are no subsidiarity issues in relation to the Commission proposal. Indeed, the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can by reason of the scale and/ or effects of this action be better achieved at EU level, as the proposed action involves trans-national aspects that cannot be properly regulated by Member States and/or regional and local authorities acting alone; 7. stresses its strong interest in the continuation of the technical dialogue with the Commission on this issue and, in this connection, underlines the importance of the impact assessment report that the Commission will submit in due course, on the basis of its cooperation agreement with the CoR; Posting of workers 8. takes note of the progress in regulating posting and certification of posting. It welcomes the fact that the Commission, with the introduction of Article 76a, is to be empowered to adopt implementing acts in accordance with TFEU Article 291, under which a standard procedure is to be laid down for the issuance, contestation and withdrawal of the portable document A1 (also known as an A1 attestation), so as to hinder misuse thereof. The aforementioned procedure can in particular be suitable for helping avoid various procedures, from lengthy litigation to infringement proceedings, and thus contribute to a stable legal situation within European Union; 9. would point out that the proposal in hand for amending Regulation No 883/2004 with an update to the arrangements for issuing the A1 attestation constitutes a key element for better protection against the social abuse of posted employees, as part of parallel work revising the Posted Workers Directive 96/71/EC. With a view to the importance of this aspect, each step towards a binding, clear and direct shaping of the way the A1 attestation is granted in the future is particularly important and should be given due consideration; 10. in connection with the posting of workers, would point out that social security depends to a considerable extent on the clarification of rules and definitions, for which reason an unambiguous definition of key terms such as \u2018self- employment\u2019 and \u2018place of business\u2019 would be helpful for dealing effectively with problems relating to \u2018bogus\u2019 self- employment or letterbox companies; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/71 ",
        "11. reiterates in this regard the Committee\u2019s view that the time limit beyond which the law of the host country applies in full to employment relationships in posting situations should be 12 months ( 1 ); 12. regrets the delay in introducing the Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information (EESSI); considers pan- European electronic data interchange to be essential; Sickness and long-term care benefits 13. notes that the coordination of long-term care benefits extends the scope of coordinating law, which is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the proposed action; the ban on overlapping of sickness and long-term care benefits is likely to be difficult to implement, however; 14. notes that the protection of a sick person residing in a Member State has to be ensured, even if that person does not have legal right of residence; points out, however, that it is often difficult to obtain recognition of foreign sickness insurance cover under current EU law and that in some Member States people in precarious employment are often \u2014 wrongly \u2014 refused any kind of sickness insurance cover; 15. welcomes, therefore, the fact that entitlement to sickness insurance cover for economically inactive and needy EU citizens will be conditional merely on actual residence in a Member State rather than legal residence. In this regard, the host Member State\u2019s right to reimbursement by the competent Member State must be established; Unemployment benefits 16. considers the new rules on coordination of unemployment benefits to be appropriate. Although the exception concerning short-term employment of less than twelve months provided for in Article 65(2) of Regulation No 883/2004 may not be necessary strictly speaking, it clarifies the text; 17. welcomes the planned extension of the possibility to export unemployment benefits from three to six months. It would, however, point out that this should be coupled with appropriate active labour market policies (ALMPs), constituting a key element of the so-called \u2018activation strategies\u2019, which address the interplay between unemployment insurance and assistance systems, ALMPs and benefit conditionality. The CoR considers it necessary to clarify how Member States should be able to extend the export period beyond the applicable provisions of European law. The CoR has concerns about the special provision regarding employment periods shorter than twelve months; Family benefits 18. stresses that all EU citizens have a right to family-social benefits in the country where they are registered, employed or subject to tax, although there may be considerable divergences about family-social entitlements amongst Member States; Special non-contributory cash benefits 19. acknowledges the competence arising from the CJEU\u2019s case law on the powers of the Member States to determine the social assistance entitlements of economically inactive persons and welcomes the statement that these determinations shall comply with European fundamental and human rights. It is welcome that these persons will in future not be excluded from sickness insurance cover on the basis of actual residence and notes that they may be allowed to contribute in a proportionate manner to a scheme for sickness coverage on the basis of their habitual residence. The question remains, however, as to what justification would be needed for restriction of, or complete exclusion from, social assistance. At the same time, the extension of this principle to persons who are actually resident in a Member State other than their own entails regulating its application, also with a view to establishing equal conduct and responsibility for Member States; Cross-border workers 20. regrets the lack of reliable data and information on the number of cross-border workers as described in the legal definition in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004; C 342/72 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ( 1 ) Opinion on the Revision of the Posting of Workers Directive (COR-2016-02881).

Reason Territories with specific (geographic, economic, social and demographic) features will be able to use relevant indicators to support the implementation of public policies addressing challenges they are facing II. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS (CoR) 1. underlines the importance of European regional statistics as an important instrument for targeted policy-making and a useful tool for understanding and quantifying the impact of political decisions in specific territories. These statistics are used for a wide range of purposes by a number of public and private users, including regional and local authorities, and provide an objective base to support decision-making processes in many areas of public intervention, such as SME support, innovation policy, education, labour market, transport, tourism and maritime industries; 2. confirms that territorial typologies stemming from European statistics play an important role in regional policy as they can contribute to evidence-based policy interventions and more integrated territorial approaches that reflect the diversity of EU regions; 3. notes the European Commission's initiative to amend Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 as regards the territorial typologies (Tercet). Codification of these typologies in one single legal text could make it possible to aggregate data for different types of territories, ensuring harmonised and transparent application of existing methodologies at both EU and Member State levels. This must not lead, however, to the new Tercet classification being translated into eligibility rules for any EU policies, including Cohesion Policy; 4. concludes that the legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 complies with the principle of subsidiarity, since the objective of establishing, coordinating and maintaining harmonised statistical classifications for statistical purposes at EU level cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States acting alone. On the other hand, however, subsidiarity can only be safeguarded, if the territorial typologies are coordinated in an intensive dialogue with the Member States and regions. Moreover, the legislative proposal does not in principle go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives and therefore could be regarded as compliant with the principle of proportionality; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/77 ",
        "5. stresses the need for closer dialogue between the national statistical offices and regional (local) authorities to ensure that the development of the new Tercet classification takes due account of the socio-economic, spatial and administrative specificities of different territories; 6. stresses the importance of addressing the specific situation of territories with particular geographic, economic, social and demographic features, which should be adequately covered within the framework of European regional statistics with the aim of strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion as set out in Article 174 TFEU; 7. in this respect, draws attention to: a) Article 174 of the TFEU stipulating that particular attention shall be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions; b) the Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion (COM(2008) 616 final) and the accompanying Commission staff working document (SEC(2008) 2550), which mention territorial typologies such as border regions, mountain regions, island regions and sparsely populated regions. These typologies have already been used within the context of the Fifth report on economic, social and territorial cohesion (published in November 2010); c) the CoR opinion on the abovementioned green paper (COTER-IV-020), which calls on the European Commission to extend its research to develop relevant indicators for the particular socio-economic problems faced by specific types of regions such as mountains, islands, areas with low population density and border areas, and to significantly improve statistical data and its cartographic representation so as to reflect the real situation; d) the CoR opinion on the Sixth report on economic, social and territorial cohesion (COTER-V-052), which calls for better respect to be given to Article 174 of the TFEU; e) the CoR opinion on Indicators for territorial development \u2014 GDP and beyond (COTER-VI-009), pointing out the lack of quantitative information on the various territories with particular (geographic, environmental, economic and social) features influencing their development, as well as suggesting that the Commission (Eurostat) adopt the territorial categories identified by the Treaty in order to contribute to the proper implementation of EU policies with a territorial dimension; f) the CoR draft opinion on Entrepreneurship on islands: contributing towards territorial cohesion (COTER-VI/022), which suggests adding islands as an additional category in the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Tercet regulation; 8. regrets that the Commission's proposal includes a limited number of territorial typologies and does not take account of other typologies related to the territories with specific geographic, economic, social and demographic features that have already been developed and used, namely the typologies on island regions, mountain regions, border regions and sparsely populated regions or outermost regions. Adoption of territorial typologies providing statistical evidence of diversity and complexity of these regions is considerably important in order to capture these territories better. The CoR therefore recommends including references to the abovementioned territorial typologies when modifying the Tercet regulation with involvement of the Member States and regions.

Measures to offset those disadvantages include enabling energy communities to operate in the energy system and easing their market integration. It is proposed that the Member States in cooperation with the European Commission and their local and regional authorities draw up recommendations setting out the basic principles governing the commu- nities\u2019 structure and activities. Reason The Commission proposals put forward the view that citizens should take ownership of the energy transition, make use of new technologies to reduce their energy bills and actively participate in the market, and that local energy communities can be an effective means of energy management at local level. In order to achieve these objectives, it is important to provide the general public with detailed information about how the communities are set up, how they operate, and what opportunities and benefits they offer.

The Commission shall support the high ambition of Member States through an enabling framework comprising the enhanced use of Union funds, in particular financial instruments, especially in view of reducing the varying economic costs of renewable energy projects and improv- ing the technological capacity and competitiveness of European manufacturers and installers or consumer interest in acquiring energy from renewable sources . Likewise, in the use of EU funds, the Commission may establish mechanisms that, considering different factors and circumstances, will encourage regions or Member States whose progress in renewables can be considered higher than the average . 6. Each Member State shall ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources, calculated in accordance with the content of this Directive, in gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least its national overall target (divided in electricity, thermal consumption and transport) for the share of energy from renewable sources in that year, as set out in the Annex I. Reason Concerning 3(1) Member States should have the possibility to set more ambitious national binding targets for their share of energy from renewable sources. In this process, they could aim to achieve a higher share of renewables than the EU binding 27 % target. However, the setting of national target should be left to each Member State to decide after considering their own options, requirements and circumstances. No higher binding target should be set at the EU level. Concerning 3(4) The amendment introduces the idea that European funds can be allocated in larger amounts to those countries (and possibly regions) that are most successful in terms of promotion of renewable energy sources. Such a mechanism should take into account the different circumstances of each country and act as an incentive for them. In addition, for a balanced and competitive development, public funds should not be used for one objective only. Concerning 3(6) The amendment recovers the text of the previous directive, which obliged each Member State to establish and commit itself to its own national objectives. It is also suggested that those objectives should be detailed in their electrical, thermal and transport-related aspects. 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/83 ",

Subject to State aid rules, in order to reach the Union target set in Article 3(1), Member States may apply support schemes. Support schemes for electricity from renewable sources shall be designed so as to avoid unnecessary distortions of electricity markets and ensure that producers take into account the supply and demand of electricity as well as possible grid constraints. 1. Subject to State aid rules, in order to reach the Union target set in Article 3(1), Member States may apply support schemes. Support schemes for electricity from renewable sources (and consequently all provisions relating to the relevant market) shall be designed so as to avoid distortions of electricity markets (relating to internalisation of all costs and environmental risks), to guarantee that reliability, quality of supply, competitiveness and afford- ability are not compromised and to ensure that producers take into account the supply and demand of electricity as well as possible grid constraints. 2. Support for electricity from renewable sources shall be designed so as to integrate electricity from renewable sources in the electricity market and ensure that renewable energy producers are responding to market price signals and maximise their market revenues. 2. Support for electricity from renewable sources shall be designed so as to integrate electricity from renewable sources in the electricity market and ensure that renewable energy producers are responding to market price signals and maximise their market revenues. 3.

Member States shall ensure that support for renew- able electricity is granted in an open, transparent, competitive, non-discriminatory and cost-effective manner. 4 . Member States shall assess the effectiveness of their support for electricity from renewable sources at least every four years. Decisions on the continuation or prolongation of support and design of new support shall be based on the results of the assessments. 4. Member States may adjust financial support schemes in the outermost regions based on actual production costs resulting from specific characteristics or dependence on external sources, with the aim of increasing the electricity generated from renewable and other domestically produced clean energy sources. 5 . Member States shall assess the effectiveness of their support for electricity from renewable sources at least every four years. Decisions on the continuation or prolongation of support and design of new support shall be based on the results of the assessments. Reason Concerning 4(1) Considering the market distortions caused by national regulations or by the fossil fuel companies operating under them, it would be appropriate to put into context the market distortion mentioned by the Directive. Electricity from renewable energy sources should be integrated in the electricity market by taking into account the characteristics of each technology. Employing price as the only guiding principle may mask the real situation. C 342/84 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "Concerning 4(2) The integration of the different renewables would be done regarding the technology peculiarities. Trying to put the price as a single indicator, can be to falsify the real situation. Concerning 4(3) and 4(5) Centralisation would contradict the Commission\u2019s objective of giving broad discretion to the Member States to grant support in an open, transparent, competitive, non-discriminatory and cost-effective manner. Since Member States can set their own target requirements, a reference to compulsory EU criteria is out of place.

Cross-border cooperation investments which provide for an appropriate level of interconnections should also be promoted. Reason Toning down the call for cross-border tenders will take competitive pressure out of the system. There is still potential to cut costs. It is therefore important that appropriate interconnection capacity between the Member States is created.

This limit shall be reduced to 3,8 % in 2030 following the trajectory set out in part A of Annex X. Member States may set a lower limit and may distinguish between different types of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops, for instance by setting a lower limit for the contribution from food or feed crop based biofuels produced from oil crops, taking into account indirect land use change. For the calculation of a Member State\u2019s gross final consumption of energy from renewable energy sources, the contribution from biofuels and bioliquids, as well as from biomass fuels consumed in transport, if produced from food or feed crops, excluding low indirect land-use change-risk biofuels as defined in Article 2(u), shall be no more than 7 % of final consumption of energy in road and rail transport in that Member State. This limit shall be reduced to 3,8 % in 2030 following the trajectory set out in part A of Annex X. Member States may set a lower limit and may distinguish between different types of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops, for instance by setting a lower limit for the contribution from food or feed crop based biofuels produced from oil crops, taking into account indirect land use change. Reason Conventional biofuels with good climate performance and sustainability, including low ILUC emissions, should not be phased out. The FAO advocates sustainable production of both food and fuels. Large areas of agricultural land lie fallow in the EU and phasing out biofuels hinders flexible resource use and technological development.

One or more Member States may cooperate with one or more third countries on all types of joint projects regarding the production of electricity from renewable energy sources. Such cooperation may involve private operators. Renewable energy production plants located in third countries that are included in the joint projects must comply during their life cycle with environmental, social, labour, and safety standards applied in general in the European Union and in the Member State that intends to use this energy production in its own national accounts.

A guarantee of origin shall specify at least: 7. A guarantee of origin shall specify at least: (a) the energy source from which the energy was produced and the start and end dates of production; (a) the energy source from which the energy was produced and the start and end dates of production; (b) whether it relates to: (i) electricity; or (ii) gas, or (iii) heating or cooling; (b) whether it relates to: (i) electricity; or (ii) gas, or (iii) heating or cooling; (c) the identity, location, type and capacity of the installation where the energy was produced; (c) the identity, location, type and capacity of the installa- tion where the energy was produced; (d) whether the installation has benefited from investment support, whether the unit of energy has benefited in any other way from a national support scheme, and the type of support scheme; (d) whether the installation has benefited from investment support, whether the unit of energy has benefited in any other way from a public support scheme, and the type of this support scheme; (e) the date on which the installation became operational; and (e) the date on which the installation became operational; and (f) the date and country of issue and a unique identification number.

Where relevant, Member States shall assess the need to extend existing gas network infrastructure to facilitate the integration of gas from renewable energy sources. 1. Subject to requirements relating to the maintenance of the reliability and safety of the grid, based on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria defined by the competent national authorities: (a) Member States shall ensure that transmission system operators and distribution system operators in their territory guarantee the transmission and distribution of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, including the installation of electric energy storage systems and power management systems using batteries to eliminate disruptions in intermittent renewable energy sources and ensure the stability of the electricity network; (b) Member States shall also provide for either priority access or guaranteed access to the grid-system of electricity produced from renewable energy sources; (c) Member States shall ensure that when dispatching electricity generating installations, transmission sys- tem operators shall give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources in so far as the secure operation of the national electricity system permits and based on transparent and non- discriminatory criteria. Member States shall ensure that appropriate grid and market-related operational measures are taken in order to minimise the curtailment of electricity produced from renewable energy sources. If significant measures are taken to curtail the renewable energy sources in order to guarantee the security of the national electricity system and security of energy supply, Members States shall ensure that the responsible system operators report to the competent regulatory authority on those measures and indicate which corrective measures they intend to take in order to prevent inappropriate curtailments; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/89 ",
        "Commission proposal CoR amendment (d) Member States should ensure that remuneration for renewable energy is in line with transparency criteria, taking into account production costs for electricity from fossil fuels in the electricity networks into which renewable energy will be injected, specifically in small isolated networks, and eliminating distortions intro- duced by aid or profits which may be distributed to conventional production systems and fossil fuel supply systems in order to prevent distortions which favour fossil fuel energy sources to the detriment of renewables. (e) Installations for producing electricity from renew- ables essentially aimed at own consumption, particu- larly in the residential sector, should be assured that energy surplus can be injected in the public network with limits on power and energy in line with actual consumption, and should have facilitated authorisa- tion processes and fair compensation prices in keeping with the prices of the energy supplied to the consumer. 2 . Where relevant, Member States shall assess the need to extend existing gas network infrastructure to facilitate the integration of gas from renewable energy sources. 3 . Subject to that their assessment, included in the integrated national energy and climate plans in accordance with Annex I of Regulation [Governance], on the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable energy sources in order to achieve the Union target referred to in Article 3(1), Member States shall, where relevant, take steps with a view to developing a district heating) infrastructure to accommo- date the development of heating and cooling production from large biomass, solar and geothermal facilities. 3. Where relevant, Member States shall assess the need to develop existing transport fuel network infrastructure to facilitate the integration of fuel from renewable energy sources. 4 . Subject to that their assessment, included in the integrated national energy and climate plans in accordance with Annex I of Regulation [Governance], on the possibility and interest to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable energy sources in order to achieve the Union target referred to in Article 3(1), Member States shall, where relevant, take steps with a view to developing an infrastructure for the use of thermal energy (for example through district heating systems) to accommodate the development of heating and cooling production from large biomass, solar and geothermal facilities.

Currently, the European Union has a global technological and business leadership in the field of RES based on the competitiveness of our products and services companies from equipment manufacturers to consultants to installers, maintainers or financial institutions. It is the Commission\u2019s priority objective to consolidate and expand this leadership by 2030. 2. Both the Commission and the Member States shall allocate at least 15 % of all their funds to support for renewable energies, for actions to improve capacity, business competitiveness and especially their technologi- cal development. Likewise, in the case of ESIF, the European Commission should establish mechanisms which, considering different factors and circumstances, allow the regions or Member States whose progress in this specific area is considered greater than the average, to enable to incentivise RES in their areas. 3. In order to maintain this leadership, the following priority lines should be established by Member States and the European Commission, without prejudice to others: (A) Technology: (i) Constant reduction of investment and operating costs incorporating, among others, Information and Communication Technologies (ITCs). 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/91 ",
        "Commission proposal CoR amendment (ii) Increased energy yields and adaptability of facilities to the requirements of different con- sumers. (iii) Without prejudice to other technologies, photo- voltaics, energy storage, heat pumps, third generation biofuels and marine energy will have special relevance. (iv) The manageability of the renewable production and its transport. (v) The implementation of technological improve- ments, large or small, in all the processes and value chains of the renewable sectors. (B) Business: (i) The development and diffusion of different financial instruments. (ii) Improving internal business processes by or- ienting them according to the interests and expectations of current or potential customers, improving market and marketing studies. (iii) Facilitate the exchange of methodologies and ways of working of companies from different Member States, favouring the establishment of long-term trade agreements and increasing the size and capacity of companies. (iv) Facilitate the transit of information between the company, university and technological centres. 4. The Commission, together with the Member States, will prepare a specific strategy in this field before 31.12.2018, characterising the priority lines and, depend- ing on the evolution of the different renewable sectors and geographic areas, bottlenecks, opportunities and the public actions that can take place in the next decade. 5. Where relevant, Member States shall assess the need to develop electricity storage infrastructures so as to boost the integration of energy from renewable sources. Reason Concerning points 1 to 4 The total absence of a direct and explicit reference to these extremely important subjects (business and technological development) in relation to the thoroughness with which others are treated is considered out of place in a European Directive. Concerning point 5 Steps to encourage the production of renewable energy cannot be dissociated from the need for storage infrastructure.

Reason Concerning 23(1), (3), (5) The substitution of fossil fuels and the reduction of primary energy consumption mean that it is important for the heating and cooling sector to take not only renewable energies, but also surplus heat and co-products into consideration. If the desired objectives are to be achieved, it is also important to make economic incentives and fiscal measures possible. Concerning 23(2) The correction is simply to clarify the meaning of these entities. Energy supply is a concept that does not cover fuel only. In fact, energy could be supplied through fuel, electricity or solar energy. Concerning 23(4) Heating and cooling is a very important matter in EU. Last year the Commission published a specific strategy. Many of those ideas are not reflected in this directive and we have recovered them. Otherwise we have introduced some new ideas such as avoiding direct subsidies or the developing consumer confidence. Concerning 23(5) In order to have a better knowledge of the sector and the possibilities of future development, it is essential to know the state and characteristics of existing facilities.

It creates uncertainty for investments and unclear long-term responsibility. An unbundling of the grid and the supply operations increases costs for end-users.

        "Reason The involvement of third countries in the EU internal market in electricity can be highly significant for some Member States. When trading with third countries, therefore, it is very important to ensure a level playing field, and the same conditions for market access (principle of reciprocity). Amendment 22 (8) Proposal for a Regulation on the internal market for electricity (recast) \u2014 COM(2016) 861 final Commission proposal CoR amendment Core market principles should set out that electricity prices are to be determined through demand and supply. Those prices should signal when electricity is needed, providing market-based incentives for investments into flexibility sources such as flexible generation, interconnection, demand response or storage. Core market principles should set out that electricity prices are to be determined through demand and supply. Those prices should signal when electricity is needed, providing market-based incentives for investments into flexibility sources such as flexible generation, interconnection, demand response or storage. With these objectives in mind, the Member States should gradually phase out price regulation. Reason In many Member States, electricity prices do not follow demand and supply but are regulated by the public authorities. Price regulation can limit the development of effective competition and discourage investments and the entry of new suppliers into the market. The new market design aims at ensuring that electricity prices are free of any public intervention. The European Commission\u2019s proposal on the abolition of price regulation is welcomed in principle but this should happen gradually. 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/99 ",

The benefits of this active participation are likely to increase over time when electric vehicles, heat pumps and other flexible loads become more competitive. Consumers should be enabled to participate in all forms of demand response and therefore should have the possibility to opt for having a smart metering system and a dynamic electricity pricing contract. This should allow them to adjust their consumption according to real time price signals that reflect the value and cost of electricity or transportation in different time periods, while Member States should ensure a reasonable exposure of consumers to the wholesale price risk. Member States should also ensure that those consumers who choose not to actively engage in the market are not penalised but instead their informed decision-making on the options available to them should be facilitated in the manner that is the most suitable for domestic market conditions.

Community energy offers an inclusive option for all consumers to have a direct stake in producing, consuming or sharing energy between each other within a geographically confined community network that may operate in an isolated mode or be connected to the public distribution network. Community energy initiatives focus primarily on providing affordable energy of a specific kind, such as renewable energy, for their members or shareholders rather than prioritising profit-making like a traditional energy company. By directly engaging with consumers community energy initiatives are demonstrating their potential in facilitating the up-take of new technol- ogies and consumption patterns, including smart distribu- tion grids and demand response, in an integrated manner. Community energy can also advance energy efficiency at household level and help fight energy poverty through reduced consumption and lower supply tariffs. Community energy also enables certain groups of household consumers to participate in the energy market who otherwise might not have been able to do so. Where they have been successfully operated such initiatives have delivered eco- nomic, social and environmental value to the community that goes beyond the mere benefits derived from the provision of energy services.

Independently of the data management model it is important that Member States put in place transparent rules under which data can be accessed under non- discriminatory conditions and ensure the highest level of cybersecurity and data protection as well as the impartiality of the entities which handle data. For consumers to be involved in demand response and have the option of a dynamic pricing system, they must have access via distributors to information about their hourly electricity consumption. It is recommended that such access to information be available for all smart electricity meters and be installed for all contracted power ranges. Reason Access to information for all smart electricity meters should be a recommendation, not a binding requirement, but must be installed for all contracted power ranges.

        "Reason Greater coordination between Member States in the area of energy is to be welcomed. However, the role of the national regulatory authority in each individual EU Member State is equally important. It should be pointed out that the Member States must guarantee the independence and unimpeded functioning of their national regulatory authorities. Sufficient resources must also be provided so that the national regulatory authorities can do their job properly.

Member States should establish and update their national crisis scenarios on this basis, in principle every three years. The scenarios should provide the basis for the risk-preparedness plans. When identifying risks on national level the Member States should also describe possible risks they see in relation to the ownership of infrastructure relevant for security of supply, and possible measures taken, if any, to address such risks (such as general or sector-specific investment screening laws, special rights for certain shareholders, etc.), with an indication why in their view such measures are justified.

Reason It is appropriate and useful to make provision for ENTSO-E to regularly draw up and update regional crisis scenarios and to identify the most relevant risks for each region, such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, fuel shortages or malicious attacks. However, it is important to strengthen regional cooperation between Member States. For the Member States it is useful if the situation at regional level is presented and discussed prior to them drafting their respective national crisis scenarios.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS (CoR) General comments 1. welcomes the European Commission\u2019s \u2018clean energy package\u2019 and signals that the central points it sets out \u2014 energy efficiency and sustainability of buildings, industry and transport, the development of renewable energy sources, and conditions and how to design them sensibly so as to enable consumers to participate by managing their energy requirements, the creation of the internal market in energy and the creation of new responsibilities for electricity distribution networks, transmission system operators and national legislators will help to ensure energy independence and security of energy supply, meet climate protection goals, and above all guarantee affordable energy prices for consumers; 2. stresses, however, that there are clear indications that the current EU targets under the energy and climate package 2030 will not be sufficient to meet the commitments which all Member States and the EU have made by signing the Paris Agreement; in particular, is convinced that the 27 % renewable energy target at EU level is not sufficiently ambitious and therefore calls on the European Commission and the Member States to aim higher; 3. welcomes the proposals for close cross-border cooperation at regional level while also calling on the European Commission to put forward options regarding how such cooperation can be supported by expanding rights to participate at the micro level, enabling close cooperation between local and regional authorities, and providing neighbouring regions with real opportunities to develop a common energy infrastructure spanning national borders; C 342/106 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "4. regrets the fact that the Commission\u2019s proposals only vaguely sketch out the role of local and regional authorities and underlines local and regional authorities\u2019 important contribution to achieving climate protection goals. Many towns and cities across the EU have had climate and sustainable energy action plans for many years which call for low-CO 2 heat and energy generation, the use of renewable energy sources, measures to increase energy efficiency, and the development of sustainable transport; 5. agrees with the European Commission\u2019s aims to create a flexible, market-based framework that promotes the development of renewable energy sources while also avoiding market distortions, and especially welcomes the proposals to give consumers \u2014 who are to become active players on the electricity market \u2014 greater incentives; emphasises that local and regional authorities can contribute to this by establishing energy communities; 6. is of the view that regional cooperation to draw up national plans needs to be strengthened in areas that have clear cross-border implications; considers it very important, before national plans are drawn up, that measures are coordinated with the EU\u2019s neighbouring countries at an early stage and that local and regional authorities are involved in the process; 7. believes that Member States should intensify their efforts to eliminate administrative obstacles, bring down the cost of less mature low-carbon technologies, and focus more on effectively coordinating planning, implementation and reporting at national, regional and local level; Developing renewable energy sources and market integration 8. shares the view that the EU should pay more attention to the development and use of technologies in the renewables sector, and notes that new technologies will offer all consumers (from industrial firms to households) the opportunity to make smarter and more sparing use of energy and to choose clean and efficient methods of generating energy; 9. believes that the lack of a renewables target for transport in Member States is a very important shortcoming, especially when meeting the 10 % target for 2020, set out in the current Directive, has been the main incentive for the development of biofuels. Therefore, proposes to include a target for biofuels (including sustainably produced conventional ones), which could be 14 %; 10. takes the view that renewable energy can be competitive, and notes that some renewable energy sources, such as onshore wind farms, are fully able to compete with fossil fuel energy sources and that wind energy prices will continue to fall if more wind energy capacity is installed and the technology is improved; 11. shares the view that innovations in the area of clean energy sources require a smoothly operating internal market and fair competition, enabling new market operators to implement innovative renewable energy projects; emphasises, however, that there must be a level playing field for the implementation of innovative projects compared to operators already on the market; 12. notes that when they are creating support schemes for renewable energy sources, the Member States should be aware of the specific characteristics of the different renewable energy technologies (e.g. price levels, risks, possibility of providing system services). This would mean greater cost-effectiveness, as well as achieving the long-term target of reducing CO 2 emissions; 13. is of the view that the European Commission should encourage Member States to take appropriate measures to support the development of renewable energy sources. Member States must be granted more flexibility in relation to the development of next-generation renewable energy technologies and to the protection of small-scale projects, including combined heat and power plants that are connected to local district heating and cooling networks; 14. points out that significant financial resources are required to develop renewable energy sources and to integrate the market, making it particularly important to prioritise this and to develop a common approach among EU, national, local and regional authorities in the interests of connecting the different financing sources and achieving a multiplier effect; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/107 ",
        "15. urges the European Commission \u2014 taking into account the Member States\u2019 existing support schemes and with a view to harmonising the rules and the mobilisation of investment in this industry \u2014 to clearly set out in the Renewable Energy Directive what approach should be followed for the support schemes; 16. notes that having clear and accurate information about the possibility of using EU financial instruments after 2020 is no less important when it comes to achieving ambitious objectives; also emphasises that advanced financing techniques must be used in order to ensure that the principal investments come from the private sector. In this regard, notes that 25 % of the projects funded by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) have been energy-related, greatly helping to boost the energy sector; 17. shares the view that support schemes for electricity generated from renewable sources have proved to be an effective way of fostering deployment of renewable electricity; emphasises, however, that according to the Guidelines on State Aid for Environmental Protection and Energy 2014-2020, applicable as of 1 July 2014, renewable energy production should be integrated into the internal electricity market in a gradual way, State aid should reflect falling production costs, and market distortions should be avoided; also points out that external costs associated with fossil fuels must be made more transparent; 18. agrees in principle with opening up support schemes for projects in other Member States, but recommends that the Member States look carefully at the options for market opening in order to avoid such an obligation reducing local production due to the greater financial capacity of the other EU Member States involved in the distribution of support; is therefore of the opinion that preference should be given to support schemes based on cross-border cooperation and that there should be a particular focus on interconnections; Internal market in electricity and risk management 19. emphasises that an integrated energy market is the best tool to guarantee affordable energy prices and secure energy supplies, and to enable the generation of larger volumes of electricity produced from renewable sources to be integrated in a cost efficient manner; therefore welcomes the European Commission\u2019s proposals for an electricity market design that promotes the introduction of renewable energy, improves demand management, creates an integrated energy market at regional level and strengthens the position of consumers; 20. points out that in many Member States, electricity prices do not follow demand and supply but are regulated by the public authorities. This may hamper competition and hinder the mobilisation of investment and the entry into the market of new suppliers, and must always be duly justified with regard to specific policy aims such as protecting the most vulnerable consumers. The Committee of the Regions therefore supports the proposed market liberalisation and the reduction of state interference with the aim to reduce prices for consumers, but points out that the deregulation of energy prices should be carried out gradually by the Member States and with due respect to the special nature of energy as service of general interest; 21. shares the view that local energy communities can be an efficient way of managing energy at local level; calls on the Commission to create technical and financial tools to enable local and regional authorities to provide these communities with comprehensive support; 22. shares the view that the Member States must develop risk-preparedness plans in order to avoid crisis situations, and stresses the importance of regional cooperation for the more efficient administration of the energy sector; is also of the view that regional and local authorities must be consulted as part of the process of drawing up these plans; 23. stresses that the fight against energy poverty requires a common definition of the problem at EU level, the collection and exchange of the relevant data in cooperation between different levels of governance and a set of targeted policies and measures to help the most vulnerable energy consumers to participate in the market and to alleviate the burden of high energy prices; C 342/108 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) 24. welcomes the fact that the legal regime is being comprehensively reviewed, i.e. that not only individual aspects of the energy market are being taken into account but also their relations with each other, the interaction of those involved in pursuing these targets and the division of competences. The greater emphasis being placed on the ACER in devising and implementing the network codes is to be welcomed; stresses, however, that the European Commission must ensure that the ACER has the necessary competences to obtain information from the most important institutions in the Member States and to perform other coordination tasks; 25. points out that, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, regulatory measures of the ACER do not replace national decisions; also recommends strengthening national regulatory authorities. Member States must guarantee the independence and unimpeded functioning of their national regulatory authorities. In order for national regulatory authorities to function adequately the necessary resources must be made available and it must also be possible for them to be involved with full rights in cooperation at EU level; Consumers and the importance of information and education 26. welcomes the European Commission\u2019s proposal to reform the energy market and thereby to give consumers greater influence so they become market participants on an equal footing; supports the Commission\u2019s proposal to promote the introduction of smart meters, on a voluntary basis and in compliance with data protection principles, so that consumers receive comprehensible bills and can change electricity supplier more easily; 27. notes that more research and closer cooperation with representatives of local authorities are needed in order to better understand consumers\u2019 motives for participating in the electricity market. A better understanding of the factors that lead to changes in consumer behaviour can provide important information on how consumers may be encouraged to act as strong and responsible players in the new electricity market; 28. notes that research has shown that consumers complain about a lack of transparency in electricity markets, reducing their ability to benefit from competition and actively participate in markets. Consumers do not feel sufficiently informed about alternative providers and choices; stresses, therefore, that the problems relating to privacy protection and the security of customer data must be solved, and calls on the European Commission to present technical proposals on how high standards of security can be ensured; 29. stresses the importance of local and regional authorities in promoting the establishment of energy communities; notes that local authority representatives can provide support in the following areas: capacity building, support with accessing finance, training, sharing positive experiences, ensuring technical assistance and promoting partnerships; 30. highlights the importance of educational measures that encourage consumers to become active players in the energy sector. In this regard, an active role for the Committee of the Regions is important and needs to be supported as it could make a significant contribution to disseminating information, spreading ideas among local communities, and exchanging best practices; The role of local and regional authorities 31. notes that local and regional authorities play an important role in the energy sector: through their actions, local and regional authorities can influence the development of energy infrastructure and the functioning of the market. They organise the provision of services; are responsible for spatial planning and land use policy, street lighting, the provision of transport services and the management of housing; make decisions on issuing permits; and educate and inform local people. Additionally, they control large budgets for public procurement of energy-consuming products and services. In many cases, local and regional authorities are also energy producers; 32. points out that local and regional authorities are not mentioned in the Commission\u2019s proposals as being important energy sector players, and calls on the Commission to treat local and regional authorities as equal partners at the central level when implementing further measures; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/109 ",
        "33. notes that local and regional authorities can contribute to promoting the use of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency at local and regional level, for instance by establishing ambitious targets and action plans, simplifying administrative procedures and rules or providing financial support, as well as through the education system. Highlights in this regard that more than 6 600 local and regional authorities have signed the Covenant of Mayors and that more should be encouraged to voluntarily join this and other similar international initiatives; 34. considers that local and regional authorities should be consulted with regard to future specific measures due to the role they play in planning infrastructure, attracting investors and informing and consulting consumers; 35. offers its assistance to local and regional authorities in establishing contacts with relevant experts, in order to improve their capabilities and better coordinate common approaches; Subsidiarity and proportionality 36. notes that some national parliaments have expressed concerns regarding the European Commission\u2019s proposals in terms of their adherence to the principle of subsidiarity. Local and regional authorities bear great responsibility for ensuring EU rules are effective; is therefore of the view that a more thorough examination may be needed of whether the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality have been upheld.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMENDMENTS Amendment 1 Proposal for a regulation Recital 1 Commission proposal CoR amendment (1) This Regulation aims to establish the necessary partnerships between the Union, Member States individually and grouped into macro-regional part- nerships, and the subnational levels of governance to jointly move forward in the energy transition. These different levels must work together in a spirit of solidarity and trust for their mutual benefit. Reason The Regulation should set out at the very beginning the need for multi-level governance cooperation of all different levels. The proposal is based on a similar idea proposed in the draft European Parliament report PE 604.777 (Am 2). Amendment 2 Proposal for a regulation Article 9(2) Commission proposal CoR amendment Draft integrated national energy and climate plans 2. The Commission may issue recommendations on the draft plans to Member States in accordance with Article 28. Those recommendations shall in particular set out : 2. The Commission shall assess draft integrated national energy and climate plans and issue country- specific recommendations on the draft plans to Member States in accordance with Article 28 in order to : (a) the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions in view of collectively achieving the Energy Union objectives and notably the Union\u2019s 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency ; (a) contribute to achieving the objectives, targets and contributions of the Energy Union; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/111 ",
        "Commission proposal CoR amendment (b) policies and measures relating to Member States\u2019 and Union level objectives and other policies and measures of potential cross-border relevance; (b) ensure that policies and measures relating to Member States\u2019 action plans and other policies and measures are fit for purpose, in particular also those measures of potential cross-border relevance; (c) interactions between and consistency of existing (implemented and adopted) and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union. (c) promote interactions between and consistency of existing (implemented and adopted) and planned policies and measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan within one dimension and among different dimensions of the Energy Union; (d) insist that Member States take into account explicitly the commitments entered into at local and regional level and the outcomes achieved under initiatives such as the Covenant of Mayors; and develop procedures for taking on board the contributions of all relevant government and administrative tiers with the relevant integrated national energy and climate plans; Reason It is very important to ensure consistency and complementarity between the different Member States\u2019 action plans and policies at EU level, and to promote the involvement of local and regional authorities and their contributions The proposal is based on similar suggestions in the draft European Parliament Report PE 604.777 (Amendments 97-100). Amendment 3 Proposal for a regulation Article 10 Commission proposal CoR amendment Public consultation Without prejudice to any other Union law requirements, Member States shall ensure that the public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in the preparation of draft plans referred to in Article 9 of this Regulation and attach to the submission of their draft integrated national energy and climate plan to the Commission a summary of the public\u2019s views. In so far as the provisions of Directive 2001/42/EC are applicable, consultations undertaken in accordance with that Directive shall be deemed to satisfy also the obligations to consult the public under this Regulation. Without prejudice to any other Union law requirements, Member States shall ensure that the public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in the preparation of draft plans referred to in Article 9 of this Regulation and attach to the submission of their draft integrated national energy and climate plan to the Commission a summary of the public\u2019s views. In so far as the provisions of Directive 2001/42/EC are applicable, consultations undertaken in accordance with that Directive shall be deemed to satisfy also the obligations to consult the public under this Regulation. In view of the politically recognised role of regional and local authorities in the implementation of sustainable energy policies, and taking into account the Commission\u2019s aim of securing better regulation, national authorities are required to involve local and regional authorities in planning and monitoring in accordance with the constitu- tional and political provisions of each Member State.

        "Reason Effective coordination between the national level and local and regional authorities in planning, implementing and reporting on energy and climate policies can help avoid unnecessary administrative burdens and meet the requirements of better regulation. Amendment 4 Proposal for a regulation A new article after Article 10 Commission proposal CoR amendment A multi-level Energy Dialogue platform 1. In a spirit of partnership, Member States shall establish a permanent Energy Dialogue to support active engagement of local and regional authorities, civil society organisations, business community, investors, any other relevant stakeholders and the general public in managing the energy transition, including energy poverty. 2. Member States shall submit to this Energy Dialogue different options and scenarios envisaged for their short-, medium- and long-term energy and climate policies, together with a cost-benefit analysis for each option. 3. Member States shall ensure that the Energy Dialogue benefits from adequate human and financial resources and support, together with the European Commission, exchanges between different Energy Dialo- gues. Reason On a subject as important as the energy transition it is necessary to create structures which ensure permanent dialogue with all those concerned to explore different options and scenarios and prepare common solutions. It is based on a similar idea proposed in the draft EP report PE 604.777 Amendment 5 Proposal for a regulation Article 18(b) Commission proposal CoR amendment Member States shall include in the integrated national energy and climate progress reports the information: Member States shall include in the integrated national energy and climate progress reports the information: (b) on the implementation of the following policies and measures: (b) on the implementation of the following policies and measures: (1) implemented, adopted and planned policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding Union-level 2030 target for renewable energy as indicated in Article 4(a)(2)(i), including sector- and technology-specific measures, with a specific review of the implementation of measures laid down in Articles 23, 24 and 25 of [recast of Directive 2009/28/EC as proposed by COM(2016) 767]; (1) implemented, adopted and planned policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding Union-level 2030 target for renewable energy as indicated in Article 4(a)(2)(i), including sector- and technology-specific measures, with a specific review of the implementation of measures laid down in Articles 23, 24 and 25 of [recast of Directive 2009/28/EC as proposed by COM(2016) 767]; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/113 ",

(c) as set out in Part 1 of Annex VII. Reason Heating and cooling offers a significant untapped potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and boosting the use and production of renewable energy (see Committee of the Regions opinion on An EU Strategy for Heating and Cooling). When it comes to the Renewable Energy Directive, the national and regional/local levels should work closely together to pursue a binding target of increasing renewables use in the heating and cooling sector by 1 % a year, since this makes a tangible and effective contribution to attaining the overall EU target of 27 % renewable energy by 2030.

Reason The key role of local and regional authorities in measures relating to the Energy Union has been repeatedly acknowledged by leading European Union and European Parliament politicians. II. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS (CoR) Main goals and target groups 1. reiterates its call for implementing more ambitious targets for energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy at EU level, which should be raised to 40 % by 2030; 2. endorses the three core goals of the \u2018Clean Energy For All Europeans\u2019 package: (1) putting energy efficiency first; (2) achieving global leadership in renewable energies; and (3) providing a fair deal for consumers; regrets, however, that these goals are not fully achievable with the supporting regulations and non-legislative initiatives and that not enough emphasis has been placed on reducing the import dependency factor reflecting the share of all clean indigenous energy sources (renewable and conventional) in the energy mix; 3. calls on the European Commission, in this connection, to make energy efficiency the top priority, to declare it an infrastructure priority and to make sure that public grants and financial instruments favouring energy efficiency are classed as capital costs, which would improve the security and reliability of the energy efficiency system. This would establish a clear policy safeguarding the budget and fostering competitiveness in Europe; 4. welcomes the proposals to create a legal framework for Energy Union governance that would simplify and integrate the existing planning, reporting and monitoring obligations on energy and climate and calls on the Member States and the Commission to involve local and regional authorities in this political governance process; Energy efficiency and renewable energy heavily depend on measures at devolved level 5. stresses and highlights the important role of local and regional authorities in strategic governance at the level nearest to consumers, in management of decentralised energy production, promotion of the right investment climate and in coupling energy and climate policies with measures taken in relation to housing, energy poverty, transport, economic development, and town and country planning or land use; 6. draws attention to the key role of local and regional authorities in the implementation of energy policy, the identification of financing instruments for energy projects \u2014 especially those involving renewable energies \u2014 and in promoting sustainable energy models and best practices among consumers; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/115 ",
        "7. warns that the achievement of energy and climate targets set at European and national level will be jeopardised if the leading role of local and regional authorities in the implementation of energy policy in the Energy Union is not officially recognised; 8. points out that the process of drafting national energy and climate plans must be transparent and accountable so that local players, businesses and other stakeholders know what to expect from national governments and, in particular, how compliance with obligations is ensured and what steps could be taken if national plans proved insufficient to achieve the targets at EU level; 9. welcomes the European Commission\u2019s recognition that the transition to clean energy will be impossible without the involvement of many stakeholders from civil society and regional and local levels and therefore calls on Member States to properly involve regions and cities in the debate on the energy transition (and particularly on the integrated national energy and climate plans) so that the right response can be given to the needs of different sectors; 10. notes, however, that \u2014 whatever the different constitutional provisions of individual EU Member States \u2014 the proposals on governance make no specific reference to the institutional role of local and regional authorities (to say nothing of other stakeholders), apart from the general provisions on public consultation in Article 10, which states that \u2018the public [must be] given early and effective opportunities to participate in the preparation of draft plans\u2019; 11. suggests consideration be given to further reform of the EU rules on State aid in the energy sector to underpin the measures taken by towns and cities, in particular by devising specific guidelines for local action that seek to simplify the existing framework and by means of both specific exemption provisions for energy projects in the regeneration of local authority and social housing in order to tackle the problem of energy poverty. It should therefore be ensured that the resilience of cities and the energy transition are enshrined as priorities in the next framework \u2014 from 2020 onwards; 12. calls on the European Commission and Member State governments to step up cooperation with local and regional stakeholders, especially their local and regional energy agencies, in shaping the future energy and climate plans at national level and in this way to shift from a policy in which only a few players are involved to one in which all are involved; 13. notes, in this connection, the many successful projects involving the use of renewable energies that have been started and taken forward at local level in cooperation with SMEs, NGOs and civil society organisations and by means of investments by individuals in electricity and heat production from renewables; 14. points out that a large number of other key players are active locally in the ambit of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, including small and medium-sized enterprises, NGOs and civil society organisations; 15. stresses the need to also involve local players in supporting the national government in pursuing a number of forward-looking EFSI projects that help in meeting Europe\u2019s climate and energy policy targets. The newly established European Investment Advisory Hub should provide a fast-track procedure to support cities that have committed themselves to developing projects with low CO 2 emissions; 16. calls, with reference to the European Investment Bank\u2019s JASPERS and ELENA programmes, for the implementation of further targeted technical assistance programmes that are needed to help cities and regions secure investment for carrying out ambitious projects, including by encouraging the development of a large portfolio of investment projects and the bundling of small and highly dispersed low-carbon emission projects; Planning and reporting must be simplified and integrated on the basis of existing local and regional plans 17. points out that the governance of the EU Energy Union must aim for the \u2018streamlining and integrating\u2019 of planning in practice and that effective links to existing initiatives must be forged with regard to monitoring and reporting; C 342/116 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "18. stresses that effective coordination is needed between the national and the local and regional tiers through planning, an implementation procedure and reporting in the area of energy and climate policy. This would help to avoid needless red tape and cater to the needs of better regulation; 19. points out that, with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, local and regional authorities are already heavily involved and many of them have already put together strategies, action plans and monitoring procedures, not least under the Covenant of Mayors initiative, which covers more than 5 679 action plans for sustainable urban development in the energy sector; 20. stresses that national plans and goals must be effectively tied in with goals at local and regional level and based on realistic and coordinated inputs from individual regions and sectors; 21. points out that participation is not just about consultation, but also an active role in initiating and designing specific measures; Multi-level governance is a precondition for effective Energy Union governance 22. regrets that the current recommendations for Energy Union governance do not include a sufficiently clear multi- level approach and therefore calls for Member State governments to set up Energy Dialogue platforms in order to enlist all levels of government and administration and all relevant stakeholders in designing national climate plans, in their monitoring and reporting, as well as organising exchange between different national Energy Dialogues with the help of the European Commission to ensure consistency and address cross-border problems; 23. points out that there are a lot of advantages to an effective multi-level governance: the public and business, too, are involved in carrying out climate change measures and so take more ownership of the process and increase the chances of success, because the more visible governance is, the greater the public\u2019s sense of responsibility; 24. points out that Article 11 of the proposal (on regional cooperation) relates only to cooperation between Member States rather than to cooperation between sub-national levels of governance within or between individual Member States; calls on the Member States and the European Commission to also ensure appropriate support for cooperation between sub- national authorities, in particular cross-border cooperation, with a view to coordinating activities to fulfil the integrated national climate and energy plans; 25. calls on the European Commission to include a section on multi-level governance in the documentation it addresses to Member State governments with guidelines on reporting on national energy policy and its planning; Getting consumers actively involved requires drivers to implement the directive, as well as effective support 26. again calls on the EU and the Member States to create legal frameworks that benefit both energy end-consumers and \u2018prosumers\u2019 and the other energy suppliers on the retail energy market; underlines also that decentralised and self- generation on the basis of renewable energies delivers numerous benefits to the energy system (reduced need for transmission infrastructure and maintenance, greater resilience and flexibility) and that these benefits should be reflected in a fair price for any surplus energy from such schemes being fed into the grid; encourages therefore Member States to develop or continue innovative pricing systems to address this issue; 27. points out the need for specialist advice, delivered in the right way, in the appropriate form and accessible through the appropriate communication channel on the ground for the target group and covering both technical and financial and practical aspects of the introduction of technologies with low CO 2 emissions; 28. stresses that measures taken in energy management must enable consumers to exercise control over their own consumption so that they can actively participate in the market and benefit from effective and appropriate customer protection; this is particularly important in the fight against energy poverty; the CoR therefore calls for the development of 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/117 ",
        "a common definition of energy poverty at EU level and for a set of concrete policy proposals aimed at the most vulnerable consumers, protect them against unjustified disconnection, prioritise energy efficiency measures to their benefit and devise targeted information for them; Promoting energy innovation in the move towards a low carbon economy 29. welcomes the focus the Commission puts in its Communication on accelerating clean energy innovation (COM (2016) 763) on two crucial political priorities: the creation of a resilient Energy Union with a forward-looking climate policy and new boosts to jobs, growth and investment; 30. calls for a business, innovation and investment-friendly environment and procedures achieved through targeted signals, strategies, standards and regulations and with the right support from financial instruments in which public funds are deployed to facilitate private investment (and support risk minimisation where necessary); 31. reiterates how important it is to configure energy policy in tight synergy with the European Union\u2019s research and innovation policy; stresses that innovation in the sphere of renewable forms of energy, sustainable mobility, updating of existing energy infrastructure, the building of smart power stations, carbon binding and energy storage must be further supported at local level; calls on the Commission, therefore, to ensure better support particularly for innovative projects in the outermost regions so these can be enlisted as genuine laboratories for the energy transition; 32. believes that the development of partnerships between local authorities under the smart-city initiatives has a key role to play in innovation in the field of clean energy in integrating areas such as energy saving in urban transport, interregional transport strategies, collaboration in new storage technologies, and smart public buildings. Better synergies between European Structural and Investment Funds and the European Fund for Strategic Investments are of crucial importance for the implementation of cross-border sustainable energy projects; 33. welcomes the focus being placed on Open Innovation and Open Science to give small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as civil society, the chance to further develop on the basis of new knowledge; 34. highlights the fact that the direct or indirect support for the use of fossil fuels (as well as the support provided by some Member States) must be scrapped as soon as possible because it masks the actual costs of such fuels for society and the environment and keeps prices artificially low, thereby hindering innovation in clean energy; 35. supports the proposed use of the legal instrument to expedite the development of innovative low-carbon technologies and their effective use. The transition to a low-carbon economy will require investment in smart heating and cooling systems and in increasing energy efficiency in industry, the construction sector and transport, as well as the co- financing of projects for investment in renewable energy; 36. stresses that the governance of the Energy Union must create the framework conditions for achieving the goals, such as easier access to public-private partnerships in order to accelerate project implementation, reduce red tape, identify any obstacles to local and regional authorities and provide legal certainty and predictability for investors; 37. calls for procurement to be used, as proposed, as an effective tool for creating a market for low carbon technologies. Subsidiarity and proportionality 38. Considers that the proposed regulation does not raise concerns regarding its compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. However, it raises concerns regarding its compliance with the principle of proportionality as the suggested governance system is considered too complex, too detailed and to impose too tight reporting intervals. The CoR would have preferred to see the governance system introduced via a directive, instead of regulation, which would allow the proper involvement of regional authorities in federal countries.

Subject to paragraph 3, each Member State may: (a) carry out the calculation required by point (a) of paragraph 1 using values of 1 % in 2014 and 2015; 1,25 % in 2016 and 2017; and 1,5 % in 2018, 2019 and 2020; (b) exclude from the calculation all or part of the sales, by volume, of energy used in industrial activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC; (c) allow energy savings achieved in the energy transfor- mation, distribution and transmission sectors, includ- ing efficient district heating and cooling infrastructure, as a result of implementing the requirements set out in Article 14(4), point (b) of Article 14(5) and Article 15(1) to (6) and (9), to be counted towards the amount of energy savings required under paragraph 1; (d) count energy savings resulting from individual actions newly implemented since 31 December 2008 that continue to have an impact in 2020 and beyond and which can be measured and verified, towards the amount of energy savings referred to in paragraph 1; and (e) exclude from the calculation of the energy savings requirement referred to in paragraph 1 the verifiable amount of energy generated on or in buildings for own use as a result of policy measures promoting new installation of renewable energy technologies. 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/121 ",
        "Reason The Energy Savings Obligations are due to deliver a substantial part of energy efficiency gains. It is therefore important to avoid too many exceptions, which also adds to the clarity of the legislation. Amendment 6 EED Article 9a Text proposed by the Commission CoR amendment 2. In multi-apartment and multi-purpose buildings with a central heating or cooling source or supplied from district heating and cooling systems, individual meters shall be installed to measure the consumption of heat or cooling or hot water for each building unit. 2. In multi-apartment and multi-purpose buildings with a central heating or cooling source or supplied from district heating and cooling systems, individual meters shall be installed to measure the consumption of heat or cooling or hot water for each building unit if technically feasible and cost-efficient, as well as proportionate in relation to the overall improvement of the energy performance of the building as defined in Directive 2010/31/EU . Where the use of individual meters is not technically feasible or where it is not cost-efficient to measure heating or cooling in each building unit, individual heat cost allocators shall be used to measure heat consumption at each radiator unless it is shown by the Member State in question that the installation of such heat cost allocators would not be cost efficient. In those cases, alternative cost- efficient methods of heat consumption measurement may be considered. The conditions of technical non- feasibility and non- cost effectiveness shall be clearly set out and published by each Member State. Where the use of individual meters is not technically feasible or where it is not cost-efficient or not propor- tionate to measure heating or cooling in each building unit, individual heat cost allocators shall be used to measure energy consumption at each radiator unless it is shown by the Member State in question that the installation of such heat cost allocators would not be cost efficient or proportionate . In those cases, alternative cost-efficient methods of heat consumption measurement may be considered. The conditions of technical feasibility cost effectiveness and proportionality shall be clearly set out and published by each Member State. In new buildings of the kind referred to in the first sub- paragraph or when such a building undergoes major renovation, as set out in Directive 2010/31/EU, individual meters shall always be provided. (\u2026) (\u2026) 4. For the purposes of this Article, as of 1 January 2020 meters and cost allocators installed shall be remotely readable devices. 4. For the purposes of this Article, as of 1 January 2020 meters and cost allocators newly installed shall be remotely readable devices. Meters and cost allocators that have already been installed but which are not remotely readable shall be provided with this capability or be replaced with remotely readable devices by 1 January 2027, except where the Member State in question shows that this is not cost-efficient. C 342/122 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "Reason Under Article 9a paragraph 2, the unconditional roll-out of individual metering for new buildings and buildings undergoing major renovations would have major negative impacts on social and energy efficiency policy in some Member States. Some Member States like Finland and Sweden have a \u2018gross rent\u2019 regime by which the landlord is under legal obligation to cover all the tenant\u2019s energy costs. The purpose of this rent regulation is to protect citizens from energy poverty. It is also very positive in terms of energy efficiency because as, under the \u2018gross rent\u2019 regime, the tenant has no incentive to save energy, energy efficiency renovation by the owner is the only way to reduce the tenant\u2019s energy consumption. The Directive as currently drafted would oblige countries like Finland and Sweden to either: \u2014 mandate installation of individual meters and keep the \u2018gross rent\u2019 regime, which means that the meters would be installed at great cost for no purpose, \u2014 or mandate installation of individual meters and revert to a \u2018net rent\u2019 regime under which the tenant would pay for his energy consumption. Ending gross rent would result in a significant reduction of social protection against energy poverty because gross rent ensures uninterrupted heating at optimal levels for those at risk of energy poverty. Member States that do not have \u2018gross rent\u2019 regimes but that have a pressing need to renovate large amounts of the housing stock should be free to prioritise renovation over individual meter roll-out, especially if an unqualified metering obligation creates an incentive for renovations below the \u2018major renovation\u2019 threshold so as to avoid the metering obligation. IMB must not be ring-fenced from Member State decisions on the overall issue of how to improve the energy performance of buildings. Article 9a(4), subparagraph 2 means nothing less than the replacement or transformation by 1 January 2027 of all individual meters and cost allocators already installed or to be by 2020 but which are not remotely readable. This concerns the majority of meters in case of heating, cooling and hot water. Given the tremendous work and financial investment already devoted, or in the process to be devoted, to the roll-out of such individual meters in multi-residential and/or commercial buildings, the proportionality of such a measure compared to the limited additional envisaged benefit \u2014 between a remotely readable and a not remotely readable meter \u2014 has clearly not been demonstrated. Therefore, proportionality demands that remotely readable devices be required only when a meter or a heat cost allocator is replaced, something that Article 9a(4), subparagraph 1 already requires as of 2020. Amendment 7 EPBD Recital 9 Text proposed by the Commission CoR amendment In order to adapt this Directive to the technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to supplement it by defining the smartness indicator and enabling its implementation. The smartness indicator should be used to measure buildings\u2019 capacity to use ICT and electronic systems to optimise operation and interact with the grid. The smartness indicator will raise awareness amongst building owners and occupants of the value behind building automation and electronic monitoring of tech- nical building systems and will give confidence to the occupant about the actual savings of these new enhanced- functionalities. 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/123 ",
        "Reason This provision is redundant and should be deleted, as the discussion on what the \u2018smartness\u2019 of a building or a home entails is still in its early stages. When introducing an instrument of this kind, extensive consultation of the various stakeholders is necessary. It unnecessarily increases the administrative burden on firms and households. Therefore, its added value and cost-effectiveness should be demonstrated and the instrument should be evaluated. The subsidiarity test is negative for the smartness indicator. This amendment is linked to amendment 6 and policy recommendation 17. Amendment 8 EPBD Article 1(2) Text proposed by the Commission CoR amendment after Article 2, an Article 2a \u2018Long-term renovation strategy\u2019, to be submitted in accordance with the integrated national energy and climate plans of the Regulation (EU) XX/20XX [Governance of the Energy Union], is inserted: after Article 2, an Article 2a \u2018Long-term renovation strategy in close coordination with regional and local authorities\u2019 , to be submitted in accordance with the integrated national energy and climate plans of the Regulation (EU) XX/20XX [Governance of the Energy Union], is inserted: (a) the first paragraph consists of Article 4 of the Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, other than its last subparagraph; (a) the first paragraph consists of Article 4 of the Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, other than its last subparagraph; (b) the following paragraphs 2 and 3 are inserted: (b) the following paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 are inserted: \u20182.

In their long-term renovation strategy referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall set out a roadmap with clear milestones and measures to deliver on the long-term 2050 goal to decarbonise their national building stock, with specific milestones for 2030. In addition, the long-term renovation strategy shall contribute to the alleviation of energy poverty. In addition, the long-term renovation strategy shall contribute to the alleviation of energy poverty.

To drive further developments in energy-efficient renovation, Member States shall introduce mechan- isms for: (a) promoting cooperation between SMEs in groups and consortia so they can offer bundled packages to potential clients; (b) providing support for new forms of training and qualifications and structural improvements to existing training; (c) consolidating informal learning pathways; (d) earmarking European Social Fund resources for training and educating construction industry workers in energy efficiency matters; (e) providing information and training measures for building administrators and users regarding the need to renovate buildings .\u2019 Reason The long-term renovation strategy should be devised in close cooperation with regional and local authorities, as they are the most affected by this. In addition, construction workers\u2019 knowledge and skills are crucial for improving the energy performance of buildings. Cooperation between contractors means that potential clients can be offered a more complete package of measures. Furthermore, information and training measures should primarily be aimed at administrators and users, with the goal of raising their awareness about the usefulness of renovating buildings. Amendment 9 EPBD Article 8(6) Text proposed by the Commission CoR amendment The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23 supplementing this Directive with a definition of \u2018smartness indicator\u2019 and with the conditions under which the \u2018smartness indicator\u2019 would be provided as additional information to prospective new tenants or buyers. The smartness indicator shall cover flexibility features, enhanced functionalities and capabilities resulting from more interconnected and built-in intelligent devices being integrated into the conventional technical building systems. The features shall enhance the ability of occupants and the building itself to react to comfort or operational requirements, take part in demand response and contribute to the optimum, smooth and safe operation of the various energy systems and district infrastructures to which the building is connected. 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/125 ",

        "II. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS (CoR) General recommendations 1. welcomes the vision of the role of regions and cities which the Commission sets out in the \u2018Clean Energy for All Europeans\u2019 package. It is in the cities and regions that the energy transition is actually taking place. The Committee of the Regions recommends developing this vision by indicating in what way the European Commission is supporting regions in the energy transition; 2. supports and welcomes the legislative proposals formulated by the European Commission on: pursuing the aims of smarter, cleaner energy for everyone; implementing the Paris objectives; supporting economic growth; promoting investment and technological leadership; creating new opportunities for employment; and improving people\u2019s well-being. These proposals affect regional policy and the Committee of the Regions sees a role for the regions in the implementation thereof. The Committee of the Regions calls on Member States to involve local and regional authorities in shaping integrated national energy and climate plans; 3. supports and welcomes the Commission\u2019s rationale in giving priority to energy efficiency. The cheapest energy is the energy we do not use. Energy efficiency can be viewed as a source of energy in itself, inexhaustible and available everywhere. Energy efficiency is crucially important for achieving climate and energy targets and is the most cost-effective way to achieve the energy union goals; 4. recalls that the fight against energy poverty is a crucial challenge for European energy policy which requires a multi- level response; therefore calls for the development of a common definition of energy policy as well as a set of targeted policy measures to address it; suggests in this context that a fixed share (at least 10 %) of the energy-saving obligations should be derived from measures or policies aimed at the most vulnerable consumers and that special financial instruments should be devised to allow the most vulnerable consumers to participate in, and to benefit from, energy efficiency measures; 5. points out that freedom of choice as regards the energy mix adopted runs the risk that the energy policy goals up to 2030 and beyond cannot be reached. The directives should therefore be made binding at EU level and accompanied by measures at national level; Recommendations on the EED 6. notes that achieving the Paris targets will represent a major challenge for Europe. Europe will need to aim higher (40 % in 2030) in energy efficiency in order to meet the targets; it will not be enough to continue on the current path of 1,5 % energy saving a year. Raising this energy saving target level to 2 % per year will generate more economic growth and more employment and will lead to lower energy imports. In this context, it will also be necessary to adapt Annex V of the revised directive to ensure that only those energy-saving measures may be counted towards the ESOs which do not compromise other aims of EU climate policy (such as CO 2 reduction) and that long-term sustainable solutions are incentivised; 7. for some regions and Member States this task is harder than for others, but energy savings and energy efficiency leads to more employment and higher economic growth everywhere; 8. understands the complexity of the situation that the European Commission finds itself in, but supports the target proposed by the European Parliament of 40 % by 2030; Obligations 9. notes that the energy obligation is the most important instrument for achieving energy efficiency. A growing number of Member States are adopting this system. Over a period of five years, the number of Member States using this instrument has grown from 5 to 15. The regions in the Member States which have applied it are satisfied with the tool. The Committee of the Regions recommends that the other Member States also go over to using it; 10. when revising Article 8, recommends adopting a critical approach to the size of the firms which come under this regulation, because there is significant savings potential amongst smaller firms too; 12.10.2017 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 342/127 ",
        "Audits 11. notes that Article 8 stipulates that energy audits must be carried out on certain companies. The European Commission has not amended this article. The Committee of the Regions recommends that the article indeed be amended so that the same type of companies come under the directive in all the Member States. This would provide a level playing field for all the Member States and ensure that legislation is uniform. The requirement for energy audits in larger companies should include a selection criterion for the extent of energy use. This would be more proportionate than targeting just turnover and number of staff. In order to avoid double regulation, Article 8 should allow energy use already covered by the energy certificates of the EPBD to be excluded from audits; 12. advocates combining with the energy audit the obligation to take all energy measures whose costs can be recouped within 5 years. This obligation exists in the Netherlands, for example, in the form of a package of recognised measures per branch of industry. This makes it easier to enforce; Metering 13. welcomes the fact that the European Commission is proposing to further empower consumers on the energy market by improving the information provided on their heating and cooling energy consumption and by strengthening their rights in the metering and billing of thermal energy, in particular for people living in multi-apartment buildings. However, the requirements regarding individual metering and billing for heat should be made conditional on cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility. Additionally, given the tremendous work and financial investment already devoted to the roll-out of individual meters, the proportionality of imposing remote readability compared to the limited additional envisaged benefit is questioned. In order to make sure information is provided more often, an obligation is being introduced for heat meters to be remotely readable. This requirement may be perceived as an invasion of privacy. The Committee of the Regions recommends that Member States take measures to safeguard people\u2019s privacy and ensure appropriate data security, and that installation be voluntary, not mandatory; 14. the Committee of the Regions welcomes such measures being introduced, on condition that they are assessed for cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility. This is an important safeguard for the various rental systems operated in the Member States; Funds 15. calls on the European Commission to earmark resources for clean energy for all Europeans after 2020 too, drawing not only on the Structural Funds, but also on the directly managed funds and the financial engineering instruments. The CoR supports the Commission\u2019s commitment to reducing energy poverty and recommends making resources available via the Structural Funds (Social Funds, Regional Fund, Cohesion Fund) after 2020 for local and regional authorities to tackle such poverty; 16. calls on the European Commission to develop appropriate tools and measures to mobilise public funds and attract private investment from European, national, regional and local levels in the energy efficiency sector; Recommendations on the EPBD 17. welcomes the Commission\u2019s proposal to improve the energy performance of buildings. Around 75 % of buildings in Europe are energy inefficient and every year only 0,4 % to 1,2 % of building stock is renovated. There is huge energy-saving potential in increasing the energy performance of buildings, especially in Central-Eastern Europe; 18. recommends that public authorities and market players provide home owners with better information about energy renovation opportunities for houses (what, how and where), for example via an easily accessible website and attractive packages. In addition, the Committee of the Regions advocates requiring knowledge about energy renovation in houses and buildings to be included in education curricula for workers in the construction industry, aimed at SME businessmen and workers in the sector; C 342/128 EN Official Journal of the European Union 12.10.2017 ",
        "Electricity charging points in non-residential buildings 19. shares the European Commission\u2019s view on the transition to sustainable transport (electric vehicles); supports the proposal to put infrastructure in place for electric transport in all new non-residential buildings, existing non-residential buildings (being extensively renovated) and new large residential buildings; and recommends that the Commission develop a European standard for charging points for electric vehicles so as to speed up the transition to sustainable transportation (electric vehicles); 20. expects that the \u2018Smart finance for smart buildings\u2019 initiative will help free up and attract large-scale private investment and endorses the initiative for supporting the scheme. One prerequisite is that the financial aspects thereof not be passed on to regions and municipalities. Local and regional authorities can play an active role in pooling applications for funding; Public buildings 21. agrees with the moving of EED Article 4 on building renovation to the EPBD; regrets that EED Article 5 on the exemplary role of public bodies\u2019 buildings is not included in the same move. The Committee of the Regions thinks that local and regional authorities likewise have an exemplary role to play in energy efficiency in the use of public buildings. The Committee calls on local and regional authorities to undertake to play such a role; Competence, subsidiarity and proportionality 22. concurs with the legal basis upon which the European Commission is basing the EU\u2019s competence in this. In accordance with TFEU Article 194, the EU is competent to take measures to promote, amongst other things, energy efficiency. Measures to combat energy poverty should come under TFEU Article 151. The assessment of subsidiarity principle compliance is partly positive and partly negative. The Committee of the Regions deems it to be warranted to set up and maintain a European target in energy efficiency. The Committee of the Regions is, however, opposed to the introduction of the smartness indicator by means of a delegated act, since the debate on the smartness indicator is still in its early stages. The assessment of proportionality principle compliance is positive. Brussels, 13 July 2017.
