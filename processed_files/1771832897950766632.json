        "5 An introduction to the Council of the European Union The Council of the European Union (EU) is the second of four European institutions whose origins lie in the 1951 Treaty of Paris establishing the European Coal and Steel Community. The Council of Ministers \u2013 as it is more commonly named \u2013 is, along with the European Commission and the European Parliament, one of the European Union\u2019s policy-making institutions. No important policy action or legislative deci- sion in the Union can be taken without the Council\u2019s agreement. It is the European Union\u2019s primary decision-making body. Only in the past fi fteen years or so has the Council had a more visible public profi le. Successive European Treaties, from the creation of the European Economic Community in 1957 to the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, have extended the scope and nature of its policy role, giving it greater prominence. The combining in 1999 of the post of the Council\u2019s Secretary-General and the newly created High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) has also helped in this regard. The dynamic role played by the fi rst High Representative, Javier Solana, has done much to put the Council more fi rmly on the map. One of the main diffi culties in understanding how the European Union works is that its political system does not fi t the mould citizens are familiar with in a national context. The EU\u2019s institutions are not based on the traditional separation of powers \u2013 between the legislature, executive and judiciary \u2013 in most Western democracies. This is because the European Union is not a State, nor is it evolving into one. That is why trying to portray the working of the Union\u2019s policy-making institutions by making direct comparisons with national institutions cannot adequately describe how they function. The Union\u2019s institutions are based on a separation of legitimate interests rather than a separation of powers. The European Parliament represents the popular interest; it brings together the directly elected representatives of the peoples of the Member States. The European Commission represents the general European interest. To confer legitimacy, Commissioners are entirely independent of national governments and the other EU institutions; the Commission also makes proposals on a collegiate basis. The Council is the forum where the interests of the Union\u2019s democratically elected national governments are legitimately advanced and defended. Explaining how it does so, while at the same time working in the collective interest as much as for individual national interests, is the purpose of this brochure. am805477EN_Int.indd 5 am805477EN_Int.indd 5 21/05/08 14:53:38 21/05/08 14:53:38 ",
        "6 The Council, like all policy or law-making institutions, has evolved highly sophisti- cated formal and informal structures. The sophistication stems from the fact that the European Union is a complex political system. It cuts across virtually every area of public policy. In many areas the Union passes laws and takes decisions that have legal eff ect in Member States and a direct impact upon citizens; in others it helps Member States coordinate their policies. This sets the Union apart from other group- ings of States. National governments, with the backing of national parliaments, have voluntarily created institutions and procedures through which collectively shared powers are exercised. Endowing the Union with a unique and carefully crafted institutional structure, in which power is deliberately dispersed and tempered with numerous checks and balances, is one of the factors of its success. The Council\u2019s tasks have grown as the Union\u2019s reach has extended. Within its evolving formal structures, it has developed its own informal traditions, rules, customs and working practices. Often misleadingly portrayed as the \u201cintergovernmental\u201d compo- nent of the European Union\u2019s novel institutional blend, the Council is fi rst and fore- most a supranational institution. The Council is the Union\u2019s primary decision-making body and acts as a collective body when defending its interests and prerogatives vis-\u00e0-vis the other EU institutions, or the Union\u2019s interests to the wider world. In many cases, it takes decisions by a majority or a qualifi ed majority of its members. At the same time, it is the forum in which the interests of Member State governments are legitimately articulated and arbitrated in the Union\u2019s decision-making process. The Council currently has 27 members. Its members are representatives of their govern- ments at ministerial level authorised to commit their government. The Council\u2019s work is partly legislative and partly executive. In some areas, the Council wields ultimate legislative power, with the European Parliament acting in an advisory role. However, in most areas of legislative activity, the Council co-legislates with the European Parliament, with both institutions having real powers to infl uence You said Council \u2026? The Council of the European Union should not be confused with the Eu- ropean Council , which brings together the Union\u2019s Heads of State or gov- ernment and the President of the European Commission, and is the Union\u2019s supreme political authority (see Chapter 3 below) nor the Council of Europe , the Strasbourg-based human rights and cultural organisation which is totally separate from the European Union. am805477EN_Int.indd 6 am805477EN_Int.indd 6 21/05/08 14:53:42 21/05/08 14:53:42 ",
        "7 the outcome of the legislative process. When deliberating on matters of foreign policy (on positions towards third States, or launching military or civilian crises management operations) or in police cooperation matters, the Council is more akin to a collective executive-type body. This duality explains many of the diffi culties the Council has encountered in the face of claims since the early 1990s that it did not aff ord suffi cient formal transparency in its proceedings and access to its documents when acting in legislative mode. A further complicating factor was that the treaties did not provide a clear defi nition of what constituted a legislative act. The Council is in essence an extremely sophisticated negotiating machine geared to taking decisions. It is remarkable that representatives of 27 governments of diff erent political hues and complexions, anchored in diff erent political systems with diverse national interests, and with ministers of diff erent personalities can reach agreement on such a vast array of policy issues. Through informal conventions, practices and working methods, Member State governments seek to shape policy outcomes to render them more politically presentable and acceptable for their national parliaments and electorates. While it might appear that the primary concern of each Council member is to maximise national advantage (at the expense of others), this negotiating process is in reality as much characterised by cooperation among members to secure outcomes. This is because governments have an overriding interest in ensuring that the system func- tions eff ectively. Government ministers also understand the need to accommodate political diffi culties. There is thus a strong drive to fi nd consensus. Another reason for this is the fact that the Council is obliged to negotiate collectively with the European Parliament on legislation, and with third States or organisations to defend the Union\u2019s interests abroad. Governments have learnt that cooperation to reach acceptable collective outcomes is in their long term interest. Many national negotia- tors also more easily share a general common understanding of the issues at stake, and therefore the realistic possibilities for reaching compromises. This brochure explains the basic design and mechanics of the institution and how the process of negotiation functions. am805477EN_Int.indd 7 am805477EN_Int.indd 7 21/05/08 14:53:45 21/05/08 14:53:45 ",

        "9 The Council seen from within Anyone who approaches a meeting room before the Council gets down to business is likely to observe a large number of people (around 100) meeting with the aim of drafting common laws, launching political initiatives and giving the European Union a genuine dynamic direction. But let us look closer: \u2022 Where are Council sessions held? More often than not, at the Council head- quarters in Brussels, the Justus Lipsius building. However, in April, June and October each year the Council\u2019s normal meetings take place in Luxembourg. \u2022 What are the different forms of Council? There is legally only one Council, but it has several diff erent incarnations according to the policy areas under consideration. The most well known Council confi gurations are: \u2013 The General Aff airs and External Relations Council (GAERC), which brings foreign ministers together once a month, is one which usually attracts the most media attention. This confi guration deals with hori- zontal dossiers (institutional issues, fi nancial perspectives, enlargement), but it mostly focuses on its wide agenda of external relations issues \u2013 Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), trade and development. Finally, it is the GAERC which is responsible for preparing the meetings of the European Council. \u2013 The Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) is composed of ministers responsible for their national macroeconomic policies, finance, and treasury matters. It meets most months and is an impor- tant forum for economic policy coor- dination and Economic and Monetary Union. \u2013 The Agriculture and Fisheries Council brings together the agriculture minis- ters, usually once a month. \u2013 The Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA) brings together the justice and home affairs ministers approximately every other month, to discuss the development and implementation of cooperation and common policies in this sector.

        "10 1. The Presidency There is one Minister at this table who carries a broader responsibility than any of his or her colleagues. He or she chairs the meeting and is a member of the government of the State holding the Presidency of the Council. Each Member State holds the Presidency for six months on a rotating basis. Drawing on the support and advice of the Council\u2019s General Secretariat, the Council\u2019s political priorities are drawn up for 18-month periods, to ensure that the Council\u2019s business is conducted as effi ciently as possible. In addition to having to cope with a large number of Council meetings, the Presidency also organises informal meetings. These meetings, which are held in the country of the Presidency, are more relaxed occasions and are opportunities for freer debate on general issues; it is important to stress that no formal decisions can be taken at an informal meeting. The Presidency is hard work for everyone involved: \u2022 Ministers have to be adequately briefed on all the issues to be discussed by the Council. This means very detailed preparation, often involving consultations with other Ministries. \u2022 Civil servants must also spend much more time on their European dossiers. This can be a very heavy burden for the country holding the Presidency, not least because the Presidency has to supply both a chairman and a national representative for the high number of working parties which prepare the Council proceedings.

        "11 \u2022 During their Presidency, even States\u2019 diplomats in third countries have a role to play: they coordinate the work of the Member States\u2019 embassies on issues of European interest, for example by drafting joint reports on the situation in the country in which they are posted.

        "12 Political sensitivity of the Presidency\u2019s tasks The Presidency can frequently promote an agreement in the Council when it seems most unlikely \u2013 often by mediating between the confl icting positions and always bearing in mind the general interest. The Presidency presents its plans and the Council\u2019s subsequent actions in the European Parliament, in addition to its special role in the context of the legislative procedure with the European Parliament. It reports to the Parliament on progress made at the end of its term and makes frequent appearances in the Parliament\u2019s plenary sessions and before its committees. The Presidency\u2019s representation duties extend beyond the European Parliament. Its ministers brief the media after each Council meeting and frequently speak for the EU as a whole, particularly on common foreign and security policy matters, in international fora and in relations with third countries. 2. Coreper (Permanent Representatives Committee) At the diff erent Council meetings very senior offi cials \u2013 members of Coreper (Permanent Representatives Committee) will always be found at their Ministers\u2019 side. They are a key element in the Council machinery. The 27 members of Coreper are the perma- nent representatives of the Member States\u2019 governments in Brussels and play a crucial role in preparing the Council\u2019s work. Specialists in European aff airs, highly skilled and with the rank of ambassador, they meet several times a week in a virtually permanent process of discussion and negotiation. They establish and maintain relationships of trust and confi dence that facilitate mutual under- standing of their respective positions. Coreper has two formations which meet at least once a week, Coreper I and Coreper II. The former is composed of the deputy permanent representatives and the second of the permanent representatives themselves. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the French Republic, Mr Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, Mr Lu\u00eds Amado and Mr Bernard Kouchner, France\u2019s Foreign Minister The atrium of the Council building am805477EN_Int.indd 12 am805477EN_Int.indd 12 21/05/08 14:54:08 21/05/08 14:54:08 ",
        "13 3. The Committees Coreper occupies a special position in the Council hierarchy, because it has the fi nal say in the preparation of Council proceed- ings, but other committees are also very important: \u2022 the Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA) prepares most items for the Agriculture Council; \u2022 the Article 133 Committee (set up under Article 133 of the EC Treaty) assists the Commission in its role as the negotiator on trade and tariff matters; \u2022 the Economic and Financial Committee, comprising representa- tives of Member States\u2019 Central Banks and Treasuries, plays an extremely important role in advising the ECOFIN Council on the various issues associated with the Economic and Monetary Union, the European Monetary System and international monetary relations; \u2022 the Political and Security Committee (PSC) prepares the EU\u2019s Common Foreign and Security Policy discus- sions and initiatives. Under the Council\u2019s authority, the PSC exer- cises control and strategic direc- tion of crisis management opera- tions. Thus, it may be authorised by the Council to take decisions in the concrete management of an operation. It is also assisted by a Politico-Military Working Party, a Committee for Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management, and the Military Committee (MC). As in Coreper, its representatives have ambassadorial rank; \u2022 the Article 36 Committee (it owes its existence to Article 36(1) of the Treaty on European Union) prepares certain aspects of the meetings of the Justice and Home Aff airs Council. 4. The working parties Working parties take part in the preparatory work for the Council. These working parties are many, very varied, and each one deals with specific topics. There were approxi- mately 150 of them in 2007. Attended by civil servants based in the Permanent Representations and in national capitals, their primary task is to do the necessary technical ground work for what will eventu- ally become an item of European legislation or policy. They are therefore composed of experts from the national administrations specialised in the subjects examined. Issues which cannot be resolved at this level are passed on to Coreper. 5. The Secretary-General of the Council and High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy Appointed by a decision of the Council, the Secretary-General has over the past 20 years become an important actor for the smooth operation of the Council. Thus, at the begin- ning of the 1980s, the Secretary-General\u2019s role was strengthened to off er better support to the Council and the Presidency in carrying out their tasks. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam in May 1999, he acquired a more political role as the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union. am805477EN_Int.indd 13 am805477EN_Int.indd 13 21/05/08 14:54:13 21/05/08 14:54:13 ",
        "14 Four men have held the offi ce in more than 40 years: Christian Calmes, Nicolas Hommel, Niels Ersb\u00f8ll and J\u00fcrgen Trumpf. The current Secretary-General, who is at the same time the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, is Javier Solana (1 ). He is assisted by Pierre de Boissieu, the Deputy Secretary-General. 6. The General Secretariat This was established in 1952 at the fi rst meeting of the Council of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), following the decision by that Council that there should be a proper written record of discussions, as well as translation and legal advice. These have been the basic tasks of the Secretariat ever since, and the addition of others has made it even more indispensable to the successful functioning of the Council system. The Secretariat\u2019s size and responsibilities have grown with the membership of the European Union. In 1958 it employed 238 people, in 2000 there were 2 540. As at 31 December 2007, the number of Council staff totalled 3 273 offi cials, temporary staff members and seconded national experts, with offi cials accounting for the vast majority. 1)Appointed in 1999 for fi ve years and reappointed in July 2004.

        "16 The roles and powers of the EU\u2019s institu- tions and bodies have been defi ned by the successive Treaties which have made them evolve. As far as the Council is concerned: 1951: the Treaty of Paris: set up the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and established the fi rst Council of Ministers. 1957: the Treaty of Rome: set up the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC) and established their own Council, distinct from that of the ECSC and with rather more authority in relation to the Commission. 1965: the Merger Treaty: created a single Council and a single Commission for the three Communities and formally estab- lished the Permanent Representatives Committee. But the Council continued to operate in rather diff erent ways depending on the treaty and the legal powers it was exercising. 1970: the Treaty amending certain Budgetary Provisions of the Treaties. 1975: the Treaty amending Certain Financial Provisions of the Treaties: these laid down a budgetary procedure and allocated budgetary powers amongst Community institutions. The Council was given extensive powers to determine Community spending, sharing some of them for the fi rst time with the European Parliament. \u2022 helping the Presidency to draw up the timetable of Council meetings; \u2022 convening and organising meetings \u2013 a heavy administrative responsi- bility with around 100 sessions of the Council and more than 3500 meet- ings of working parties and other gatherings every year; \u2022 acting as the Council\u2019s registrar and memory, by keeping archives, and being its depositary of international agreements; \u2022 supporting the civilian and mili- tary crisis management operations launched by the Council; \u2022 giving legal advice. Members of the Legal Service are on hand at all important meetings to advise on issues raised in discussions and to clarify the legal aspects of certain procedures. The Legal Service also represents the Council before the Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance and the Civil Service Tribunal. Organisation of the General Secretariat The General Secretariat is organised into eight Directorates General (DGs), together with a Legal Service and a private offi ce divided between the departments attached to the Secretary General/High Representative for CFSP and to the Deputy Secretary-General. Virtually all the DGs work on specifi c policy areas which match those of the Council confi gurations.

        "17 1997 : the Treaty of Amsterdam: immi- gration, visa and asylum policy and judi- cial cooperation in civil matters become common policies for which decisions are taken unanimously for fi ve years, but the Treaty introduces the possibility of moving to qualifi ed majority voting. More legislative power to be shared with the Parliament through the extension and modifi cation of co-decision; the Treaty modifi ed the role of Secretary-General of the Council, who also became High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). 2000: The Treaty of Nice (signed on 26 February 2001): during the Intergovernmental Conference on insti- tutional reform (IGC 2000), an agreement was reached at the end of the Nice summit on 11 December 2000. This Treaty allowed for laying down principles and methods to be adopted to reform the institutional system and accompany enlargement to the States of Central and Eastern Europe. With regard to reform of the institutions, the innovations lie in the Commission\u2019s method of operation: the Treaty provides that between 2004 and 2009 it will be composed of one commissioner per Member State. The Council has also been reformed in order to extend the fi eld of application of qualifi ed majority voting, and to introduce the principle of enhanced cooperation between Member States. 1986: the Single European Act: extended the opportunities for the Council to decide by qualifi ed majority vote, notably for measures needed to create the single market. The introduction of the \u201ccoopera- tion procedure\u201d extended the Parliament\u2019s share of legislative power. The Single Act gave the Council management responsi- bility for European Political Cooperation. 1992: the Treaty on European Union (TEU): known as the Treaty of Maastricht, set out the objectives and rules for Economic and Monetary Union and organised the European Union\u2019s powers and responsi- bilities around a new three-pillar struc- ture. The Council\u2019s powers, rules and deci- sion making procedures vary according to the pillar under which it is operating. The Treaty on European Union: \u2022 extended the range of quali- fi ed majority voting on fi rst pillar issues; \u2022 gave the European Parliament extended powers of co-decision with the Council on legislative matters in certain policy areas, e.g. free movement of workers, internal market, consumer protection; \u2022 allowed for the possibility for the fi rst time that not all Member States would participate in parti- cular policies \u2013 opt-outs were permitted from Economic and Monetary Union and the social fi eld. am805477EN_Int.indd 17 am805477EN_Int.indd 17 21/05/08 14:54:37 21/05/08 14:54:37 ",

        "19 1. A strategic body The European Council\u2019s evolution has been shaped above all by practical political neces- sities and the wishes of the participants. Created in 1974 with the intention of estab- lishing an informal forum for discussion between Heads of State or Government, the European Council rapidly developed into the body which fi xes priorities and goals for the Union and sets the course for achieving them, in all the fi elds of the European Union\u2019s activity. It acquired a formal status in the Treaty on European Union signed in 1992, which defi ned its function as providing the impetus and general political guidelines for the Union\u2019s development. 2. The meetings of the European Council: who and what is involved, when and where? The European Council is composed of 27 Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission. They are usually assisted by the Foreign Aff airs Ministers and another member of the Commission. Unlike at Council meetings, only the politicians have access to the meeting room \u2013 the offi - cials assisting them remain outside, so as to preserve the original intimacy of European Council meetings. The European Council defi nes the outlines for development of the European Union. For example, in November 2004 the European Council drew up an ambitious programme for the development of justice and home aff airs policy. Each spring it reviews the implemen- tation of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment. It is at this level that the nego- tiations for accession of the new Member States were fi nalised in 2002. It was also the European Council which in December 2005 concluded the negotiations on the fi nancing of the Union over the period 2007-2013. In the spring of 2007 the European Council defi ned the basis for a new integrated policy to deal with the challenges of energy supply and climate change. The European Council generally meets four times a year. It can happen that it meets more often in the event of an emergency, as was the case for example after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Although in the past it met in the country holding the Presidency, since 2003 it has automatically been meeting at the Council\u2019s headquarters in Brussels. It is not surprising that the meetings between Heads of State, Heads of Government and the President of the Commission attract a great deal more public attention than a routine session of the Council. It is not unusual for more than 1 500 journalists to fl ock to Brussels to cover a European Council meeting. 3. Preparation of European Council meetings The deliberations of the European Council are prepared very thoroughly in advance by the Council bodies. One month before the European Council meeting, the Presidency circulates an \u201canno- tated agenda\u201d which indicates, for each item on the agenda, the Presidency\u2019s intentions. This agenda is submitted to the GAERC. The Presidency then circulates the draft conclusions of the European Council, which are discussed in Coreper II, and then in the GAERC. This process enables the Heads of State and Government to focus their atten- tion on the most important points. am805477EN_Int.indd 19 am805477EN_Int.indd 19 21/05/08 14:54:41 21/05/08 14:54:41 ",
        "20 The occasion ends with a press conference given by the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission. It is followed by press conferences held by the other Heads of State or Government. 5. The European Council\u2019s secretariat The secretariat for the European Council is provided by the General Secretariat of the Council. It assists the Presidency in preparing the annotated agenda and the draft conclusions. During the European Council, the Secretary- General and the Deputy Secretary-General assist the Presidency, particularly in order to reach agreement on the draft conclusions. At the end of the European Council the General Secretariat draws up, under the Presidency\u2019s responsibility, the fi nal version of the conclusions. 4. Conduct of European Council meetings European Council meetings generally last for a day and a half. Since 1987 these meetings have been preceded by an address by the President of the European Parliament. The fi rst working meeting then begins, followed by informal discussions during the separate dinners of the Heads of State or Government and Foreign Ministers. After dinner, the Presidency and offi cials from the Council\u2019s General Secretariat will fi nalise the draft conclusions based on the fi rst day\u2019s talks and texts on specifi c issues that will be the subject of negotiations the following day before being approved. Another plenary session is held in the morning of day two, and this may stretch into the afternoon. At the close, the \u201cPresidency Conclusions\u201d are distributed to the media. am805477EN_Int.indd 20 am805477EN_Int.indd 20 21/05/08 14:54:45 21/05/08 14:54:45 ",

        "23 Once a Commission proposal has been received by the Council, it is passed to the Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions for opinions when required by the Treaty. Then the work enters three phases: Phase One: examining the proposal The Presidency, with the assistance of the Secretariat, identifi es and convenes the appropriate working party. This working party begins with a general examination of the proposal and then makes a line-by-line scrutiny. There is no formal limit on the time a working party can take to complete its work; that varies very much from one proposal to another. Phase Two: enter Coreper Coreper (or the Special Committee on Agriculture for most agricultural matters) takes up the issue after receiving a report from the working party. Its treatment of the proposal will depend on how much agreement has been reached at that level. If it is suffi cient to allow Coreper to agree upon the proposal without discus- sion, it features on Part I of the agenda and is then sent to the Council for enactment. If further discussion is needed within Coreper because agreement has not been reached in the working party on certain aspects of a proposal, it is listed in Part II of the Coreper agenda. In this case, Coreper can: \u2022 try to negotiate a settlement itself; 1. Setting and managing the agenda In addition to the six-monthly rotation of the Presidency, the Council\u2019s longer-term busi- ness must be sustained. The consistency and continuity of its work are reinforced by a planning eff ort at three levels: the Council\u2019s 18-month programme, the Council\u2019s indica- tive agendas and the timetable of Presidency meetings. 1. The Council\u2019s 18-month programme For each 18-month programme, the three Presidencies which will be in offi ce during that period draw up the Council\u2019s programme. This covers the Union\u2019s major objectives in all sectors of activity. The programme is subject to the approval of the General Aff airs and External Relations Council, which debates it in public session. 2. The Council\u2019s indicative agendas Before taking up its duties, the Presidency draws up indicative agendas for all the Council meetings it plans to organise. These agendas are defi ned in the light of the Council\u2019s 18-month programme. 3. Timetable of meetings Several months before they take offi ce, the incoming Presidencies draft a timetable and send a list of dates for Council meetings to their partners. 2. Handling the business The best way to understand how the Council works is to follow the progress of a Commission proposal for Council legislation. am805477EN_Int.indd 23 am805477EN_Int.indd 23 21/05/08 14:55:00 21/05/08 14:55:00 ",
        "24 \u2022 too politically sensitive to be settled at a lower level. The Council\u2019s decision-making can therefore be summed up as a three-stage process. At one end, the main technical work is done at the level of the experts sitting on working parties; at the other, the ministers meeting in the Council take the political decisions. Between the two, the Ambassadors of the Member States in Coreper combine technical expertise and ability to engage in political arbitration. In this respect, Coreper acts as a kind of catalyst for the Council. Coreper is also the preferred forum for nego- tiation with the European Parliament. Most areas of Community legislation are nowadays subject to the co-decision procedure. On the basis of a Commission proposal, the two legislative branches \u2013 European Parliament and Council \u2013 are involved in a sometimes long and arduous process of negotiation, at both internal and interinstitutional level, in order to reach a fi nal agreement on the legis- lative text to be adopted. The President of Coreper is responsible for conducting most contacts with the European Parliament, espe- cially in the decisive fi nal stages of negotia- tion. To do so, he must at each stage have the dossier examined fi rst by Coreper and obtain a mandate for negotiation. 3. Decision-making procedures The Treaties lay down the cases in which the Council acts by a simple majority, by a quali- fi ed majority or unanimously. Virtually from the very beginning, the Council has preferred to decide by consensus if at all possible. But consensus has not always been possible and it has been made more elusive by the steady increase in the number of Member States. So it should be no surprise \u2022 refer the proposal back to the working party, perhaps with sugges- tions for a compromise; \u2022 pass the matter up to the Council. Most proposals feature several times on the agenda of Coreper, which seeks to resolve diff erences that the working party has not overcome. Phase Three: Council decides If Coreper has been able to agree a proposal, it will become an \u201cA\u201d item on the Council agenda, meaning that agreement is expected without discussion. As a rule, around two thirds of the items on a Council agenda will be for adoption as \u201cA\u201d items. Discussion on these items can nevertheless be re-opened if one or more Member States so request. Other items are entered into the \u201cB\u201d section of the Council agenda. \u201cB\u201d items are matters: \u2022 left over from previous Council meetings; \u2022 upon which no agreement was possible in Coreper or the working party; A meeting room seen from an interpreter\u2019s booth am805477EN_Int.indd 24 am805477EN_Int.indd 24 21/05/08 14:55:04 21/05/08 14:55:04 ",
        "25 Weighting of Member States\u2019 votes Member States\u2019 votes are weighted as follows: Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom 29 votes each Spain, Poland 27 votes each Romania 14 votes Netherlands 13 votes Belgium, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Portugal 12 votes each Bulgaria, Austria, Sweden 10 votes each Denmark, Ireland, Lithua- nia, Slovakia, Finland 7 votes each Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovenia 4 votes each Malta 3 votes Total 345 votes In most cases, if the subject is a Commission proposal a qualifi ed majority is reached if 255 votes in favour are cast by the majority of members. When the Council is not deciding on a Commission proposal, two conditions must be met for it to be adopted by a quali- fi ed majority: \u2013 255 votes out of 345; \u2013 two-thirds of the members of the Council. Furthermore, a Member State may ask for a check to ensure that the qualifi ed majority comprises at least 62 % of the total popu- lation of the European Union. If this turns out not to be the case, the decision is not adopted. that voting, or even the possibility of voting, has become an essential element in Council decision-making. Voting can get the job done The right to call a vote lies not only with the President of the Council, but also with any other member of the Council. The Commission can also secure a vote if a majority of the Council\u2019s members supports this request. The diff erent kinds of vote are: \u2013 simple majority: this means a majority of the members (i.e. 14 out of 27, not counting abstentions). It is the method applied unless the Treaty provides otherwise, and is mainly used for procedural deci- sions \u2013 each Member has one vote; \u2013 qualifi ed majority voting (i.e. by weighting votes of Council members according to the size of the State in question): the possi- bilities of qualifi ed majority voting have been signifi cantly expanded by the Single Act, the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice (currently in force) to cover most decisions of the European Union (with the exception of matters concerning CFSP, taxation or employment, etc., which require unanimity). am805477EN_Int.indd 25 am805477EN_Int.indd 25 21/05/08 14:55:12 21/05/08 14:55:12 ",
        "26 has the possibility of submitting an amended proposal at any time during the negotiations. This gives the Commission an active and impor- tant role in the Council\u2019s negotiating process. Abstention by a member of the Council does not prevent unanimity. When a decision is needed more urgently than the time in which a Council meeting can be arranged, it can be taken by a written vote if the Council or Coreper agree unanimously to use that procedure. Finally, the \u201cLuxembourg compromise\u201d must be mentioned. This is a political statement which has not been agreed by all Member States. Some of them invoke it in the case of decisions which may be taken by quali- fi ed majority vote on a proposal of the Commission and where they fi nd that vital national interests are at stake. If this is invoked, the Council might either vote and reject the wish of the Member State concerned, or endeavour, within a reasonable time, to reach a solution. This is a political (not a legal) instrument to which reference is sometimes made, but which is rarely invoked in practice. \u2013 Unanimity: it is still required in a number of fi elds such as taxation, \u201cconstitutional matters\u201d, social secu- rity, environment (in part), energy, culture, industry, horizontal inter- national agreements with deve- loped countries. It is also the rule for common strategies, joint actions or common positions adopted under the CFSP and in many areas of Justice and Home Aff airs. Finally, the Council has to be unanimous if it wishes to amend a Commission proposal against the Commission\u2019s wishes. However, the Commission A press conference at the Council A meeting of Foreign Ministers am805477EN_Int.indd 26 am805477EN_Int.indd 26 21/05/08 14:55:15 21/05/08 14:55:15 ",

The appli- cant then has 15 working days to submit a confi rmatory application. If the confi rmatory application is rejected in its entirety or in part, the applicant may lodge a complaint with the European Ombudsman and/or fi le an appeal before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities. Council deliberations open to the public and public debates Public access to the Council\u2019s deliberations and debates is part of its overall transparency policy. This policy specifi es inter alia that all Council deliberations on legislative acts adopted according to the co-decision proce- dure are open to the public. In addition, the following are also open to the public: \u2013 the fi rst deliberations of the Council on legislative acts other than those adopted under the co-decision procedure and subsequent delibera- tions on a given act, unless otherwise decided by the Council or Coreper; 4. Transparency and openness of the Council\u2019s decision-making process The two basic aspects of transparency The principle of public access to documents of the Community institutions is considered to be one of the basic elements of the trans- parency policy, which aims to strengthen the democratic nature of the institutions and public confi dence in the administration, and the second aspect is the openness of the Council\u2019s decision-making process. Public access to Council documents All citizens have the right of access to Council documents under the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. The General Secretariat of the Council is obliged to provide a reply within 15 working days, although this can, exceptionally, be extended by a further 15 working days. Access generally involves issuing a copy of the document, or where appropriate providing an electronic version. In order to make it easier to fi nd documents which might be requested, the General Secretariat of the Council publishes a public register of Council documents on the Internet. Certain categories of document, in particular where the Council is acting in its capacity as legislator, are available on-line as soon as they have been circulated to delegates of the Member States. Furthermore, documents which have been supplied in response to individual requests are also available via the register.

        "28 Publication of the results of votes, state- ments and minutes The results of votes held among Council members are automatically made public when the Council is acting in its capacity as legislator. The votes of members of the Council may be accompanied by explana- tions of vote to be made public at the request of their author(s). Where the Council is not acting as legislator, it is also possible for the results of votes and explanations of vote to be made public by a unanimous decision of the Council. In the context of the decision-making proce- dure, the Council, the Commission and/or one or more of the members of the Council may make statements and request that they be included in the Council minutes. Such statements have no legal eff ect and are regarded as a political instrument intended to facilitate decision-making. The rules governing public access to state- ments in the Council minutes and to the minutes themselves are similar to those on the publication of the results of votes. The minutes contain, for each agenda item, a list of the documents submitted to the Council, the decisions taken or the conclu- sions reached by the Council, and the state- ments for the minutes. \u2013 deliberations of the General Aff airs and External Relations Council on the 18-month programme, and debates of other Council confi gurations on their priorities; \u2013 the presentation by the Commission of its fi ve-year programme, its annual work programme and its annual policy strategy, and the ensuing debates; \u2013 other public debates on important issues aff ecting the interests of the Union and its citizens. To enable citizens to follow Council proceed- ings, the Council General Secretariat broad- casts by way of \u201cvideo streaming\u201d in the EU\u2019s offi cial languages all those Council delib- erations and debates which are open to the public, on the Council\u2019s Internet site: www.consilium.europa.eu. This site also provides access to all Council documents being discussed, as well as back- ground information, press releases and also, at the end of each public deliberation ending with a vote on a legislative act, the detailed results of that vote.

The General Secretariat arranges information visits in the Justus Lipsius building for groups of at least 10 people. The visit involves a presentation by a GSC offi cial of the role and operation of the Council, followed by a question and answer session.

Their main elements are: \u2013 the Council draws up a draft budget on the basis of a preliminary draft from the Commission and after consultation with the Parliament; \u2013 the Parliament may amend the budget and if it does so, the Council takes a position on the amend- ments by qualifi ed majority voting before sending the budget back to Parliament. Usually further negotiations are needed between the Council and Parliament before the budget is offi - cially signed by the President of the Parliament. It should be noted that Parliament has the fi nal word on non-com- pulsory expenditure entered in the budget while for compulsory expenditure this power falls to the Council. \u2022 Assent: in certain cases provided for in the treaties, the Council cannot adopt an act without Parliament\u2019s favourable opinion. The European Parliament\u2019s assent is required for important international agreements The European Union could not function without a high degree of cooperation be- tween the institutions. The Presidency and the General Secretariat must also try to en- sure fruitful and eff ective interinstitutional cooperation. 1. Relations with the European Parliament In recent years, the successive reforms of the treaties have strengthened the trend towards the gradual sharing of legislative powers between the European Parliament and the Council. During the passage of legislation, both these institutions have to work closely together according to procedures which vary according to the provisions of the Treaty for the policy area concerned. \u2022 Co-decision: This procedure was introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht. It gives the European Parliament the power to adopt acts jointly with the Council. The co-decision procedure involves one, two or three readings. It has the eff ect of increasing contacts between the Parliament and the Council, the co-legislators, and with the Commission. The co-de- cision procedure was simplifi ed by the Treaty of Amsterdam to make it more effi cient and faster and to strengthen the Parliament\u2019s role. It has also been extended to cover new areas, in particular social exclu- sion, public health and the preven- tion of fraud aff ecting the European Community\u2019s fi nancial interests. The Treaty of Nice again transferred seven additional areas to qualifi ed majority voting in the Council and the co-decision procedure. The areas concerned are incentives to combat discrimination, judicial am805477EN_Int.indd 31 am805477EN_Int.indd 31 21/05/08 14:55:38 21/05/08 14:55:38 ",

It is usually represented by a Minister for European Aff airs or by the minister who is the President of the Council responsible for the matter under discussion. During each Presidency there is normally one ministerial appearance before each parliamen- tary committee. This occurs more regularly before the Committee on Foreign Aff airs, its Subcommittees on Security and Defence and Human Rights, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Aff airs. According to the EU Treaty, under the Common Foreign and Security Policy the Presidency is assisted by the Secretary General/High Representative for the CFSP. The latter also appears regularly before the Parliament\u2019s plenary session and Committee on Foreign Aff airs. 2. Relations with the Commission This relationship is marked by construc- tive cooperation and some fl eeting tension. Formally, the Commission initiates the policy and decision-making process. It does not always get its way with the Council but it plays a pivotal role in much of the Council\u2019s work. In addition to the treaty regulated such as the accession of new Member States, association agreements with third countries, and the organisa- tion and objectives of the Structural and Cohesion Funds (for promoting balanced economic development within and between Member States). \u2022 Consultation procedure: requires an advisory opinion from the Parliament before the Council can adopt a legislative proposal from the Commission. This applies, for example, to the annual agricultural price review and to decisions and agreements on trade matters. Responding to Parliament The Council Presidency has a vital role in representing the Council before the Parliament. During its six months\u2019 term, the Presidency: \u2022 presents its programme to the Parliament at the beginning of its term and reports on progress at the end; \u2022 delivers an oral report by the President following each meeting of the European Council; Mr Hans Gert P\u00f6ttering, President of the European Parliament, and Mr Javier Solana, SG/HR am805477EN_Int.indd 32 am805477EN_Int.indd 32 21/05/08 14:55:42 21/05/08 14:55:42 ",
        "33 3.Relations with the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions Presidency Ministers present the Presidency\u2019s work programme to these Committees and occasionally attend plenary sessions to discuss specifi c subjects. In some areas, the Treaties require the Council to take note of the Committees\u2019 opinions on legislative proposals. 4.Relations with the Court of Justice and Court of First Instance \u2022 The acts of the Council, like those of other EU institutions, can be chal- lenged by Member States, other insti- tutions, individuals and companies before the Court of First Instance and before the Court of Justice, in the cases defi ned by the Treaties. The Council and the other institutions can also bring cases before the Court. \u2022 The judges of the Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal and the members of the Court of Auditors are appointed by the Council, on proposals from the Member States. aspects of their relationship, less formal forms of cooperation are very important, such as: \u2212 informal exchanges of opinion between Commission offi cials, the private sector and offi cials of the Member States before the Commission fi nally drafts a proposal. Sounding out the Council in this way may often speed up progress to agreement; \u2212 the Commission can help the Presidency to secure agreement by supporting its eff orts to mediate between the Council\u2019s Members, and by being ready or not, as the case may be, to amend its proposals during the course of a negotiation in order to secure the necessary quali- fi ed majority; \u2212 by off ering its opinions, the Commission can help to shape the Presidency\u2019s work programme; \u2212 the Commission and Council coor- dinate closely on external issues because both have responsibili- ties for representing the EU to the outside world. On many trade issues, for example, the Commission negoti- ates not only for the Community, but also for all Member States and is their authorised representative (e.g. in the World Trade Organization in general). In many relationships with third States (e.g. those covered by asso- ciation agreements) the Commission negotiates while sharing representa- tion with the Council.

        "35 INTRODUCTION The European Union is now a major player on the world stage. With a population of some 500 million people representing over 25 % of the world\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), providing half of all development aid and contributing to a fi fth of world-wide imports and exports, the Union is an active political player, with regional and global security interests and responsibilities to match. It is a role that Europeans and non-Europeans alike want the EU to play. The EU has a common foreign policy through which it speaks with one voice on key inter- national issues. It is playing an essential role in the Middle East peace process, in diplo- macy with Iran and in strengthening the stability of the Western Balkans, including in Kosovo. It has troops, police and judges helping to save lives, and stabilise countries and regions after confl icts across the globe, from Kosovo to Afghanistan and from the Palestinian Territories to Chad. It provides emergency relief in the wake of disasters. The Union has a High Representative, Javier Solana, as its face and voice abroad. It has a secu- rity strategy guiding its response to global threats and underpinning its strategic rela- tions with key partner countries and regions, with which it holds regular summits. EU Special Representatives work in all corners of the world to further the Union\u2019s foreign policy aims. The Union has privileged relationships with its closest neighbours in the Western Balkans and the Mediterranean region. It has a vast web of complex relationships with the rest of the world covering political cooperation, trade and development aid, and it plays a key role in international agreements on trade, the environment and human rights. Since January 2007, the Union numbers 27 Member States, following the most recent wave of enlarge- ment that has taken in 12 new members, over- coming the divisions of the continent in the 20th century. 1. The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) It was the geopolitical changes that followed the collapse of communism at the end of the 1980s, the reunifi cation of Germany, the confl icts in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the threat of international terrorism that prompted EU leaders to create and develop its formal instruments of diplomacy and interven- tion under the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 and the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999. These treaties gave the Union the means to respond to the crises that confronted it on its doorstep and to project its values around the world as a whole, replacing European Political Cooperation (which had begun in 1970 and was formalised Mr Javier Solana, SG/HR, welcomes Mr Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations am805477EN_Int.indd 35 am805477EN_Int.indd 35 21/05/08 14:55:52 21/05/08 14:55:52 ",
        "36 EU in the international Quartet dealing with the Middle East peace process. He has been mandated by the international community to represent it in conducting talks with Iran on its nuclear programme. He has steered the EU\u2019s active role in a number of countries in the Western Balkans, including the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where he led the negotiations on the Ohrid Agreement, as well as in Serbia and Montenegro, between whom he facilitated the Belgrade Agreement, and Kosovo. He has also been actively engaged with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including Ukraine and Moldova. The High Representative is supported by a number of European Union Special Representatives who are appointed by the Council on his recommendation and are responsible for developing and helping to implement the Union\u2019s foreign policy objec- tives around the world. There are currently 11 EUSRs. The High Representative has also appointed several personal representatives dealing with specifi c issues such as non-pro- liferation of weapons of mass destruction, human rights and parliamentary aff airs. A set of structures was set up under the Amsterdam Treaty to support the work of the in 1986) whereby Member States merely consulted one another with a view to coope- rating on major international policy issues. The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) was established under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which entered into force in 1993, and was strengthened under the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty , which entered into force in 1999. The Amsterdam Treaty created the operational arm for the CFSP, the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) , with the potential for later creating a common defence structure. The CFSP was further rein- forced under the 2001 Nice Treaty , which entered into force in 2003. The objectives of the CFSP under the Treaty on European Union are to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the Union; to strengthen the security of the Union; to preserve peace and strengthen international security; to promote international coopera- tion, and to develop and consolidate democ- racy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Since the Amsterdam Treaty, the role of the Council has steadily increased. This Treaty created the post of High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy , for \u2018a personality with a strong political profi le\u2019, in order to give the CFSP diplomatic weight and continuity. This position is combined with that of Secretary-General of the Council. The Cologne European Council in 1999 designated Javier Solana as the fi rst High Representative/Secretary-General and his mandate was renewed for a second fi ve-year term in 2004. The High Representative\u2019s role, under the Treaty, is to assist the Presidency in formu- lating policy. He also acts on behalf of the Council in conducting political dialogue with third parties and he chairs the military committee and the defence agency. Together with the Presidency and the commissioner for external relations, Solana represents the Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2013 in the centre, Lt. General David Leakey, the present Director General of the EU Military Staff am805477EN_Int.indd 36 am805477EN_Int.indd 36 21/05/08 14:55:59 21/05/08 14:55:59 ",
        "37 High Representative. The Policy Planning and Early Warning Unit , in the General Secretariat of the Council, is staff ed by national diplo- mats and experts from the Council and the Commission. It monitors international political developments, alerts the High Representative and the Council to any crises that are likely to arise and examines their possible consequences for the Union, as well as possible lines of action for the Union to take, enabling it to react more swiftly and eff ectively. The Nice Treaty created a standing Political and Security Committee (PSC) comprised of representatives of ambassadorial rank of the Member States. The PSC is the hub around which the CFSP operates. It monitors the international situation in the areas covered by the CFSP and the ESDP and contributes to the defi nition of policies. It meets at least twice a week and, under the responsibility of the Council, it provides political control and strategic direction of crisis management operations. \u201cIt is my belief that because of our size and interests, because of our history and values, we have an obligation to take our share of responsibilities in this global age. We could, in theory, walk away from these responsibili- ties - but we could not escape the consequences of doing so.\u201d Javier SOLANA, Europe\u2019s place in the world, The Hague, February 2001.

        "38 The Joint Situation Centre (SITCEN) opened on 1 January 2003 and is staff ed by civilian and military offi cials. It provides early warning, situation monitoring and assessment, acts as a round-the-clock operational contact point and provides facilities for a crisis taskforce. 2. Formulation and conduct of foreign policy The European Council (Heads of State and Government of the 27 Member States plus the President of the European Commission) sets out the general principles and guide- lines for the CFSP, including for matters with defence implications. It generally meets four times a year. The six-monthly rotating Presidency of the Council represents the Union in CFSP matters and expresses the position of the Union in international organisations and interna- tional conferences. It is assisted by the High Representative who contributes to the formu- lation, preparation and implementation of European policy decisions. The Presidency , High Representative and President of the European Commission hold summit meetings with the EU\u2019s partner countries or regions. The Council \u2013 meeting as the General Aff airs and External Relations Council (GAERC) and consisting of the foreign ministers of the Member States \u2013 convenes once a month and discusses relevant external relations issues as well as institutional issues. It defi nes and implements the EU\u2019s common foreign and security policy on the basis of guide- lines set by the European Council. Policy is formulated on the basis of consensus- building and collective problem-solving. The Council\u2019s formal positions are published as \u201cconclusions\u201d or \u201cstatements\u201d of the Council. Declarations are also issued by the Presidency and the High Representative. Since the late 1990s, EU defence ministers have met regu- larly. Although there is no formal Defence Council as such, at least one informal meeting of defence ministers is held during each presidency and defence ministers attend one session of the External Relations Council devoted to politico-military issues. The Permanent Representatives Committee (COREPER) and the Political and Security Committee (PSC) prepare the work of the Council, with COREPER preparing the work of the Council as a whole and the PSC dealing The Federal Chancellor, Ms Angela Merkel, and Mr Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, at the EU- Africa summit in Lisbon am805477EN_Int.indd 38 am805477EN_Int.indd 38 21/05/08 14:56:07 21/05/08 14:56:07 ",
        "39 European Council. It commits the Member States to conducting an activity, for example appointing an EUSR, supporting projects in the fi eld of non-proliferation, or sending a peace- monitoring mission after a confl ict. When the Council decides on a joint action it lays down its scope, the EU\u2019s general and specifi c objec- tives for the action and, if necessary, its dura- tion, means, procedures and conditions for its implementation. It also usually defi nes the fi nancial reference amount for the conduct of the action. The Amsterdam Treaty added a third legal instrument, a common strategy , to be defi ned by consensus in an area where the Member States have important shared interests. 4. The European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) The European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), was introduced under the Amsterdam Treaty, as the operational arm of the Common Foreign and Security Policy in the fi eld of crisis management, covering all questions relating to the EU\u2019s security and with the potential for later creating a common defence structure, should the European Council so decide. Under the ESDP, the Union now has permanent polit- ical and military structures and civilian and military capabilities, as well as a set of crisis management concepts and procedures. The Cologne European Council in June 1999 placed crisis-management tasks at the heart of the process of strengthening the CFSP. These tasks include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace keeping tasks and tasks of combat-force in crisis management, including peace-making. The Cologne European Council also decided that \u201cthe Union must have the with political and security issues. Working parties dealing with CFSP, composed of experts from EU Member States and the Commission, meet along geographical lines (covering, for example, the Middle East and the Balkans) and thematic lines (covering, for example, human rights, the UN, and c o u n t e r- t e r- rorism). They prepare PSC and COREPER meetings. They make joint analyses of the situation in third countries and of multila- teral issues and they prepare possible common positions. They draw up proposals for measures to implement the CFSP, such as declarations by the presidency on behalf of the EU, for approval by the PSC and then by the Council. They also formulate recommendations to the PSC for future initia- tives in the fi eld of the CFSP. 3. Legal instruments Common Positions and Joint Actions were created for the CFSP by the Maastricht Treaty. A common position , reached by consensus, is defi ned on a matter of foreign and security policy of general interest. Member States are bound by it and are required to ensure that their national policies are in line with it. A joint action is adopted unanimously by the Council following general guidelines from the am805477EN_Int.indd 39 am805477EN_Int.indd 39 21/05/08 14:56:16 21/05/08 14:56:16 ",
        "40 capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without preju- dice to actions by NATO.\u201d The Union has concluded arrangements for the consultation and participation of third countries in crisis management. It has also defi ned with NATO the framework for relations between the two organisations, including arrangements allowing the Union to have recourse to NATO\u2019s assets and capabilities. In December 1999, the Helsinki European Council set the Helsinki Headline Goal, calling on the Member States to be able, by 2003, to deploy military forces of up to 60 000 persons within 60 days and sustain them for at least one year. New goals for 2010 were agreed in 2004, focusing on rapid response and aiming for the development of rapidly deploy- able battlegroups to be completed by 2007. Battlegroups are highly-trained, battalion- sized, formations (1 500 soldiers each), avail- able at 15 days\u2019 notice and sustainable for at least 30 days. The EU has reached its goal and, since January 2007, it has had the capacity to undertake two concurrent single battlegroup- sized rapid response operations, including the ability to launch both such operations simultaneously. 5. ESDP Structures The EU has the means to address the crises confronting it on its doorstep, as well as in other parts of the world. The European Union Military Committee (EUMC) is the highest mili- tary body within the Council. It is composed of the Chiefs of Defence Staff of the Member States or their representatives and it provides the PSC with advice and recommendations on all aspects of military crisis management. The European Union Military Staff (EUMS) , the EU\u2019s only permanent integrated military structure, is composed of military and civilian experts seconded to the Council Secretariat by the Member States. It includes a civilian- military (civ-mil) cell and an EU Operations Centre . The Council Secretariat also includes a Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) in charge of planning and running civilian missions under the ESDP. An important development was the estab- lishment, in 2004, of the European Defence Agency, headed by the High Representative and directed by a Chief Executive, currently Alexander Weis, which supports the Member States and the Council in their eff orts to improve European defence capabilities in the fi eld of crisis management. The Institute for Security Studies (EU ISS) in Paris is an auton- omous agency of the EU Council set up in 2001 to conduct policy-oriented research in support of the Union\u2019s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).

        "41 Satellite Centre (EUSC), in Torrejon, Spain, an agency of the Council since 2002, supports EU decision making by providing analysis of satellite imagery and collateral data. 6. ESDP operations Since 2003 when the fi rst missions were launched, the Union has conducted 17 mili- tary and civilian crisis-management opera- tions. It currently has eleven ESDP operations under way. They span three continents and range from military operations to security- sector reform, institution-building and police and rule-of-law missions. Some are autono- mous missions and some assist other inter- national organisations, such as the UN or the African Union. From Kabul to Kinshasa, from Chad to Sarajevo, from Ramallah to Kosovo, the EU is providing the \u2018key enablers\u2019 for peace and stability. 7. European Security Strategy In December 2003, the Union adopted the European Security Strategy (ESS), which constitutes the EU\u2019s security doctrine and gave a fresh impetus to the CFSP and the ESDP. The Strategy, entitled \u2018A Secure Europe in a Better World\u2019 states that the Union needs \u2018to develop a strategic culture that fosters early, rapid and, when necessary, robust interven- tion\u2019 Drawn up under the guidance of Javier Solana at the European Council\u2019s request, the ESS is the EU Member States\u2019 shared vision of the global challenges and key threats facing the EU, how to respond to them and its stra- tegic objectives. Terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), regional confl icts, State failure and organised crime are identifi ed as the key threats. The ESS under- lines the need to build security in our neigh- bourhood and to promote an international order based on eff ective multilateralism.

        "42 ESS is to be examined, with a view to adoption by the European Council in December 2008 of proposals for improving its implementation and for elements to complement it, in the light of all the developments since 2003. Counter-terrorism The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York, March 2004 in Madrid and July 2005 in London spurred the adoption by the Council of the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which commits the Union to combating terrorism globally while respecting human rights, and allowing its citizens to live in an area of freedom, security and justice. A Counter-Terrorism Coordinator coordinates the work of the Council of the EU in the fi eld of counter-terrorism. Non-Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) In parallel with the European Security Strategy, the European Council of December 2003 adopted a Strategy against the proli- feration of WMD which states that WMD and missile proliferation put at risk the security of EU Member States, their people and their interests around the world. The EU must act to prevent, deter, halt and, where possible, eliminate WMD proliferation programmes of concern worldwide. \u201cEurope has never been so pros- perous, so secure nor so free. The violence of the fi rst half of the 20th century has given way to a period of peace and stability unprecedented in European history. The creation of the European Union has been central to this development. We live in a world that holds brighter prospects but also greater threats than we have known. We need to think globally and to act locally.\u201d European Security Strategy am805477EN_Int.indd 42 am805477EN_Int.indd 42 21/05/08 14:56:29 21/05/08 14:56:29 ",

European Neighbourhood Policy The Union has close ties with its near neigh- bours. The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is its fl agship policy towards the EU\u2019s eastern neighbours and the Mediterranean region. It includes all the Mediterranean and Eastern European countries, and the Caucasus (excluding Russia). The ENP seeks to create privileged economic and political rela- tionships between the Union and each neigh- bouring country, building upon a mutual commitment to common values (democracy and human rights, rule of law, good govern- ance, market economy principles and sustain- able development). 8. The EU\u2019s relations with key countries and regions The Union\u2019s relationships with countries and regions in the world are guided by the European Security Strategy . Western Balkans The EU\u2019s contractual relations with the Western Balkans are based on the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) established in 1999 and designed to bring the Western Balkans region (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo) closer to the EU. At the Thessaloniki European Council in 2003, the EU reiterated its determination to fully and eff ectively support the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries, which will become an integral part of the EU once they meet the established criteria. Stabilisation and Association Agreements have been signed with Albania, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and negotiated with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.

        "44 Gulf States The EU is developing ever closer relations with the six Arab Gulf States of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Negotiations on a new Free Trade Agreement have picked up refl ecting the keen interest on both sides in deepening relations. Within the present Cooperation Agreement, the EU and the GCC States already meet in various fora, including the annual Joint Council and Ministerial meeting. The European Commission Delegation in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, covers all GCC States. Russia Russia is one of the EU\u2019s most important stra- tegic partners and the EU\u2019s largest neighbour. It is an important market for EU goods and investment and a key international partner, in particular in addressing challenges and threats to global security and stability. The contractual basis for the Union\u2019s rela- tionship with Russia is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), which reached the end of its initial ten-year term last year. It will remain in force pending a new EU-Russia agreement, which is still to be negotiated. The PCA provides for regular consultations at the level of heads of State and government (twice a year), as well as at ministerial level as frequently as possible. The EU\u2019s political dialogue with Russia is very comprehensive and more intensive than with any other third country. It not only covers international and regional issues, but also includes regular consultations on human rights. Euro-Mediterranean Partnership The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (Barcelona Process) , launched in 1995, provides the regional framework for the Union\u2019s rela- tions with the countries in North Africa and the Middle East (from Jordan to Morocco). Albania and Mauritania recently became members. The Euro Mediterranean Partnership is the only regional forum within which Israel meets the Arab countries. Middle East The Middle East Peace Process is a top foreign and security policy priority of the EU, and contributing to the eff orts to bring about a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East is a long-standing EU goal. It has a Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process and it works closely with the UN, the United States and Russia in the inter- national Quartet. The EU works with our part- ners in the region e.g. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League. The EU is active on the ground with two ESDP missions in the Palestinian Territories and it provided close to EUR 1 billion in emergency and humanitarian aid in 2007.

        "45 Ukraine Ukraine is a country of strategic impor- tance and a key partner for the EU. The Union continues to be actively involved in supporting Ukraine\u2019s democratic develop- ment and reforms. During the 2004 Orange Revolution, High Representative Javier Solana played an active role as one of the interna- tional facilitators seeking a legitimate solution to the political crisis which ensued as a result of massive electoral fraud around presiden- tial elections. Since the Orange Revolution, Ukraine has demonstrated important move- ment towards the consolidation of democ- racy and freedom of expression, setting a new standard for the region. Ukraine\u2019s role as an EU partner is also seen in the fi eld of foreign and security policy. Ukraine has aligned with nearly all EU foreign policy statements. It participates in EU-led crisis management operations and this cooperation is expected to develop further. The EU and Ukraine continue to work In 2003, the EU and Russia decided to rein- force cooperation by developing four \u201ccommon spaces\u201d under the PCA: a common economic space; a common space of freedom, security and justice; a space of cooperation in the fi eld of external security; and a space of research, education and culture. Road maps to implement these common spaces were agreed in 2005 and have proved to be a productive framework for deepening EU-Russia relations. South Caucasus The EU has a Special Representative for the South Caucasus who is helping Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan develop closer ties with the EU and pursue internal reforms and is seeking to contribute to a resolution of the frozen confl icts concerning Nagorno- Karabakh, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. He also manages the EUSR Border Support Team in Georgia that is helping with security reform.

        "46 Central Asia In 2007 the EU adopted a Strategy for a New Partnership with Central Asia, covering Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Enhanced political dialogue and practical cooperation with the Central Asian countries will cover such fi elds as economics, transport, energy, environment and education. The Strategy will promote the rule of law and respect for human rights, thus contributing to the stability of this vast region which links Europe and Asia. The EU has a Special Representative for Central Asia. Africa The EU and Africa adopted the Joint EU-Africa Strategy establishing a Strategic Partnership at the second EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December 2007. Under this partnership, relations between the EU and Africa move beyond the donor/recipient relationship and become a partnership of equals in which both sides agree to address jointly issues of mutual and global interest such as energy, climate change and migration. In December 2007, the Council and the Commission appointed an Ambassador serving as both the European Union Special Representative and the Head of the European Commission Delegation to the African Union, whose task will be to implement the common agenda with Africa under the new Partnership. The EU has ESDP security-sector reform, policing and peace-keeping operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad and the Central African Republic, and Guinea-Bissau. together in search of a solution to the frozen confl ict concerning the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. Here Ukraine\u2019s commitment to the EU Border Assistance Mission for Moldova and Ukraine, which has its headquarters in Odessa, has played a particularly important role. The EU and Ukraine are currently negotiating a new enhanced agreement to replace the PCA which came into force in 1998. This will deepen the EU Ukraine partnership further in all areas of cooperation. One of its key elements will be a deep and comprehensive free trade area, negotiations on which were launched in February 2008, following the signing of Ukraine\u2019s WTO accession protocol. Moldova The EU has a Special Representative to Moldova who is working for a settle- ment of the frozen confl ict concerning the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. He also works closely with the EU Border Assistance Mission for Moldova and Ukraine, the Head of which is his Senior Political Adviser. Belarus Belarus is an important neighbour for the EU, which would like to engage with it compre- hensively under the ENP. This has not been possible, owing to the democratic defi cit in the country. For the EU to start building a functioning relationship with Belarus, it needs to see Minsk take practical steps towards democratisation. The EU has put in place restrictive measures (visa ban and asset freezes) against members of the Belarusian administration responsible for restricting democratic rights, including the suppression of peaceful demonstrations. am805477EN_Int.indd 46 am805477EN_Int.indd 46 21/05/08 14:56:52 21/05/08 14:56:52 ",

As the European Security Asia The EU is developing increasingly close ties with Asia that go beyond traditional cooperation to embrace economic integra- tion and deeper political cooperation. It pursues dialogue with all its partner coun- tries in Asia, within the framework of the 45-member Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The next ASEM summit will be held in China in October 2008. Regular summits are also held with individual Asian countries, such as China, India, Japan and South Korea. The EU oversaw the implementation of the peace agreement in Aceh, Indonesia, with an ESDP monitoring mission from mid 2005 to the end of 2006. At the end of 2007, the Council published guidelines for a common foreign and security policy in East Asia. Helping to stabilise the situation in Afghanistan is a top priority for the EU, which has an ESDP mission there supporting police reform.

Negotiations are underway for a similar agreement with Canada. Latin America The EU\u2019s links with Latin America date back to the 1960s and were developed into a stra- tegic partnership with Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) at the Rio de Janeiro Summit in 1999. The next summit will be held in Lima in May 2008. Relations between the two blocs are governed by Community Agreements, except for the agreement with MERCOSUR, which dates back to 1999 and is a mixed agreement. EU Rio Group meet- ings and a political dialogue meeting are held every year. The EU also has association agreements with Mexico and Chile and is in the process of negotiating other agreements with MERCOSUR, the Andean Community and Central America. Strategy states, \u201cThe transatlantic relation- ship is irreplaceable. Acting together, the European Union and the United States can be a formidable force for good in the world. Our aim should be an eff ective and balanced partnership with the USA. This is an addi- tional reason for the EU to build up further its capabilities and increase its coherence.\u201d The EU works together with the US and Canada to address global and regional issues of mutual interest and concern. While agree- ment with our transatlantic partners may not be suffi cient to achieve solutions \u2013 there are other important stakeholders \u2013 it is often a necessary pre-condition. Since the end of the Cold War, transatlantic cooperation has broadened due to the changed security environment and the development of the EU\u2019s foreign, security and defence policies, as well as policies on justice and home aff airs. For example, the EU is working closely with both Canada and the US in the Balkans, the Middle East, South Caucasus, Central Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. On crisis manage- ment, Canada is participating in a number of ESDP operations. For the fi rst time, the US will participate \u2013 substantially \u2013 in the ESDP rule- of-law mission in Kosovo under EU command. The EU and US work together on counter-ter- rorism and agree that international law has to be respected in this context. Taking forward cooperation on global issues that are important to the European public, such as climate change, is a priority for the EU. The transatlantic economic partnership is of great signifi cance. The latest step in a deep- ening EU-US relationship is the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), agreed in 2007 to accelerate economic integration as well as provide a forum for strategic economic issues.

        "49 At political level, the EEA Council, which is composed of the Members of the Council of the European Union, the European Commission and of the Governments of the three EEA-EFTA States meets twice a year at Ministerial level in order to assess the overall functioning and the development of the EEA Agreement. Swiss Confederation The Swiss Confederation is one of the major trading partners of the European Union. The economic relations between Switzerland and the European Community were institutional- ised through a bilateral Free Trade Agreement in 1973. Ever since, Switzerland participates in European integration through bilateral Agreements in specifi c sectors. Seven such Agreements (the so called \u201cBilaterals I\u201d) entered into force in 2002. They cover the following areas: free movement of persons, air transport, land transport by road and rail, trade in agricultural products, mutual recognition of conformity assessment, government procurement, and cooperation in scientifi c and technological programmes. Following the successful precedent of the Bilaterals I, a new set of Agreements (Bilaterals II) were signed on 26 October 2004, including Swiss association in the Schengen/Dublin/ Eurodac acquis, the fi ght against fraud and all other illegal activity adversely aff ecting Swiss and EU fi nancial interests, the taxa- tion of savings income in the form of interest payments, trade in processed agricultural products, cooperation in the fi eld of statistics, 9. External economic relations European Economic Area (EEA) The European Economic Area unites the 27 Member States of the European Union and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, Members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) within the Internal Market established under the European Community. Since 1994, the EEA Agreement has opened the door to an unprecedented economic integration of almost 500 million people, has guaranteed the proper functioning of the free movement of goods, services, capital and persons (the four Community freedoms), and has ensured equal conditions for competition, public procurement and rules on State aid between its 30 Member States. Furthermore, the European Economic Area provides for co-operation and executes its task of legislative harmonisation in the so-called \u201cFlanking and Horizontal Policies\u201d, such as research and development, educa- tion, information technology, social policy, consumer protection, the environment, statistics and company law. In addition, the EEA Agreement also aims to improve effi ciency and adds value by opening up for full and equal participation of its Member States in a large and growing number of EU programmes and agencies. In return, the three EEA-EFTA Sates contribute around EUR 300 million annually towards the reduction of the social and economic dispari- ties in the European Union, which confi rms that the European Economic Area Agreement is also an instrument of solidarity, prosperity and stability. am805477EN_Int.indd 49 am805477EN_Int.indd 49 21/05/08 14:57:07 21/05/08 14:57:07 ",
        "50 The European Union is the most important trading power in the world. The total of EU trade (imports and exports combined) with the rest of the world (excluding internal trade between EU members) amounted to EUR 2.238 billion in 2005. The EU accounts for 18 % of world trade for goods and 26 % of world trade in services. This compares with 16 % and 19 % respectively, for the USA. The EU\u2019s share of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) inflows for the period 2002-2004 was 27 % of the world total; FDI outflows amounted to 32 %. The European Union believes in the promo- tion of trade on the basis of fair rules that are negotiated by all countries concerned - i.e. \u201cmultilaterally\u201d. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is the key to this approach and the successful completion of the WTO Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations is currently the main priority of EU trade policy. However, the EU also believes that trade policy must interact coherently with development policy to manage the various eff ects of globalisation and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The EU considers that trade policy in the 21st century is not just about tariff reductions in trade in goods. Other crucial questions also need to be tackled. These include: Trade facilitation (i.e. measures to simplify import, export and customs procedures); Swiss participation in the Media Community Programmes, in the European Environment Agency and in the European Environment Information and Observation Network. In return, Switzerland contributes one billion Swiss francs to the 2004 enlargement to new Member States of the European Union. Trading power Article 133 of the EC Treaty sets the legal framework of the common commercial policy, establishing the principle of Community competence. According to this provision, the Commission negotiates bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, acting on the basis of a mandate given by the Council and in continuous consultation with Council bodies (the Article 133 Committee and other geographical working parties). The Council must approve all agreements and authorise their signature and entry into force (by quali- fi ed majority or unanimity, depending on the scope and content of the agreement).

The EU also believes that the environmental and social aspects of trade and globalisation must be dealt with in the appropriate place. Trade with the developing world The EU is the largest trading partner for the world\u2019s poorest countries as it has preferen- tial trade agreements that eliminate duties and quotas in almost all cases. Market opening: The EU has thus opened its market for poor countries. In 2003 around 80 % of developing countries\u2019 products entered the EU duty-free or at reduced rates of duty. The EU has the most open trade regime for Sub-Saharan Africa and the other African, Caribbean and Pacifi c (ACP) coun- tries. In 2003 ACP countries paid full duty on only three per cent of their exports to the EU. The remaining 97 % entered the European market at zero duty or reduced rates of duty. These preferential trade relations have a huge impact on the EU\u2019s share of the developing world\u2019s exports to the world. Inclusion of services in WTO rules so that interested countries can voluntarily liberalise trade in services among themselves; Competition (i.e. measures to ensure non- discrimination, transparency, procedural rights and judicial review on questions of competition); Investment (i.e. measures to improve the business climate by increasing legal security for investors and reducing the perceived risk); Government procurement (contracts and purchases by governments represents a large part of the market (especially in certain sectors) but they are currently excluded from most WTO rules); Protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) (since the EU is an important source of inven- tion and design, it seeks to have international protection for rights granted to creators and inventors; these include copyright and similar rights for literary and artistic works, and also More and more a major way of doing business: electronic commerce \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m u n i t i e s am805477EN_Int.indd 51 am805477EN_Int.indd 51 21/05/08 14:57:17 21/05/08 14:57:17 ",
        "52 (EU25 data 2005) The Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) The relations between the EU and 78 African, Caribbean and Pacifi c (ACP) States are defi ned in the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, signed in 2000 as a successor to the Lom\u00e9 Conventions, fi rst signed in 1975. Under these treaties, ACP countries have enjoyed preferential trade relations with the EU. However, these trade preferences were not compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), because they were not reciprocal and they discriminated against other developing countries. Moreover, these preferences did not help the ACP countries to achieve sustainable growth, diversify their economies, and increase their share of EU imports which, on the contrary, has increas- ingly shrunk as a consequence of progressive trade liberalisation taking place at multilateral level. Therefore, when signing the Cotonou Developing countries: The EU gets 48 % of its total imports from developing countries and 65 % of its total agricultural imports come from the developing world. 18.1 % of the developing countries\u2019 exports to the world go to the EU and 17.5 % of their imports come from the EU. LDCs and ACP: The EU accounted for 22.2 % of the LDCs\u2019 (Least Developed Countries) entire trade with the world and for 28.6 % of ACPs\u2019 entire trade with the world in 2005, thus making the EU the biggest trading partner for both groups. The EU represents 23.4 % of LDCs\u2019 total exports to the world and 21.2 % of its total imports. 26.7 % of the ACPs\u2019 (including South Africa) exports go to the EU, and 30.4 % of its imports come from the EU. Of its overall trade with the world, the EU gets about 1.5 % of its total imports from LDCs and 4.5 % from ACP (including South Africa). All in all the share of the EU in the LDCs\u2019 overall exports to the world (excluding energy) was 62 % (2004).

        "53 More and better aid European aid comes from the EU budget and from the budgets of its 27 Members States. In 2006, it amounted to approximately EUR 48 billion. This is getting close to EUR 1 billion every week. In 2005, on the occasion of the United Nations review of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Council decided to increase EU aid in line with the recommendations of the United Nations. It pledged to increase the aid budget in order to achieve the target of 0.7 % of gross national income by 2015, with an intermediate collective target of 0.56 % by 2010. This means an additional EUR 20 billion per year from 2010. In 2006, the EU was ahead of its target for that year \u2013 the target was 0.39 % and the level reached was 0.43 %. In 2005, the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament agreed on a an overall policy approach to development - the European Consensus. This contains the main guiding principles for the action of the European Union and for its Member States. It highlights how diff erent policy aspects must fi t together. It also emphasises that policies should be worked out and applied in partnership with devel- oping countries. Aid effectiveness The EU is committed to improving the eff ec- tiveness of aid, with initiatives at both inter- national and European level. Internationally, the EU is active in the Monterrey process started by the UN Conference in 2002 and in the process prompted by the OECD-DAC with the Paris Declaration on Aid eff ectiveness in 2005. Internally, the EU adopted in 2005 the European Consensus on Development Policy, with the aim to improve the overall impact of Agreement, the EU and ACP agreed to nego- tiate new arrangements, the EPAs, intended to progressively create free-trade ACP-EU areas through the gradual removal of barriers to trade and support the gradual integration of the ACP economies into the international trading system. EPAs are conceived as instruments that promote regional integration and economic development in the ACP countries; they are based on the asymmetrical opening of markets and the provision of substantial fi nancial resources to support economic policy reforms in the ACP States. They should cover trade in goods, services and trade related areas. In 2002, negotiations were launched with six regional groupings of ACP countries: the Caribbean, the Pacifi c and four African regions. By the end of 2007, a comprehensive EPA had been agreed with the Caribbean. In the other regions interim arrangements, often limited to trade in goods, were agreed with all ACP countries having a major economic interest. Negotiations will have to be pursued in order to conclude comprehensive EPAs in all regions in the shortest possible period.

Enlargement The accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007 completed the fi fth enlarge- ment of the European Union. It was an unprecedented (twelve new countries have joined) and successful process, that contributed greatly to peace, stability and prosperity throughout Europe by over- coming the divisions that the continent had experienced in the 20th Century. From an economic point of view, the fi fth enlarge- ment has created the conditions for the European economy to become stronger and more dynamic, and thus better equipped to face global competition. Currently, the Union is conducting accession negotiations with two candidate countries, Croatia and Turkey. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has also been given the status of candidate country, but a deci- sion on the opening of accession negotia- tions has not been taken yet. Furthermore, the European Council has repeatedly stated that the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union, and therefore the other countries of this region can be seen as \u201cpotential\u201d candidates. The accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey started in October 2005. They are conducted in an Intergovernmental Conference (which meets either at Ministerial or at Deputy level), with the participation of all the EU Member States, on the one hand, and of the candidate State, on the other. aid on development targets, reduce poverty and minimise those \u201ctransaction costs\u201d that have no impact on development. The Council believes that complementarity of donor actions, together with a better division of labour among donors, are essential: they will strengthen the ownership of the actions by partner countries, as well as their capacity to take over responsibility for coordinating donors\u2019 activities. The Council agrees that the EU should be a driving force for these eff orts on a global basis and that its approach should be open to all donors.

        "57 In addition to the binding commitments of the stability and growth pact, EMU member- ship also implies non-binding coordina- tion of national fi scal policies through the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which are addressed to each Member State and also to the euro area. 3. The euro The euro (\u20ac) has been the currency of EMU since 1999 and took the concrete form of notes and coins in 2001. Except for Denmark and the United Kingdom, all Member States must adopt the euro as their national currency, subject to fulfi lling a number of convergence criteria. So far fi fteen Member States have fulfi lled the criteria and adopted the euro (eleven from the start, Greece from 2001, Slovenia from 2007, Cyprus and Malta from 2008). Most other Member States participate in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) which restricts the exchange rate variations of their currencies against the euro. The euro is also the national currency of the Vatican State, San Marino and Monaco (three countries that before the euro had monetary agreements with Italy and France on the use of the Italian lira and the French franc respectively as their legal tender). Moreover, the euro is the de facto currency in Andorra, Montenegro and Kosovo. The euro also 1. Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is the framework for drawing up and imple- menting EU economic and monetary policy. All Member States are part of EMU, although two Member States, Denmark and the United Kingdom, have been granted derogations from the obligation to enter its \u201cthird stage\u201d. The most important implication of this dero- gation is that, unlike other Member States, Denmark and the United Kingdom do not have to adopt the euro as their currency. 2. The Stability and Growth Pact No member of the EMU can conduct its economic policy in isolation; policies conducted by one Member State will have repercussions on the Union as a whole, and therefore also on other Member States. Measures that may appear optimal from the point of view of the individual Member State could be to the detriment of other EMU members. EMU membership therefore implies a series of commitments by Member States to pursue responsible fi scal policies in the interest of collective stability and growth. These commitments are on the one hand preventive, aiming at avoiding exces- sive budget defi cits and government debts in Member States, and on the other hand corrective, setting out the measures Member States have to take if their budget defi - cits or government debts exceed a certain percentage of their GDP, and enabling the Council to impose sanctions against Member States failing to take such corrective measures. Possible sanctions against Member States in the euro area are more wide-ranging than those against Member States outside the euro area.

        "58 5. Financial markets In addition to being responsible for EMU matters, fi nance ministers also deal with certain internal market policy areas, including fi nancial services. The aim is to improve the functioning of the internal market in fi nan- cial services by means of harmonised rules, removal of national barriers, mutual recogni- tion and supervisory arrangements enabling providers of fi nancial services to off er their products across the EU, while investors are no longer restricted to their national market. 6. Taxation In the tax area, decision-making is particularly diffi cult because unanimity is required for adopting laws and other texts. Nevertheless ministers have, over time, agreed deep harmonisation of value added tax and excise duties in order to remove obstacles to the internal market. Also, in the income tax area specifi c measures have been adopted by the Council to eliminate double taxation on cross-border payments of dividends, interest and royalties, and to facilitate cross-border cooperation between companies (Merger Directive, Transfer Pricing Convention). In addition, Member States have agreed to improve administrative cooperation and the exchange of information between them, including in the area of savings tax. In addition to law making, the Council has set up a non-binding policy coordination has a strong position in the world economy and is widely used in world trade, exchange, contracts, settlement and as reserve currency in central banks around the world. 4. The euro area and the role of the Eurogroup The euro area is part of the EMU and comprises all Member States using the euro as their currency (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland and, from 1 January 2008, Cyprus and Malta). Informal policy coordination within the euro area takes place in the Eurogroup, which usually meets in connection with meetings of the Council and in the margins of informal meetings of fi nance ministers and central bank governors. Eurogroup meetings are attended by fi nance ministers from euro area countries, the Commission and the European Central Bank. The President of the Eurogroup is elected for two years (renewable once for two more years) from among the fi nance ministers from the euro area.

        "59 stagnation and mismatched skills, and the need to increase both social inclusion and environmental sustainability. In the context of the broader Lisbon process, the Employment Guidelines have, since 2005, been incorporated, with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, into a single set of Integrated Guidelines which, in principle, should only be substantially reviewed every three years in order to maintain stability as far as possible and to allow the Member States to concentrate on implementation. The next substantial revision is expected in Spring 2008, to cover the period 2008-2010. A specifi c diffi culty in the context of the Lisbon Strategy arose from the fact that most of the matters under consideration were the subject of national, rather than Community competence. Indeed, this even applies to the Employment Strategy: Article 128 of the Treaty provides for Employment Guidelines, which the Member States should take into account in drawing up their national employ- ment policies, but there is no Common Employment Policy as such. Against this background, therefore, the awareness of shared problems and the search for common solutions gave rise to a new approach, namely the Open Method of Coordination, which has proved to be a key tool in promoting shared objectives in the employment and social policy fi elds. exercise with a view to eliminating harmful tax competition in the European Union, and it increasingly integrates generally accepted principles of good governance in the tax area into its external policy instruments (dialogue, agreements). 7. The Lisbon strategy for growth and employment The European Employment Strategy repre- sented an important fi rst step in responding to persistently high levels of unemploy- ment resulting from structural changes in the European economy. It was soon realised, however, that the issue needed to be tackled on a broader front and, in 2000, the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Employment was launched with the aim of making Europe by 2010 \u201cthe most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, and respect for the environment\u201d. The strategy embraced not only employment policy, but also the transition to the knowledge society, the need to increase competitiveness both through completion of the internal market and by addressing problems such as low productivity, \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m u n i t i e s The Lisbon Strategy: towards a knowledge-based society am805477EN_Int.indd 59 am805477EN_Int.indd 59 21/05/08 14:57:58 21/05/08 14:57:58 ",
        "60 In the fi eld of health and safety at work, the key legislative act is the so-called \u201cFramework Directive\u201d (Directive 89/391/EEC), which lays down minimum provisions with regard to employers\u2019 obligations with respect to health and safety. Given, however, the vastly diff ering conditions in diff erent industries and occupations, it was always envisaged that the Framework Directive would be completed by more specifi c provisions and, to date, nine- teen individual directives have been adopted covering such fi elds as workplace conditions, protective equipment, building sites, biolog- ical and chemical agents, vibration, noise and explosive atmospheres. The most recent of these is the Directive on Artifi cial Optical Radiation, adopted in April 2006. 10. Social Protection \u2022 Coordination of Social Security Systems In the context of the \u201cfour freedoms\u201d, the coordination of social security schemes is essential to the free movement of labour. In fact, freedom of movement cannot be eff ec- tive if it involves sacrifi cing acquired rights in the areas of health insurance, social secu- rity and pensions. The fundamental aim of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is to bring about a suffi cient degree of coordination of the diff erent social security schemes to safe- guard these rights. Following many amend- ments through the years to refl ect changes in the diff erent national systems, the time had come for a complete overhaul of the Regulation which led, in 2004, to the adop- tion of the new Regulation (EC) No 883/04. This new Regulation cannot, however, enter into force without the adoption of a parallel implementing regulation setting out many of the more detailed operating rules, and it is on this that work is currently being concentrated. 8. The Open Method of Coordination (OMC) In its most comprehensive form, as seen in the context of the Employment Strategy, the Open Method of Coordination consists of a number of successive steps, followed on a cyclical basis and embracing the following elements: the adoption at EU level of policy Guidelines, the submission by the Member States of implementation reports, a peer review of the implementation reports followed by publication by the Commission of an analytical report, on the basis of which recommendations may be made to indi- vidual Member States and, if appropriate, the Guidelines may be revised as the basis of the next cycle. Appropriate indicators and bench- marks are essential to ensuring real compara- bility between the diff erent Member States\u2019 performances, the analysis of which should permit exchanges of information, expertise and best practice and the promotion of inno- vative approaches which can be refl ected in revised guidelines. The OMC has provided a framework for mutual learning and has promoted openness, transparency and the involvement of stakeholders, European and national, with a view to better policy-making. 9. Working conditions The fi eld of working conditions is a broad one including working time, health and safety at work and worker representation. Although this last fi eld is at present relatively inactive, important legislative acts adopted in the past include the European Works Council Directive, the Information and Consultation of Workers Directive, and acts providing for worker representation in the context of European Companies and European Cooperatives. At the present time, important proposals remain on the table in the fi elds of working time and temporary agency work. am805477EN_Int.indd 60 am805477EN_Int.indd 60 21/05/08 14:58:03 21/05/08 14:58:03 ",
        "61 \u2022 Modernising and Improving Social Protection Under this heading a number of diff erent activities are going on, also within the context of the open method of coordination, with a view to the creation of \u201cgreater social cohe- sion\u201d within the Union and its Member States. Following the Council\u2019s call for EU-level work to \u201cmake a decisive impact on the eradica- tion of poverty\u201d and to ensure the future adequacy and sustainability of pension systems, the Social Inclusion Process and the OMC on Adequate and Sustainable Pensions were established. The European Council later sought to extend the work to the future of health care and long-term care. These activi- ties are largely coordinated by the Social Protection Committee. In the Social Policy fi eld, in particular, the OMC is \u201clighter\u201d insofar as common objec- tives have been defi ned which are, however, less specifi c than the Guidelines adopted in the employment context. The reporting stages are essentially similar but there is no Treaty basis for addressing recommendations to the Member States along the lines of the employment recommendations. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n C o m m u n i t i e s Care of the elderly: a growing sector of social welfare am805477EN_Int.indd 61 am805477EN_Int.indd 61 21/05/08 14:58:07 21/05/08 14:58:07 ",

For the fi rst time, the European Council (at the level of Heads of State and Government) met to defi ne a programme for creatingthe area of freedom, security and justice. The objectives agreed included the establishment of a European Judicial Cooperation Unit (Eurojust), imple- mentation of the principle of reciprocal recognition of judgments accompanied by legislative harmonisation when necessary, replacement of the often very lengthy extra- dition procedure by a system of surrender between Member States and, fi nally, the strengthening of Europol\u2019s powers. The Tampere Summit also set the objectives for an integrated asylum, immigration and visa policy that is part and parcel of an area without internal borders. The Treaty of Nice strengthened the European Parliament\u2019s co decision role in the areas of asylum, immigra- tion and visas. The Member States\u2019 commitment to JHA cooperation was also strengthened for tragic reasons by the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 and other terrorist attacks in subsequent years, in particular in Madrid and London and more generally by a feeling (shown by Eurobarometer surveys) that the people of the Member States expect the most from Europe in the area of security (and in that of unemployment). Coordination and cooperation in the area of JHA external rela- tions with partners such as the United States, JHA: a recent field of activity European cooperation in the fi eld known as JHA (Justice and Home Aff airs) started in the \u201890s thanks to the Maastricht Treaty. The pillared structure of the Treaty made it possible to reconcile objectives as diff erent as police or judicial cooperation on one hand with objectives concerning the free move- ment of persons such as visa policy, asylum or the crossing of borders on the other. However, the instruments made available by the Maastricht Treaty did not enable JHA policy to be developed suffi ciently rapidly: neither international conventions (subject to lengthy ratifi cation procedures in each Member State) nor common positions made it possible to respond to the many challenges with regard to security and freedom of move- ment voiced by public opinion in the Member States. The notable example dating from this period concerns cooperation between Member States\u2019 police forces in the form of the Europol agency established in 1995. It was in fact from 1999 onwards that the foundations were laid for the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. Several factors contributed to it. The fi rst to be mentioned is the Treaty of Amsterdam. It incorporated the complete Schengen acquis, by means of which 13 EU Member States (as well as Norway and Iceland) had already laid down arrangements for an area without internal border controls. The Schengen dimension has continued to expand after its incorporation into the European Union and now covers almost all the territory of the European Union. The Treaty of Amsterdam enabled a common objective to be defi ned, that of establishing \u201can area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured\u201d (Article 2 of the Treaty on European am805477EN_Int.indd 63 am805477EN_Int.indd 63 21/05/08 14:58:12 21/05/08 14:58:12 ",
        "64 linked to the Schengen Information System, etc. The second coordination committee is called the SCIFA (Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum) which, as its name suggests, deals with matters concerning migration (both legal and illegal), visa policy and the programme for harmo- nising asylum policy. The third is called the Committee on Civil Law Matters. Its role is twofold: on the one hand, it prepares instru- ments to be adopted by the Council in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters and on the other it ensures the consistency of Community law in acts to be adopted by the Council in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters. Certain JHA proceedings fall directly under Coreper\u2019s authority, such as the Working Party on Schengen Evaluation or the Committee on Civil Law Matters. Working parties on other JHA linked activities such as the High-Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration report to the External Relations Council. In the context of the third pillar, the Council may adopt decisions or framework deci- sions on the initiative of the Commission or Member States, generally in consultation with the European Parliament. Essentially, the Council must adopt decisions unanimously. It should be noted that implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon would simplify the legal basis for the Council\u2019s action in the JHA area as the procedures for the fi rst pillar should be extended to cover most questions. Cooperation in combating terrorism has taken concrete form in a number of JHA activities. Examples are the exchange of information and adoption of measures concerning the fi nancing of terrorism, radi- calisation and recruitment. The fi ght against organised crime is carried out through police cooperation and combating money laun- dering and various forms of traffi cking. From Russia, the Western Balkans and the Union\u2019s neighbouring countries developed consider- ably during this period. Protecting fundamental rights and creating a European area of freedom, security and justice are two closely linked tasks which are at the same time two of the key goals of European integration for the years to come. There are several tools in the European Union for enshrining these rights. Two of the most important are the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights established in 2007. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights was signed and proclaimed in Nice on 7 December 2000. An adapted version of the Charter was signed and proclaimed in Strasbourg on 12 December 2007. A complex institutional framework The Council, meeting in its JHA formation, brings together Ministers with responsi- bility for home aff airs, justice and immigra- tion in their Member States. Responsibilities are allocated in very diff erent ways in the Member States, straddling one, two and sometimes three ministries. The Commission is represented at the JHA Council by the Vice- President responsible for Justice, Freedom and Security. Preparations for the Council\u2019s proceedings are made by three high-level coordination committees under the general responsi- bility of the Permanent Representatives Committee (Coreper). The fi rst is called the Article 36 Committee (with reference to that article in the EU Treaty). Proceedings take place under its aegis on matters such as police cooperation, judicial cooperation in criminal matters, combating drug traffi cking, customs cooperation, part of the proceed- ings on combating terrorism, proceedings am805477EN_Int.indd 64 am805477EN_Int.indd 64 21/05/08 14:58:15 21/05/08 14:58:15 ",
        "65 known as the Schengen Mixed Committee. The Mixed Committee was set up to enable other Schengen area States, i.e. Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, to be associated with the development of the Schengen acquis. The Mixed Committee dimension applies at ministerial, ambassadorial (Coreper) and working party level. The Schengen acquis applies to the United Kingdom and Ireland only to the extent desired by those States. In December 2007, the Schengen acquis was applied in its entirety in nine of the Member States that came into being after the 2004 enlarge- ment, with the exception of Cyprus. Finally, it should be noted that part of the EU acquis in the JHA area is implemented by agencies that are separate from the insti- tutions, such as Europol and Eurojust (The Hague), FRONTEX (European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union \u2013 Warsaw) or CEPOL (European Police College \u2013 Bramshill, United Kingdom). an institutional viewpoint, it should be noted that the Council Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP has appointed a coordinator in charge of combating terrorism. Increasing activities in European coopera- tion in the area of civil protection should also be noted in this context. In 2007, following the abovementioned terrorist acts and an increasing number of natural disasters (for example the fl oods in Europe, the tsunami in South-East Asia in 2004, hurricane Katrina in the United States, the earthquake in Pakistan in 2006 and the forest fi res in Greece in August 2007), the European Union revised the necessary legal instruments in order to be able to give the best possible assistance to victims of such events both within and outside the EU, always on the basis of means made available by the Member States. This assistance refl ects the European Union\u2019s practical solidarity with the Member States and third countries. Although it falls under the fi rst pillar (and in this context the Council always acts on a Commission proposal, in consultation with the European Parliament and acting unanimously), it is the Justice and Home Aff airs Council that generally takes decisions on this subject. All JHA proceedings are currently taking place under the Hague work programme, adopted in 2004. In addition to achieving the abovementioned objectives based on essen- tial concepts of harmonisation, operational cooperation and mutual recognition, it will be noted that an innovative concept is being introduced, that of the availability of infor- mation to all those who use it in the Member States. Information must, however, be used in strictest compliance with data protection- standards and practices. It should be emphasised that a substantial proportion of JHA proceedings (approxi- mately a third) takes place in a Council format am805477EN_Int.indd 65 am805477EN_Int.indd 65 21/05/08 14:58:19 21/05/08 14:58:19 ",

        "67 Council, at its meeting in June 2007, decided to convene a further IGC and agreed on a comprehensive and detailed mandate for its work. The IGC opened in July 2007 and reached fi nal agreement on a text in October the same year. The new treaty was signed in Lisbon on 13 December 2007 and, subject to the necessary ratifi cation procedures having been completed in time, should enter into force on 1 January 2009. Although the Treaty of Lisbon retains many of the substantive elements from the Constitution, it is signifi cantly diff erent in appearance since it returns to the traditional method of introducing modifi cations by means of an amending treaty. Furthermore the term \u201cConstitution\u201d has been dropped. The new treaty amends both the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community. It provides for a single legal personality for the Union (the Community ceases to exist), and as a result the EC treaty is renamed \u201cTreaty on the Functioning of the Union\u201d. The treaties on which the Union is founded constitute the rules according to which it functions. They can be modifi ed only by unanimous agreement of all Member States meeting within an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC). An IGC functions separately from the Council and the other institutions of the Union. The outcome of an IGC can only come into force once it has been ratifi ed by all the Member States. In 2004 an IGC reached agreement on a treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe which was intended to replace the existing treaties. The text of the Constitution had been drawn up over a period of fi fteen months by a Convention bringing together not only Member State representatives, but also members of national parliaments and representatives of the Union\u2019s institutions and other bodies. However the Constitution never came into force since it was rejected in referendums in two Member States in 2005. Two years later agreement was reached on a way out of the impasse caused by the rejection of the Constitution. The European Ms Angela Merkel, the Federal Chancellor, and Mr Frank Walter Steinmeier, Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister, sign the Lisbon Treaty The Lisbon Treaty am805477EN_Int.indd 67 am805477EN_Int.indd 67 21/05/08 14:58:24 21/05/08 14:58:24 ",
