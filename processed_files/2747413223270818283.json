What exactly the EU does for you and where the money comes from to pay for it all? Read on to find out everything you need to know about the EU. ",
        "A S H O R T G U I D E T O T H E E U 4 What is the European Union? The European Union (EU) is a unique economic and political union between 27 European countries. They work together to improve the lives of people in Europe, and even further afield. The EU has worked for the peace, prosperity and well-being of its citizens for over 60 years. From six founding countries \u2013 or Member States \u2013 in the 1950s, it has grown into a Union of 27 countries with a population of almost 450 million people. What started as an economic project to help raise living standards in post-war Europe has led to the creation of the world\u2019s largest single-market area, where people, goods, services and money can move freely. Over the decades, the EU has widened its scope to areas where cooperation between countries brings better results. The countries that belong to the EU believe that by working together they are stronger and better able to tackle today\u2019s big challenges, such as COVID-19, climate change and the digital transformation of our society. This guide contains lots of useful information about the EU and what it does, and tips on where to get more information. ",

        "A S H O R T G U I D E T O T H E E U 6 A Union of values While Europeans may speak different languages and have different traditions, they share the same set of values, on which the EU was founded. These are respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These values are set out in the EU treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which brings together in one place all the personal, civic, political, economic and social rights enjoyed by people within the EU. \u00a9 i S t o c k . c o m / p i x e l f i t If you are a citizen of one of the 27 countries that make up the EU, you are also a citizen of the EU. This gives you some important extra rights, such as the freedom to move, live, work and study in any EU country and the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in local and European elections, even when living in another EU country. You also have the right to make a petition to the European Parliament, to apply to the European Ombudsman and to write to any EU institution in one of the 24 official languages of the EU. As well as protecting the rights of its citizens and people living in the European Union, the EU also promotes human rights and fair elections worldwide. Every year, the European Parliament awards the Sakharov Prize to an individual or organisation that fights for human rights and fundamental freedoms. In 2020, 13.5 million people in the EU were citizens of a different EU country from the one they lived in. ",
        "7 A S H O R T G U I D E T O T H E E U Living in the EU brings some important rights and benefits, such as these: \u2022 I am protected from discrimination on any ground, including sex, race, religion, ethnic or social origin, disability, age or sexual orientation; \u2022 I have the right to have my personal data protected; \u2022 I can shop online and buy from any EU country with confidence, thanks to strong EU consumer protection; \u2022 My health is protected by tough EU environmental standards, such as rules on the quality of air and water.

Here you can find information on some of the big issues that the EU is working on to improve people\u2019s lives. To see how the priority issues on the EU\u2019s agenda are put into action, please refer to the section \u2018Who does what?\u2019 (page 27). You can find more information about all of the EU\u2019s activities on the EU\u2019s website: europa.eu. COVID-19 The coronavirus pandemic has led to human tragedy, lockdowns and economic slowdown, testing the EU and the rest of the world like never before. The EU\u2019s priority since the beginning of the crisis has been to save lives and protect jobs. As well as taking action to contain the spread of the virus, it has been working to support national health systems and help get Europe back on its feet. By summer 2021, four COVID-19 vaccines were authorised for use in the EU. A delivery of medical equipment from the rescEU reserve in Prague, Czechia, 24 October 2020. ",
        "11 A S H O R T G U I D E T O T H E E U While EU countries are responsible for their own health policies and immunising their own citizens, the EU provides support and helps with coordination, for example by securing vaccine supplies so no country is left empty-handed. Vaccination programmes started across the EU in December 2020. A common system of EU digital certificates is helping to make it easier for people in the EU to start travelling again. The EU is committed to ensuring that safe vaccines reach all corners of the world, and has exported hundreds of millions of doses to other countries. It is also is one of the leading contributors to COVAX, the global initiative for fair access to COVID-19 vaccines. To make sure it is prepared for future epidemics, the EU is working with its international partners, including through initiatives such as the G20 Global Health Summit in May 2021. The EU and its Member States have shown true solidarity during the pandemic. For example, hospitals across Europe have treated patients from other countries, and the EU has coordinated the delivery of protective equipment to where it is needed most. The rescEU medical reserve (the common European stockpile of emergency medical equipment) has helped Member States facing shortages of equipment.

From 2021 to 2027, funding of \u20ac2 018 billion (in current prices) will support people, companies and regions across the EU. This total includes a special recovery fund of \u20ac807 billion, known as NextGenerationEU. The EU aims to ensure Europe\u2019s healthy recovery from COVID-19 by investing in projects and initiatives to make it greener, more digital and better able to deal with future challenges.

        "13 A S H O R T G U I D E T O T H E E U Climate change Climate change and damage to the environment threaten Europe and the world. The European Green Deal is the EU\u2019s strategy to create a modern and competitive European economy. It aims to make Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050, at which point we will produce no more greenhouse gases than our ecosystems can naturally absorb. As a first milestone on this ambitious path, the EU has set a new target of cutting its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. All sections of society and the economy will have to play their part \u2013 from industry, energy and transport to food production, agriculture and construction. There will be financial support for those regions, industries and workers that face the greatest challenges. In July 2021 the European Commission proposed a package of measures to make sure that the EU achieves its objectives under the European Green Deal. What\u2019s in it for you? The benefits of the target to cut net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. ",

        "15 A S H O R T G U I D E T O T H E E U Getting the most out of the digital transformation The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us how important digital technology is for keeping people and businesses connected in times of crisis. We all need to be digitally savvy in today\u2019s society, whether it\u2019s for online banking and shopping at home or using technology in our jobs. To get everyone up to speed, and ensure Europe\u2019s position as a world leader in technology, the EU is investing in everything from digital skills and supercomputing to high-speed connectivity and better cybersecurity.

The EU is working to ensure that the online world is safe and fair for people and businesses alike. Thanks to EU rules, today we have more control over our personal data and how it is used by others. The EU in the world The EU works closely with its neighbours and with countries around the world. It is building new partnerships, in particular with Africa, and working with other countries and international organisations, such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization, to tackle common challenges like climate change and COVID-19. The EU also makes trade deals with other countries, most recently with Canada, Japan and Mexico. These deals expand the trade that supports the EU economy and creates jobs. Together, the EU and its member countries are the biggest donor of international aid in the world. In 2020 they provided \u20ac66.8 billion to help fight COVID-19, overcome poverty and advance global development. ",
        "A S H O R T G U I D E T O T H E E U 16 Helping people find work The European Social Fund helps people to get a job (or a better job), including those who face disadvantages. Each year the fund helps some 10 million people find a job or improve their skills. The EU is helping young people to enter the job market. For example, the Youth Guarantee scheme aims to ensure that anyone under 30 receives an offer of good- quality employment, education, apprenticeship or training within 4 months of becoming unemployed or leaving education. The \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019 programme also helps young people to find work in another EU country. Volunteering is a great way of contributing to local communities at home or abroad, while developing new skills and making friends. The European Solidarity Corps gives young people the chance to volunteer or work in projects in their own country or abroad. EU Aid Volunteers offers over-18s the opportunity to participate in humanitarian projects worldwide. Stepping up the fight against cancer The EU is determined to turn the tide against cancer.

This means that women and men should get equal pay for equal work, people with disabilities are able to participate equally in all areas of life, and racism is not tolerated. It means that people should not be excluded or marginalised, and people should be free to love who they want. Migrants and EU citizens with a migrant background play a key role in European society, including as essential workers. The EU is working to ensure everyone can participate fully in society by focusing on things such as better access to education, jobs, healthcare and housing. Protecting people The safety and security of people in Europe, in both the physical and the digital worlds, is a top priority for the EU. It works daily to tackle threats such as terrorism, organised crime, the drugs trade and human trafficking. Lies about COVID-19, dangerous hoaxes, conspiracy theories and consumer fraud all pose a threat, including to public health.

These have been agreed voluntarily and democratically by all EU countries. The EU takes action in those areas where its Member States have authorised it to do so and where it makes sense to act together, such as on climate change or trading across the world. The EU treaties specify who can pass laws in what areas: the EU, national governments or both. EU countries are responsible for making their own decisions and laws in certain areas of national policy, such as industry, health and education, and the EU provides support. In areas where either the EU or national governments can act, the EU may only do so if it can act more effectively. To help achieve their goals, the EU countries have created a number of institutions to take decisions at the EU level and to then carry them out.

The Council of the European Union, also known as the Council, is made up of the government ministers of all the EU countries. Together with the European Parliament, it is the main decision-making body of the EU. Every 6 months a different EU country holds the presidency of the Council. To ensure continuity, the presidencies work together closely in groups of three on a common agenda over an 18-month period.
