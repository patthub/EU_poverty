        "COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2019/2242 of 16 December 2019 specifying the technical items of data sets, establishing the technical formats and specifying the detailed arrangements and content of the quality reports on the organisation of a sample survey in the income and living conditions domain pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/1700 of the European Parliament and of the Council (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2019/1700 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 October 2019 establishing a common framework for European statistics relating to persons and households, based on data at individual level collected from samples, amending Regulations (EC) No 808/2004, (EC) No 452/2008 and (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 ( 1 ), and in particular Article 7(1), Article 8(3) and Article 13(6) thereof, Whereas: (1) In order to ensure the accurate implementation of the sample survey as regards the income and living conditions domain, EU-SILC, the Commission should specify the technical items of the data set, the technical formats for transmission of information and the detailed arrangements and content of the quality reports. (2) The EU-SILC survey is a key instrument for providing information required by the European Semester and the European Pillar of Social Rights, in particular for income distribution, poverty and social exclusion, as well as various related living conditions and poverty EU policies, such as on child poverty, access to health care and other services, housing, over indebtedness and quality of life. It is also the main source of data for microsimulation purposes and flash estimates of income distribution and poverty rates. (3) The international comparability of national and regional statistics on income and living conditions requires the use of statistical classifications for the territorial units, education, occupation and economic sector that are compatible with the NUTS ( 2 ), ISCED ( 3 ), ISCO ( 4 ) and NACE ( 5 ) classifications. The recommendations made by the United Nations in the Canberra Group Handbook on Household Income Statistics should also be taken into account. (4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation specifies the technical items of the data set, the technical formats for the transmission of information from Member States to the Commission (Eurostat) and the arrangements for transmission and the content of the quality reports in the income and living conditions domain (EU-SILC).

        "(b) the variable\u2019s name; (c) the modality label and code; (d) the collection unit; (e) the mode of collection; (f) the reference period. 3. The variables for which missing values are not allowed and for which data shall be imputed shall be those identified in the Annex II. 4. All household and personal data shall be linkable for the whole duration of the panel, both for cross-sectional and for longitudinal information. Article 4 Characteristics of the statistical populations and observation units and the rules on respondents 1. The target population in the income and living conditions domain shall be private households and all persons composing these households in the territory of the Member State. 2. Information at household and person level shall be collected or compiled for all household members, including all sample persons and co-residents as specified in Annex II. In the selected respondent model, data shall be collected through individual interviews only from selected respondents aged 16 or over. For a sample person, starting from the second wave, information shall be obtained on whether that person remained at the same address or moved to a different address from one year to the next, as well as on the new contact information in case of change. 3. Information on household members from the previous wave who are no longer household members shall be collected to establish whether those persons have died or whether they have moved abroad or to an institution or to a different address within the national territory. 4. A household shall be included for the collection or compilation of detailed information if it contains at least one sample person. 5. In both the initial and the split-off household, the full information required for current household members and the full information at household level shall be collected or compiled. 6. At least three attempts shall be made to contact a household or person before it is considered that it, he or she is non- responding, unless there are conclusive reasons why this cannot be done (such as a definite refusal to cooperate or circumstances endangering the interviewer\u2019s safety). 7. Where proxy interviews are allowed, the proxy rate shall be kept as limited as possible with regard to: (a) the income personal variables; (b) any variables required for at least one household member aged 16 and over. If a proxy interview is conducted, the identification of the person who has provided the information shall be recorded. 8. Detailed characteristics of the identification of households and persons shall be those set out in Annex III. Article 5 Reference periods 1. The income reference period shall be a 12-month period, such as the previous calendar or tax year. 2. The reference periods for variables not referring to income shall be those specified in Annex II. Article 6 Detailed sample characteristics 1. Only Member States that used the selected respondent model before 19 January 2020 shall be authorised to continue using the method over the following years. EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.12.2019 L 336/135 ",
        "2. Controlled substitutions of sample households or persons may be allowed only in the first year of each panel, if the response rate falls below 60 % and one of the following situations arises: (a) the sample household or person is not contacted because it/she/he cannot be located or is inaccessible; (b) the sample household or person is contacted, but the interview is not completed because the household or person refuses to cooperate, the whole household is temporarily away, the household or person is unable to respond or there are circumstances endangering the interviewer\u2019s safety. 3. The set of sample households or persons for substitution shall be defined prior to data collection. There shall be no substitution with households or persons not belonging to that set. 4. Procedures shall be followed to ensure that the process of substitution is controlled to the maximum extent possible. Such procedures shall include using a design which ensures that the selected substitutes closely match the households or persons they replace in terms of their significant characteristics. 5. Small parts of a national territory amounting to no more than 2 % of the national population may be excluded from EU-SILC, as may French overseas departments and territories. Both exclusions shall not take place simultaneously. 6. If subpopulations covered by the survey are significantly under-represented in the achieved sample owing to specific non-response or attrition, Member States shall take measures such as oversampling, calibration or applying any relevant method to correct for the resulting bias. The methods used, their impact and any drawbacks shall be explained and assessed in the quality report. Article 7 Data gathering periods and methods 1. For data directly provided by respondents, the fieldwork period shall be as close as possible to the income reference period, to minimise time lag between income and current variables. 2. The interval between the collection or compilation of data concerning a given household or person for successive waves shall be kept as close as possible to 12 months. 3. Data provided directly by respondents shall be collected by computer-assisted methods, including computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) and computer-assisted web-interview (CAWI). Justification shall be provided for any exceptions. Article 8 Rules on follow-up 1. Sample persons, co-residents and sample households shall be observed for the purpose of the survey over the duration of the panel in accordance with the rules set out in paragraphs 2 to 7. 2. Sample persons moving to a private household within the national territory covered in the survey shall be followed to the location of the household. 3. Sample persons who are temporarily away from the household but who are still considered members of the household shall be covered by the survey in that household. 4. Sample persons who are no longer members of a private household, or who have moved outside the national territory covered in the survey or to an institution, shall be dropped from the survey. 5. Co-residents living in a household containing at least one sample person shall be followed. 6. Co-residents living in a household not containing any sample person shall be dropped from the survey. 7. A sample household shall be dropped from the survey in the following situations: (a) the household was not enumerated for a single year due to either of the following reasons: (1) the address was impossible to locate; (2) the address was non-residential or unoccupied; (3) there was no information on what happened to the household (the household was lost); (4) the household refused to cooperate; EN Official Journal of the European Union L 336/136 30.12.2019 ",
        "(b) the household was not contacted in the first year of the panel or in two consecutive years of the panel due to either of the following reasons: (1) it was not possible to access the address; (2) the whole household was temporarily away or unable to respond due to incapacity or illness or for other serious reasons. Article 9 Common standards for data editing, imputation, weighting and estimation 1. Imputation, modelling or weighting shall be applied to the data where necessary. 2. Where non-response to income variables at component level results in missing data, appropriate methods of statistical imputation shall be applied. 3. Where any net income variable at component level is collected directly, appropriate methods of statistical imputation or modelling, or both, shall be applied to obtain the required target gross variables and vice versa. 4. Where non-response to an individual questionnaire occurs within a sample household, appropriate statistical methods for statistical weighting or imputation shall be used to estimate the total income of the household. 5. The procedure applied to the data shall preserve the variation in and the correlation between variables. Methods that incorporate \u2018error components\u2019 into the imputed values shall be preferable to those that simply impute a predicted value. 6. Methods which take into account the correlation structure (or other characteristics of the joint distribution of the variables) shall be preferable to the marginal or univariate approach. Article 10 Formats for transmitting information 1. Member States shall transmit the data that comply with the characteristics of the variables as specified in Annex II in electronic form to the Commission (Eurostat). 2. Member States shall transmit the data to the Commission (Eurostat) in the form of micro-data files (including appropriate weights), using the statistical data and metadata exchange standard through the single entry point to allow the Commission (Eurostat) to retrieve the data by electronic means. The data must have been fully checked and edited. 3. Member States shall annually transmit all the subsamples belonging to the rotational design of the given year, regardless of their duration. All the subsamples shall be transmitted together. 4. Member States shall provide the metadata necessary for the purpose of microsimulation in accordance with country specificities and in conformity with an appropriate classification for the variables on social benefits, using the exchange standards referred to in paragraph 2. Article 11 Quality reporting 1. Member States shall apply quality evaluation criteria and the detailed content of the quality report as laid down in Annex IV. 2. Member States shall transmit the quality-related reference metadata required by this Regulation to the Commission (Eurostat), using the statistical data and metadata exchange standard. They shall send the metadata through the single entry point so that the Commission (Eurostat) can retrieve the data by electronic means.

        "ANNEX I Definitions of statistical concepts 1. GROSS INCOME COMPONENTS 1.1. Employee income Employee income is defined as the total remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable by an employer to an employee in return for work done by the latter during the income reference period. Employee income is broken down into: (1) Gross cash or near-cash employee income (PY010G); (2) Gross non-cash employee income (PY020G); (3) Employers\u2019 social insurance contributions (PY030G). 1.1.1. Gross cash or near-cash employee income (PY010G) It refers to the monetary component of the compensation of employees in cash payable by an employer to an employee. It includes the value of any social contributions and income taxes payable by an employee or by the employer on behalf of the employee to social insurance schemes or tax authorities. Gross cash or near-cash employee income includes the followings items: \u2014 wages and salaries paid in cash for time worked or work done in main and any secondary or casual job(s), \u2014 remuneration for time not worked (e.g. holiday payments), \u2014 higher rates of pay for overtime, \u2014 fees paid to directors of incorporated enterprises, \u2014 piece rate payments, \u2014 payments for fostering children, \u2014 commissions, tips and gratuities, \u2014 supplementary payments (e.g. 13th month payment), \u2014 profit-sharing and bonuses paid in cash, \u2014 additional payments based on productivity, \u2014 allowances paid for working in remote locations (regarded as part of the conditions of the job), \u2014 allowances for transport to or from work, \u2014 additional payments made by employers to their employees or former employees and other eligible persons to supplement the sick, disability, maternity leave or survivors\u2019 pay entitlement from social insurance schemes, where such payments cannot be separately and clearly identified as social benefits, \u2014 payments made by employers to an employee in lieu of wages and salaries through a social insurance scheme when that employee is unable to work through sickness, disability or maternity leave where such payment cannot be separately and clearly identified as social benefits, \u2014 cash subsidies received from the employer for dwelling costs. Gross cash or near-cash employee income does not include: \u2014 payments made by an employer to reimburse work-related expenses (e.g. business travel), \u2014 severance and termination pay to compensate employees for employment ending before the employee has reached the normal retirement age for that job, and redundancy payments (they are included under \u2018Unemployment benefits\u2019 (PY090G)), \u2014 allowances for purely work-related expenses such as those for travel and subsistence or for protective clothes, \u2014 lump-sum payments at the normal retirement date (included under \u2018Old age benefits\u2019 (PY100G)), EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.12.2019 L 336/139 ",
        "\u2014 union strike pay, \u2014 employers\u2019 social insurance contributions. 1.1.2. Gross non-cash employee income (PY020G) It refers to the non-monetary income components which an employer may provide free of charge or at a reduced price to an employee as part of the employment package. (If any goods or services are provided for both private and work use, then private use, as a proportion of total use, must be estimated and applied to the total value). Gross non-cash employee income includes: \u2014 a company car and associated costs (e.g. free fuel, car insurance, taxes and duties, as applicable) provided either for private use or for both private and work use (PY021G), \u2014 free or subsidised meals, luncheon vouchers, \u2014 reimbursement or payment of housing-related expenses (e.g. gas, electricity, water, telephone or mobile telephone bills), \u2014 accommodation provided free or at reduced rent to an employee as the household\u2019s main or secondary residence, \u2014 other goods and services provided free or at a reduced price by employers to their employees, if they are a significant component of income at national level or they constitute a significant component of the income of particular groups of households. The value of goods and services provided free of charge shall be calculated according to their market value. The value of goods and services provided at a reduced price shall be calculated as the difference between the market value and the amount paid by the employee. Gross non-cash employee income does not include: \u2014 the cost to the employer of providing any of these goods and services if they are necessary to enable employees to do their work, \u2014 accommodation services at a place of work which cannot be used by the households to which the employees belong, \u2014 allowances paid to employees for the purchase of tools, equipment, clothes, etc. needed exclusively or primarily for their work, \u2014 special meals or drinks necessitated by exceptional working conditions, \u2014 any goods or services provided to employees at the place of work or required because of the nature of their work (e.g. a medical examination required for work). 1.1.3. Employers\u2019 social insurance mandatory/legal contributions (PY030G) Employers\u2019 contributions means payments made, during the income reference period, by employers for the benefit of their employees to insurers (social security funds and private funded schemes). The term covers statutory, conventional or contractual contributions to provide insurance against social risks. Traditionally, they cover statutory old age pension schemes, statutory health insurance and unemployment benefit. Employers\u2019 contributions are paid for most people in employment and can be deducted from the wages they receive, in accordance with published rules. The variable includes: \u2014 employers\u2019 contributions to government insurance (social security) schemes (including payroll taxes levied for social insurance purposes), \u2014 employers\u2019 contributions to private retirement (pension) plans that are a component of a defined insurance system in a country (e.g. second pension insurance pillar), \u2014 statutory employers\u2019 contributions to other private retirement (pension) plans, \u2014 statutory or conventional employers\u2019 contributions to private health insurance, EN Official Journal of the European Union L 336/140 30.12.2019 ",
        "\u2014 statutory or conventional employers\u2019 contributions to life insurance, \u2014 statutory or conventional employers\u2019 contributions to other employer insurance schemes (e.g. disability). The variable does not include voluntary contributions by employers. 1.2. Self-employment income Self-employment income means income received, during the income reference period, by individuals, for themselves or in respect of their family members, as a result of being or having been self-employed. Self- employment refers to jobs in which remuneration depends directly on the profits (or the potential for profits) derived from the goods and services produced (with own consumption considered as part of profits). A self- employed person makes the operational decisions affecting his or her enterprise, or delegates such decisions while retaining responsibility for the welfare of the enterprise. (In this context, \u2018enterprise\u2019 includes one-person operations). Remuneration for engaging in a hobby is regarded as an instance of self-employment. If the income collected or compiled corresponds to a time period earlier than the reference period, basic adjustments shall be applied to update the data to the income reference period. Self-employment income is broken down into: (1) Gross cash profits or losses from self-employment (including royalties) (PY050G); (2) Value of goods produced for own consumption (HY170G). 1.2.1. Gross cash profits or losses from self-employment (including royalties) (PY050G) That includes: \u2014 net operating profit or loss accruing to working owners of, or partners in, an unincorporated enterprise, less interest on business loans, \u2014 royalties earned on writing, inventions and so on, not included in the profit/loss of unincorporated enterprises, \u2014 rentals from business buildings, vehicles, equipment, etc., not included in the profit/loss of unincorporated enterprises, after deduction of related costs such as interest on associated loans, repairs and maintenance and insurance charges. It does not include: \u2014 directors\u2019 fees earned by owners of incorporated enterprises (which are included under \u2018Gross cash or near cash employee income\u2019 (PY010G)), \u2014 dividends paid by incorporated enterprises (which are included under \u2018Interest, dividends, profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business\u2019 (HY090G)), \u2014 profits from capital invested in an unincorporated enterprise in which the person does not work (\u2018sleeping partners\u2019) (these profits are included under \u2018Interest, dividends, profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business\u2019 (HY090G)), \u2014 rent from land and receipts from boarders or lodgers (which are included under \u2018Income from rental of a property or land\u2019 (HY040G)), \u2014 rentals from dwellings not included in the profit/loss of unincorporated enterprises (which are included under \u2018Income from rental of a property or land\u2019 (HY040G)). Income from self-employment shall be calculated as: \u2014 market output (gross revenue to turnover, including the value of goods produced by the enterprise but consumed by the self-employed person or his/her household), \u2014 plus the market value of goods and services bought for the unincorporated enterprise but consumed by the entrepreneur and his/her household members, \u2014 plus property income received in connection with financial and other assets belonging to the enterprise, \u2014 minus intermediate consumption (raw material costs, costs of sales, distribution costs, maintenance costs, administrative expenses, etc.), EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.12.2019 L 336/141 ",
        "\u2014 minus compensation of employees (wages, salaries and social security contributions for employees), \u2014 minus taxes on production and import taxes, \u2014 minus interest paid on business loans, \u2014 minus rents paid on land and other non-produced tangible assets rented by the enterprise, \u2014 minus consumption of fixed capital, \u2014 plus subsidies. In practice if the self-employed person or business prepares annual accounts for tax purposes, the gross income profits/losses shall be calculated as net operating profits/losses shown on this tax account for the most recent 12- month period, before deduction of taxes on income and compulsory social insurance contributions. In the absence of annual accounts, either for tax purposes or as a business account, the alternative approach to measuring self-employment income shall be to collect the amount of money (and goods) drawn out of the business for personal use (for consumption or saving, including the market value of goods produced or purchased by the business but taken for personal use). 1.2.2. Value of goods produced for own consumption (HY170G) The value of goods produced for own consumption refers to the value of food and beverages produced and consumed within the same household. The value of goods produced for own consumption shall be calculated as the market value of goods produced deducting any expenses incurred in the production. The value of food and beverages shall be included if they are a significant component of income at national level or if they constitute a significant component of the income of particular groups of households. This value does not include: \u2014 the value of household services, \u2014 any production for sale and any withdrawals from a business by a self-employed person (these values are included under \u2018Gross income profits or losses from self-employment\u2019 (including royalties) (PY050G)). 1.3. Property income Property income means income received minus expenses accruing, during the income reference period, by the owner of a financial asset or a tangible non-produced asset (land) in return for providing funds to or putting the tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of another institutional unit. Property income is broken down into: (1) Interest, dividends, profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business (HY090G); (2) Income from rental of a property or land (HY040G); (3) Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under the European system of integrated social protection statistics (ESSPROS)) (PY080). 1.3.1. Interest, dividends, profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business (HY090G) Interest (not included in the profit/loss of an unincorporated enterprise), dividends and profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business refer to the amount of interest from assets such as bank accounts, certificates of deposit, bonds, etc., dividends and profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business in which the person does not work, received during the income reference period, minus expenses incurred. 1.3.2. Income from rental of a property or land (HY040G) Income from rental of a property or land refers to the income received, during the income reference period, from renting a property (for example renting a dwelling not included in the profit/loss of unincorporated enterprises, receipts from boarders or lodgers or rent from land) after deducting costs such as mortgage interest repayments, minor repairs, maintenance, insurance and other charges. EN Official Journal of the European Union L 336/142 30.12.2019 ",
        "1.3.3. Pensions received from individual private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) (PY080). Regular pensions from private plans (other than those covered under ESSPROS) refer to pensions and annuities received, during the income reference period, in the form of interest or dividend income from individual private insurance plans, i.e. fully organised schemes where contributions are at the contributor\u2019s discretion, independently of his or her employers or government. The term includes: \u2014 Old age, survivors, sickness, disability and unemployment pensions received as interest or dividends from individual insurance private plans. It does not include: \u2014 Pensions from mandatory government schemes, \u2014 Pensions from mandatory employer-based schemes. 1.4. Current transfers received 1.4.1. Social benefits Social benefits ( 1 ) are defined as current transfers received by households during the income reference period ( 2 ) and intended to relieve them of the financial burden of certain risks or needs, made through collectively organised schemes, or outside such schemes by government units and non-profit institutions serving households. Social benefits include the value of any social contributions and income tax payable on the benefits by the beneficiary to social insurance schemes or to tax authorities. To be classed as a social benefit, a transfer must meet one of two criteria: \u2014 coverage is compulsory (under a law, regulation or collective bargaining agreement) for the group in question, \u2014 it is based on the principle of social solidarity (i.e. if it is an insurance-based pension, the premium and entitlements are not proportional to the individual exposure to risk of the people protected). Social benefits are broken down into: (1) Family/children-related allowances (HY050G); (2) Housing allowances (HY070G); (3) Unemployment benefits (PY090G); (4) Old-age benefits (PY100G); (5) Survivors\u2019 benefits (PY110G); (6) Sickness benefits (PY120G); (7) Disability benefits (PY130G); (8) Education-related allowances (PY140G); (9) Social exclusion allowances/benefits not classified elsewhere (HY060G). Social benefits are classed as means-tested or non-means-tested benefits, and as contributory or non-contributory. Contributory schemes are social protection schemes that require the payment of contributions, by the protected persons or by other parties on their behalf, in order to secure individual entitlement to benefits. Non-contributory schemes are social protection schemes in which eligibility to benefits is not conditional on the payment of contributions by the protected persons or by other parties on their behalf. Means-tested social benefits are social benefits which are explicitly or implicitly conditional on the beneficiary\u2019s income or wealth, or both, falling below a specified level. Non means-tested social benefits are social benefits which are not conditional on the beneficiary\u2019s income or wealth, or both, falling below a specified level. ( 1 ) The social benefits included in EU-SILC, with the exception of housing benefits, are restricted to cash benefits. ( 2 ) To obtain a more accurate measure of the well-being of the household, the lump-sum benefits received during the income reference period are treated in accordance with Eurostat technical recommendations. In the same way, lump-sum payments received before the income reference period may be taken into account and imputed according to Eurostat recommendations.

        "ANNEX III Identification of households and persons Household identification number (1) The household identification number (ID) is composed of the household number and the split number. The household number is a unique number assigned to each household in wave 1. That number shall be generated in such a way as to contain no information that might enable the household to be identified. The split number for the first wave shall always take the value \u201800\u2019. (2) In the event of a household split, the initial household shall keep the household number and split number from one wave to the next. The split-off household or households shall keep the same household number, but shall be assigned the next available unique split number in sequence. (3) In the event of a fusion of two sample households, if the new household remains at the previous address of one of them, it shall retain the household number and the split number of the household that occupied that address during the previous wave. If the new household now occupies a new address, the household number and split number of the household of the sample person who now has the lowest person number shall be used. Personal identification number (1) The personal identification number (ID) is composed of the household ID and the person number. (2) The person number for any new person in the household shall be formed by adding 1 to the highest person number used, for all the years of the survey and the household ID. (3) The household ID shall be the household identification number of the household where the person first appears in the panel. (4) The personal ID shall remain unchanged throughout the time the person is taking part in the survey. EN Official Journal of the European Union L 336/268 30.12.2019 ",
        "ANNEX IV Detailed arrangements and contents of quality reports Member States shall include the following specific information in the quality report on the income and living conditions domain. STATISTICAL PROCESSING Sample design \u2014 Sample size by rotational group and allocation criteria \u2014 Weightings (design factor, non-response adjustments, adjustments to external data (level, variables used and sources)) \u2014 Final cross-sectional and longitudinal weight \u2014 Substitutions if applied in cases of unit non-response, method of selection of substitutes, main characteristics of substituted units compared to original units, by region (NUTS 2), distribution of substituted units by record of contact at address, household questionnaire result and household interview acceptance of the original units for each rotational group and total Sampling unit Description of the sampling units. Sources other than surveys Description of each individual source and of how they are combined. Data collection The method by which income variables at component level were obtained and the form they take (e.g. gross, net of taxes on income at source and social contributions, net of tax on income at source, net of social contributions) shall be described. For each wave, the distribution of household members aged 16 or over by \u2018data status\u2019 and by \u2018type of interview\u2019 shall be provided, for each sample person, for co-residents and for the total. Any differences between the national follow up rules and the standard EUSILC follow up rules shall be mentioned. Data compilation If there is any imputation, the extent to which it is used and the reasons for it shall be explained. For the EU-SILC cross-sectional component and for each wave (if there are differences) of the EU-SILC longitudinal component, the imputation procedure used for item non-response shall be described. The list of variables where imputation is used and the instances of imputation as a percentage of the total number of observations per variable shall be reported. If the sum of the income components is different from the total income, an explanation of the reasons shall be provided. ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY Sampling error For each year for the income components the mean, the total number of observations (before and after imputation) and the standard errors shall be reported at national and regional level (NUTS 2).

        "Measurement error The different sources of measurement errors likely to be found in the survey shall be described. This includes a description of the questionnaire design, the use of a cognitive laboratory (if applicable), field testing of the questionnaire, the effect of its design, content and wording, information on the intensity and efficiency of interview training: number of training days, skills testing before starting the fieldwork (rate of success and so on), information on studies to check the impact of the interviewer, such as re-interviews, record check studies, or split-sample experiments (if available), and results from models (if available). Proxy interview rates shall be provided. Non-response error: Achieved (Net) sample size The following information shall be provided for the achieved sample size: (a) For each wave the number of households for which an interview is accepted for the database by rotational group breakdown and total, (b) For each wave, the number of persons aged 16 or older who are members of the households for which an interview is accepted for the database, and who underwent a personal interview, by rotational group breakdown and total, (c) For each wave, the number of selected respondents (if applicable) who are members of the households for which an interview is accepted for the database, and who underwent a personal interview, by rotational group breakdown and total. Unit non-response For each wave, the following shall be reported: the distribution of households (original units and substituted units, if applicable) by \u2018record of contact at address\u2019, by \u2018household questionnaire result\u2019 and by \u2018household interview acceptance\u2019. For the first wave the unit non-response rate shall be provided in accordance with the formulas set out below. For the total sample, the unit non-response shall be calculated by removing, from the numerator and the denominator of the formulas set out below, those units that are out of scope, according to the follow-up rules. \u2014 Household non-response rates (NRh) shall be computed as follows: NRh = (1-(Ra * Rh)) * 100 Where: Ra = Number of addresses successfully contacted/Number of valid addresses selected Ra is the address contact rate Rh = Number of household interviews completed and accepted for database/Number of eligible households at contacted addresses. Rh is the proportion of complete household interviews accepted for the database. For those Member States where substitutions are made in case of unit non-response, non-response rates shall be calculated before and after substitutions. \u2014 Individual non-response rates (NRp) shall be computed as follows: NRp=(1-(Rp)) * 100 Where: Rp = Number of personal interviews completed/Number of eligible individuals in the households whose interviews were completed and accepted for the database. Rp is the proportion of complete personal interviews within the households accepted for the database. \u2014 Overall individual non-response rates (*NRp) shall be computed as follows: * NRp = (1-(Ra * Rh * Rp)) * 100 For those Member States where substitutions are made in cases of unit non-response, non-response rates shall be calculated before and after substitutions.

        "For those Member States where a sample of persons rather than a sample of households (addresses) was selected, the individual non-response rates shall be calculated for \u2018the selected respondent\u2019, for all individuals aged 16 or older and for the non-selected respondent. For the second and subsequent waves, the following information shall be provided: \u2014 The distribution of persons by membership status Response rate for the sample for households \u2014 Wave response rate Percentage of households successfully interviewed which were passed on to wave t (from wave t-1) or newly created or added during wave t, excluding those out of scope (under the rules on follow up) or non-existent. \u2014 Longitudinal follow-up rate Percentage of households which are passed on to wave t+1 for follow-up within the households received into wave t from wave t-1, excluding those out of scope (under the rules on follow up) or non-existent. \u2014 Follow-up ratio Number of households passed on from wave t to wave t+1 in comparison to the number of households received for follow- up at wave t from wave t-1. \u2014 Achieved sample size ratio Ratio of the number of households accepted for the database in wave t to the number of households accepted for the database in wave t-1. Response rate for the sample of persons \u2014 Wave response rate Percentage of sample persons successfully interviewed among those passed on to wave t (from wave t-1) or newly created or added during wave t, excluding those out of scope (under the rules on follow up).
