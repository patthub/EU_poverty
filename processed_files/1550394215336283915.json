        "Official statistics play a fundamental role in today\u2019s society. Public administrations, policy makers, economic operators, markets, researchers and citizens rely on high quality statistics to describe developments in the economic, social, environmental and cultural spheres as accurately as possible. Statistical authorities respond to the needs of these users who require easy and timely access to such high quality information. Impartial and objective statistical information is essential in order to enable well informed decisions based on an accurate and relevant picture of society. Statistical information underpins transparency and openness of policy decisions; official statistics therefore are a public good and a basis for the smooth functioning of democracy. At European level, statistics are increasingly important for the definition, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies. Europe needs a plethora of statistical data which meet the highest possible standards in terms of quality. For example, reliable statistics are needed to assess macro-economic developments such as inflation, employment, economic growth and the business cycle in general: in order to facilitate economic policy coordination among Member States; to keep Europe on the path to long-term prosperity, notably through the revised Lisbon strategy and the integrated guidelines on growth and employment; and finally, to reinforce a commitment to solidarity and social justice. European statistics thus constitute an essential information tool that may help monitor European Union strategic objectives, as well as sustaining underlying policies and supporting instruments. Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Communities, ensures the collection, production and dissemination of harmonised statistics at European level. Eurostat gets most of its data from the national statistical authorities in the Member States. It then processes, analyses and publishes that data at a European level, following common statistical concepts, methods and standards. Eurostat also supports and encourages the development of similar statistical systems within countries neighbouring the European Union, driving thereby a process of statistical harmonisation. I hope this publication will encourage you to use Eurostat\u2019s data for your information needs and daily work. Please consult our website at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat which offers you free access to nearly all Eurostat data and publications.

        "The publication Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition provides an overview of data that is available through the European statistical system. It belongs to the same family of compendium publications as the more extensive Eurostat yearbook. The publication provides a balanced set of key indicators, presenting a broad cross-section of information that is available within Eurostat\u2019s dissemination database. The publication is part of Eurostat\u2019s current dissemination strategy, insofar as it is distributed free of charge, accompanying the vast array of official statistics freely available on Eurostat\u2019s website. Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition is divided into nine chapters, each of which contains information relating to a particular topic. Within each chapter each double page focuses on a subject: most start with a short commentary that provides contextual information (such as policy relevance), as well as definitions of the indicators presented, and warnings concerning the interpretation of the data. The standard structure employed for the majority of these double pages is to present a graph focused on aggregated European Union data, as well as a table with a selection of indicators/time periods for all Member States and other non-Community countries. The balance of the information presented within the publication reflects to some degree the volume of information available under each of the themes within Eurostat\u2019s dissemination database, while also attempting to provide information that is of particular interest for the general public. Eurostat produces a broad range of more specialised publications, which may be accessed through the Eurostat homepage. The European statistical system The European statistical system comprises Eurostat and the statistical offices, ministries and agencies that collect official statistics in the European Union Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The European statistical system concentrates on European Union policy areas, although harmonisation has extended to nearly all statistical fields. The European statistical system is a network in which Eurostat\u2019s role is to lead the way in the harmonisation of statistics in close cooperation with the national statistical authorities. At the heart of the European statistical system is the Statistical Programme Committee, which brings together the heads of Member States\u2019 national statistical offices and is chaired by Eurostat. The Statistical Programme Committee discusses joint actions and programmes to be carried out to meet European Union information requirements. It agrees a five-year programme, which is implemented by the national authorities and monitored by Eurostat. For a list of contact details for the national statistical authorities please refer to page 234. Data coverage The information presented within this publication was extracted from Eurostat\u2019s dissemination database during the first week of July 2007; data are generally available up until 2005 or 2006.

        "space constraints associated with the format of this publication mean that time-series are generally not presented. Longer time-series will generally be available when consulting Eurostat\u2019s website. Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition presents information for the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU-27), the euro area, as well as the individual Member States. When available, information is also presented for the candidate countries, EFTA countries, as well as Japan and the United States. The EU-27 aggregate is only provided when information for all 27 Member States is available or has been estimated. In some cases it was not yet possible to calculate the EU-27 aggregate, even if all 27 individual Member States provided data; in most of these cases the EU-25 aggregate is shown instead. A footnote is added when the data refers to a partial total that has been created from an incomplete set of country information (no data for certain Member States, or only data for an older reference period). The data for the euro area covers the 13 Member States that share the euro as a common currency: Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Finland. Data for the euro area covers all 13 participating countries, irrespective of when they joined the euro area; otherwise, a footnote is added. Cyprus and Malta will also become members of the euro area in 2008; however, this could not be taken into account at the time of writing (September 2007). Further information Free access to most Eurostat data is available through the Eurostat website, which can be found at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat. The website presents a vast array of information in the form of tables, databases, methodology and publications: these are all structured primarily by subjects/themes. Eurostat data code A code (such as \u2018tec00001\u2019) has been inserted as part of the source whenever Eurostat data is presented in this publication. This code allows the reader to easily access the most recent data on the Eurostat website (note that the data on the website is frequently updated and may also be more detailed or have a different measurement unit). For more details, consult the link entitled \u2018The Eurostat data code\u2019 on the Eurostat homepage. Symbols used for data An italic font is used in tables to show provisional data, estimates and forecasts (in other words, data that are likely to change in the future). The colon (:) is used in tables to represent data that is not available, either because the value was not provided by the national statistical authority or because the value is confidential. In figures (charts/graphs) missing information is footnoted as not available. A dash (-) is used to indicate values that are not relevant or not applicable. More metadata can be found on Eurostat's website. 8 Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition ch00.qxp 21/12/2007 09:53 Page 8 ",

        "Gross domestic product (GDP) is a central measure of national accounts, which summarises the economic position of a country (or region). GDP can be calculated using one of three different approaches: \u2013 the output approach, which sums the gross value added of various industries, plus taxes and less subsidies on products; \u2013 the expenditure approach, which sums the final use of goods and services (final consumption and gross capital formation), plus exports and minus imports of goods and services, and; \u2013 the income approach, which sums the compensation of employees, net taxes on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixed income. The real GDP growth rate shows the change from one year to the next in GDP, after adjusting for changes in price levels, in other words removing the effect of inflation. This shows the real change in an economy, allowing an analysis of an economy over time. An analysis of the economy of different countries can be made easier by studying GDP per capita, so removing the influence of the absolute size of the population. Such comparisons of the wealth and competitiveness of countries can be made using purchasing power standards (PPS). To do this measures of GDP in national currencies are converted into a common currency using purchasing power parities (PPPs) that reflect the purchasing power of each currency, rather than using market exchange rates.

        "The European system of national and regional accounts (ESA 95) provides a number of key indicators that can be used to assess macro-economic conditions, covering a wide range of subjects including: output, expenditure, and investment. The main aggregates of national accounts are compiled from institutional units (be they non-financial or financial corporations, general government, households, or non-profit institutions serving households). The output of the economy is measured using gross value added, which is defined as the value of all newly generated goods and services (at basic prices) less the value of all goods and services consumed in their creation (at purchasers\u2019 prices). Economic output can be analysed by activity (based on NACE) in a number of ways, for example showing the relative importance of particular activities, highlighting the structural differences between countries. An analysis of output over time can be facilitated using a volume measure of output, in other words by deflating the value of output to remove the impact of price changes: each activity is deflated individually to reflect the changes in the prices of its associated products. 16 ECONOMIC OUTPUT 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Financial intermediation; real estate, renting & business activities Distributive trades; hotels, restaurants; transport, storage, communication Total industry Public admin., defence; education; health, community & personal services Agriculture, hunting, forestry & fishing Construction Figure 1.2: Gross value added, chain-linked volumes for 2000, EU-27 (1995=100) Source: Eurostat (nama_nace06_k) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 1 Chapter 1 Economy and finance ch01.qxp 21/12/2007 09:54 Page 16 ",

        "Using the expenditure approach GDP is defined as private final consumption expenditure + government final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + exports - imports. In the system of national accounts, only households, non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) and government have final consumption, whereas corporations for example have intermediate consumption. Private final consumption expenditure, or that performed by households and NPISH, is defined as expenditure on goods and services for the direct satisfaction of individual needs, whereas government consumption expenditure includes goods and services produced by government, as well as purchases of goods and services by government that are supplied to households as social transfers in kind. With respect to investment, gross capital formation consists of gross fixed capital formation, plus changes in inventories (stocks). Gross fixed capital formation is defined as residents\u2019 acquisitions less disposals of fixed tangible or intangible assets that are used repeatedly, or continuously, in production processes for more than one year; such assets may be outputs from production processes or imports. Investment may be made by public or private institutions. The final component of GDP, as defined by the expenditure approach, is the balance of external trade, which is equal to exports minus imports of goods and services. 18 GDP EXPENDITURE AND INVESTMENT Final consumption expenditure of general government 21.0% Final consumption expenditure of households and non-profit institutions serving households 58.1% Gross capital formation 20.7% External balance of goods and services 0.2% Figure 1.4: Expenditure components of GDP, EU-27, 2006 (%) Source: Eurostat (tec00009, tec00010, tec00011 and tec00012) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 1 Chapter 1 Economy and finance ch01.qxp 21/12/2007 09:54 Page 18 ",

        "A wide array of statistical indicators have been developed to measure labour productivity. Labour productivity per person employed is one such measure. It is calculated by taking gross value added and dividing by the total number of persons employed. The indicator provides confirmation of the most labour intensive areas of the European Union economy, as well as an insight into the apparent productivity growth of particular economic activities. GDP per hour worked is another productivity measure and, when expressed in PPS (see page 14 for a definition of PPS) which eliminates differences in price levels between countries, is particularly useful in terms of cross-country comparisons; the use of hours worked as the denominator, rather than the number of persons employed, eliminates measurement problems associated with distinguishing between full and part-time employment, the incidence of which varies greatly between countries and activities. The data are presented in the form of an index in relation to the European Union average: if the index rises above 100, then labour productivity is higher than the European Union average. The real unit labour cost compares the average compensation per employee with the labour productivity (gross domestic product (GDP) per persons employed). As such it shows the average cost of each employee (paid person) compared with the average value that each person, whether paid employee or unpaid workers (such as the self-employed), produces. The rate of change of this ratio aims to give an impression of the dynamics of the participation of the labour production factor in the value added of output. 20 LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY Figure 1.5: Labour productivity, EU-27 (EUR 1 000 per person employed) Source: Eurostat (nama_nace06_c and nama_nace06_e) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 1 Chapter 1 Economy and finance 0 25 50 75 100 Public administration, defence; education; health, community & personal services Financial intermediation; real estate, renting & business activities Distributive trades; hotels & restaurants; transport, storage & communication Construction Total industry Agriculture, hunting, forestry & fishing 1996 2006 ch01.qxp 21/12/2007 09:54 Page 20 ",

        "An interest rate is defined as the cost or price of borrowing, or the gain from lending; interest rates are traditionally expressed in annual percentage terms. Interest rates are distinguished either by the period of lending/borrowing, or by the parties involved in the transaction (business, consumers, governments or interbank operations). Central bank interest rates are key reference rates set by the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks (for those countries outside of the euro area). Central bank interest rates are also referred to as \u2019official interest rates\u2019; they are the main instrument of monetary policy for central banks. Long-term interest rates are one of the convergence criteria (or Maastricht criteria) for European economic and monetary union. The data are based upon central government bond yields on the secondary market, gross of tax, with a residual maturity of around 10 years. Eurostat publishes a number of short-term interest rates, with different maturities: overnight, 1 to 12-months. Day-to-day money rates refer to deposits or loans on the money market with a maturity of just one business day. The rates shown are reference rates and are generally interbank rates. 22 INTEREST RATES 02 468 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Euro area (2) United States Japan Figure 1.6: Central bank interest rates - official lending rates for loans (%) (1) (1) Annual averages.

        "Changes in the price of consumer goods and services are usually referred to as the inflation rate. Price stability is one of the primary objectives of the European Central Bank (ECB), with the inflation rate used as a prime indicator for monetary policy management within the euro area. The ECB has defined price stability as an annual increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) for the euro area of close to but below 2 % (over the medium term). For this purpose, the monetary union index of consumer prices (MUICP) covers the euro area countries, while Eurostat also publishes an aggregate index for all European Union Member States, the European index of consumer prices (EICP). HICPs are presented with a common reference year, which is currently 2005=100. Normally the indices are used to create percentage changes that show price increases/decreases for the period in question: although the rates of change shown in this publication are annual averages, the basic indices are compiled on a monthly basis. HICPs cover practically every good and service that may be purchased by households in the form of final monetary consumption expenditure. The different goods and services are classified according to an international classification of individual consumption by purpose, known as COICOP/HICP. At its most disaggregated level, Eurostat publishes around 100 sub- indices, which can be aggregated to broad categories of goods and services (as shown in the graph below). 24 CONSUMER PRICE INDICES -4 -2 0 2 4 6 Inflation rate Housing, water, elec., gas & other fuels Education Transport Restaurants & hotels Alcoholic beverages, tobacco Miscellaneous goods & services Food & non-alcoholic beverages Health Furnish., household equip. & maintenance Recreation & culture Clothing & footwear Communications Figure 1.7: Harmonised indices of consumer prices, annual average rate of change, EU, 2006 (%) (1) (1) European Union, EU-15 up to April 2004, EU-25 up to December 2006.

        "Comparisons of price changes between countries depend not only on movements in price levels, but also exchange rates, and together these impact on price and cost competitiveness. The real effective exchange rate aims to assess a country\u2019s (or currency area\u2019s) price or cost competitiveness relative to its principal competitors in international markets. The real effective exchange rate shown here is deflated by nominal unit labour costs and is based on an aggregate for 34 industrial countries, made up of the EU-25 Member States, Turkey, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and the United States. A rise in the index means a loss of competitiveness. Comparative price levels are the ratio between purchasing power parities (PPPs) and market exchange rates (see page 14 for a definition of PPPs). Comparative price levels are shown as a ratio in relation to the European Union average (EU-25=100). If the index for a country is higher/lower than 100, the country concerned is relatively expensive/cheap as compared with the European Union average. Price convergence is shown here measured by the coefficient of variation of comparative price levels of household final consumption expenditure: if the coefficient for the European Union decreases/increases over time, the national price levels in the Member States are converging/diverging. 26 PRICE CONVERGENCE AND COMPETITIVENESS Figure 1.8: International price competitiveness (real effective exchange rate), 2006 (1999=100) (1) Value covers Belgium and Luxembourg.

        "Government debt is a key element when assessing the government sector\u2019s financial position. Both the general government public balance and general government debt are reported on 1 April and 1 October of each year to the European Commission within the framework of the excessive deficit procedure (EDP). These two indicators are also important measures that form part of the convergence criteria for European economic and monetary union (also known as the Maastricht criteria). General government consolidated gross debt is expressed as a percentage of GDP. It refers to the consolidated stock of gross debt at the end of the year. Under the convergence criteria, the debt ratio of general government consolidated gross debt to GDP, should generally be no more than 60 %. The public balance is defined as general government net borrowing/net lending and is also expressed in relation to GDP. General government comprises central, state and local government, as well as social security funds. Under the convergence criteria, the ratio of planned or actual government deficit (net borrowing) to GDP should be no more than 3 %. 28 GOVERNMENT PUBLIC BALANCE AND DEBT 0 25 50 75 100 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 -6 -4 -2 02 General government debt (left-hand scale) (2) Public balance (right-hand scale) (3) Figure 1.9: Evolution of general government debt and public balance, EU (% of GDP) (1) (1) Public balance - net borrowing/lending of general government sector; general government debt - general government consolidated gross debt.

The first pages position the people of Europe as a whole within the world\u2019s population of 6.5 billion in 2005. Although the world\u2019s population increased significantly from 1960 to the present, each successive decade recorded a progressively slower growth, with varying population change in the six continents. Europe had by far the lowest growth rates among the different continents. Furthermore, Europe, Asia, as well as Latin America and the Caribbean recorded progressively slower population growth rates from one decade to the next. Africa initially recorded an increasing growth rate, peaking at an annual average growth of 2.9 % in the 1980s, after which the rate of growth fell to an average of 2.3 % in the five years to 2005. Northern America and Oceania both recorded a higher average annual growth rate in the 1960s compared with the 1970s, after which the annual average rates of growth were relatively stable. As a result of the lower growth rates, the share of the world\u2019s population in Europe fell from around one fifth in 1960 to just over one tenth in 2005. The Northern American share also fell, though to a far lesser extent while the share of Oceania remained roughly stable. The share of the other three continents increased, most notably that of Africa which rose from 9.3 % in 1960 to 14.2 % in 2005. Asia remained the largest continent in population terms, with 3.9 billion persons in 2005, equivalent to some three fifths of the world population.

        "Total population figures refer to the population as of 1 January each year. The statistics presented should cover the total number of inhabitants of a given area (irrespective of their nationality). Data are usually based on the most recent census information, adjusted by the components of population change. Population change is the difference in population between two reference dates and is equal to the sum of natural population change (the number of live births minus the number of deaths) and net migration (a measure of the difference between those leaving a territory and those arriving). Eurostat predicts that, under normal conditions, the EU-27\u2019s population will rise to around 496 million persons in 2025, after which it is expected to contract. The increase through to 2025 is predicted to be unevenly spread with modest gains among EU-15 Member States (except Italy). While most of the Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007 are expected to see their population contract by 2025, the populations of Malta and Cyprus are expected to increase considerably. Population density is the ratio of mid-year population, as defined by the number of inhabitants, relative to the size of the territory in square kilometres (km\u00b2). Note that the final chapter at the end of this publication presents regional data for population density and population growth. 42 EU POPULATION 0 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Net migration (2) Natural change (3) Figure 2.2: Population change, EU-27 (1 000) (1) (1) Break in series, 1998.

        "The impact of demographic change within the European Union is likely to be of major significance in the coming decades. Consistently low birth rates and higher life expectancy will transform the structure of the European Union\u2019s age pyramid; probably the most important change will be the marked transition towards a much older population and this trend is already apparent in many Member States. The share of older persons in the total of the European Union will increase from 2010 onwards, as the post-war baby-boom generation reaches retirement. These demographic trends have economic and social consequences, and were addressed by a European Commission communication \u2018towards a Europe for all ages - promoting prosperity and inter- generational solidarity\u2019, which promoted active ageing and equal opportunities. The Lisbon Strategy pays particular attention to the demographic challenges that face the Union in relation to policies for economic growth and social cohesion. 44 EU POPULATION BY AGE CLASS 10 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 85 and over 80-84 75-79 70-74 65-69 60-64 55-59 50-54 45-49 40-44 35-39 30-34 25-29 20-24 15-19 10-14 5-9 0-4 Male Female Figure 2.3: Age pyramid, EU-27, 2006 (% of male/female population) Source: Eurostat (demo_ppavg) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 2 Chapter 2 Population and social conditions ch02.qxp 21/12/2007 09:59 Page 44 ",

        "The crude marriage rate is the number of marriages during a year in relation to the average population, expressed per 1 000 inhabitants. Equally, the crude divorce rate relates the number of divorces to the average population, again expressed per 1 000 inhabitants. Despite a peak in the late 1980s the marriage rate for the European Union has been on a downward trend since the early 1970s, coinciding with an increase in the mean age at first marriage. Note that divorce is possible in each of the Member States, except for Malta. While in many countries divorce was introduced in the 18th and 19th centuries, it was not introduced until 1970 in Italy, 1975 in Portugal, 1976 in Scotland, 1981 in Spain, and 1995 in Ireland. 46 MARRIAGES AND DIVORCES 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2003 2004 Male Female Figure 2.4: Mean age at first marriage, EU-25 (years) Source: Eurostat (tps00014 and demo_nsinagec) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 2 Chapter 2 Population and social conditions ch02.qxp 21/12/2007 09:59 Page 46 ",

        "Live births are defined as the total number of births excluding still births. The crude birth rate is the ratio of the number of births to the average population in a particular reference year (the result is generally expressed per 1 000 inhabitants). Live births outside of marriage are generally those where the mother\u2019s marital status at the time of birth is other than married. The total fertility rate is the number of children born to a woman during her lifetime (5) . In developed countries a rate of about 2.1 children is considered to maintain a stable population in the long run, under a hypothetical zero net migration. Fertility rates in the European Union have generally been below this natural replacement level across most Member States for a couple of decades. Indeed, fertility rates in the majority of the Member States continued to decline over this period and only a handful of countries within the European Union report fertility rates anywhere near to the replacement level. 48 BIRTHS AND FERTILITY 10.25 10.50 10.75 11.00 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 20 25 30 35 Crude birth rate (\u2030, left-hand scale) (1) Live births outside of marriage (%, right-hand scale) (1, 2) Figure 2.5: Birth rates, EU-27 (1) Break in series, 1998.

        "Migration and asylum are highly political topics: the statistics produced in this area are used, among others, to monitor common asylum policy and harmonised immigration policies across the European Union. The data are also used to assess the inclusion of migrant populations and measures to prevent discrimination. In many of the Member States, migration is an important component of population change. Net migration is defined as the difference between immigration into and emigration from the territory considered. As the latter is not easy to measure, net migration is often estimated on the basis of the difference between population change and natural increase. Eurostat produces corrected net migration figures by taking the difference between total and natural population increases. This assumes that any movement of population not attributable to natural change (births and deaths) is attributable to migration. Corrections due to population censuses or register counts which cannot be classified as births, deaths or migrations are also taken into account in the net migration figures. 50 MIGRATION 0 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Figure 2.6: Net migration, including corrections, EU-27 (1 000) (1) (1) Break in series, 1998.

        "The acquisition of citizenship is sometimes viewed as an indicator for the formal integration of migrants into their host country. The granting of citizenship usually requires a period of legal residence, together with other factors (for example, language proficiency). Citizenship may be granted to persons who have previously been citizens of another country or to persons who have been stateless. Asylum applications refer to all persons who apply on an individual basis for asylum or similar protection, irrespective of whether they lodge their application on arrival or from inside the country, and irrespective of whether they entered the country legally or illegally. An asylum applicant is a person who has requested protection under: either Article 1 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967; or within the remit of the United Nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel or inhuman treatment (UNCAT); or the European convention on human rights; or other relevant instruments of protection. 52 CITIZENSHIP AND ASYLUM 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 LU LV (1) EE (2) CY (3) AT ES DE BE EL (4) IE FR (2) SE UK (3) DK IT NL MT (3) PT (2) CZ SI FI PL (2) HU LT SK BG (2) RO Figure 2.7: Foreigners in the population, 2006 (% of total population) (1) Including Latvian non-citizens.

The information is gathered from death certificates, as medical certification of death is obligatory in all Member States. The statistics presented refer to the underlying cause of death, in other words, the disease or injury which initiated the events leading to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury. Infant mortality reflects the number of deaths of children under one year of age during the year and is presented as a ratio to the number of live births in that year. The life expectancy of citizens within the European Union has risen throughout recent decades, and the gap between men and women has narrowed, perhaps reflecting changes in work and lifestyle patterns. The statistics presented for life expectancy in this publication refer to the mean number of years that a newborn child can expect to live if subjected throughout his/her life to the current mortality conditions. A similar indicator for life expectancy at 65 reflects the mean number of years still to be lived by a person who has reached the age 65, if subjected throughout the rest of his or her life to the current mortality conditions. The indicators concerning healthy life years show the number of years that a person is (still) expected to live in a healthy condition. A healthy condition is defined by the absence of limitations in functioning/disability. The indicator is also called disability-free life expectancy (DFLE).

        "Smoking is widely accepted as one of the leading causes of potential health problems and has come in for particular attention in terms of restrictions: legislation has been adopted in a number of Member States restricting or forbidding smoking in public places and/or workplaces (including in particular bars and restaurants), as well as on collective transport, while indirect taxes, health warnings, and restrictions on advertising have also targeted smokers. Obesity and being overweight increase the risk of premature death and disability. Overweight people are those with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 25, while the threshold for obesity is a BMI of 30. The BMI is a measure of the body fat content of adults calculated as the ratio between the weight measured in kilograms, and the square of the height measured in metres. Salmonellosis is a food-borne illness caused by the bacteria salmonella. Salmonella bacteria cause an infection usually limited to the gastrointestinal system in humans but these organisms may also spread to other parts of the body. Salmonellosis is a communicable disease, threatening human health. Epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases was established within the European Union since it can bring about interventions that contribute to the reduction of morbidity and/or mortality. 56 HEALTH PROBLEMS 0 10 20 30 40 50 FI SE UK HU EE DE FR LV PL SI PT NL CZ LT CY SK DK BE IE ES LU IT MT AT EL Male Female Figure 2.9: People having a long-standing illness or health problem, 2005 (% of persons aged 15 or more) (1) (1) Long-standing is anything that has troubled the respondent over a period of time or that is likely to affect the respondent over a period of time; provisional data.

This includes accidents in the course of work outside the person\u2019s business premises, even if caused by a third party, and cases of acute poisoning. It excludes accidents on the way to or from work, occurrences having only a medical origin, and occupational diseases.

A new programme of Community action for the period 2003-2008 was agreed in 2002. It has three main areas: improving health information and knowledge for the development of public health; enhancing the capability to respond rapidly and in a co-ordinated fashion to threats to health; and promoting health and preventing disease through addressing health determinants across all policies and activities. Hospital beds are those which are regularly maintained and staffed and immediately available for the care of admitted patients. Beds in all hospitals, including general hospitals, mental health and substance abuse hospitals, and other specialty hospitals are covered. Data refer to occupied and unoccupied beds. The number of hospital beds is expressed per 100 000 inhabitants. Practising physicians are defined as physicians who provide services directly to patients (i.e. seeing patients either in a hospital, practice or elsewhere). The number of physicians is expressed per 100 000 inhabitants and is used as a proxy for access to the healthcare system. A discharge is the formal release of a patient from a hospital after a procedure or course of treatment. A discharge occurs anytime a patient leaves because of finalisation of treatment, signing-out against medical advice, transfer to another healthcare institution, or death. Data refer to in-patients. The number of discharges is expressed per 100 000 inhabitants and is the most commonly used measure of the utilisation of hospital services. HEALTHCARE ch02.qxp 21/12/2007 10:01 Page 60 ",

The youth education attainment level is the percentage of young people aged 20-24 having attained at least an upper secondary education (ISCED level 3a, 3b or 3c long minimum). 64 LEVELS OF EDUCATION 0 10 20 30 40 50 EU-27 Euro area FI DK EE BE CY SE IE NL UK ES LT FR LU DE BG EL SI LV PL HU AT SK CZ PT IT MT RO Male Female Figure 2.13: Percentage of the population aged 25 to 64 having a tertiary education, 2006 (%) Source: Eurostat (lfsa_pgaed) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 2 Chapter 2 Population and social conditions ch02.qxp 21/12/2007 10:02 Page 64 ",

Expenditure on educational institutions from public sources comprises one of two forms: - purchases by the government agency itself of educational resources to be used by educational institutions (e.g. direct payments of teachers\u2019 salaries by a central or regional education ministry); - payments by the government agency to educational institutions that have responsibility for purchasing educational resources themselves (e.g. a government appropriation or block grant to a university, which the university then uses to compensate staff and to buy other resources).

        "Lifelong training and education offer an important opportunity for individuals to maintain or improve their skills situation. Education, vocational training and lifelong learning play a vital role in the economic and social strategy of Europe. The European Council has adopted strategic goals and objectives for education and training to be attained by 2010. Training is often less regular and formalised than education and particularly difficult to map in statistical terms. Lifelong learning refers to the proportion of persons aged 25 to 64 who stated that they received education or training in the four weeks preceding the (EU labour force) survey. The information collected relates to all education or training subjects whether or not relevant to the respondent\u2019s current or possible future job; note however that formal (official and non- official programmes) and informal education and training are covered, but self-learning activities are excluded. 68 LIFELONG LEARNING 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 EU-27 Euro area SE (1) DK UK (2) FI NL SI AT ES LU BE (2) DE IE FR CY LV (2) EE IT CZ MT LT (2) PL (2) SK HU PT EL BG RO TR NO Figure 2.15: Lifelong learning - excluding self-learning activities, 2006 (% of population aged 25 to 64 participating in education and training) (1) Data for 2005.

        "The European employment strategy (EES) was launched at the Luxembourg Jobs Summit in November 1997 and was evaluated in 2002, when it was revamped to align employment strategy more closely to the Lisbon objectives. The European Union has set itself an ambitious target of a 70 % total employment rate by 2010, while in the spring of 2001 an employment rate target for persons aged between 55 and 64 years of 50 % was added. The total employment rate is calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 15 to 64 in employment by the total population of the same age group. The employed population consists of those persons who, during the reference week of the (EU labour force) survey, did any work for pay or profit for at least one hour, or were not working but had jobs from which they were temporarily absent; the data include family workers. Employment rates are generally higher among persons having achieved higher levels of education, and lower among older workers: the employment rate of older workers is calculated by restricting the population to persons aged 55 to 64.

Unemployed persons comprise those aged between 15 and 74 who were without work during the reference week of the labour force survey. Persons without work are those who had neither a job, nor were at work (for one hour or more during the reference week) in paid employment or self-employment; in addition, the unemployed have to be available for work and actively seeking work. Note that the final chapter at the end of this publication presents regional data for unemployment rates. The duration of unemployment is defined as the duration of a search for a job, or as the period since the last job was held (if this period is shorter than the duration of the search for a job). The long term unemployment rate is the proportion of active persons in the labour market, who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. 74 UNEMPLOYMENT 0246 Total Male Female 2001 2006 Figure 2.18: Harmonised long-term unemployment rates, EU-27 (persons unemployed for 12 months or more as a % of the total labour force) Source: Eurostat (tsisc061, tsisc063 and tsisc062) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 2 Chapter 2 Population and social conditions ch02.qxp 21/12/2007 10:03 Page 74 ",

        "Two indicators have been selected to illustrate this issue. The job vacancy rate (JVR) measures the percentage of total posts that are vacant. This is based on the ratio of the number of job vacancies to the total number of posts, where the latter is composed of the number of occupied posts plus the number of job vacancies. A job vacancy is defined as a post (newly created, unoccupied or about to become vacant): - for which the employer is taking active steps to find a suitable candidate from outside the enterprise concerned and is prepared to take more steps; and - which the employer intends to fill either immediately or in the near future. A job vacancy should be open to candidates from outside the recruiting enterprise, however, this does not exclude the possibility of the employer appointing an internal candidate to the post. A vacant post that is open only to internal candidates should not be treated as a job vacancy. An occupied post is a post within an organisation to which an employee has been assigned. Information on the average exit age gives the average age at which active persons definitively withdraw from the labour market. It is based on a probability model considering the relative changes of activity rates from one year to another at a specific age. The activity rate represents the labour force (employed and unemployed population) as a percentage of the total population for a given age. 76 Figure 2.19: Job vacancy rate (%) Source: Eurostat (jvs_q) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 2 Chapter 2 Population and social conditions LABOUR MARKET DEMAND 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 2003 2004 2005 2006 EU-25 Euro area ch02.qxp 21/12/2007 10:03 Page 76 ",

Source: Eurostat (lfsi_emp_a) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 2 Chapter 2 Population and social conditions Labour market flexibility may be seen as a way of encouraging employers to increase employment and to increase participation in the labour force. The indicators presented here are all derived from the EU labour force survey, and cover persons aged 15 to 64. Persons with temporary contracts are those who declare themselves as having a fixed term employment contract or a job which will terminate if certain objective criteria are met, such as completion of an assignment or return of the employee who was temporarily replaced. This can be contrasted with those in permanent or unlimited employment, for whom no fixed end date is foreseen. The share of temporary employees is shown as a percentage of all employees. In the labour force survey, the distinction between full-time and part-time employment is left to the respondent, since working hours differ from one Member State to the next and between economic activities. The indicator on persons with a second job refers only to persons with more than one job at the same time, and consequently, persons having changed job during the reference period of the labour force survey are not covered.

        "The structure and evolution of earnings are important features of any labour market, reflecting labour supply from individuals and labour demand by firms. Earnings, productivity, profits and consumption are all inter-related and may be leading determinants of economic growth and employment performance. The gender pay gap in unadjusted form is defined as the difference between average gross hourly earnings of male and female paid employees, and is shown as a percentage of men\u2019s earnings. Some of the underlying factors that may in part explain gender pay gaps include sectoral and occupational segregation, education and training, awareness and transparency: the European Union seeks to promote equal opportunities implying progressive elimination of the gender pay gap. Gross earnings are remuneration (wages and salaries) in cash paid directly to an employee, before any deductions for income tax and social security contributions paid by employees. Data is presented for full-time employees in industry and services. Data on minimum wages are transmitted by national ministries responsible for areas such as social affairs, labour or employment. Minimum wages are fixed hourly or monthly rates that are determined by governments. They are enforced by law and usually apply nationwide to all full-time employees. Note that minimum wages are gross amounts, before deductions for income tax or social security; hence, care should be taken when making any comparisons across countries. Note that not all countries have a minimum wage. 80 0 10 20 30 EE CY SK DE FI UK CZ DK NL AT LV BG SE LT LU ES RO FR HU PL IE EL IT PT SI BE MT EU-27 Figure 2.21: Gender pay gap, 2005 (%) Source: Eurostat (tsiem030) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 2 Chapter 2 Population and social conditions EARNINGS AND MINIMUM WAGES ch02.qxp 21/12/2007 10:04 Page 80 ",

        "The transition from gross to net earnings takes into account income taxes, employee\u2019s social security contributions and, if appropriate, family allowances. The amount of these components and therefore the ratio of net to gross earnings depend on the individual situation. A number of different family situations are considered, all referring to an average worker (AW). Differences exist with respect to marital status, number of workers, number of dependent children, and level of gross earnings, expressed as percentage of the earnings of an AW. The tax wedge on labour costs is defined as income tax plus the employee and the employer\u2019s social security contributions, expressed as a percentage of the total labour costs (gross earnings plus the employer\u2019s social security contributions plus payroll taxes where applicable). This indicator is for single persons without children, earning 67 % of the earnings of an AW. The unemployment trap measures the percentage of gross earnings which is taxed away through higher tax and social security contributions and the withdrawal of unemployment and other benefits when an unemployed person returns to employment. This indicator is available for single persons without children, earning 67 % of the earnings of an AW when in work. The low wage trap measures the percentage of gross earnings which is taxed away through the combined effects of income taxes, social security contributions and any withdrawal of benefits when gross earnings increase from 33 % to 67 % of the earnings of an AW. This indicator is available for single persons without children, and also for one-earner couples with two children. 82 0 25 50 75 100 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Unemployment trap Low wage trap - one earner couple with two children Low wage trap - single person without children Tax wedge on labour cost Figure 2.22: Tax rate on low wage earners, EU-25 (%) Source: Eurostat (tsiem041, tsiem042, tsiem043 and tsiem044) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 2 Chapter 2 Population and social conditions LOW WAGE EARNERS ch02.qxp 21/12/2007 10:04 Page 82 ",

        "Consumer policy within the European Union is based on three key objectives: a high common level of consumer protection; effective enforcement of consumer protection rules; proper involvement of consumer organisations in European Union policies. The safety of consumer products is covered by a wide range of sectoral legislation, while consumer interests are also safeguarded by legislation on unfair commercial practices, misleading advertising, price indications, the conformity of goods, distance selling, doorstep selling, and e-commerce. Statistics on the final consumption expenditure of households cover expenditure incurred on goods or services that are used for the satisfaction of individual needs. Consumption expenditure covers the purchase of goods and services, the consumption of own production (such as garden produce), as well as the imputed rent of owner-occupied dwellings. The data on consumption expenditure may be broken down according to the classification of individual consumption according to purpose (COICOP), which identifies 12 different headings at its most aggregated level. Housing, energy costs, transport, and food and non-alcoholic beverages account for a high proportion of expenditure made by European households. The indicators presented here include data expressed in PPS (see page 14 for a definition of PPS) which eliminates differences in price levels between countries. 84 0 5 10 15 20 25 Housing, water, elec., gas & other fuels Transport Food & non-alcoholic beverages Miscellaneous goods & services Recreation and culture Restaurants and hotels Furnish., household equip. & maintenance Clothing & footwear Alcoholic beverages, tobacco Health Communications Education Figure 2.23: Breakdown of household consumption expenditure, EU-25, 2005 (% of total household consumption expenditure) Source: Eurostat (tps00079 to tps00090) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 2 Chapter 2 Population and social conditions HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE ch02.qxp 21/12/2007 10:05 Page 84 ",

        "While comparisons of standards of living are frequently based on GDP per capita, such figures say little about the distribution of wealth and income among private households. For the purpose of poverty indicators, the national median equivalised disposable income is calculated from the total disposable income of each household (income received by all members of a household) divided by the equivalised household size whereby weights are assigned to each member of the household (1.0 to the first adult, 0.5 to other persons aged 14 or over, and 0.3 to each child aged less than 14). The at-risk-of-poverty rate is defined as the proportion of persons with an equivalised income that is below the threshold of 60 % of the national median disposable income. This rate may be expressed before or after social transfers, with the difference measuring the hypothetical impact of national social transfers in reducing poverty. Retirement and survivor\u2019s pensions are counted as income before transfers and not as social transfers. The S80/S20 income quintile share ratio is a measure of the inequality of income distribution and is calculated as the ratio of total income received by the 20 % of the population with the highest income 86 Figure 2.24: Persons at-risk-of-poverty, 2005 (% of total population) (1) (1) Source: EU-SILC, income data for 2004, except for Ireland (moving income reference period, 2004-2005) and the United Kingdom (2005).

        "Social protection systems are highly developed in the European Union: they are designed to protect people against the risks associated with unemployment, parental responsibilities, ill health and invalidity, the loss of a spouse or parent (survivors), old age, housing and social exclusion. The model used in each Member State is somewhat different and some social protection benefits are provided by private social protection schemes, although they continue to be financed by government (at least partially). Data on expenditure and receipts of social protection are drawn up according to the European system of integrated social protection statistics (ESSPROS) methodology (for more details and definitions, see the publication \u2018ESSPROS Manual 1996\u2019, available from the Eurostat website (catalogue number: CA-99-96--641)). This system has been designed to allow a comparison of social protection flows between Member States. Note that besides transfers in cash or in kind, total expenditure on social protection also includes other costs associated with running the services, such as administration, management and payment of property income. Expenditure on care for the elderly concerns social protection expenditure devoted to old age care, covering care allowance, accommodation, and assistance in carrying out daily tasks and other benefits in kind. The old-age-dependency ratio is the ratio between the total number of elderly persons of an age when they are generally economically inactive (aged 65 and over) and the number of persons of working age (from 15 to 64). 88 Old age 41.4% Social exclusion n.e.c. 1.5% Sickness / health care 28.3% Disability 8.1% Family / children 7.8% Unemployment 6.5% Survivors 4.5% Housing 2.0% Figure 2.25: Expenditure on social protection, EU-25, 2004 (% share of total benefits) (1) (1) Figures do not sum to 100 % due to rounding.

These statistics show developments for economic activities (through short-term business statistics, compiled with monthly, quarterly and annual frequencies), or structural aspects (through structural business statistics, compiled with an annual frequency). In addition information is provided on production statistics, and also on tourism. The information presented in the opening pages of this chapter is based upon short-term business statistics. The index of turnover shows the evolution of the market for goods and services in terms of the sales made. The index is not deflated, and so its objective is to measure market activity in value terms. Turnover includes all invoiced duties and taxes on the goods or services with the exception of the VAT invoiced to customers and other similar deductible taxes directly linked to turnover. Turnover also includes all other charges (transport, packaging, etc.) passed on to the customer, even if these charges are listed separately in the invoice. 92 GROWING AND DECLINING ACTIVITIES Figure 3.1: Fastest growing service activities, average annual growth rate of turnover, EU-27, 2001-2006 (%) (1) (1) Working day adjusted series; estimates for 2006.

        "In order to improve the timeliness of the monthly and quarterly economic statistics, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission announced the principal European economic indicators (PEEIs) in the spring of 2003. This set of indicators, of which there are eight short-term business indicators, are given the utmost priority in terms of timely collection, compilation, harmonised methodologies, dissemination and quality. Among the PEEIs for the industrial economy are the index of production and the index of domestic output prices. The industrial production index shows changes in output and activity within industry. It aims to show volume changes in value added. In practice, proxies are used for the compilation of the index, such as deflated turnover or production values, the physical quantity of production, or occasionally the level of labour, raw material or energy inputs. Domestic industrial output price indices (sometimes also known as industrial producer price indices) show the development of transaction prices across industrial activities. Output prices may be used as an early indication of inflationary pressures within an economy, as may import price indices for which an index is currently being developed for the European Union. Industrial output price increases/decreases are separated according to the destination of the product, between domestic and non-domestic markets, as determined by the residency of the third party that has ordered or purchased the product. Furthermore, within the non- domestic market a distinction between euro area and non-euro area markets may be made. 94 SHORT-TERM STATISTICS FOR INDUSTRY 90 100 110 120 130 May-97 May-99 May-01 May-03 May-05 May-07 Domestic output price index Production index Figure 3.3: Production and domestic output price indices, total industry (excluding construction), EU-27 (2000=100) (1) (1) Trend-cycle series for the index of production; gross series for the index of domestic output prices.

        "As with the index of production for industrial activities (shown on the previous page), the construction production index also aims to show volume changes in value added; it is also one of the PEEIs. The index for construction may be split into an index for building and an index for civil engineering, according to the classification of types of construction (CC). Buildings are sub-divided into residential buildings (in other words buildings at least half of which are used for residential purposes) and non-residential buildings. Civil engineering works are all constructions not classified under buildings: for example, railways, roads, bridges, highways, airport runways, dams. It is particularly difficult to compile a production index for construction, given that it is difficult to measure output in physical quantities, as almost every project is unique in terms of the building being constructed and the site being used; equally it is difficult to obtain reliable output prices to use as a deflator in the event that output is measured in value terms. Because of this, a wide variety of approaches are used in different countries, including the use of hours worked as a proxy. 96 SHORT-TERM STATISTICS FOR CONSTRUCTION 90 95 100 105 110 115 Apr-97 Apr-99 Apr-01 Apr-03 Apr-05 Apr-07 Building Construction Civil engineering Figure 3.4: Index of production, construction, EU-27 (2000=100) (1) (1) Trend-cycle series; construction from 01-2007 onwards: estimates; building and civil engineering for 04-2007: estimates.

        "Retailing covers the resale without transformation of new and used goods to the general public for personal or household use and consumption. Various distinctions can be made, for example between non-specialised and specialised retailers, between food and non-food retailers, in-store and other retailers (retailing in markets, door-to-door or remote selling for example), and between new and second hand goods. Turnover indices for retail trade are compiled in both value and volume terms. The volume measure is more commonly referred to as the index of the volume of (retail) sales, which eliminates price effects. This indicator is also one of the PEEIs. Retail trade has a particular importance because of its role as an interface between producers and final customers, and because of this retail sales turnover and volume of sales indices can be used as a short-term indicator for final domestic demand by households. 98 SHORT-TERM STATISTICS FOR RETAIL TRADE 90 100 110 120 130 May-98 May-00 May-02 May-04 May-06 Retail trade Food, beverages and tobacco Textiles, clothing, footwear & leather goods in specialised stores Household equipment in specialised stores Books, newspapers and other sales in specialised stores Figure 3.5: Volume of sales index, selected retail trade activities, EU-27 (2000=100) (1) (1) Trend-cycle series; all values from March 2007 onwards, except for retail sales of food, beverages and tobacco: estimates.

        "The contribution of services to the European economy grows almost every year, and it is important that official statistics are able to provide information on this growing area. The knowledge- based economy and the demand for intangibles, either for consumption or investment purposes, as well as international outsourcing, has led to a major restructuring of many European economies, with a shift away from industrial activities towards services activities. This weightlessness that is inherent to many sectors of the economy provides new opportunities and with it competition both nationally and internationally. Traditionally, business statistics were concentrated on industrial and construction activities, and to a lesser extent distributive trades and service. Since the early 1990s major developments in official statistics within the European Union have seen data collection efforts focus more on services. The index of turnover for other services (also a PEEI) shows the evolution of sales in value terms. Note that prices for some services have actually been falling, perhaps due to market liberalisation and increased competition (for example, telecommunications and other technology-related activities). In such cases, the rapid growth rates observed for turnover value indices for some activities would be even greater in volume terms. 100 SHORT-TERM STATISTICS FOR OTHER SERVICES Figure 3.6: Index of turnover, selected service activities, EU-25 (2000=100) (1) (1) Trend-cycle series; from 10-2006 onwards: estimates.

SBS covers the \u2018business economy\u2019, which includes industry, construction and market services (NACE Sections C to K). Note that financial services (NACE Section J) are kept separate because of their specific nature and the limited availability of most types of standard business statistics in this area. SBS does not cover agriculture, forestry and fishing, nor public administration and (largely) non-market services such as education and health. SBS describe the economy through the observation of units engaged in an economic activity, which in SBS is generally the enterprise. An enterprise carries out one or more activities at one or more locations and may comprise one or more legal units. Note that enterprises that are active in more than one economic activity (and the value added and turnover they generate and the persons they employ, etc.) will be classified under the NACE heading (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) which is their principal activity, normally the one that generates the largest amount of value added.

An enterprise birth amounts to the creation of a combination of production factors with the restriction that no other enterprises are involved in the event. Births do not include entries into the population due to mergers, break-ups, split-off or restructuring of a set of enterprises. A birth occurs when an enterprise starts from scratch and actually starts activity. The birth rate is the number of births relative to the stock of active enterprises. Gross value added at factor cost can be calculated from turnover, plus capitalised production, plus other operating income, plus or minus the changes in stocks, minus the purchases of goods and services, minus other taxes on products which are linked to turnover but not deductible, minus the duties and taxes linked to production. As such it corresponds to operating output net of the cost of operating materials and services consumed. Value added at factor costs is calculated gross, as value adjustments (such as depreciation) are not subtracted.

        "Average personnel costs are defined as personnel costs divided by the number of employees, with the result usually expressed in terms of thousand euro per employee. Personnel costs are the total remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable by an employer to an employee in return for work done by the latter during the reference period. All remuneration paid during the reference period is included, regardless of whether it is paid on the basis of working time, output or piecework. Included are all gratuities, workplace and performance bonuses, ex gratia payments, 13th month pay (and similar fixed bonuses), payments made to employees in consideration of dismissal, lodging, transport, cost of living and family allowances, commissions, attendance fees, overtime, night work, etc., as well as taxes, social security contributions and other amounts owed by the employees and retained at source by the employers. Also included are the social security costs for the employer. Payments for agency workers are not included in personnel costs. Employees are persons who work for an employer and who have a contract of employment and receive compensation in the form of wages, salaries, fees, gratuities, piecework pay or remuneration in kind. The agreement between employer and employee may be formal or informal. A worker from a temporary employment agency is considered to be an employee of the temporary employment agency and not of the unit (customer) in which they work. The number of employees includes part-time workers, seasonal workers, persons on strike or on short-term leave, but excludes those persons on long-term leave. The number of employees is calculated as the number of jobs and is measured as an annual average. 106 PERSONNEL COSTS 0 10 20 30 40 Electricity, gas and water supply Transport, storage and communication Manufacturing Real estate, renting and business activities Construction Mining and quarrying Distributive trades Hotels and restaurants Figure 3.9: Average personnel costs, EU-27, 2004 (EUR 1 000 per employee) (1) (1) Includes rounded estimates based on non-confidential data.

        "The gross operating rate is one measure of profitability, which is a key factor for competitiveness and enterprise success. The gross operating rate is the gross operating surplus divided by turnover; the result is expressed as a percentage. The gross operating surplus measures the operating revenue that is left to compensate the capital factor input, after the labour factor input has been recompensed, and therefore can be simply calculated from value added at factor cost less personnel costs. The surplus is used to recompense the providers of own funds and debt, to pay taxes, and eventually for self-financing all or a part of investment. See page 104 for the definition of turnover. Although not always the case, the gross operating surplus will generally be higher for capital-intensive activities and lower for those activities which have a relatively high proportion of their costs accounted for by personnel costs. Equally the gross operating rate will be low for those activities with a distributive nature as such activities have very high turnover: this is the case for some energy supply activities, for retail and own-account wholesale trade, and some other specific services such as reselling of advertising space and the services of travel agents. 108 PROFITABILITY 0 10 20 30 Mining and quarrying Real estate, renting and business activities Transport, storage and communication Electricity, gas and water supply Hotels and restaurants Construction Manufacturing Distributive trades Figure 3.11: Gross operating rate, EU-27, 2004 (%) (1) (1) Includes rounded estimates based on non-confidential data; gross operating rate: gross operating surplus / turnover.

        "Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are often referred to as the backbone of the European economy, providing a potential source for jobs and economic growth. Structural business statistics with a breakdown by size-class is the main source of data for an analysis of SMEs. Size can be measured in a number of ways, the most commonly used for structural business statistics being the number of persons employed. Less than one enterprise in 400 within the European Union\u2019s non-financial business economy employs 250 or more persons (and is therefore considered as large), but these enterprises account for one third of employment and more than two fifths of value added. Nevertheless, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs, with less than 250 persons employed) generate the majority of value added and employ most of the workforce in the non- financial business economy. Micro enterprises (those with less than 10 persons employed) in particular play an important role, providing employment to nearly as many persons as do large enterprises. Note that gross value added and the number of persons employed are defined on pages 103 and 104. 110 ENTERPRISE SIZE-CLASSES Medium-sized 17.8% Small 18.8% Micro 20.2% Large 43.1% Figure 3.13: Value added and employment, breakdown by enterprise size-class, non-financial business economy, EU-27, 2004 (%) (1) (1) Includes rounded estimates based on non-confidential data; figures do not sum to 100 % due to rounding; micro enterprises: 1-9 persons employed; small enterprises: 10-49 persons employed; medium-sized enterprises: 50-249 persons employed; large enterprises: 250 or more persons employed.

        "Productivity is a key measure of economic efficiency, showing how effectively economic inputs are converted into output. Apparent labour productivity is defined as the value added generated by each person employed (measured by headcounts); the result is usually expressed in terms of thousand euro per person employed. Due to the use of head counts this measure does not consider differences in the extent of part-time work across activities. Part- time (and seasonal) employment typically occurs in several non- financial services, such as hotels and restaurants, retail trade, and certain business services. Size-class data may also be used to study the relative productivity of enterprises, with productivity (perhaps resulting from scale economies) often increasing by enterprise size. Consequently, in the majority of activities, large enterprises tend to account for a higher proportion of the total value added generated than their respective share of the number of persons employed. 112 LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY BY SECTOR AND ENTERPRISE SIZE-CLASS 0 50 100 150 200 NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESS ECONOMY Manufacturing Electricity, gas and water supply Construction Distributive trades Hotels and restaurants Transport, storage and communication Real estate, renting and business activities Micro enterprises (1-9 persons employed) Small enterprises (10-49 persons employed) Medium-sized enterprises (50-249 persons employed) Large enterprises (250 or more persons employed) 250 300 Figure 3.15: Labour productivity by enterprise size-class, EU-27, 2004 (EUR 1 000 per person employed) (1) (1) Includes rounded estimates based on non-confidential data; mining and quarrying: not available.

        "Tourism grew rapidly in the latter part of the 20th century. However, this trend was briefly reversed from 2001 as concerns over terrorism attacks, health and safety epidemics, and natural disasters played a role in diminishing demand. The Internet has become an important factor within this area of the economy, as consumers increasingly make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation, often driven by significant discounts or alternatively by the opportunity to view a range of options for travel, accommodation and related activities before booking. A tourist is defined as a visitor who stays at least one night in collective or private accommodation. A night spent is defined as each night that a guest is registered to stay in a hotel or similar establishment. A breakdown of the nights spent in hotels is provided for residents and non-residents, the former are identified as having lived for most of the past year in a country/place, or having lived in that country/place for a shorter period and intending to return within a year to live there.

Approximately half of the European Union\u2019s land is farmed, highlighting the importance of agriculture in society. Utilised agricultural area (UAA) is defined as the area taken up by arable land, permanent grassland, permanent crops, and kitchen gardens - it does not include wooded areas or forests. Permanent crops are those not grown in rotation, occupying the soil for a long period and yielding harvests over several years, for example orchards or vineyards. Permanent grassland is land used (for five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops; it is usually used for grazing or mowed for silage or hay. Arable land is worked regularly, generally under a system of crop rotation, normally with annual crops like cereals; this category also includes temporary grassland (<5 years), melons and strawberries, seedlings, and crops under glass or cover. Wooded area is land with tree crown cover of more than 5 % where trees reach a height of at least 5 metres at maturity, or where tree crown cover is over 10 % (irrespective of height). 118 LAND USE IN AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 EU-25 IE LT LV BG RO ES HU EE DK FR FI PL AT SK PT SE CZ EL UK LU IT SI CY DE BE NL MT Figure 4.1: Utilised agricultural area per inhabitant, 2006 (hectares per inhabitant) (1) (1) Ireland, France, Italy, Latvia and Sweden: data for 2005; EU-25 and the United Kingdom: data for 2003.

In order to correct for this, agricultural employment is also measured in terms of Annual Work Units (AWU) \u2013 which measure the equivalent of the work of one person employed full-time over a 12-month period (7) . The volume of agricultural labour input (including the non regular labour force) was 9.8 million AWU. The average volume of labour input per person in the EU-27 was equal to half of a full-time equivalent. The most important contribution to labour input on farms (8) was provided by the holder and his/her family; as seven out of eight persons working within agriculture could be attributed to the family labour force. Nearly one third of the family labour force (holders, their spouses and other family members) in the EU-27 had another gainful activity, besides working on the agricultural holding. Where another gainful activity is performed, this activity is usually the principal one. Having another gainful activity was more frequent among the population aged less than 54 years old. 120 FARM LABOUR FORCE Figure 4.2: Agricultural labour force, EU-27, 2005 (million) (1) Persons: not available.

        "Successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have simplified rules and re-aligned farm support such that it targets areas of consumer concern, and agricultural production that focuses on meeting quality, environmental and food safety guarantees. The principal crops grown on arable land are cereals. Due to policies encouraging the use of renewable energy, cereals, but mainly oilseed crops (such as rape), are more frequently grown and then subsequently fed into bio energy production. As consequence, a noticeable increase in the production of these oilseed crops (especially rape) has taken place. The quantity of milk is relatively stable because of the milk quota system. Rising milk yield per cow is therefore associated with a decreasing overall cattle herd. The downward trend in cattle and sheep numbers is also partly due to the decoupling of support payments. Pig numbers fell in 2004 but subsequently rose in 2005 and 2006 \u2013 although this pattern could end, as a result of increasing costs for feedstuffs. Crop production figures relate to harvested production; milk production covers production on the farm of milk from cows, ewes, goats and buffaloes; data on animals concerns the population of animals at the year\u2019s end (December). 122 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 05 10 15 20 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Rape Sunflower Figure 4.3: Evolution of production of rape and sunflower, EU-27 (million tonnes) Source: Eurostat (tag00104 and tag00109) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 4 Chapter 4 Agriculture, forestry and fisheries ch04.qxp 21/12/2007 10:09 Page 122 ",

        "The output of agricultural activity includes output sold (including trade in agricultural goods and services between agricultural units), changes in stocks, output for own final use (own final consumption and own-account gross fixed capital formation), output produced for further processing by agricultural producers, as well as intra-unit consumption of livestock feed products. The output of the agricultural industry is made up of the sum of the output of agricultural products and of the goods and services produced in inseparable non-agricultural secondary activities. Intermediate consumption represents the value of all goods and services used as inputs in the production process, excluding fixed assets whose consumption is recorded as fixed capital consumption. Gross value added equals the value of output less the value of intermediate consumption, and is shown here measured at producer prices (the producer price excludes subsidies less taxes on products).

        "In a Communication from 2006 (9) , the European Commission adopted a list of 28 agri-environmental indicators to be maintained and further developed which will: provide information on the farmed environment; track the impact of agriculture on the environment; assess the impact of agricultural and environmental policies on the environmental management of farms; inform agricultural and environmental policy discussions; illustrate agri- environmental relationships to the wider public. Organic farming can be defined as a method of production which places emphasis on environmental protection and, with regard to livestock production, animal welfare considerations. It avoids or largely reduces the use of synthetic chemical inputs such as fertilisers, pesticides, additives and medicinal products. The Council Regulation (EC) N\u00b0 834/2007 defines in detail the requirements for agricultural products or foodstuffs bearing a reference to organic production methods. It notably defines a method of agricultural production for crops and livestock, and regulates the labelling, 126 AGRI-ENVIRONMENT AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 EU-25 FI FR UK DE NL RO AT DK LU SE CZ PT LV EE IT CY PL HU IE MT BE SI ES SK BG EL LT Figure 4.5: Agricultural holdings with another gainful activity than agricultural production, 2005 (% of all holdings) Source: Eurostat (tag00096) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 4 Chapter 4 Agriculture, forestry and fisheries (9) Development of agri-environmental indicators for monitoring the integration of environmental concerns into the Common Agricultural Policy, COM(2006) 508 final; for more information: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2006/com2006_0508en01.pdf. ch04.qxp 21/12/2007 10:09 Page 126 ",

About 60 % of wooded land is under private ownership. Total roundwood production (or removals), comprises all quantities of wood removed from the forest and other wooded land. This volume measure is reported in cubic metres underbark (in other words, excluding bark). Total sawnwood production is that produced either by sawing lengthways or by a profile-chipping process, whereby the wood exceeds 6 mm in thickness.

It was introduced in 1983 and can be divided into four main areas: the conservation of stocks; structures (such as vessels, port facilities and fish processing plants); the organisation of the market for fish in the European Union; and external fisheries policy. To ensure sustainable fishing, it is not only the quantity of fish taken from the sea that is important, but also their species, size, and the techniques used in catching them, as well as the areas where they are caught. This may be extended to more general protection of marine ecosystems, avoiding pollution and other forms of environmental damage. Restructuring within the fisheries sector has led to the European Union\u2019s fleet capacity declining, as quotas have been imposed to ensure a better balance between the number of vessels and fish. This has often resulted in a loss of employment in coastal areas which in many cases may face limited employment opportunities. The total annual catch of fishery products is measured in terms of the catch from all oceans and internal waters of the world; data are expressed in the live weight equivalent of the landings (in other words, as taken from the water, before processing). The total power of the fishing fleet is expressed in kilowatts; data generally refer to the fleet size on 31 December of each reference year. Data on trade in fishery products include edible fishery products (fish, crustaceans and molluscs), inedible products (meals, oils and fats as well as sponges, corals, etc.) and aquatic plants.

These data are extensively used for multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations, to define and implement anti-dumping policies, and to evaluate the progress of the Single Market. It is important to note that there are two main sources for statistics on international trade. On the one hand, there is external trade statistics (ETS) which provide information on trade in goods, collected on the basis of customs and VAT declarations. ETS provide detailed information on the value and volumes of international trade in goods per commodity. On the other hand, there is the Balance of Payments (BoP), which registers all the transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The current account of the BoP provides information not only on international trade in goods (generally the largest category), but also on international transactions in services, income and current transfers. For all these transactions BoP registers the value of exports (credits) and imports (debits), the difference of which is usually referred to as the balance. A negative balance, that is a current account deficit, shows that a country is spending more abroad than it is earning from abroad and is therefore a net debtor towards the rest of the world. Trade integration of goods and services is the average value of debits and credits (summed together and divided by two) given relative to GDP. This indicator is calculated for both goods and services, based on BoP data; if the values increase over time, then the reporting territory became more integrated within the international economy. It is normal that smaller countries will display a higher recourse to international trade, as they are more likely to import a range of goods and services that are not produced within the domestic market.

        "Balance of Payment statistics are of particular interest for analysing the services economy, as external trade statistics only cover goods. The provision of services tends to contribute an increasing share of the economic wealth of the European Union, and accounts for more than 50 % of GDP in each Member State. Nevertheless, the value of exports and imports of goods is approximately three times higher than that of services. Part of this imbalance may be due to the nature of some services: for example, the provision of services of proximity or alternatively professional services that are bound by distinct national legislation, making it difficult to trade many services across borders. Due to their intangible nature, trade in services is more difficult to record than trade in goods, with difficulties associated with defining the service, its value, and the flows associated with each service; as such, there may be some elements of under-reporting in the statistics that are presented. The three main categories that may be identified within the services account include transportation, travel, and other services (essentially other business services, financial services and royalties and license fees). 134 INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN SERVICES Figure 5.2: International trade in services, EU-27, 2006 (EUR 1 000 million) (1) (1) Provisional values; extra-EU trade flows.

        "International trade in goods forms an increasing part of the world economy, with globalisation extending its influence and with growth in a number of rapidly developing economies, notably the well documented cases of China and India, but also some of the New Independent States (the States of the former Soviet Union, excluding the Baltic States), particularly those where indigenous energy supplies are of particular importance. Extra-EU trade statistics cover the trading of goods with non- member countries, whereas trade between Member States is usually referred to as intra-EU trade. Note that an important distinction is usually made when reporting data for the European Union, insofar as external trade data is usually provided in relation to extra-EU trade only. As such, the data presented for the EU-27 treats this as a single trading block, and reports exports from the whole of the EU-27 to the rest of the world and imports from the rest of the world into the EU-27. In contrast, when reporting data for individual European Union Member States, world trade includes both intra-EU and extra-EU flows. The statistics for exported goods are recorded at their free-on- board (fob) value, which is their market value at the customs frontier of the exporting economy, including charges made for insurance and transport services up to the frontier. Import values are usually presented in terms of cost, insurance, freight (cif). All values are generally provided excluding import duties or other Community taxes. 136 WORLD MARKET FOR GOODS Exports Others 47.2% EU-27 18.0% United States 12.1% China (excl.

        "The United States accounts for a little less than one quarter of the EU-27\u2019s exports of goods, a share that has fallen somewhat in recent years; note that between 2001 and 2006 the value of EU-27 exports to the Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and China more than doubled. For imports, the trading partner is the country of origin. The traditional position of the United States as the principal origin of EU-27 imports and of Japan in the top 3 is no longer the case. The value of imports from the United States and from Japan has fallen (between 2001 and 2006), while imports from China, India and a number of natural resource rich countries have increased. As a result, in 2006, China overtook the United States as the single largest supplier of goods to the EU-27. 138 MAIN EU TRADING PARTNERS EU-27 exports Rest of the world 49.3% United States 23.2% Switzer- land 7.5% Russian Feder- ation 6.3% China (excl.

One of the most common classifications for studying aggregate product statistics is the standard international trade classification of the United Nations (SITC Rev. 3); this classification allows a comparison to be made on a worldwide basis. Imports are defined as goods which enter the statistical territory of the European Union from a third country and are placed under the customs procedure for free circulation (as a general rule goods intended for consumption), inward processing or processing under customs control (goods for working, processing) immediately or after bonded warehousing; while exports are goods which leave the statistical territory of the European Union for a third country after being placed under the customs procedure for exports (definitive export) or outward processing (goods for working, processing) or following inward processing. A positive balance of trade is known as a trade surplus and consists of exporting more (in terms of value) than one imports. On the contrary, a negative balance of trade is known as a trade deficit and consists of importing more than one exports. Neither is necessarily damaging in a modern economy, although large trade surpluses or trade deficits may sometimes be a sign of other economic problems. Overall the EU-27 tends to register a negative trade balance, particularly due to trade deficits for fuels (mineral oil and lubricants) and other raw materials.

        "Intra-EU trade statistics report trade between European Union Member States. Whereas extra-EU trade statistics are required for a common trade and customs policy, intra-EU trade statistics measure the integration of the Member States in a common single market. Note that countries that are near the centre of Europe are more likely to have a higher proportion of intra-EU trade than countries that are geographically on the periphery of the European Union. Intra-EU trade generally accounts for the majority of trade flows recorded for the Member States, although Dutch intra-EU imports were slightly less than extra-EU imports in 2006. Intra-EU trade statistics are collected directly from trade operators as a result of customs controls being abolished between the borders of the Member States during the creation of the single market. 142 TRADE IN GOODS BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES Figure 5.6: Intra-EU-27 trade, 2006 (% of total trade) Source: Eurostat (ext_lt_intratrd) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 5 Chapter 5 International trade 0 25 50 75 100 Average for Member States LU SK CZ NL HU PL PT BE AT LV ES DK RO CY SI EE FR IE DE LT EL UK IT SE BG FI MT Arrivals Dispatches ch05.qxp 21/12/2007 10:12 Page 142 ",

Source: European Commission, Directorate-General for Energy and Transport, Energy and Transport in Figures, 2006 Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 6 Chapter 6 Transport Transport is defined as any movement of passengers and/or goods (freight). Increased trade, both within the single European market and outside, have driven rapid growth in road and maritime freight transport services. Each mode of transport has its own particular advantages in relation to a set of criteria covering issues such as capacity, speed, cost, safety, flexibility, energy consumption, and environmental impact. European transport policy aims to create a transport system that allows each mode of transport to play a role in a developing transport infrastructure, resulting in more efficient, cost effective and sustainable transport solutions. For the purpose of statistical comparisons between different modes of transport, standardised units are often used for measuring freight (in tonne-kilometres, which represent the movement of one tonne over a distance of one kilometre) and passenger (passenger- kilometres, which represent one passenger travelling a distance of one kilometre) transport volumes. The indicators of transport volumes shown in Figure 6.1 show the real change in inland transport: road, rail and inland waterways for freight; passenger cars, buses, coaches, and trains for passengers. The indicators are based on the ratio of the transport volumes to GDP in constant prices (1995 prices), and this is expressed as an index with 1995=100. Rail and inland waterways freight transport are based on movements on national territory, regardless of the nationality of the vehicle or vessel. Road freight transport is based on all movements of vehicles registered in the reporting country. For passenger transport all data should be based on movements on the national territory, regardless of the nationality of the vehicle, however, data collection methodology is not harmonised across the European Union.

Source: Eurostat (road_go_ta_to) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 6 Chapter 6 Transport The growth in the use of road networks has often outpaced the speed with which new, or improved, roads have been built. This has resulted in increased congestion, particularly evident around and within Europe\u2019s major conurbations. Although motorways constitute only a small part of the entire road network within the European Union, their length has more than tripled over the last 30 years. Considering only inland transport, there has been considerable growth in road freight transport, accompanied by a slower increase in the volume of goods transport by railway. As such the volume of freight transported by road in the European Union (EU-25) is more than four times as high as the volume transported by railway. More than two thirds of the volume of road freight transport by vehicles registered in European Union Member States is national, although this proportion varies greatly between Member States depending on the geography of the country, with small land-locked Luxembourg specialised in international transport contrasting with the national transport dominated island of Cyprus. For air and sea transport the indicators provided in Table 6.2 are presented in tonnes (loaded/unloaded), rather than tonne- kilometres. The European Union relies heavily on maritime transport for trade, in particular that relating to bulky, low value goods that cannot be transported economically using other transport modes, with most of the international trade passing through one of the major sea ports. The weight of freight (and mail) transported by air is low, although generally the average value of air freight is high. GOODS TRANSPORT ch06.qxp 21/12/2007 10:17 Page 146 ",

        "There has been substantial increase in the use of air transport in recent years. Some of this may be attributed to the deregulation of air transport markets, which resulted in increased competition and the development of low-cost air carriers. As a result, it is now relatively common for many Europeans to take several holidays within the same year and to visit a number of countries, often for short breaks. Alongside the environmental impact of air transport and the construction/expansion of airports, one of the main concerns for the development of air transport networks is the capacity of the system, which in many cases has reached saturation, resulting in congestion for travellers (delayed flights and overloaded air traffic control systems. The information on the number of air passengers refers to the total number of passengers, therefore both arrivals and departures. To avoid double counting the figures for the Member States only count passengers on domestic flights once, while the figure for the EU-25 only counts passengers on intra-EU flights once. The information presented for sea passengers covers passengers using seagoing vessels on voyages which are undertaken wholly or partly at sea. Service staff are not regarded as passengers, nor are non-fare paying crew members, or infants in arms. Passengers are counted both inward and outward, regardless of destination. 148 AIR AND SEA PASSENGER TRANSPORT 0 25 50 75 Milano Malpensa (IT) Kobenhavn Kastrup (DK) Palma de Mallorca (ES) London Stansted (UK) Manchester Ringway International (UK) Paris Orly (FR) Barcelona Transoceanico (ES) Munchen F.J.

Note that the transformation of energy, for example, electricity generation in thermal power plants from coal or oil is not considered as primary production. Solid fuels cover fossil fuels such as hard coal, lignite, and peat. Primary production of crude oil covers all production within national boundaries, including offshore production. Natural gas is measured as the dry marketable production, after purification and extraction of NGLs (natural gas liquids) and sulphur; it does not include quantities re-injected, extraction losses, or quantities vented and flared. The heat produced in a reactor as a result of nuclear fission is regarded as primary production of nuclear heat, in other words nuclear energy. Renewable energy sources cover the production of energy from biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind and solar energy. PRODUCTION OF PRIMARY ENERGY ch07.qxp 21/12/2007 10:13 Page 150 ",

A sustainable energy policy is in part reliant upon increasing the share of renewable energy, which may at the same time help improve the security of energy supply by reducing the Community\u2019s growing dependence on imported energy sources. Renewable energy sources are expected to be economically competitive with conventional energy sources in the medium to long term. The proportion of electricity from renewable energy measures the contribution of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in relation to national electricity consumption, which comprises total gross national electricity generation from all fuels, plus electricity imports, minus electricity exports. Renewable energy sources include renewable non-fossil energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydro-power and energy from renewable biomass/wastes. The latter refers to electricity generated from the combustion of wood and wood wastes, other solid wastes, biogas (including landfill, sewage, and farm gas) and liquid biofuels.

Dependency on energy imports (see overleaf) has increased from 40 % of gross consumption in the 1980s to over 50 % in the EU-27 today. Increased globalisation and rising living standards are likely to result in higher demand for energy, for use in freight and passenger transportation, as well as to heat homes and power household appliances. Despite increased production from nuclear energy and renewable sources, this increased consumption has coincided with an overall fall in primary production, in particular of hard coal and lignite and of crude oil. Naturally the result of increased consumption and reduced production has been increased net imports. A shift in the energy mix, notably an increase in the consumption of natural gas particularly for electricity generation, has lead to particularly large increases in net imports of natural gas. Whilst energy production may be expected to continue to fall, particularly for fossil fuels as reserves are depleted, notably in the North Sea, net imports can be expected to rise further. To constrain this increased dependency on imports, production of other sources would need to increase, in combination with a reduction in energy use. In 2006 the European Commission proposed an energy efficiency action plan to save 20 % of the European Union\u2019s energy consumption by 2020. ENERGY IMPORTS ch07.qxp 21/12/2007 10:14 Page 154 ",

It may be defined as primary production plus imports, recovered products and stock changes, less exports and fuel supply to maritime bunkers (for seagoing ships of all flags). It therefore reflects the energy necessary to satisfy inland consumption within the limits of national territory. In 1997 a target was set to increase the share of renewable energies in gross energy consumption to 12 % by 2010 within the European Union. In 2007 a new target was set for renewable energy to contribute 20 % of the energy mix by 2020. The energy dependency rate is defined as net imports divided by gross consumption, expressed a percentage; gross consumption is equal to gross inland consumption plus the energy (oil) supplied to international marine bunkers. A negative dependency rate indicates a net exporter of energy. A dependency rate in excess of 100 % indicates that energy products have been stocked. Energy intensity may be measured as the ratio between gross inland consumption of energy and gross domestic product (GDP) at constant prices (1995). The ratio is expressed as kgoe (kilogram of oil equivalent) per thousand euro. Note that if an economy becomes more efficient in its use of energy, and its GDP remains constant, then the ratio for this indicator should fall. However, the economic structure of an economy plays an important role in determining the intensity, as post-industrial economies with large service sectors will, a priori, display low levels of energy intensity, while developing economies may have a considerable proportion of their economic activity within industrial sectors, thus leading to a higher value for the indicator.

There has been a shift in fuels used for electricity generation: among the main sources natural gas has increased at the expense of coal, lignite and oil due to lower emissions from gas, and there has been an increase in the use of renewables, particularly wind turbines. The indicator of electricity from renewable energy sources is the ratio between the electricity produced from renewable energy sources and the gross national electricity consumption. Electricity produced from renewable energy sources comprises the electricity generation from hydro plants (excluding pumping), wind, solar, geothermal and electricity from biomass/wastes. Gross national electricity consumption comprises the total gross national electricity generation from all fuels (including autoproduction), plus electricity imports, minus exports. The European Parliament and Council set indicative targets in 2001 for the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources, whereby 22 % of the EU-15\u2019s gross electricity consumption should be electricity produced from renewables by 2010; the target for the EU-25 and the EU-27 is 21 %. These targets also represent an important contribution towards complying with the commitments made by the European Union under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (see page 164 for more information). Final consumption of electricity covers the electricity delivered to the final consumer\u2019s door (in the industry, transport, household and other sectors) for all energy uses. It excludes deliveries for transformation and/or own use of the energy producing industries, as well as network losses.

Final energy consumption by transport covers the consumption of energy products in all types of transportation: rail, road, international and domestic air transport and inland navigation/coastal shipping, but excluding maritime shipping. Energy consumption for transportation has grown strongly in recent years. In 2007 a minimum target that biofuels should account for 10 % of transport petrol and diesel by 2020 was set. Per capita energy consumption varies greatly between Member States reflecting in particular economic development and consumption patterns, the degree of industrialisation (and the industrial structure), and climatic conditions. The particularly high energy consumption per capita recorded in Luxembourg can in part be explained by petrol purchases by residents of neighbouring countries and drivers of road freight transporters in transit, and also by its industrial structure.

Source: European Commission, Directorate General for Transport and Energy (http://ec.europa.eu/energy/oil/bulletin/index_en.htm) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 7 Chapter 7 Energy and environment A competitive and reliable energy sector is an essential part of an industrialised economy. The energy sector has been highlighted recently due to concerns over the security of supply caused by instabilities in the Middle East, disputes over pipelines for delivery, or adverse weather conditions that affect refinery output. With rapid growth in demand for fossil fuels from several developing countries, imbalances arose between supply and demand, leading to pressure on prices. This was most evident for oil prices which have risen strongly since the end of 2002, the effects of which were evident in higher prices for industry and consumers. As oil and gas (the price of which is related to that for oil) are among the main fuels used to generate electricity, there were also knock on effects on electricity prices. Some protection against such price increases can be achieved through diversification, particularly for electricity generation, for example from renewable energy sources or nuclear power; changing the product mix to avoid reliance on any one type of energy or any single country as a supplier. The indicators shown for transport fuels are the average at the pump prices for consumers, for unleaded petrol (Euro-super 95) and automotive diesel. Electricity and gas tariffs vary from one supplier to another. They may be the result of negotiated contracts, especially for large industrial consumers. For smaller consumers they are generally set according to the amount of electricity or gas consumed, and a number of other characteristics that vary from one country to another. Tariffs also generally include fixed charges. Therefore, there is no single price for electricity or gas in any European Union country. In order to compare prices over time and between countries, two \u2019standard consumers\u2019 are presented, one representing domestic consumers and one industrial consumer. The actual price paid by real consumers will differ from these. All electricity price data are given in euro per kWh (excluding taxes) and correspond to prices applicable on 1 January of the reference year, a similar set of criteria are used for gas prices, except the unit changes to euro per GJ.

For its part, the European Union agreed to an 8 % reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions, with reductions for the EU-15 Member States agreed under the so-called burden sharing agreement, which allows some countries to increase their emissions, provided these are offset by reductions in other Member States. In 2007 the objective of a 20 % reduction (relative to 1990) by 2020 was set, with the objective of a 30 % reduction in the same timescale put forward as the European Union\u2019s contribution to a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012. Emissions of the six greenhouse gases covered by the Protocol are weighted by their global warming potentials (GWPs) and aggregated to give total emissions in CO 2 equivalents. The total emissions are presented as indices, which were set to 100 for the Kyoto base year. The index of greenhouse gas emissions therefore shows trends in emissions of the Kyoto basket of six gases.

Source: Eurostat (ten00012) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 7 Chapter 7 Energy and environment Freshwater resources are renewed through natural processes (the hydrological cycle), whereby, depending on the country\u2019s climatic conditions, approximately two thirds of the precipitation (rain, hail and snow) falling on land returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration; the remainder recharges groundwater, lakes, streams and rivers. Statistics on water resources are usually calculated on the basis of long-term annual averages of at least 20 years, to take account of the fluctuations in rainfall and evaporation/transpiration from one year to the next. Evapotranspiration is the volume of water that is transported from the ground (including inland water surfaces \u2013 streams, rivers, freshwater lakes and glaciers) into the atmosphere by evaporation or by transpiration of plants. The internal flow is the volume of river run-off and groundwater recharge derived from precipitation; in other words, precipitation less evapotranspiration. External inflow is the volume of inflow derived from rivers and groundwater that originate in a neighbouring territory. The sum of these two categories is called freshwater resources, which refers to the volume of water resulting from internal flow and external inflow. Outflow is the volume of water that flows from rivers and groundwater into the sea and into neighbouring territories. The total additional freshwater resources available are calculated as the sum of internal and external flows. The proportion of the population that is connected to public water supplies is defined as the share of the total population which is served by (public or private) economic units with piped water of (usually) drinking water quality. Figure 7.10 shows the extent of household\u2019s connection to the public water supply (PWS) network. Although the data set is incomplete, in all available Member States except Romania, the proportion of households connected to the PWS was close to or in excess of three quarters, and in many Member States the proportion exceeded 90 %.

There are three broad types of urban waste water treatment that are distinguished when collecting statistical information in this area: primary, secondary and tertiary water treatment. Primary treatment of waste water involves physical or chemical processes (such as sedimentation) in which the biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids are reduced by at least 20 % and 50 % respectively. Secondary treatment generally involves biological treatment, with a secondary settlement procedure that should result in a BOD removal of at least 70 % and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of at least 75 %. Tertiary treatment goes a stage further and removes nitrogen and/or phosphorous and/or any other pollutants affecting the quality of the water.

In some circumstances there may be statutory requirements on a producer to dispose of waste in a certain manner, for example, when waste materials are toxic. The construction industry is by far the most important waste generating activity. Municipal waste is part of the total waste stream; it consists of waste collected by or on behalf of municipal authorities and disposed of through the waste management system. Waste generated by households is an important part of municipal waste, but depending on the national waste management system it can also include part of the waste generated by commerce, offices and public institutions. For areas not covered by a municipal waste scheme, an estimation has been made of the amount of waste generated. The quantity of waste generated is expressed in kg per person per year. Wastes which are considered particularly dangerous for man and the environment have been classified as hazardous waste. Specific rules are established for the collection, handling and recycling of this type of waste. GENERATION OF WASTE ch07.qxp 21/12/2007 10:15 Page 172 ",

Treatment of municipal waste can be classified into three principal categories: - landfill, which is defined as the depositing of waste into or onto land, including specially engineered landfill, and temporary storage of over one year on permanent sites; - incineration, which refers to the thermal treatment of waste in a specifically designed plant, and; - recycling, which is a reprocessing of waste in a production process which diverts it from the waste stream. The disposal of waste can have a serious environmental impact: for example, landfill takes up land space, and may cause air, water and soil pollution. Incineration can also result in emissions of dangerous air pollutants, unless properly regulated.

Note that activities which may be beneficial to the environment, but that primarily satisfy technical needs, or health and safety requirements, are excluded. Environmental protection expenditure may be classified according to the economic sector (agriculture, industry, services, public sector, and households) carrying out the expenditure, according to a financial breakdown of the expenditure (treatment and prevention investment, current expenditure, subsidies) or according to the environmental domain covered (air, waste, water, etc. - of which nine areas are distinguished in the single European standard statistical classification of environmental protection activities (CEPA)). Specialised producers are public or private businesses that provide environmental services, such as waste or waste water management. Non-core expenditure consists of administrative costs such as labour costs associated with running environmental departments or government funded agencies. Organisations participating in the EU eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) are committed to evaluate and improve their own environmental performance, comply with relevant environmental legislation, prevent pollution, and provide relevant information to the public. The Community eco-label is awarded to products and services with reduced environmental impacts. The existing scheme has been in operation since 1993.

Protected areas for biodiversity are based on areas proposed by countries under the Habitats Directive. The indicator shown in Figure 7.15 reflects the share of the total area of a country that is considered as protected areas. The indicators concerning fish catches relate to the catches of a number of fish stocks that have been assessed to be outside safe biological limits. In general terms, it is considered that a stock is within safe biological limits if its current biomass is above the value corresponding to a precautionary approach advocated by the international council for the exploration of the sea (ICES). Further details on the way ICES formulates advice in precautionary terms can be obtained from the ICES website http://www.ices.dk. The population index of farm birds is an aggregated index of population trend estimates of a selected group of breeding bird species dependent on agricultural land for nesting or breeding. It is indexed on the year 1990. Indices are calculated for each species independently and are then combined using an unweighted geometric mean. Aggregated European Union indices are calculated using population-dependent weighting factors for each country and species. BIODIVERSITY ch07.qxp 21/12/2007 10:15 Page 178 ",

Source: Eurostat (tsiir043 and tsiir042) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 8 Chapter 8 Science and technology The European Commission has placed renewed emphasis on the conversion of Europe\u2019s scientific expertise into marketable products and services, while also focusing on improving the mobility of European researchers, encouraging networks between researchers from different Member States, and promoting R&D as an occupation for women. The indicator on tertiary graduates in science and technology includes new graduates from all institutions completing graduate and post graduate studies in science and technology fields, and is calculated as a percentage of all graduates. Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems, and in the management of the projects concerned. The data on the number of researchers are presented in the form of head-counts and therefore do not take account of the differences that may exist between countries with respect to the propensity to employ researchers on a part-time basis. The indicator of human resources in science and technology (HRST) is shown as a share of the economically active population in the age group 25-64. HRST is defined as persons having either successfully completed tertiary education in an S&T field of study, or employed in an occupation where such an education is normally required. The term PhD is defined as general tertiary programs which lead to the award of an advanced research degree, e.g. a doctor in economics. The programs are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-work only. They usually require 3-5 years of research and course work, generally after a Master\u2019s degree. In that sense, indicators on the number of PhD students provide an idea of the extent to which countries will have researchers at the highest level. The number of PhD graduates is measured by graduates from ISCED level 6 education. The number of graduates refers to new graduates in the reference year, not the total number available in the labour market in that year. HUMAN RESOURCES ch08.qxp 21/12/2007 10:18 Page 180 ",

        "Research and development (R&D) lies at the heart of the European Union\u2019s strategy to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010. Indeed, one of the goals set in Lisbon was for the European Union to increase its R&D expenditure to at least 3 % of GDP by 2010. In December 2006 the seventh framework programme of the European Community for research and technological development for the period 2007 to 2013 (FP7) was established, to be applied from January 2007. FP7 will be implemented through specific programmes corresponding to the main themes of European research policy. The European Commission has been active in establishing a European Research Area (ERA), which is designed to overcome some of the barriers that are thought to have hampered European research efforts, for example, by addressing geographical, institutional, disciplinary and sectoral boundaries. Research and development is defined as comprising creative work undertaken on a systematic basis to increase the stock of knowledge (of man, culture and society) and the use of this stock to devise new applications. Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (often referred to as GERD) is composed of four separate sectors of performance: business enterprises, government, higher education, and private non-profit organisations. Expenditure data consider the research spend on the national territory, regardless of the source of funds; data are usually expressed in relation to GDP, otherwise known as R&D intensity. 182 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE 01 2 34 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 JP (1) US (2) EU-27 (3) Figure 8.2: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) (% of GDP) (1) Break in series for 1996.

Source: Eurostat (tsc00010) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 8 Chapter 8 Science and technology Patents reflect a country\u2019s inventive activity and also show its capacity to exploit knowledge and translate it into potential economic gains. In this context, indicators based on patent statistics are widely used to assess the inventive and innovative performance of a country. Patents are used to protect R&D results, but they are also significant as a source of technical information, which may prevent re-inventing and re-developing ideas because of a lack of information. The use of patents is relatively restricted within the European Union - this may be for a number of reasons including relative cost, the overlap between national and European procedures and the need for translation into foreign languages. Official statistics on patents are provided to Eurostat by the European Patent Office (EPO). From 2006 the main raw data source is the new international Patent Database PATSTAT held by the EPO and developed in cooperation with the WIPO, the OECD and Eurostat. European patent applications refer to applications filed directly under the European Patent Convention or to applications filed under the Patent Co-operation Treaty and designated to the EPO (Euro-PCT), regardless of whether the patents are granted or not. Applications are assigned to a country according to the inventor\u2019s place of residence, using fractional counting if there are multiple inventors to avoid double counting. To normalise the data, the total number of applications at the EPO is also divided by the population and expressed as applications per million. PATENTS ch08.qxp 21/12/2007 10:19 Page 186 ",

        "For the purpose of the community innovation survey (CIS) an innovation is a new or significantly improved product (good or service) introduced to the market or the introduction within an enterprise of a new or significantly improved process. Innovations are based on the results of new technological developments, new combinations of existing technology or the utilisation of other knowledge acquired by the enterprise. Innovations may be developed by the innovating enterprise or by another enterprise. However, purely selling innovations wholly produced and developed by other enterprises is not included as an innovation activity, nor is introducing products with purely aesthetic changes. Innovations should be new to the enterprise concerned: for product innovations they do not necessarily have to be new to the market and for process innovations the enterprise does not necessarily have to be the first one to have introduced the process. Enterprises with innovation activity include all types of innovator, namely product innovators, process innovators, as well as enterprises with only on-going and/or abandoned innovation activities. The proportion of enterprises with innovation activity may also be referred to as the propensity to innovate. Enterprises may cooperate with other parties (for example suppliers, competitors, customers, educational/research establishments) when engaging in an innovative activity. 188 INNOVATION Figure 8.5: Enterprises engaged in innovation activity, 2004 (% of all enterprises) Source: Eurostat (inn_cis4_prod) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 8 Chapter 8 Science and technology 0 20 40 60 80 DE AT LU IE IS DK BE SE EE CY FI UK PT CZ NO IT EL ES NL FR LT SI PL SK HU MT RO LV BG EU-27 ch08.qxp 21/12/2007 10:19 Page 188 ",

        "The i2010 initiative (European information society in 2010) seeks to promote modern public services and a dynamic environment for e-business through widespread availability of broadband access at competitive prices. The policy covers regulation, research, deployment, and promoting cultural diversity. Its main objective is to ensure that Europe\u2019s citizens, businesses and governments make the best use of information and communication technologies (ICT), in order to improve competitiveness, support growth and create jobs, as well as addressing key societal challenges. At the heart of the policy is a desire to ensure that social and geographical differences are overcome, thus creating an inclusive digital society that provides opportunities for all. For the indicators presented here households are defined as having at least one member in the age group 16 to 74 years old. Internet access refers to whether anyone in the household could use the Internet at home, if desired, even if just to send an e-mail. The most commonly used technologies to access the Internet are divided between broadband and dial-up access. Broadband includes digital subscriber lines (DSL) and uses technology that transports data at high speeds. A dial-up access using a modem can be made over a normal or an ISDN telephone line, often referred to as narrowband. 190 INTERNET ACCESS OF HOUSEHOLDS 0 20 40 60 Total Densely-populated area (at least 500 inhabitants/square kilometre) Intermediate urbanised area (between 100 and 499 inhabitants/square kilometre) Sparsely populated area (less than 100 inhabitants/square kilometre) 2005 2006 2007 Figure 8.6: Internet access for households, breakdown by degree of urbanisation, EU-25 (% having access to the Internet at home) Source: Eurostat (tsiir031 and isoc_ci_in_h) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 8 Chapter 8 Science and technology ch08.qxp 21/12/2007 10:19 Page 190 ",

        "While information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become available to a wider public, in terms of accessibility and cost, there remains a gap between users and non-users, often referred to as the \u2019digital divide\u2019. This divide may be attributed to a number of factors, including a lack of infrastructure (particularly in remote, rural areas), or a lack of computer literacy/skills that may be necessary to take part in the information society, or a lack of awareness or interest in what the information society can offer. To benchmark ICT-driven developments, Eurostat has established annual information society surveys on ICT use in enterprises and in households/by individuals. These surveys initially concentrated on access and connectivity, however, their scope has subsequently been extended to cover a variety of socio-economic breakdowns, so that regional diversity, gender specificity, age and educational differences can also be studied. For the indicators presented a computer is defined as a personal computer, powered by one of the major operating systems (Windows, Mac OS or Linux); handheld computers or palmtops (PDAs) are also included. The ordering of goods and services includes confirmed reservations for accommodation, purchasing financial investments, participation in lotteries and betting, Internet auctions, as well as information services from the Internet that are directly paid for. Goods and services that are obtained via the Internet for free are excluded. Orders made by manually written e-mails should be excluded. 192 ICT USE OF INDIVIDUALS 0 25 50 75 100 At home At place of work (other than home) At neighbours, friends or relative's house At place of education At other places (e.g. airport, hotel, etc.) Figure 8.7: Place of Internet use, EU-27, 2007 (% of individuals who accessed the Internet during the last 3 months) (1) (1) The categories presented are not mutually exclusive.

Orders received via manually typed e-mails are excluded. The year given relates to the survey year, whereas e-commerce data relates to the year prior to the survey. The population (size and activity) coverage is the same as for the Internet access statistics on the previous page. The indicator of turnover (sales) from e-commerce is shown as a percentage of the total turnover. The percentage of enterprises purchasing online rises among larger enterprises, which may be due to their investment in more advanced networks and their more frequent purchases, which promote the use of systems such as EDI, often linked to logistical and stock control. Equally, in nearly all Member States with data available, a larger proportion of enterprises have made purchases online than have received orders online, reflecting the greater complexity of handling orders received online than making purchases. 196 E-COMMERCE 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 Enterprise turnover from e-commerce Enterprises having purchased online (2) Enterprises having received orders online (2) Figure 8.9: E-commerce among enterprises, EU-27, 2007 (% of total) (1) (1) Covers all enterprises with 10 or more persons employed; enterprises have their main activity in NACE Sections D, F, G, H (Groups 55.1 and 55.2 only), I, K and O (Groups 92.1 and 92.2 only).

        "The indicator of online availability of public services shows the percentage of 20 selected basic services which are fully available online, in other words for which it is possible to carry out full electronic case handling. However, only relevant services within a country are considered for the calculation of the ratio. Measurement is based on a sample of URLs of public websites agreed with Member States as relevant for each service. The indicators of usage of e-government services are based on the household/individuals and enterprise surveys of ICT usage, and therefore have the coverage defined on pages 190 (households) and 194 (enterprises). The indicators for the individuals are based on usage during the three months prior to the survey, and concern interaction with public authorities, i.e. having used the Internet for one or more of the following activities: obtaining information from public authorities' websites, downloading official forms, submitting completed forms. 198 E-GOVERNMENT Figure 8.10: E-government online availability, 2007 (% of online availability of 20 basic public services) Source: Eurostat (tsiir100) Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 8 Chapter 8 Science and technology 0 25 50 75 100 AT MT PT SI UK SE DE EE ES FR IT FI DK NL BE CZ IE HU EL CY LU LT RO SK LV PL BG ch08.qxp 21/12/2007 10:20 Page 198 ",

        "The European telecommunications sector was historically characterised by public service, monopoly providers, often run in conjunction with postal services. Liberalisation moves began in the first half of the 1980s and, at first, concerned value added services or business users, while basic services were left in the hands of monopoly providers. By 1998, telecommunications were, in principle, fully liberalised across all of the then Member States. The indicator of mobile subscriptions shows subscriptions to public cellular mobile telecommunication systems and also includes active pre-paid cards. Note that an increasing number of people have multiple mobile subscriptions (for example, for private and work use). SMS messages are short-message services, traditionally sent between mobile phones but now also to and from a range of other SMS enabled devices and through online web services. The telecommunications prices are all based on the price (including VAT) in euro of a 10 minute call at 11 am on a weekday in August, based on normal rates. Three markets are presented, namely a local call (3km), a national call (200km) and an international call (to the United States). 200 TELECOMMUNICATIONS 0 50 100 150 200 LU LT IT CZ PT UK EE AT CY IE NL FI DK SE ES DE EL HU SI BE SK LV MT BG FR PL RO 0 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 CY DK LT IE MT CZ PT FI PL EL BE ES SK DE SI SE FR UK AT NL HU EE RO BG LU Figure 8.11: Mobile phone subscriptions and the use of SMS, 2005 (1) Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom: data are sourced from ITU.

        "The indicator of total turnover in value terms is based on sales from all telecommunication services, including leased lines, fixed network services, cellular mobile telecommunication services, interconnection services, and Internet service provisions. In the majority of Member States (with data available) turnover from mobile services exceeds that from fixed network services. Although overall expenditure on telephony has increased, the proportion accounted for by ex-monopoly providers has generally been reduced, as fixed-line voice operations have shrunk, while new entrants in mobile and data service providers have captured much of the growth experienced within the telecommunications sector. The two indicators presented here on market share refer to mobile telecommunications and fixed-line long-distance telecommunications. The market share of the leading mobile operator is calculated on the basis of the estimates of the number of mobile subscribers. The market share of the incumbent is defined as the enterprise active in the market just before liberalisation and the market share is calculated on the basis of retail revenues. A long distance call is a call from one local network to another. 202 TELECOMMUNICATIONS - TURNOVER AND MARKET SHARE 0 25 50 75 100 BE CZDK DE EE IE EL ES FR IT CY LV LT LU HUMT NL AT PL PT SI SK FI SE UK Share of the leading operator in mobile telecommunication, 2006 Share of the incumbent in fixed telecommunications: long distance calls, 2005 Figure 8.12: Market shares, telecommunication (% of total market) (1) (1) Bulgaria and Romania: not available; Denmark, Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden: not available for fixed telecommunications.

        "Regional statistics cover a broad range of statistical areas, with information on, for example, demography, migration, employment and unemployment, education, health, agriculture, energy, industry, trade and services, tourism, transport, research and development and regional accounts. The concepts and definitions used are as close as possible to those used for the production of data at a national level. Regional statistics are used for a wide range of purposes, including the allocation of structural funds which aim to foster economic and social cohesion in the European Union. In this context, regional data are used as an objective base for selecting regions eligible for funding, and for ex-post analysis of the effects of European structural policies. To classify regional data, territorial units are grouped together according to the NUTS classification system. This is a hierarchical classification, which subdivides each Member State into a number of regions at different levels. The NUTS regions are in general administrative units, reflecting the remit of local or regional authorities within a particular territory. This chapter presents the latest regional information available at the NUTS 2 level for a selection of key socio-economic indicators, as well as a national indicator summarising difference in regional employment rates. Population density - the ratio of mid-year population, as defined by the number of inhabitants, to the given area of a territory, expressed in terms of the number of inhabitants per square kilometre. Population growth - the difference in population between two reference periods; equal to the sum of natural increase (births - deaths) and net migration (immigration - emigration); the information presented is an average annual growth rate for the period 2000 to 2005. GDP per inhabitant - national currency GDP levels are converted into a common currency using exchange rates (purchasing power parities) that reflect the purchasing power of each currency; GDP per inhabitant in a common currency, the purchasing power standard (PPS), therefore eliminates differences in price levels between countries, as well as allowing a comparison between economies of different absolute sizes. 204 REGIONAL STATISTICS - BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition 9 Chapter 9 Europe\u2019s regions ch09.qxp 21/12/2007 10:22 Page 204 ",
        "Disposable income per inhabitant - income received, in the form of wages, operating surplus, rent, interest, dividends and social benefits, from which are deducted taxes, social security contributions and other current transfers; data are derived from household accounts and are presented in the common currency of the purchasing power consumption standard (PPCS) per inhabitant. Employment rate (%) - calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 15 to 64 in employment by the total population of the same age group; the employed population consists of those persons who during the reference week did any work for pay or profit for at least one hour, or were not working but had jobs from which they were temporarily absent. Unemployment rate (%) - unemployed persons comprise those aged 15 to 74 who were without work during the reference week, who were available for work, and who were actively seeking work (which involves having been in contact with a public employment office to find work, having been in contact with a private agency (temporary work agency, firm specialising in recruitment to find work), or applying directly to employers to find work). Dispersion of regional employment rates - this indicator shows the regional differences in employment rates (see above) within countries and groups of countries. The dispersion of regional employment rates is zero when the employment rates in all regions are identical, and it will rise if there is an increase in the differences between employment rates among regions. The indicator is not applicable for Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta or Slovenia as these Member States comprise only one or two NUTS level 2 regions.

        "STRUCTURAL INDICATORS During the Lisbon European Council of March 2000, the Heads of State of the European Union agreed to set a strategic goal for the next decade \u2019of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\u2019. Structural indicators (SI) are used to underpin the Commission\u2019s analysis in an annual progress report to the European Council on the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. In 2005, the European Commission presented a new approach to the Lisbon strategy, focusing in particular on growth and jobs. The list of structural indicators covers six broad domains under the following headings: general economic background, employment, innovation and research, economic reform, social cohesion, and the environment. More information regarding structural indicators may be found on Eurostat\u2019s website at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ structuralindicators. Alternatively, for further information, contact Eurostat\u2019s structural indicators co-ordination team, at: estat- structuralindicators@ec.europa.eu. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS The European Union\u2019s Sustainable Development Strategy, adopted by the European Council in Gothenburg in June 2001, and renewed in June 2006, aims to continuously improve quality of life, both for current and for future generations, through reconciling economic development, social cohesion and protection of the environment. A set of sustainable development indicators has been developed to monitor progress in the implementation of the sustainable development strategy. The indicators are organised under ten different themes that reflect different political priorities: socio-economic development, sustainable consumption and production, social inclusion, demographic changes, public health, climate change and energy, sustainable transport, natural resources, global partnership, and good governance. More information regarding sustainable development indicators may be found on Eurostat\u2019s website at: http://ec.europa.eu/ eurostat/sustainabledevelopment.

A more complete listing of each classification may be obtained on the Eurostat website, by accessing the RAMON classifications server at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon. COICOP Classification of individual consumption according to purpose (COICOP). This is used to classify the purpose of individual consumption expenditures incurred by three institutional sectors, namely households, non-profit institutions serving households and general government. Below is an extract of those COICOP headings that have been used in this publication. 01 Food and non-alcoholic beverages The food products classified here are those purchased for consumption at home. The group excludes: food products sold for immediate consumption away from the home by hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars, kiosks, street vendors, automatic vending machines, etc., cooked dishes prepared by restaurants for consumption off their premises, and cooked dishes prepared by catering contractors whether collected by the customer or delivered to the customer\u2019s home (11.1.1); and products sold specifically as pet foods (09.3.4). The non-alcoholic beverages classified here are those purchased for consumption at home. The group excludes non-alcoholic beverages sold for immediate consumption away from the home by hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars, kiosks, street vendors, automatic vending machines, etc. (11.1.1). 02 Alcoholic beverages, tobacco The alcoholic beverages classified here are those purchased for consumption at home. The group excludes alcoholic beverages sold for immediate consumption away from the home by hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars, kiosks, street vendors, automatic vending machines, etc. (11.1.1). The beverages classified here include low or non-alcoholic beverages which are generally alcoholic such as non-alcoholic beer. 03 Clothing and footwear Clothing includes clothing materials, garments, other articles of clothing and clothing accessories, cleaning, repair and hire of clothing. Footwear includes shoes and other footwear including repair and hire of footwear. 04 Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels Actual rentals for housing, actual rentals paid by tenants including other actual rentals, maintenance and repair of the dwelling, water supply and miscellaneous services relating to the dwelling, electricity, gas and other fuels. 226 Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition CLASSIFICATIONS Annex ch10_Annex.qxp 21/12/2007 10:25 Page 226 ",

It does not include expenditures on educational materials, such as books (09.5.1) and stationery (09.5.4), or education support services, such as healthcare services (06), transport services (07.3), catering services (11.1.2) and accommodation services (11.2.0). It includes education by radio or television broadcasting. The breakdown of educational services is based upon the level categories of the 1997 international standard classification of education (ISCED) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). 11 Restaurants and hotels Catering services, accommodation services. 12 Miscellaneous goods and services Personal care, electric appliances for personal care and other appliances, articles and products for personal care, personal effects n.e.c., social protection, insurance, financial services n.e.c., other services n.e.c. 227 Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition Annex ch10_Annex.qxp 21/12/2007 10:25 Page 227 ",
        "ISCED This classification is designed to serve as an instrument suitable for assembling, compiling and presenting comparable indicators and statistics of education. LEVEL 0 - Pre-primary education Programmes at level 0 (pre-primary), defined as the initial stage of organised instruction, are designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment, i.e. to provide a bridge between the home and a school-based atmosphere. LEVEL 1 - Primary education or first stage of basic education Programmes at level 1 are normally designed on a unit or project basis to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing and mathematics along with an elementary understanding of other subjects such as history, geography, natural science, social science, art and music. In some cases religious instruction is featured. The core at this level consists of education provided for children, the customary or legal age of entrance being not younger than five years or older than seven years. This level covers in principle six years of full-time schooling. Throughout this level the programmes are organised in units or projects rather than by subjects. LEVEL 2 - Lower secondary or second stage of basic education The contents of education at this stage are typically designed to complete the provision of basic education which began at ISCED level 1. In many, if not most countries, the educational aim is to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development. The programmes at this level are usually on a more subject-oriented pattern using more specialised teachers and more often several teachers conducting classes in their field of specialisation. The end of this level often coincides with the end of compulsory education. LEVEL 3 - (Upper) secondary education This level of education typically begins at the end of full-time compulsory education for those countries that have a system of compulsory education. More specialisation may be observed at this level than at ISCED level 2 and often teachers need to be more qualified or specialised than for ISCED level 2.The entrance age to this level is typically 15 or 16 years. The educational programmes included at this level typically require the completion of some 9 years of full-time education (since the beginning of level 1) for admission or a combination of education and vocational or technical experience and with as minimum entrance requirements the completion of level 2 or demonstrable ability to handle programmes at this level. 228 Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition Annex ch10_Annex.qxp 21/12/2007 10:25 Page 228 ",
        "LEVEL 4 - Post-secondary non-tertiary education ISCED 4 captures programmes that straddle the boundary between upper-secondary and post-secondary education from an international point of view, even though they might clearly be considered as upper-secondary or post-secondary programmes in a national context. ISCED 4 programmes can, considering their content, not be regarded as tertiary programmes. They are often not significantly more advanced than programmes at ISCED 3 but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed a programme at level 3. Typical examples are programmes designed to prepare students for studies at level 5 who, although having completed ISCED level 3, did not follow a curriculum which would allow entry to level 5, i.e. pre-degree foundation courses or short vocational programmes. LEVEL 5 - First stage of tertiary education (not leading directly to an advanced research qualification) This level consists of tertiary programmes having an educational content more advanced than those offered at levels 3 and 4. All degrees and qualifications are cross-classified by type of programmes, position in national degree or qualification structures and cumulative duration at tertiary. LEVEL 6 - Second stage of tertiary education (leading to an advanced research qualification) This level is reserved for tertiary programmes which lead to the award of an advanced research qualification. The programmes are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-work only. 229 Key figures on Europe \u2013 2007/08 edition Annex ch10_Annex.qxp 21/12/2007 10:25 Page 229 ",
        "NACE The statistical classification of economic activities in the European Communities (NACE) is the classification that is used for the bulk of the information collected for business statistics; the classification currently in use is NACE Rev.1.1. During 2007 and 2008 major changes to all international classifications of activities have taken place or are planned, including ISIC (under the auspices of the United Nations), NAICS (the North American industry classification), and JSIC (the Japanese classification). Within Europe, Eurostat has worked together with National Statistical Institutes, other Directorate-Generals of the European Commission and business and trade associations, towards finalising the structure for NACE Rev. 2, which is consistent with ISIC Rev.4. One of the most important changes, apart from this increase in international comparability of data, is the introduction of a new section in the classification to cover information and communications, as well as changes to reflect the growing importance of service activities. Below is an extract of the NACE Rev. 1.1 headings that have been used in this publication. Section C: Mining and quarrying Subsection CA: Mining and quarrying of energy producing materials Subsection CB: Mining and quarrying, except of energy producing materials Section D: Manufacturing Subsection DA: Manufacture of food products, beverages and tobacco Subsection DB: Manufacture of textiles and textile products Subsection DC: Manufacture of leather and leather products Subsection DD: Manufacture of wood and wood products Subsection DE: Manufacture of pulp, paper and paper products; publishing and printing Subsection DF: Manufacture of coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel Subsection DG: Manufacture of chemicals, chemical products and man-made fibres Subsection DH: Manufacture of rubber and plastic products Subsection DI: Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products Subsection DJ: Manufacture of basic metals and fabricated metal products Subsection DK: Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c. Subsection DL: Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment Subsection DM: Manufacture of transport equipment Subsection DN: Manufacturing n.e.c.
