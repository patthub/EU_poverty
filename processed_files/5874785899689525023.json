        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 6 A. I NTRODUCTION This report constitutes deliverable 6 of the study entitled \u201cFeasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefits Scheme\u201d commissioned by DG EMPL and carried out by a Consortium led by CEPS. The objective of this deliverable is to examine different possible options for the scope and design of a European Unemployment Benefits Scheme (EUBS henceforth). To this end, the report provides a thorough analysis of the 18 policy options and their main features. Two types of EUBS are distinguished throughout this report: equivalent and genuine schemes (representing 4 and 14 out of the 18 options respectively). For both types, a thorough analysis of the features of the different options is performed. This analysis draws heavily on the related literature, simulations exercises as well as other work that is being done for the project. This report is structured as follows. The second section comprises a general presentation of the 18 policy options. The section clarifies the difference between equivalent and genuine schemes and points out the key features through which both types, and the different options within these types, can be differentiated. The third section presents a comparison of the options with the schemes in other federations, inside and outside the EU. The fourth section of the report constitutes a note on the distribution of unemployment shocks in a range of countries across Europe. In the fifth section, which is the core of this report, the features of which the 18 policy options are composed (i.e. the parameters that define the different schemes) are presented. Some examples of these features are the trigger of the scheme and the eligibility criteria. In the report, a conceptual and operational definition of each feature is put forward and discussed. This involves more details on how each feature was designed and on why certain choices were made in the design process. The sixth section covers the issue of minimum requirements, accession criteria, convergence and related topics. The last section of this report consists of 18 overview tables (fiches, one for each option). ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 7 B. P RESENTATION OF 18 POLICY OPTIONS FOR EUBS This chapter presents an in-depth analysis of 18 policy options for the European Unemployment Benefits Scheme (EUBS). The 18 options can be divided into two groups, equivalent and genuine schemes, which are further characterised by a range of features or parameters. The chapter first clarifies the distinction between these two types of schemes and then describes each of the features in detail. Specifically, for each of the features we provide a conceptual and operational definition, a detailed discussion of why specific parameters were chosen, a comparison with the definition of these features in the current literature and, when possible, an overview of related empirical or simulation results. In each case, baseline and alternative variants of the features are explored. The operational definitions of the various features will be used to construct the different EUBS for the micro- and macro-simulations of their impact. These simulations will be carried out in a later stage of the project. In order to better embed the chapter in the literature, we also draw on the review of the existing realities in federations inside and outside the EU (Task 1A) as well as the review of existing proposals for a supranational unemployment benefit scheme (Task 1B). As requested in the ToR, 18 different types of European Unemployment Benefits Schemes will be examined in this research project. These 18 options are closely related to each other, because each of them is a combination of different variants of the features described in this chapter. Some of these features have been comprehensively defined in the ToR. In these cases, we carefully describe the features and review the relevant literature. For other features, the ToR leaves to the researchers the task to choose some aspects of the definition (particularly of the operational definition, which is used in the simulation exercises). In these cases, our analysis extends beyond a description of the feature and a literature review, and also makes explicit our choices for the operational definitions of the features and the reasoning that led to these choices. In fact, in these cases we present an overview of the different options that we explored and a detailed explanation as to why we prefer specific parameters or variables to their alternatives. We also consider the implications of these choices. We rely on related empirical work to verify our feature definitions and to provide support for these choices, which are also validated by the simulations performed in other tasks of the project. A European unemployment benefits scheme is one form of a supranational automatic stabiliser that could be introduced in Europe. An EUBS contributes to the welfare of European citizens in times of crisis and, by reinforcing fiscal capacity, to crisis prevention by breaking the vicious circle of economic and financial crises. Besides stabilisation and crisis prevention, an EUBS also acts as a mechanism for redistribution. Stabilisation and (re)distribution reinforce each other. It can be argued that a downturn will affect primarily the more vulnerable workers (e.g. low-skilled, which have the lowest hiring and firing costs). An uneven distribution of the adjustment burden may strengthen the intensity and persistence of the downturn (e.g. as low income earners typically have a higher propensity to consume \u2013 adversely affecting aggregate demand). 1. Genuine versus equivalent schemes A key distinction that is made in this study is that between equivalent and genuine schemes. Out of the 18 options that we explore, four are equivalent EUBS . These schemes involve financial transfers between the supranational fund, which manages the EUBS, and the Member States. In these schemes, there are no direct transfers between the Fund and unemployed individuals. Note that transfers may still reach unemployed individuals indirectly, if the supranational fund pays the national state which in turn directs the funds towards its unemployed citizens. Table 1 presents an overview of the four equivalent schemes and the features that differentiate them. The main difference between the equivalent schemes is the design of the trigger (i.e. the threshold level that determines when the funds are disbursed). This is a rather different situation in comparison with the genuine schemes, in which a ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 8 number of other features come into play as well. Table 1 lists the main characteristics of the four equivalent schemes through which they can be distinguished from each other. These are, apart from the trigger , the presence of experience rating , the presence of a claw-back mechanism, and the possibility for the supranational fund to issue debt . Note that the definitions of the features can be found in the Glossary in Appendix I. As is clear from Table 1, the trigger is defined in a similar way for each of the options, but the cut-off level differs. In the \u201crainy day\u201d scenario (options 2 and 3), the cut-off is set at 0.1% which means that the trigger is pulled very frequently. In this scenario the trigger is activated when the recorded short-term unemployment rate at quarter t minus its average in the last 40 quarters ( t \u201340,\u2026, t \u20131) exceeds 0.1%. This scenario covers nearly all shocks. The cut-off is set at 1% in the \u201cstormy\u201d day scenario (option 1) and at 2% in the case of \u201creinsurance of national UBS\u201d (option 4). The latter only covers very severe recessions. The selection of these three cut-off values is documented in the following sections. Note that experience rating is not implemented in the \u201cstormy day\u201d scenario, while claw-back is not present in the \u201creinsurance\u201d scenario. In two of the options, the supranational fund can issue debt to deal with short-term imbalances. Table 1.

The remaining fourteen options are genuine EUBS , which do involve direct transfers from the supranational fund to unemployed citizens. In genuine schemes no trigger is required as these schemes are activated for any eligible worker that becomes unemployed. An overview of these 14 options and the features that are particularly relevant in these cases is provided in Table 2. These features are: a basic or top-up scheme (V6), the duration of the benefits (V7 and V8), the replacement rate of the benefits (V9 and V10), the eligibility criteria (the minimum requirements to be able to qualify for the scheme, V11 and V12) 1 , capping (are benefits capped upwards, do not receive more than a certain amount, V13 and V14), cyclical variability (are there features that are affected by the economic cycle, e.g. duration of benefits, V15), the presence of experience rating (V16), the presence of a claw-bac k mechanism (V17), and the possibility for the supranational fund to issue debt (V18). For the exact definitions of each of these features we again refer to the following sections and the Glossary in Appendix I. In its most basic form as represented in V5, the genuine EUBS is a basic scheme that provides benefits from the beginning of the fourth month until the end of the twelfth month to all unemployed individuals that have worked at least 3 out of the 12 last months. The replacement rate is set at 50% of the reference wage and capped at 150% of the average national reference wage. The scheme is further characterised by experience rating, claw-back and the possibility of the Fund to issue debt. There is no cyclical variability is this baseline scheme. For the duration, the replacement rate, the eligibility 1 Note that in the modelling exercises, V11 and V12 are operationalised as follows: V11 has an eligibility of 6M out of 12M, while V12 has an eligibility of 9M out of 12M.

        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 9 and the capping features, the alternative variants include both an extension (e.g. replacement rate of 60% instead of 50%) and a reduction (e.g. 35% instead of 50%).

From the discussion above, one may derive that equivalent and genuine schemes differ on two important dimensions: the trigger (necessary to activate equivalent schemes, but irrelevant for genuine schemes) and the way in which funds are collected and disbursed (directly from/to the unemployed individuals in genuine schemes and from/to countries for equivalent ones). While these dimensions are clear in theory, the distinction between both types of EUBS in the real world is less clear-cut and straightforward to make than one may initially expect. As became clear in Task 1A, the existing multi-tiered schemes - in fact- often are complex and difficult to classify as either equivalent or genuine based on these two dimensions. An example that illustrates this is the American system of Extended and Emergency Benefits. These benefits are considered \u2018federal\u2019 and are conditioned by triggers. However, the Extended and Emergency Benefits are cashed out directly to unemployed individuals; this suggests that they are genuine in nature. Reality thus seems much more complex than a theoretical framework could capture. A more nuanced way to think is that the two ideal-types move, according to the specification in each variant, in a continuous space (as illustrated in Figure 1). The horizontal axis in the Figure represents the values of the trigger (cut-off of \u20180\u2019 for the genuine schemes and different options for the equivalent ones); the vertical axis represents the flexibility that governments have to operate their own UB scheme (flexibility here captures the level of harmonisation \u2013or the lack thereof- across the various UBS). Moving more towards the \u2018zero\u2019 on the vertical axis implies a higher level of harmonisation across the Member States. ",

As indicated above, equivalent schemes leave much more flexibility to Member States to run their own scheme and are therefore much less problematic than genuine EUBS from the administrative point of view. When it comes to the equivalent schemes, however, there are other complications. In genuine EUBS, the flow of transfers is clear: the supranational fund directly cashes out benefits to any eligible unemployed. In equivalent EUBS, funds are transferred to national governments. In this case, it is crucial to distinguish between the rules and formulas used to calculate how much a government receives when the trigger is pulled and the rules that determine how a government can spend this sum via the national schemes (laid down in minimum requirements). If an equivalent EUBS would be introduced, one could envisage a simplistic scenario in which no change is applied to the national unemployment benefits schemes (NUBS henceforth) and the supranational fund transfers resources when the local schemes are in financial stress. This would imply an EUBS that simply finances the existing NUBS. This system would aid countries not to cut the expenditure on unemployment benefits in a time of crisis. However, it would not improve the stabilisation capacity of the national system in question (importantly, the research performed for Task 3 shows that national stabilisation capacity can be particularly low). The main question therefore is: where does one draw the line in the equivalent EUBS? To what extent should the funds transferred come with conditions that Member States have to respect, and how specific should these conditions then be? One option is that the EUBS pays a lump sum to the country whose trigger is activated, with some rules attached. For example, a condition could be that the amount of money transferred is spent on at least 75% of the short-term unemployed, leaving the country free to design specific eligibility requirements. An alternative, more stringent possibility is that the lump sum is spent on the same unemployed workers that would qualify for the genuine scheme (as identified in the baseline scenario V5). This is what is simulated in the backward and forward-looking scenarios in Tasks 3B/C. In this case, the only distinction between an equivalent and a genuine scheme is the existence of the trigger. From this comparison, it follows that there exists a continuum of minimum requirements with regard to the regulation of national unemployment benefits schemes, ranging from very flexible to rigid. If the EU determines exactly how the Member States should spend the lump sum received in the equivalent EUBS, this would correspond to very rigid minimum requirements. If, on the other hand, the EU leaves it flexibility 0 1% 2% 3% equivalent schemes trigger genuine schemes ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 11 largely to the Member States to decide how the money can be used, the minimum requirements can be regarded as highly flexible. The case of the genuine EUBS is rather different from that of the equivalent EUBS. For the genuine schemes, it is the EU who defines eligibility, generosity, duration etc. (possibly allowing nation-specific adjustments, e.g. flat-rate benefits instead of earnings-related benefits in countries that already have such a system). This means that de facto there are no minimum requirements beyond the design of the scheme. To already provide the reader with some more details on the design of the features presented above both for the genuine and the equivalent EUBS, we introduce Table 3 below. Table 3 is a summary table that comprises the operational definitions that we propose for each of the nine features. The nine features are: trigger (when is the scheme activated), pay-in (the contributions requested from countries or individuals), experience rating (accounting for the country\u2019s historical unemployment), claw-back (limiting long- term transfers from the system to a particular country), duration (number of months UB are paid out), replacement rate (percentage of reference wage paid out as an UB), reference wage (last gross monthly wage), eligibility (who is entitled to UB) and capping (the maximum UB that one can receive). When applicable, both the baseline definitions and the alternative ones are provided (e.g. the baseline duration of the unemployment benefits corresponds to 9 months, from M3 to M12, while the alternatives are a longer duration, from M0 to M12 (in V7), and a short duration, from M3 to M6 (in V8)). In this way, the reader can easily compare the operational definitions of the key features that define the 18 EUBS. In Table 3, i generally refers to country i and t stands for quarter t .

        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 14 The following section, section C, consists of a comparison of the 18 EUBS with the experiences of other countries. The section builds upon the literature review of the existing unemployment insurances in federations inside and outside the EU (Task 1A). This review comprised eight case studies (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and the US). We indicate in the next section which of the different options matches best with each of the case studies. In section D, we analyse the distribution of unemployment shocks (for the short-term and total unemployment rates) across Europe. To this end, we first take a graphical approach and then continue by performing normality tests. The analysis of the distribution of shocks is motivated by the fact that if such shocks are normally distributed, then all countries have the same probability of being a beneficiary of equivalent EUBS (over a sufficiently long period of time). In addition, this would also provide support for the political acceptability of the genuine EUBS. This analysis provides us with more insight into the type of shocks that countries generally are affected by. Section E then presents an analysis of the 18 policy options and their main features, one by one. This section is at the heart of the chapter because it outlines the features that make up each of the 18 options. The section further summarises -for each feature- the related literature, the most important trade-offs that the selection of the feature involves and the choices that were made to come up with operational definitions to be used in the micro- and macro-simulations of the EUBS in a later phase of the project. To be more precise, the section first introduces the trigger, a feature that is only applicable to the equivalent EUBS. The following parts of the section address the pay-in, experience rating and claw-back; and the possibility of the Fund to issue debt. These features are relevant to both types of EUBS. The final parts of section E cover all other features. These features are especially relevant to the genuine schemes, as they differ across options 5- 18. In the equivalent schemes these features are also relevant, but they are identical in each of the four cases. In section F, the issue of minimum requirements is addressed. Both equivalent and genuine EUBS can be linked to minimum requirements for national unemployment benefits scheme and activation policies. More specifically, the section deals with the potential risks of moral hazard on the one hand and of ineffectiveness of the scheme due to low coverage on the other hand. These risks may result from a substantial decentralisation of eligibility conditions to Member States. Section F is further devoted to issues such as accession criteria, voluntary and involuntary opt-outs, opt-ins and convergence. Section G comprises for each of the 18 policy options: a fiche, which is an overview table of the main features, the economic impact, the legal and operational impact of the option, and some general remarks. The economic impact includes the results of the micro- and macro-simulations (stabilisation, redistribution, transfers), the value added of the scheme (labour mobility, structural reforms, markets\u2019 and agents\u2019 confidence) and the risk of moral hazard. The legal and operational impact refers to the compatibility with national laws and practices of Member States and with the EU legal framework. In each fiche, countries or cases that require further attention are highlighted. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 15 C. C OMPARISON OF 18 EUBS POLICY OPTIONS WITH EXPERIENCES OF OTHER COUNTRIES This section is meant to bridge the gap between Tasks 1A and 1C. The idea is to understand whether any of the 18 \u2018ideal types\u2019 matches one or more features of the cases deeply analysed in Task 1A and to understand if the lessons from these eight cases are learned. Australia = Variant 9/3. The system is organised centrally and it is financed by general revenue. As a result there are no direct transfers across regions. However, since different regions exhibit different unemployment rates, a form of redistribution exists determined by the fact that people living in more prosperous areas contribute more and people living in less prosperous areas recur more to the funds. The policy mix is the following: low eligibility conditions, high controls to promote activation and ungenerous benefits. The closest of the variants is V9 (genuine), where the replacement rate is 35%. One should mention then that the central level also regulates and implements activation, which makes it very different from the idea of a genuine EUBS in the European context, at least if we keep activation as (predominantly) a Member State responsibility. Canada = no specific matching variant. The Canadian system is organised at the Federal level. Its origin dates back to the Great Depression, an interesting parallel with the current crisis and the debate on the EUBS. The system is financed by employees\u2019 and employers\u2019 contributions (respectively 40 and 60%) and its maximum duration is generally 52 weeks. The system does not match a specific variant, but can be classified as \u2018genuine\u2019. What makes it interesting is a feature not directly matched by any of the 18 variants analysed in this study. The benefit rates are not equal across the country, but higher in those regions where the unemployment rate is higher! Moreover, in regions facing a downturn, the eligibility criteria are eased and the duration is prolonged. As a result, the system is effective in terms of shock-absorption and also highly redistributive. As such, it is organised in the opposite way of the EUBS which always have correction mechanisms based on experience rating and claw-back. Austria = Variant 6. The Austrian labour market governance is relatively centralised. Like in all the genuine systems as a default option, the Austrian unemployment benefits system is financed by employees\u2019 and employers\u2019 contributions. Payments are granted for up to 52 weeks (like in most variants). An interesting feature is the equalisation payment. Austria has a history of low replacement rates. In order to avoid falling below a social minimum, the system foresees the possibility to top-up the replacement rate, which can reach up to 80% for a wage earner below the median income (this applies to social assistance, not to the UB). The goal of such provision in Austria is to force L\u00e4nder to attain certain replacement rates for social assistance benefits. This feature contains similarities with V6. Belgium = Variant 16. The Belgian case is interesting because, among those analysed in Task 1A, it is the one where the issue of moral hazard emerges more aggressively. This is due to the combination of two factors: the generosity of the system and the strong differences in terms of unemployment rates among the three regions. Such structural redistribution led over time to political tensions among the different levels of government. This makes Belgium similar to the \u2018missing variant\u2019 in the list of 18, and precisely the one where neither experience rate nor claw-back mechanisms are foreseen to correct the redistributive element of the system. As this variant is inexistent, the one closest to it is V16 where only the claw-back is present and by design it is pulled only in case of negative balance of a country vis-\u00e0-vis the Fund for more than 3 years. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 16 Finally, Germany , Denmark and Switzerland have all put in place UB schemes which belong to the category of \u2018genuine\u2019. However, their specificity does not match any of the 18 variants considered for the EUBS. US = Variant 15. It is difficult to clearly classify the American system under the equivalent / genuine dichotomy. Unemployment insurance, in standard times, is not redistributive as each state has its own account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. National funds can borrow from the central fund (FUA) but have to restore the balance to zero in the long-term. If the outstanding loan is not repaid by that time, the state will face an effective federal tax increase (Whittaker, 2012). 2 Yet, the system introduces a distributive element in case of major recessions. If no sign of recovery is present in the economy and the unemployment rate stays high, the Congress can approve extended benefits and emergency benefits. The presence of a trigger for the extended and emergency benefits makes the system \u2018mixed\u2019. Among the 18 variants, V15 is the closest to the US system. In this option the opportunity to include \u2018cyclical variability\u2019 will be tested. As can be read in the ToR (p.8): \u201cthe values for one or more dimensions change during a \u2018deep downturn\u2019. One example would be a longer duration, such as in the case of \u2018extended benefits\u2019 in the US.\u201d This variant is interesting as it complements the \u2018insurance\u2019 aspect of the policy with a solidarity element across member states. One more feature is interesting about the US case: the existence of minimum requirements. Unlike in all other systems considered, where the parameters of the UI are defined at the Federal level, in the US only a floor is harmonised. States are then free to be more generous with unemployed, which translates into a higher contribution for the employers. D. A NALYSIS OF DISTRIBUTION OF UNEMPLOYMENT SHOCKS 1. Introduction In this section, we investigate whether the short-term and total unemployment rates in various countries across Europe are normally distributed. This analysis is particularly relevant for equivalent schemes, where a trigger determines when the funds are disbursed. The main issue is the following: if ultimately unemployment shocks are normally distributed, then all countries have the same probability of being a beneficiary of the scheme (when a sufficiently long period of time is considered) (Beblav\u00fd et al., 2015). 2 In the US system, unemployment compensation benefits are financed through employer taxes (federal and state payroll taxes). With regards to the federal unemployment taxes, a gross tax rate of 6% is imposed. In states with programs approved by the federal government and without any delinquent federal loans, this rate is reduced to 0.6% only. In times of economic downturn, state taxes and reserve balances may prove to be insufficient to cover the expenditure for unemployment benefits. If a state is unable to pay unemployment benefits, it does not have a program that meets federal law and therefore employers will be subjected to a federal tax rate of 6%. Moreover, the state may need to borrow money from a dedicated loan account (FUA) or outside sources. Even in case of the former, interest rates are applied to the borrowed funds related to new loans when they have not been not repaid by the end of the fiscal year in which they were obtained. It is strictly regulated which funds that may or may not be used to pay interest, as well as when this needs to happen. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily waived interest payments. In contrast to the US system, the EUBS does not apply interest. The idea of charcing interest runs counter to the idea of an insurance and risk-sharing. Moreover, the system is already based on wage growth and GDP growth, so this already is accounted for to some extent. Another point is that the current interest rates are very low and likely to remain low for an extended period of time. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 17 This analysis is also useful as it aids to determine the type of shocks that each country is generally affected by (i.e. positive or negative, large or small shocks). Since we consider both the short-term and total unemployment rates in the design of the trigger, we examine the normality of both distributions. In order to get a sufficiently long time period for our analysis, we extracted data from AMECO (total unemployment rates, covering 1980-2014) and EUROSTAT (short-term unemployment rates, covering 1990-2014). As data were not available for several countries for this time period, the analysis is limited to a sub-set of countries (of which the majority are EU15 members). We thus examine the distribution of shocks in a range of countries that differ (substantially) as far as the structure and functioning of their economy is concerned. Even though AMECO offers data for an even longer time period for some countries (i.e. covering also the 1960s and 1970s), we decided to exclude these years as unemployment in that period was at a different level and had a very different structure than in later years. We further considered the impact of the recent crisis on the distribution of the unemployment rates by including or excluding years 2009-2014 in our analyses, of which the results are displayed in the top and bottom panel of the tables below respectively. Our analysis of the distribution of shocks comprises two steps. As a first step, the distribution of shocks is explored graphically. The second step involves a more formal analysis, in which we make use of different normality tests. From the graphical analysis, it is immediately clear that in some countries unemployment is normally distributed (e.g. Belgium) while in other countries this is not the case (e.g. France). However, when the EU (EU15) or the Euro Area as a whole are considered, distributions appear to be normal. Normality tests of the different distributions lead to a similar conclusion: in about half of the countries shocks are normally distributed. When the EU and the Euro Area are studied, the same result is found. Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain have normally distributed shocks in all cases, regardless of the time period and the type of unemployment considered. The opposite applies to Ireland and Latvia where normality is rejected every time. The period considered does seem to have a big impact on the distribution in some cases, though this does not apply to the EU and the Euro Area. A clear example of this result is the inclusion or exclusion of the recent crisis years (2009- 2014). For some countries, the result is also dependent on the unemployment measure used (total or short-term rates). How can there results be interpreted? A first important finding is that in many countries the normality of the distribution of shocks is confirmed, regardless of the period considered and the unemployment measure used. This finding also applies to the EU and the Euro Area, a result that provides clear support in favour of risk sharing across countries. However, normality is difficult to reject, and therefore the fact that in the other half of the sample unemployment shocks are not normally distributed requires further analysis. In this regard, for a number of countries normality is rejected because of the small tails of their distributions (which are fairly symmetric) in comparison with the normal distribution, which indicates that large shocks are less frequent. However, one should further keep in mind that our time series are relatively short, which can affect results, as illustrated by the test in which the period 2009-2014 is excluded. Additionally, our analysis covers unemployment rates (levels) at annual frequency. We do not consider changes in unemployment levels. We opted for this approach for two reasons. First, unemployment levels change drastically from one quarter to the next, which severely complicates and precludes an analysis based on changes. Secondly, the dynamics of unemployment rates reflect the cycle well, given the strong correlation with changes in GDP (despite the fact that unemployment rates have a structural component). 2. Analysis In this section, we first perform a graphical analysis of the distributions of the short-term and total unemployment rates and then continue with more formal tests. To this end, we make use of two datasets. The first dataset holds data on total unemployment rates, which we collected from AMECO. This dataset covers 15 EU countries, for which data are ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 18 available and complete already since the 1980s. We use this dataset because it allows us to have a longer time series. The countries included are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany 3 , Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. This implies that, even though New Member States are excluded, countries with (very) different labour markets and economies are still covered in our analysis. We further extract data on total unemployment rates from AMECO for the EU and the Euro Area as a whole (covering period 1980-2014, when possible). The second dataset is obtained from EUROSTAT and covers short-term unemployment rates. Unfortunately, these data are only available for a sub-set of countries (eight countries) and for a shorter time period. In this case, we study Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in period 1990-2014. 2.1 Graphical analysis For the graphical analysis, we look at the distribution of unemployment shocks in the following way: we count how many times the unemployment rate is higher or lower than x times its standard deviation. In this exercise, x ranges from 0.5 to 3 and varies with steps of 0.5. As indicated above, we consider both the total and short-term unemployment rates, but only present graphs based on total unemployment here (i.e. the AMECO data, for which we have a longer time series). Some examples are pictured in Figure 2 below, in which each panel holds the graph of one country (i.e. for Belgium, France, Austria and Portugal). In each graph, the number of times the total unemployment rate exceeds the cut-off is depicted on the vertical axis, while the horizontal axis displays the cut-off values. The top right panel of Figure 2 shows the distribution of total unemployment rate in Belgium, which appears to be normal. In the other panels of Figure 2, the distribution of total unemployment does not appear to be normal (with Austria and Portugal showing an opposite pattern). For France, the distribution is strongly left-skewed, meaning that no large negative unemployment shock is observed during the period. Figure 2.

Source : Authors\u2019 elaboration on AMECO data 2.2 Analysis based on normality tests The second step of the analysis is based on normality tests. As before, total as well as short-term unemployment rates are considered. In both cases, we use two tests, the skewness and kurtosis test for normality and the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, and consider two time periods (with and without 2009-2014). We first discuss the results for total unemployment and then focus on short-term unemployment. For total unemployment rates, we do not only show results for individual countries but also for the EU and the Euro Area. 2.2.1 Analysis of the total unemployment rates (AMECO data) for period 1980- 2014 First test : To test the normality of the unemployment distributions, the \u2018Skewness and kurtosis test for normality\u2019 (sktest) was used (in statistical package Stata). This test requires at least eight observations and entails a normality test based on the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution (which are combined into an overall test statistic). The null hypothesis for this test is that the variable under examination is normally distributed. Two time periods are studied: 1980-2014 and 1980-2008 (to see to what extent the crisis has an impact on the shape of the distribution). Results are presented in Table 4. The countries indicated in red and bold are countries where unemployment shocks are not normally distributed (p-value > 10%). When period 1980-2014 is considered, for 7 out of the 15 countries the null hypothesis is rejected at the 10% level (in the top panel of the table). This implies that total unemployment is not normally distributed in Ireland , Greece , France , Luxembourg , Portugal , Sweden and the United Kingdom . The first two columns show whether the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution are significantly different from those of a normal distribution. This appears to be the case for Greece; whereas for the remaining countries either the skewness or the kurtosis differs significantly. The bottom panel of the table shows results for period 1980-2008. Results do appear to be influenced by the Great Recession. In this case, for 4 out of 15 countries ( Ireland , Portugal , Sweden and the United Kingdom ), the distribution is not normal as the null hypothesis is rejected at the 10% level. This appears to be caused by the kurtosis of the distribution for these countries. 4 4 When the tests are repeated for unemployment changes, normality is rejected at the 10% level for 8 countries in the top panel (Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Luxembourg, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and 6 countries in the bottom panel (Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom). 02468 10 12 14 < A V G - 3 S D < A V G - 2 . 5 S D < A V G - 2 S D < A V G - 1 . 5 S D < A V G - 1 S D < A V G - 0 . 5 S D > A V G + 0 . 5 S D > A V G + 1 S D > A V G + 1 . 5 S D > A V G + 2 S D > A V G + 2 5 S D > A V G + 3 S D EU15 1980-2014 02468 10 12 14 < A V G - 3 S D < A V G - 2 . 5 S D < A V G - 2 S D < A V G - 1 . 5 S D < A V G - 1 S D < A V G - 0 . 5 S D > A V G + 0 . 5 S D > A V G + 1 S D > A V G + 1 . 5 S D > A V G + 2 S D > A V G + 2 5 S D > A V G + 3 S D EuroArea12 1980-2014 ",

Results are presented in Table 8 and Table 9 below. First test : For period 1990-2014, short-term unemployment is normally distributed in 7 out of 8 countries when we use the 5% level as a cut-off for the skewness and kurtosis test for normality (it is not normally distributed in Latvia ). When the 10% level is used as removed), and the EU15 including West-Germany when the shorter sample is used. These results are likely due to volatility in unemployment changes. 7 In addition to these tests, we also considered co-movement between the moments of the distributions across Member States. To this end, we calculated the rolling mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of subsequent five year periods (e.g. 1980-1984, 1981-1982 etc.) and checked the correlations of these moving moments across the Member States. Overall, no clear pattern can be detected for the mean and variance. Correlations vary from really low numbers (0.001) to rather high numbers (0.96), and are both positive and negative. When it comes to the skewness and kurtosis, correlations generally are low. It is difficult to draw clear-cut conclusions from these findings. ",

When we consider period 1990-2008 instead, for two countries the distribution is not normal at the 5% level: Denmark and Latvia . For France and Italy the null hypothesis is rejected at the 10% level. For the first two columns of Table 8, one can again derive whether the rejection of normality is driven by the skewness or kurtosis of the distribution (or both). 8 Second test : As before, these results were verified using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. In the top panel of Table 9, we reach the same conclusion for Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands and Finland. For France , the null hypothesis of normality is rejected at the 10% level, whereas this no longer applies to Luxembourg.

Finally, in Table 10, countries are classified into groups on the basis of the skewness and kurtosis of the total and short-term unemployment rate distributions. In the table, the full time period is considered (i.e. including the crisis years). As a first step, the countries for which the short-term or total unemployment rate is normally distributed are separated from those to which this does not apply. This first group of countries has symmetric distributions with normal tails (indicated in the top left cell of the table). Then, the second group of countries is further split up according to the skewness (left-skewed or right-skewed) and kurtosis (flatter or thicker tails with regards to the normal distribution) of their distributions. For the short-term unemployment rate, presented in panel A of the table, four countries had a non-normal distribution in period 1990-2014. The distributions of three of these countries are right-skewed (i.e. positive shocks are more frequent). The distributions of two countries have flatter tails (no large shocks). With regards to skewness, the distributions of Denmark and Latvia are significantly different from that of the normal distribution (right-skewed, indicated in bold). For kurtosis, there are only significant differences for Italy and Latvia (the distribution of Italy has flatter tails; that of Latvia has thicker tails, in italics). For total unemployment, which is presented in panel B of Table 10, we find seven countries with non-normal distributions. Three out of seven countries have distributions with significantly flatter tails (Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, in italics), while the distribution of Greece has significantly thicker tails (i.e. larger shocks are more frequent). With regards to the skewness of the distribution, Table 10 suggests that France has a left-skewed distribution whereas Greece and Portugal have a right-skewed distribution (in all cases significantly different from the normal distribution, in bold). 10 Table 10.

Conclusions In this section, we focussed on the distributions of the short-term and total unemployment rates of several countries and country-groups. The aim of the note was to determine whether these unemployment measures are normally distributed or not. To this end, we made use of two datasets obtained from AMECO and EUROSTAT, the latter for short-term and the former for total unemployment, covering a sufficiently long time series. We first examined the distributions from a graphical point of view and then continued by performing normality tests. In fact, we compared results for different time periods (including or excluding the recent crisis) and different tests. From our analysis, we conclude that in half of the countries, in the EU (EU15) as a whole and in the Euro Area, shocks are normally distributed. This finding for the EU and the Euro Area is a strong argument in favour of risk sharing across these countries. Although it is hard to reject normality, one has to keep in mind that our times series are rather short and that including or excluding certain years (such as period 2009-2014) can have an impact on the test results. The findings for the Euro Area and the EU as a whole do not appear to be affected by the time period considered. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 27 E. A NALYSIS OF KEY POLICY FEATURES OF EUBS 1. Introduction This section presents a thorough analysis of the key policy features \u2013or parameters that define each- of the 18 potential EUBS. Some of these features will be shared by both the equivalent and the genuine UB schemes while other features are specific to one of these types. An example of the latter would be the \u2018trigger\u2019, which is a feature of the equivalent EUBS only. As indicated above, equivalent EUBS are those schemes in which financial transfers flow from Member States to the supranational fund or from the Fund to the Members States. There are no direct transfers to unemployed individuals. This, however, does not preclude indirect flows to unemployed citizens since national governments can transfer the funds received from the supranational fund directly towards their unemployed citizens. The first four out of the 18 options considered in this report are equivalent schemes. The remaining 14 options are genuine EUBS ; schemes that are characterised by direct financial transfers from the supranational fund to unemployed individuals. The following features will be discussed in more depth: the trigger; pay-in, experience rating and claw-back; the possibility to issue debt; basic versus top-up schemes; cyclical variability; the duration of the UB; the replacement rate; the reference wage; the eligibility criteria and capping. For each of these features we provide a definition and detailed description, we present an operational definition and we carefully explain how the parameters in this definition were determined. We also discuss related literature and empirical results. In each case, we list what the baseline form of the feature is and which alternatives are studied (e.g. the baseline replacement is 50%, with two variants: 35% in option 9 and 60% in option 10). When relevant, we also discuss country-specific cases or results. For a comprehensive list of definitions for each feature, we refer to the Glossary in Appendix I. 2. Trigger The trigger is the condition determining when financial transfers from the supranational fund towards a particular country should occur. It only applies to the equivalent EUBS , because in genuine systems the Fund is activated at any job loss that fulfils the eligibility requirements. In equivalent schemes, a trigger is necessary to define events that activate the Fund. A trigger is defined by an indicator and a threshold and activated when the former is larger than the latter. A trigger is defined by the choice of an indicator and of a threshold. When the indicator for a specific country i at a specific time t exceeds the threshold, then the supranational fund pays to the country the agreed claim. In our proposal, t refers to quarters and not years. For the indicator, we use the short-term unemployment rate of country i at time t (represented by UR i,t in the equation below). The threshold is based on the sum of the 10 years moving average of the country\u2019s short-term unemployment rate (which corresponds to the last 40 quarters, as represented by UR i , t-40,...,t-1 ) and \u03c4 percentage points. The claim is paid to country i whenever the recorded short-term unemployment rate at quarter t minus its average in the last 40 quarters ( t \u201340,\u2026, t \u20131) exceeds a certain value.

        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 28 Our preferred data series are the seasonally adjusted series from the EU-LFS. Because of data limitations, the definition of the trigger will be adapted to yearly data in the simulations to be carried out later on in this research project. An important methodological note is about what we mean by the short-term unemployment rate. For purposes of the EUBS, the tender defines eligible unemployed as those unemployed between 3 and 12 months. However, for the purposes of historical analysis, such data are not available on a long-term basis; therefore we use the short-term unemployment rate (0-12 months) as a proxy instead. 12 A trigger is characterised by two parameters: an indicator and a threshold. With regards to the indicator , the literature has defined two broad types. The first type of indicators was put forward by Enderlein et al. (2013) and is based on the output gap. The output gap is \u201cthe difference of a country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) to this country\u2019s potential output \u2013 that is, to the highest level of output that is sustainable in the long term\u201d (Enderlein et al., 2013, p. 24). The output gap has a very strong conceptual appeal as a measure of the economic cycle, because it is immediately related to it: when a country is in a negative phase of the economic cycle, the output gap is negative by definition. The second type of indicators, which receives much more support in the literature (Italianer and Vanheukelen, 1993; Dullien, 2007, 2012, 2013; Vetter, 2014; Beblav\u00fd and Maselli, 2014), is based on the unemployment rate. The reasons for this being that the unemployment rate is a solid indicator, as it is based on a head-count, and that statistics on unemployment rates are available quarterly (thanks to the European Labour Force Survey). Even more importantly, output gap statistics are controversial (as they require estimating the \u201cpotential output\u201d) and often revised, even ex-post, which makes them difficult to consider reliable in real-time (Strauss et al., 2013; Ince and Papell, 2013; Biggs and Mayer, 2010). This means that the estimation of the output gap for 2015 calculated in 2015 will hardly coincide with the revisions conducted in later years (2016, 2017, and so on). A recent article by Darvas (2015) confirms this in his analysis of output gap estimates revisions made by the IMF and the European Commission during 2001 and 2015. Substantial revisions are made to the previous and current year output gap estimates one year later, amounting to 0.5 to 1% of GDP on average across countries (in normal years). Enderlein et al. (2013), however, indicate that output gap revisions cannot only result from methodological changes but also from improvements in future estimates. In addition, the authors find that ex-post adjustments are highly correlated between countries. Despite these considerations, we follow the majority of earlier studies on this topic and therefore select the unemployment rate for the indicator. The following decision to be taken is whether to use the short-term or total unemployment rate for the indicator. The literature suggests that the short-term unemployment rate is a better indicator than the total unemployment rate (Dullien, 2013; Vetter, 2014; Beblav\u00fd and Maselli, 2014; Beblav\u00fd et al., 2015). In addition, the afore-mentioned literature also emphasises that the difference from a norm should be considered rather than the level of the unemployment rate itself. In this way, one can avoid that some countries will turn into net payers into the scheme whereas other countries become net beneficiaries. With regards to the threshold , again there are several elements to keep in mind. The first is the question of the \u2018norm\u2019; i.e. what should the threshold be based on? In their paper, Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) propose to use a moving average of the country\u2019s short-term 12 Note that in the modelling exercises in Tasks 3B and 3C this issue is addressed as follows. As a first step, information is obtained from Eurostat on the number of unemployed with different durations (this is based on the Labour Force Survey). From this, the share of short-term unemployed and the share of short-term unemployed with duration 3-12 months are calculated. One has to keep in mind, however, that in the anonymised Labour Force Survey, the categories of unemployed by duration are broader (e.g. less than 6 months, 6-11 months). ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 29 unemployment rate (in a 10 year reference period) as the norm. This approach avoids having to use a historical average within a reference period that can be too short (and hence too dependent on the cycle) or too long (when it becomes more different to appreciate structural improvements). Other studies use the yearly growth of unemployment, but this approach results in a rather volatile indicator that is highly depended on the level of unemployment one year earlier. Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) note that these issues could be resolved using a measure of structural unemployment for the indicator, such as the NAWRU. The NAWRU, however, is more difficult to estimate than the simple unemployment rate and is subject to ex-post revisions (similarly to the output gap). Because of this reason, we prefer to use a moving average as the norm on which the indicator is defined. Following Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014), we consider 10 years as a reference period, to deal with the trade-off between sensitivity to prolonged economic slumps and outdated data. The next question is what difference from this norm is required to trigger the system. Here, the literature points to two possibilities: expressing this difference in terms of standard deviations or in terms of percentage points. We summarise all possible combinations in Table 11 below: - Short-term unemployment rate vs. total unemployment rate (indicator) - Fixed percentages vs. standard deviations (threshold) Table 11. Overview of different options for the trigger Fixed percentage Standard deviations Short-term unemployment rate Option a Option b Total unemployment rate Option c Option d Source : Authors\u2019 elaboration. We focus on the period 2000-2014. The reason is twofold: on the one hand, this allows looking backward: series of short-term unemployment start to be complete from 1996 onwards and therefore selecting 2000 as starting point means that the supposed 10 years average counts at least four data points. On the other hand, the 2000-2014 period includes both the crisis and the pre-crisis phase. This implies that we cannot only see how many times the trigger would have been pulled in the recent crisis years, but also how many times and, importantly in which countries, the trigger would have been activated in other periods of economic downturn. For Germany, for example, this reveals that the trigger would also have been pulled in the years 2003-2005, when the country was going through a severe crisis. In order to provide further support for our analysis, we present two correlation tables that cover the four options listed in Table 11. In both tables, period 2000-2014 is considered for the EU27 (Croatia is excluded because of data availability issues). 13 Table 12 shows the correlations between the different series in terms of values (e.g. what is the value of the short-term unemployment rate plus 1% and to what extent is it correlated with the value of the short-term unemployment rate plus two standard deviations). Table 13 illustrates the correlations between the different series in terms of the number of times the trigger is pulled. Both tables suggest that the correlations generally are high. Table 14 presents a brief discussion of the correlations in Table 13 . In the remainder of this section, we frequently refer to these tables. Table 12.

In this way, one can compare our proposal with the current state of the literature. From the overview presented in the note below, it is immediately clear that many studies recur to the unemployment rate. 14 2.1 Why do we opt for short-term instead of total unemployment? The first choice to be made is to select which indicator is preferable between short-term and total unemployment rates. Despite the high correlation between these two series (as illustrated in Table 12), we prefer short-term unemployment. Our choice is motivated by both economic and political arguments. From the purely economic point of view, several studies argue that short-term unemployment is more sensitive to the economic cycle, whereas total unemployment also includes structural unemployment. Given that the purpose of the insurance is to create a shock-absorption mechanism in case of recession, short-term unemployment is better suited to do that, also because more volatile (see for instance, Dullien (2013), Vetter (2014), Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) and Beblav\u00fd et al. (2015)). Moreover, despite the high correlation between the short-term and total unemployment rates shown in Table 12, the two series can diverge. This can result in situations in which the short-term unemployment rate of a country is decreasing when the country starts to stabilize after a shock, while the total unemployment rate at this point can stay at its level or even increase further. This can happen, for instance, in case of hysteresis. The following six figures, in Figure 4 below, present examples of countries where this issue occurs. It can be observed in the charts that in Spain, Greece and Italy after the early phases total UR continue to increase even when STUR remains stable. 14 Dullien (2013) defines the trigger in three different ways for the three simulation scenarios: - Unemployment rate above 7 %, increase above one percentage point over past 12 months - Unemployment rate above 5 %, increase above one percentage point over past 12 months - Unemployment rate above 7 %, increase above 15 percent over past 12 months Italianer and Vanheukelen (1993) suggest the following trigger: - Increase of the unemployment rate over past 12 months is positive and greater than the average increase over the other members of the European Union Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) design the trigger in the following way: - Difference between unemployment rate and NAWRU (Non-Accelerating Wage Rate of Unemployment) exceeds 2% Beblav\u00fd et al. (2015) analyse three different EUBS, with the following triggers: - Short-term unemployment rate exceeds the sum between its 10-years average and one tenth of its 10-years standard deviation - Short-term unemployment rate exceeds the sum between its 10-years average and its 10- years standard deviation - Short-term unemployment rate exceeds the sum between its 10-years average and two times its 10-years standard deviation ",

Examples of countries that are characterised by a period in which the short- term unemployment rate goes down, whereas the total unemployment rate is unchanged or further increasing Source : Authors\u2019 elaboration on Eurostat \u2013 Labour Force Survey \u2013 data. From the political point of view instead, total unemployment, on the other hand, has the advantage that it is simple and easier to explain and communicate to a wider public, which is used to read in the press about these figures. If this is true, we consider however the argument not strong enough in the light of the argument that one country is financing the unemployed of the other could be easily used by populist Eurosceptic parties. In this study, we follow the afore-mentioned literature and use the short-term unemployment rate (ratio of unemployed individuals since less than one year to the size of the labour force) as the indicator of unemployment throughout this chapter. 15 15 Notice that in most variants except V7, the EUBS starts paying benefits only after three months of unemployment, so very short term unemployment is not covered by the EUBS in this sense.

        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 33 Please note that the entire analysis in this study is based on annual data, but we do recommend using quarterly data in practice, should an EUBS be set up anytime in the future. In a number of macro-simulations, either monthly (Italianer and Vanheukelen, 1993; Dullien, 2013) or yearly (Beblav\u00fd and Maselli, 2014) unemployment rates are used. We also use yearly data in our study, which is partly driven by methodological and data limitations. Annual data, however, should not be used in the EUBS because this would result in a scheme that responds rather slowly to changes in unemployment. Monthly data would allow a much faster reaction, but these data do not differ much from quarterly data and most economic indicators are collected quarterly. We therefore prefer to make use of quarterly short-term unemployment rates. Italianer and Vanheukelen (1993) and Dullien (2013) exploit the yearly difference to eliminate seasonality in the data. We suggest working with seasonally adjusted data instead. These data are routinely produced by Eurostat and allow computing the average that we use as the norm on a larger sample size. 2.2 How big are the average short-term unemployment rate and standard deviation? In 2007, the 10 years average short-term unemployment rate was 4.44% in the EU. The average standard deviation over the same period was 0.81. Seven years later, the short- term unemployment rate was 4.8% with a standard deviation of 1.22.

Our preferences go to fixed percentages rather than standard deviations. For the pure scientific sake, standard deviations would be more appropriate. However, this might result in a case in which two countries in a given year have the same short-term unemployment rate, but only one of them qualifies. Such a situation would be politically unacceptable and has to be avoided. Using a fixed percentage is a more transparent mechanism. As can be observed in Table 12, the series are so highly correlated that choosing one or the other makes very little difference. The second step consists in defining the cut-off points for the \u201crainy day\u201d, \u201cstormy day\u201d and \u201creinsurance\u201d. Our understanding from the ToR is that: - The rainy-day fund needs to be triggered easily - The stormy day fund would have a higher trigger - The reinsurance is meant for significant shocks. We start with a wide range of cut-off points: 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75 and 3 and check how often they would trigger the Fund. Figure 9.

The challenge is to define fixed percentages that mirror as much as possible the desired values in terms of standard deviations. What are these? - One sufficiently small to be activated often and operational on a nearly continuous basis. - One sufficiently large to trigger only in cases of major events. - One somewhat in the middle between the two extreme cases. Our choices are to a certain extent discretionary but with solid roots in the figures. In defining the cut-off we start from the middle case, the stormy day. Looking at Figure 9 and Figure 10 , one can notice that the long list of cut-off points considered indicates 3 possible cases (further details on these cut-off points are provided in Appendix II): - A lower hand trigger at 0.1 or 0.25: the number of cases is very similar since the figures are sufficiently low. In the EU27, the trigger is pulled 197 times between 2000 and 2014 when the cut-off is set at 0.1 percentage points, 174 times when the cut-off is set at 0.25 percentage points and 132 times when the cut-off is set at 0.5 percentage points. We find that setting a low cut-off value is particularly important for countries in the North/West of Europe, in comparison with countries in the South and East of the continent. Sensitivity analysis suggests that in all countries the trigger is pulled at some point during period 2000-2014 when the cut-off value is 0.1, whereas Finland would no longer benefit when the cut-off is 0.5. With an even higher cut-off level of for instance 0.75, in four countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland and France) the trigger would never be pulled during 2000-2014 and in five other countries it would have been pulled only once or twice. - A higher hand trigger. For this values above 2 should be excluded since they make the number of cases too small and such that countries from the North never benefit from the system. When the cut-off value is set at 2.5, the trigger is activated only 25 times in the EU27 between 2000 and 2014. For cut-off values of 2.75 and 3, this number drops further to 21 times and 19 times.

Within the range of 1.75-2.25, the differences in terms of which countries can benefit and how many times the trigger is activated for each country are small (see Figure 9 ). The value of \u20182\u2019 therefore seems a good candidate as a cut-off value for the \u201creinsurance scenario\u201d. - A middling value. Here a value in between 0.5 and 1.75 should be selected. We prefer 1 because very close to the average standard deviation, which is equal to 0.94 on average in Europe during 2000-2014. Figure 10.

Figure 10 presents the number of times the trigger is pulled during period 2000-2014 for a range of cut-off values in three regions: North (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Finland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), East (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia) and South (Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Malta, Spain and Portugal). The three columns on the left of the Figure present the benchmark, i.e. how many times the trigger would have been activated if no cut-off was applied (cut-off equal to zero). For the North and East country-groups, which both hold 10 countries in the 15- year period, this would be 150 times. In the South, this number would be equal to 105 times. When a cut-off of 0.1 is used, the trigger is active 71 times in the North, 67 times in the East and 59 times in the South. In comparison with the benchmark, this corresponds to 47.3%, 44.7% and 56.2% of the cases respectively. When the cut-off is set at 0.25, these percentages decrease to 40.7%, 40% and 50.5%. For a cut-off at 0.5, the pattern begins to reverse: in this case the trigger is activated less in the North (28%) than in the East (30%). The countries in the East and South of Europe are still entitled to benefits at relatively high cut-off levels, whereas this does not apply to the North. 2.4 Conclusions on the trigger 150 71 61 42 25 15 9 8 7 3 2 0 0 0 150 67 60 45 34 31 26 21 13 11 10 9 6 6 105 59 53 45 39 34 27 24 21 18 16 16 15 13 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 0 0.1 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2 2.25 2.5 2.75 3 N u m b e r o f t i m e s t r i g g e r i s a c t i v a t e d Trigger based on percentage points deviation from 10 years moving average North East South ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 38 For a trigger we suggest to use the short- term unemployment rate as an indicator and the 10 years moving average plus \u03c4 percentage points as a threshold. The trigger is pulled when the value of the indicator is higher than that of the threshold. The value of \u03c4 depends on the scenario: we suggest using 0.1 for the \u201crainy day\" scenario, 1 for the \u201cstormy day\u201d scenario and 2 for the \u201creinsurance\u201d scenario. Based on the data shown in the previous pages, we conclude that: Choosing fixed percentage instead of standard deviations does not lead to substantially different results. The two series are highly correlated, independently for the 3 cut-off points chosen, as evidenced by Table 12 and Table 13 . - The correlations between trigger based on short-term unemployment using percentage points (standard deviation) and trigger based on total unemployment using standard deviation (percentage points) for the same cut-off are also quit high (from 0.62 to 0.81). - The correlations between the series based on short-term and total unemployment are high for the same cut-off, both when the trigger is based on percentage points as well as for triggers based on standard deviation (over 0.73 for percentage points and over 0.79 for standard deviation). We can firmly confirm our preference for a threshold based on fixed percentages. - We select three triggers: 0.1%, 1% and 2%. - A lower trigger entails that all countries benefit from the system. A higher trigger benefits more the South and East of Europe, where unemployment rates appear to be more prone to large shocks (see Figure 10). 2.5 Payout disbursed when the trigger is pulled When the trigger is pulled for country i , it remains to be decided what should be the amount transferred from the EUBS to this country. We define this amount on the basis of the same parameters as in the baseline option defined in the ToR. In other words, for the quarter in which the trigger conditions are satisfied, country i will receive from the EUBS an amount equivalent to the disbursement that would be needed to finance a UBS covering unemployed citizens who worked at least 3 out of the last 12 months, for a duration of 9 months, 50% replacement rate, and capping set at 150% of the median national wage. 3. Basic pay-in Another important feature of an EUBS is the financing of the scheme. In order to be able to pay out unemployment benefits, either indirectly via payments to the national governments or directly to the unemployed workers, the supranational fund has to acquire a sufficient amount of funding. This section therefore focuses on how the supranational fund is financed. We consider who contributes to the Fund, how these contributions are calculated, how they could be collected, and so on. The section also presents the pay-in formulas, which are adjusted in later sections to incorporate the experience rating and claw-back mechanisms. The contributions of the countries to the supranational fund are determined as follows: For the equivalent EUBS : each country contributes with x % of its GDP every quarter (multiplied by any national extra coefficients as detailed elsewhere in the analysis), until this cumulates to z % of the EU GDP, at which point countries stop their contributions to the Fund. If the balance drops below z% of the EU GDP, contributions restart (start-and-stop). In these equations, x is equal to 0.1% and z is equal to 0.5%. \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc66 \u2212 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc65 \u2217 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc67 % \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc48 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51; \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b For the genuine EUBS : each worker and employer contributes with a /2% of the ",

In their study, Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) devote a lot of attention to the revenue side of EUBS. A first issue that they explore is what type of taxation could be used to finance the Fund. The authors examine three mechanisms: a dedicated tax on consumption or labour, or a contribution from national governments that is not directly linked to a specific tax. For genuine EUBS, they propose to use a payroll tax because this generates a clear link between the benefits and the contributions of the scheme. A disadvantage of this tax is that it potentially raises the tax wedge on labour costs, which is already high in many EU countries. Moreover, when the payroll tax is linear, it potentially undermines to some extent non-linear social security contribution systems (e.g. in which low wages are subject to lower social contributions) that exists in some countries. In their simulations, Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) set the pay-in in the harmonized EUBS equal to 0.5% of nominal compensation. This rate was selected because it roughly balances the system. For the reinsurance model, the authors suggest a funding mechanism that is based on a contribution by governments rather than a dedicated tax. A second issue that Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) address is whether the supranational fund should be pay-as-you-go or funded . The pay-as-you-go system could result in surpluses and deficits, since the contributions are proportional to the average long-term expected annual expenditure. In this pay-as-you-go system, surpluses are used to cover potential future deficits. The funded system, in contrast, is based on a yearly contribution to be paid until a predetermined amount of funds is gathered. In this case, the pay-in used in the simulations is equal to 0.1% of GDP, which has to be paid annually until 0.5% of EU GDP is collected. Pay-in is restarted if the Fund falls below the 0.5% cut-off. In another recent paper, Beblav\u00fd et al. (2015) use the same parameters to set up the pay-in and also propose to halt it when 0.5% if EU GDP is attained. In equivalent systems where the trigger is not too low, it would function as a start/stop system. In a series of related studies, Dullien (2007; 2012) develops a basic unemployment insurance scheme that is financed through a contribution from employees and/or employers. In the basic case, his simulation results suggest that the average annual financing volume would reach 54 billion Euros, which could be financed with a payroll tax of 1.75%. When extended benefits are possible, the size of the scheme would go up to 62 or 64 billion Euros, which could be financed via a payroll tax of 2.02% and 2.04% respectively (depending on whether extended benefits are triggered for individual countries or at the level of the EMU). Based on their simulations, Dolls et al. (2014) conclude that the average benefits granted during 2000-2013 (about 49 billion Euros annually) could be covered by a contribution rate of 1.6% on employment income (uniform rate across countries). In this scenario, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands would have paid the largest net contributions while Latvia and Spain would have received the largest net benefits. This leads us to the following proposal. 16 16 One important note here, which also applies to the pay-out, is that we do not account for discounting. In the current circumstances, this seems to be a straightforward approach. One may argue, however, that in times of high inflation and/or high interest rates, discounting is ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 40 The financing of the equivalent EUBS studied in this research project works as follow: each country contributes with x % of its GDP every quarter (multiplied by national extra coefficients as detailed elsewhere in the analysis), until this cumulates to z % of the EU GDP, at which point countries stop their contributions to the Fund. If the balance drops below z% of the EU GDP, contributions restart (start-and-stop). The logic of holding the z% in reserve is to avoid or at least decrease large additional contributions by Member States precisely during the period of economic malaise. The likelihood of the negative balance obviously decreases with higher x and higher z. In other studies, we have previously suggested that x = 0.1 and z = 0.5 . The approporiateness of these coefficients was confirmed by the simulation exercises. The financing of genuine EUBS works in a similar, but not identical way: each worker and employer contributes with a /2% of the gross salary every month (so that the total sum of the contribution is equal to a % of the gross salary) and multiplied by national extra coefficients as detailed elsewhere in the analysis. We propose that the parameter (a) is set to balance the Fund on average. This implies that the Fund would be in deficit in approximately half of the years in which it would operate and in surplus during the other half. If the parameter (a) is set to a higher level, then \u2013 depending on the calibration - it would both create reserves and decrease the percentage of years in which the Fund would run an annual deficit. However, to prevent infinite aggregation of reserves, there would need to be a start-stop mechanism similar to the one proposed above for the equivalent schemes which would make it very complicated for Member States and individuals involved. Revenue-neutral contribution rates x are represented in Table 15 (derived from Task 3B). They range from 0.35 for V8 to 1.36 for V7 for the EA19 case and from 0.36 for V8 to 1.34 in V7 for the EU27 case. Table 15. Revenue-neutral contribution rates x, in per cent of employment income.

The proposal contains 2 alternatives: - automatic imposition of the claw- back - ability of the Council to suspend operation of claw-back 4.1 Background analysis on experience rating and claw-back 4.1.1 Experience rating Experience rating is one of the features that are present in the majority of the 18 potential EUBS examined in this Chapter. The mechanism of experience rating ensures that the contributions of the payers into the Fund (i.e. the pay-in) are based on their past experience with unemployment. The idea behind this concept therefore is to differentiate contributions into the supranational fund on the basis of the likelihood of recurring to it. By linking the pay-in into the Fund to the extent to which the Fund is used, the scheme avoids permanent redistribution from countries with low unemployment to countries with high unemployment. In the EUBS literature, the term experience rating often refers to countries, but it can also apply to employers as is the case in the US system. In the US, contributions are collected among employers through a payroll tax, which is higher for companies that have laid off more workers in the past. In a similar way, countries where the short-term unemployment rate is higher or more volatile may be requested to pay a higher ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 42 contribution, relative to their GDP, than other countries. Experience rating is therefore the ex-ante remedy against moral hazard and it is built in such a way to increase the contribution to the Fund of those countries that are more likely to benefit from it. 17 4.1.2 Claw-back Claw-back aims to reduce potential, long-term positive (negative) net contributions by a Member State by increasing (decreasing) that Member State\u2019s pay-in into the supranational fund. The idea of a claw-back mechanism was introduced in several early studies on unemployment insurance, such as Lin (1998). In these studies, however, the concept referred to the possibility for national governments to claim back transfers that have been mistakenly operated in favour of some recipients. In the more recent literature on EUBS, claw-back serves as a way to address the issue of non-neutral net contributions at the country-level. In our proposal, the claw-back is activated after 3 years of more than 1% of GDP cumulative negative balance vis-\u00e0-vis the central Fund and it remains active until this balance declines below the 1% level. Claw-back mechanisms have been thoroughly analysed in recent work by Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014), Dolls et al. (2014) and Dullien (2014). We will use their simulation results as a guideline for the design of the claw-back in our proposal. In his work, Dullien (2014) proposes a system by which country contribution rates are changed by 0.3% of GDP, upwards if their net contribution has been negative for two consecutive years, or downwards, if it has been greater than 1% of GDP for two consecutive years. The system is further characterised by a floor to the minimal contribution, which implies that a country\u2019s contribution to the supranational fund can never be lower than 0.1% of GDP. Dullien\u2019s (2014) simulation results indicate that a claw-back reduces the risk of non- neutral net contributions, although it limits the stabilisation capacity of the EUBS, at least in long-lasting recessions. Dolls et al. (2014) develop a mechanism by which the contribution of each country to the supranational fund is adjusted every three years. The new contribution is computed, so that, if the country will continue to receive the same amount of benefits as in the last triennium, the net balance will be reduced by 100% in the next three years (or by 50%, in the alternative option that the authors explore). Quite surprisingly, the results of their simulation indicate that neither option is very effective in reducing the risk that some countries will be net payers or contributors in the medium term. 17 The concept of experience rating has been widely examined in the economic literature. Many of these studies deal with the US system of experience rating in which employers\u2019 tax rate depends on their layoff history. In the system, experience rating is introduced to counteract the fact that an UB system lowers the costs of firing workers (Mongrain and Roberts, 2005). Theoretical work argues that experience rating is \u201cperfect\u201d when firms pay the full costs of their layoffs (Beblav\u00fd and Maselli, 2014). In this case, the introduction of unemployment insurance is not translated into higher levels of unemployment (Topel and Welch, 1980). The US system of experience rating is nevertheless incomplete (not perfect), since upper and lower bounds exist. As a result, firms with higher levels of employment volatility will be subsidised by firms with lower volatility levels (Wang and Williamson, 2002). This incompleteness may also have other implications. In an early theoretical study, Feldstein (1976) concluded that a large fraction of temporary layoffs can be attributed to imperfect experience rating. Later empirical work by Card and Levine (1994) confirms these results. These authors find a strong negative association between the rate of temporary layoff unemployment and the degree of experience rating. They estimate that \u201ca move to complete experience-rating would reduce the temporary layoff unemployment rate by about 1.0 percentage point (or roughly 50 percent) in the trough of a recession, and by about the same amount in the lowest demand months of the year (Card and Levine, 1994, p. 27)\u201d. In a number of more recent studies, using a variety of different models, the conclusion (again) is that a higher experience rating leads to lower unemployment rates (see l\u2019Haridon and Malherbet, 2009) or reduces the amplitude of recessions (Albertini, 2011). Finally, Ratner (2013) also reports a strong negative relation between experience rating and job flows: a 5% increase in the former is associated with a decrease of the latter by 1.4% on average and a drop of the unemployment rate of 0.21 percentage points on average. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 43 Our proposal is most closely related to the paper by Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014), who compare two types of EUBS: harmonised European unemployment benefits (proposed by Dullien, 2007) and unemployment reinsurance (see Beblav\u00fd et al., 2015). The first type consists of an insurance fund financed through payroll taxes and spent on unemployment benefits covering all eligible workers. The second type, which is based on a reinsurance fund, is only activated in the event of severe recessions. For each type, Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) consider two options: no long-term country-level budget neutrality (option a) and long-term country-level budget neutrality (option b). The latter, option b, can be interpreted as a claw-back mechanism. This claw-back is set into motion when countries reach a cumulative deficit vis-\u00e0-vis the system of at least 1% of GDP and is stopped when the deficit falls below this cut-off. In the harmonised UB system, a country\u2019s contribution into the Fund is doubled from 0.5% to 1% of GDP until the cumulative deficit is lower than the 1% cut-off. In the reinsurance scenario, a country is subject to a supplementary contribution of 0.2% of GDP when the claw-back is activated. Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) present simulation results for the revenues and expenditures of the schemes, as well as for the annual and cumulative balance of each country vis-\u00e0- vis the system. As the harmonised UB system with long-term budget neutrality (type 1, option b) matches best with our proposal, we only discuss these simulation results here. During the period 1999-2012, the mean expenditure by country ranged from 0.11% of GDP (Luxembourg) to 0.71% of GDP (Spain). For nine countries, the maximum expenditure exceeded 0.5% of GDP (Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Spain). In the same period, the mean revenues varied between 0.16% of GDP (Luxembourg) and 0.43% of GDP (Spain). The average contributions paid by countries into the system were the smallest in Hungary (0.24% of GDP) and Slovakia (0.23% of GDP), when Luxembourg is not considered. The lowest contributions are paid by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland (all at 0.23% of GDP) and Slovakia (0.22% of GDP), again excluding Luxembourg. On the other hand, the highest contributions paid in any given year during 1999-2012 are found in Spain (0.62% of GDP), Latvia (0.49%), Lithuania (0.44%) and Poland (0.53%). These high contributions are a result of the annual and cumulative balances of these countries vis-\u00e0-vis the system. If there was no claw-back mechanism in the system, the average annual balance would be negative in 11 countries between 1999 and 2008, with Spain (-0.22% of GDP), Lithuania (-0.11%) and Poland (-0.23%) having the largest negative balances. In years 2009-2012, this number would rise to 19 countries. In this case, large negative average annual balances are found in Estonia (-0.25% of GDP), Greece (-0.28%), Spain (-0.88%), Latvia (-0.36%) and Lithuania (-0.33%). Note that the average annual balances in the 28 countries thus generally appear to be quite small. The cumulative balance is negative and larger than 1% of GDP in Greece (-1.16% of 2012 GDP), Spain (-5.36%), Latvia (-1.70%), Lithuania (-1.57%) and Poland (-1.65%). As only 5 of the 28 countries reach a negative cumulative balance of over 1% of GDP during 1999-2012, this is a rather rare event, and one has to keep in mind that this time period is relatively short. However, if the system does include a claw-back mechanism, the claw-back would be activated in the countries with a deficit of more than 1% of GDP. This is reflected in rising contributions, as is clear from the fact that the highest revenues are found in these countries. As a result, the average annual balances of the countries change: in period 1999-2008 the balances would be at -0.16% of GDP in Spain, -0.10% in Latvia, -0.11% in Lithuania and -0.13% in Poland; between 2009 and 2012 the balances would be - 0.58% of GDP in Spain, -0.19% in Latvia, -0.22% in Lithuania and -0.11% in Poland. This results in a cumulative balance (expressed as a percentage of 2012 GDP) of -3.54% in Spain, -1.06% in Latvia, -1.14% in Lithuania and -1.06% in Poland. These cumulative balances are still above the 1% of GDP cut-off, but are much lower than when the system would not have a claw-back. For Spain the difference is between 5.36% and 3.54% of GDP. 4.1.3 Difference between experience rating and claw-back ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 44 It is useful to look at the distinction between experience rating and claw-back. This distinction seems of a more practical than a conceptual nature, even to the point that in some papers it is difficult to understand precisely how the two mechanisms differ (e.g. Dolls et al., 2014). Both experience rating and claw-back aim at adjusting the contribution of a country (or payer) to the EUBS, so that the net contribution is closer to zero in the medium- to long- term than it would be without these features. The main difference between the concepts is that experience rating is, in principle, set up to make these adjustments ex-ante, whereas claw-back adjusts the contributions ex-post. As Andor (2014, p.188) puts it: \u201cExperience rating means that the contributor versus beneficiary profile of each Member State in the scheme is monitored, and the contribution or drawdown parameters can be adjusted at the beginning of each period so as to bring the Member State closer to a projected balance with the scheme over the medium term. Claw-back, on the other hand, neutralises net transfers ex-post, meaning that Member States are allowed to be net beneficiaries for several years, but then their contribution and/or drawdown rates are modified so as to compensate for the net transfers that had occurred.\u201d In our proposal, which is discussed in more detail below, the claw-back mechanism is activated after 3 years of being a net beneficiary. The time dimension, however, is not strong enough to mark such distinction between the two correcting mechanisms. Moreover, it gave space to confusing interpretation in the above-mentioned literature. Also in our case, in fact, even though experience rating operates ex-ante (or rather de-facto in real time), while claw-back operates ex-post, both mechanisms have an ex-post dimension to them in the sense that the adjustments of countries\u2019 contributions into the Fund in both cases are based on historical data. The difference between experience rating and claw-back is, in essence, qualitative: (i) the indicator that triggers the mechanism: unemployment outcomes in the case of experience rating; financial outcomes in the case of claw-back; (ii) claw-back is defined on the basis of a (financial) objective function , and is thus more \u2018stringent\u2019 in terms of the result it produces. As is clear from the definitions presented above, changes in the adjustments of the contributions would be more frequent in a system with experience rating than in a system with claw-back (one \u201cperiod\u201d typically corresponds to one quarter when talking of a UBS). Another difference between experience rating and claw-back is that the former tends to be associated with the country\u2019s historic records in terms of unemployment, and not necessarily that of net contributions. An experience rating mechanism can therefore be thought of as a mechanism according to which the net contribution of a country is updated frequently (every quarter) on the basis of the historical series of short-term unemployment within each country. Conversely, a claw-back mechanism is updated less frequently (for example, every three years or more) and is based on the historical records of the net contributions to the EUBS. In 14 of the options considered in this study experience rating and claw-back are present at the same time (exceptions are options 1, 4, 16 and 17). This results in an \u201coverlap\u201d between options with similar goals. In addition, including both features in an EUBS also means that the countries\u2019 contributions will have to be computed according to a complex set of rules. So why are experience rating and/or claw-back needed? Assuming that exogenous risks are uniform across EU countries, any observed difference in the occurrence of unemployment risks is due to 'behaviour'. Eliminating moral hazard with adjustment mechanisms would eliminate the possibility for any country to be a net beneficiary of the scheme on average. For this reason, among the 18 options considered, there is not a single option with neither experience rating nor claw-back. V16 only has claw-back and V17 only has experience rating; but all other variants are characterised by both mechanisms. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 45 The idea behind these correcting mechanisms is to minimise moral hazard and avoid the risk of permanent transfer across countries. It is important to note, however, that in every form of unemployment insurance a certain degree of transfer exists: from workers with a lower risk of unemployment to low skilled workers in less developed areas. The more one relies on experience rating in the genuine EUBS variants, the less \u2018genuine\u2019 these schemes become, from the point of view of the individual European citizen. The fact that none of the variants considers eliminating such adjustments constitute a shortcoming because it implies that no \u2018true\u2019 insurance system will be modelled, in which the citizens will insure themselves at a European level without differences by nationality. Such a variant would be also useful to compare how experience rating and claw-back perform against the no-correction variant. Third, one could argue that the need for experience rating or claw-back is not self- evident. Even if redistribution is not taken into consideration, if the EUBS is designed with the purpose to protect against tail risk (i.e. very large unemployment shocks), then the risk of moral hazard is minimal since no government would be likely to survive a sky- rocketing unemployment rate, independently from the receiving of European funds. Despite these considerations, the legal analyses performed as part of this project suggests that experience rating and claw-back are essential for the legal feasibility of a scheme. In fact, at the EU-level, a legal base is found within the existing EU framework in Article 352 TFEU for the equivalent EUBS and in a combination of Articles 175 and 352 TFEU for the genuine EUBS. In both cases, the legal base falls within the scope of Article 125 TFEU, which is also known as the \u2018no bail-out\u2019 clause. Under this clause, the EU may grant financial assistance to Member States on the condition that this encourage labour market reforms. Experience rating and claw-back are essential tools to ensure the latter. This implies, however, that any EUBS without experience rating and claw-back would violate the no bail-out clause (and call for a modifation or removal of the clause in order to be implemented). 4.1.4 Conclusions from the policy analysis There are five conclusions from the analysis. First of all, experience rating and claw-back need to be analytically examined together, but they need to serve separate functions in order to avoid duplication and fulfil multiple policy objectives. Experience rating is an ex-ante instrument that should adjust contribution rate of participants in a given country to the level of its utilization of the system. Claw-back should be an ex-post instrument that should guarantee that a long-term relationship of any given country with the system is not in (excessive) deficit. Secondly, there is the need to distinguish and differentiate policy design between the equivalent and genuine systems. Genuine systems require ongoing contributions and pay-outs to individuals so differences in long term average of short-term unemployment rates between countries need to be included as they result in different net balance of countries with the system. In other words, if country X has a long-term average of short-term unemployment 2.3% and country Y has 5.3%, then the EUBS needs to be calibrated to take this into account and the experience rating is the best instrument to do that. On the other hand, equivalent systems are only activated when a country is in trouble RELATIVE to its OWN past performance. Therefore, the issue of comparative difference in the long-term average of short-term unemployment rates is not relevant there. This means that experience rating needs to be set up differently for the genuine and equivalent systems. This does NOT impinge on simplicity requirements since in reality ONLY ONE OR THE OTHER would be adopted, so different approaches reflecting different natures of the underlying systems present complexity for policy-makers and analysts in ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 46 making decision about which system to adopt, but NOT to users / institutions in implementation. Thirdly, there is a need to distinguish between temporary and permanent shocks in policy design while acknowledging that such distinction is impossible to make ex-ante. It is essentially unknowable at the time of the shocks to what extent the shock is temporary / permanent and what the policy reaction will be (which has a large influence on how the shock will feed into long-term growth). Even such pure exogenous shocks like the oil shock of 1973 had very different long-term effects on developed economies depending on their policy reaction. Additionally, the employment effects even of identical shocks can differ between countries and even the straightforward linkage between, for example, output gap and unemployment is subject to change in individual countries over time and cycle. Therefore, making this distinction is better suited to claw-back as the ex-post instrument. As a part of that, the system should be designed to avoid policy yo-yo that can arise for country in severe and long-term difficulties if the EUBS first delivers substantial and sustained assistance, thus building up a high level of country deficit vis-\u00e0-vis the EUBS. In the medium term, this can lead to a rapid increase in the gross country contribution to the EUBS to ensure not only that there is no continuation of annual deficit, but also to pay back the balance. Such a policy yo-yo can be limited by a combination of gradual, but rapid rise in the experience rating and a gradual claw-back procedure with an option to suspend it or slow it down. For those reasons, the policy analysis is based on experience rating that takes into account unemployment developments over the last 10 years and a claw-back procedure that starts after 3 years. Fourthly, one should acknowledge that this policy design, where decisions on key variables is centralised and homogenised as proposed in this document, limits the ability of individual Member States to manage the expenditure on the EUBS. They would not be able to pay a less generous European benefit. However, they would be able top up on it. And, at the same time they would remain free to decide on the national benefits. Fifthly, unlike the US system, our policy analysis does not contain experience rating at the firm-level. In the US system, firms\u2019 contributions are dependent on its history \u2013 if its employees make more use of the system, contributions increase. It should be noted that such firm-level coefficients are NOT forbidden or excluded in the analysis, but they would be left to Member States\u2019 discretion. This is due to the tender design. Additionally, given the varying nature of labour market regulation and industrial relations in the EU Member States, it does not seem appropriate that there should be a uniform regulation on this aspect of the labour market regulation system. In only five EU countries, Croatia, Italy, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Poland, the NUBS is financed solely by employers\u2019 contribution. In most countries, there is a mix of employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 financing and in a few cases (e.g. Denmark) the NUBS is only financed by workers. 4.2 Experience rating - proposal Experience rating reflects the fact that Member States have different long-term average of (short-term) unemployment rate as well as the fact that the way shocks feed through into short-term unemployment is also different. It needs to be: - simple and robust - rapidly reacting, automatic and non-discretionary - reflect differences between MS in both LT and ST trends - lead in general to balance of the MS contributions and pay-outs - counter-cyclical However, our proposals in this respect so far are based on two observations, which we believe to be valid even after the discussion and the comments: ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 47 - the EUBS system needs to be, to the maximum extent possible, non-discretionary - the EUBS needs to work in real time and provide rapid response to shocks whereas Therefore, the question is how to reconcile the comments received in the past months with these observations. One part of the answer is in better calibration of the experience rating, which should take into account the fact that countries have different long run averages of short-term unemployment rate and that the long run average can change within a single country due to various factors. The second part is to examine, historically, whether massive permanent shocks led to overshooting in terms of growth and whether there is an argument for smoothing change to the new growth path even if the shock is permanent. If that were the case, then the real issue would be whether to allow for \u201cwriting off\u201d of part of the EUBS claw-back if the shock proves to be permanent and GDP is lower for a significant period of time. As indicated above, one element to consider in the analysis of potential EUBS is the nature of the shocks that hit the European economies. In this regard, a distinction can be made between temporary and permanent shocks. Temporary and permanent shocks potentially interact with the EUBS in different ways; which is also reflected in the relation between the shocks on the one hand and experience rating and the claw-back mechanism on the other. The distinction between temporary and permanent shocks and their impact on the economy can further be examined on the basis of the following theoretical scenarios. In a country hit by an adverse permanent shock , unemployment increases while GDP falls. The country\u2019s economy, however, does not necessarily adjust towards a new equilibrium because the EUBS is based on unemployment rates in the last 40 quarters and the scheme\u2019s transfers stimulate aggregate demand. To the extent that these transfers keep actual unemployment below the new NAIRU, gross nominal wages and prices will go up (i.e. the Phillips curve effect), which in turn raises the unemployment benefit level and induces additional transfers. Such price increases may further result in a loss of competitiveness and higher unemployment. In this scenario, the country\u2019s capacity to repay can be strongly affected; this is where the interplay between the shock and the experience rating and claw-back becomes relevant. If the country is allowed to pay reduced net contributions to account for the gravity of the shock (e.g. by reducing the experience rating coefficient or postponing the claw-back), other countries are in fact subsidizing the delayed adjustment to this new equilibrium. Alternatively, when this is not allowed, the country\u2019s capacity to repay could result in a further decrease of GDP and additional transfers from the Fund. The scenario of a temporary shock is very different from this one, in the sense that this type of shock is not expected to affect the country\u2019s capacity to repay (in the long run, assuming no hysteresis effects). The transfers from the Fund to the country are more limited. Unemployment will likely remain above its long-term equilibrium, which lowers wages and stimulates labour demand. In this scenario, experience rating may suffice to keep the country\u2019s net GDP balance within the bounds of 1% of GDP (claw-back is not activated), or both mechanisms may quickly bring the country back below this cut-off. These theoretical scenarios, however, do not necessarily correspond to reality. A first element that supports this point is that although the economy would adjust more quickly towards a new equilibrium in the absence of unemployment benefits (in case of a permanent shock), there is a wide literature that points to downward rigidities in Europe (see Du Caju et al. (2015), Abbritti and Fahr (2013), Schmitt-Groh\u00e9 and Uribe (2013), Behr and Potter (2010), and Babecky et al. (2010)). A recent example of this is the case of Spain, where wages even increased in 2009. Not having a UBS can thus make a recession harder than necessary. A second element to consider is that severe shocks often result in a free-fall: GDP plummets, much more than necessary (\u2018overshooting\u2019). Such major economic downturns often are not anticipated, which impedes the assessment of their expected size, duration and transmission through the economy. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 48 Another important caveat to keep in mind is that at the time of the shock, it is essentially unknowable whether the shock is of a temporary or permanent nature. Indeed, shocks do not become permanent immediately. Another factor that comes into play in this discussion is what the policy reaction to the shock will be, which again is unknowable when the shock hits. The policy response, however, does have a large influence on how the shock will feed into long-term growth. An example of this is the purely exogenous oil shock in 1973, which had very different long-term implications for the developed economies depending on their policy responses. Furthermore, the employment effects of identical shocks can differ between countries and the clear-cut linkage between, for example, unemployment and the output gap, is subject to change in individual countries over time and cycle. With these considerations in mind, we propose that the EUBS should work in real-time, provide a rapid response to the shock and be non-discretionary, to the maximum extent possible. For equivalent systems, we propose to preserve the proposal from the inception report, where the experience rating is a single coefficient applying to all contributions from a given country at a given time. The value of the coefficient is determined as: 1 + 0.025 \u2217 \ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc56,(\ud835\udc61\u221240,\u2026,\ud835\udc61\u22121) where Fi,t\u201340\u2026t\u20131 is equal to the number of times that the system was activated for a given country during the last 40 quarters (t\u201340,\u2026,t\u20131). The system is activated when the unemployment in a given quarter exceeds by 0.1% (or 1% or 2%), in the \u201crainy day\u201d, \u201cstormy day\u201d and \u201creinsurance\u201d equivalent EUBS, respectively). The coefficient\u2019s range is (1, 2). The maximum value 2 applies when the system has been used in all 40 previous quarters (or when claw-back is activated). If we adjust the basic pay-in formula for equivalent schemes to take into account the experience rating, it would look as follows: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc66 \u2212 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc65 \u2217 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 \u2217 (1 + 0.025 \u2217 \ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc56,(\ud835\udc61\u221240,\u2026,\ud835\udc61\u22121) ) The short-term unemployment rate is directly related to the economic cycle and to the expenditure of the EUBS. As the activation of the trigger is also determined by a country\u2019s short-term unemployment rate, there is a clear link between the use of the Fund on the one hand and the contributions that a country has to pay on the other hand. One has to be aware, however, of the \u201cinter-temporal inconsistency\u201d that experience rating incites: a country would see its pay-in increasing at the time when it experiences a recession, arguably needing more help. Such \u201cinconsistency\u201d would decrease the usefulness of the scheme since it would aggravate the budget pressure on a crisis country. For this reason, we suggest to use the long-term average of the short-term unemployment rate (i.e. based on the previous 40 quarters). In this way, the country\u2019s pay-in would go up immediately, but slowly (with only a small amount), so that it remains a net beneficiary. Another potential solution for this problem is to make sure that the adjustment is lagged: the adjustment of the pay-in could, for example, be calculated on the basis of quarters t-40 to t-20. In this example, a country that receives benefits in 2015 will only see its pay-in to the Fund change in 2020. Note that the value of 0.025 in the equation represents the proportional increase of the country contribution due to experience rating . This value is obtained as follows: we first define a ceiling for the maximum contribution of a country relative to the base rate, as it seems inequitable to allow a difference between countries which is too large. We design the experience rating system in such a way that no country can be asked to pay more than twice as large a contribution rate than the base rate. This gives us a value equal to 1/40 = 0.025. Hence, the contribution of a country will experience an increase equal to 0.025 of the base rate for each quarter in which it received transfers from the supranational fund in the last 40 quarters. Similarly, it will experience an increase equal to 0.1 of the base rate for each year it received transfer if the system is calibrated on a yearly basis (1/10). ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 49 For genuine systems, we propose that the experience rating is a single coefficient applying to all individual contributions from a given country at a given time. The value of the coefficient is: \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc45 \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u221240,\u2026,\ud835\udc61\u22121 \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc45 \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc61\u221240,\u2026,\ud835\udc61\u22121 where the coefficient is the ratio of 10-year national average of headline short-term unemployment over the 10-year average of headline short-term unemployment for the whole EU. It would be updated every three years and its range is (0,\u221e). In other words, if country X had a long-term average 6% and EU as a whole 4%, the coefficient would be 1.5. Determining the coefficient on the basis of the 10-year average of national and EU short-term unemployment would ensure delayed feed through from unemployment rate to the experience rating to avoid pro-cyclicality of EUBS. Importantly, we propose that in the genuine schemes, experience rating should be implemented from the start (i.e. from the first year in which the scheme is implemented). If we adjust the basic pay-in formula for genuine schemes to take into account the experience rating, it would look as follows: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc66 \u2212 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc65 \u2217 \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 \u2217 ( \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc45 \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u221240,\u2026,\ud835\udc61\u22121 \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc45 \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc61\u221240,\u2026,\ud835\udc61\u22121 ) Using a long-term average ensures delayed and gradual feed through from the unemployment rate to the experience rating , to avoid pro-cyclicality of the scheme. In this way, not only the countries\u2019 past performance but also its performance relative to the other countries in Europe is taken into account. Notice that from the point of view of an insured European citizen, the introduction of country-level experience rating in a genuine system implies that a worker will pay a different price for his/her unemployment insurance than a citizen in another country, but he/she receives benefits that are defined in an identical way. We propose a fixed experience rating for a period of three years to provide stability to contributions paid by tens of millions of businesses and hundreds of millions of workers in the EU. Unlike the equivalent system where only governments are involved and frequent updating of the experience rating is administratively easy, employers and employees cannot be reasonably asked to change their contribution rates every quarter or even every year. Therefore, a 3-year period appeared to be a reasonable compromise between stability and accurate reflection of different situations in Member States. We propose that the financing of the system is equally divided between employers and employees for the sake of the simulations. This is the solution adopted by several countries, although given the heterogeneity of European models, different options do exist. The experience rating is symmetrical in the sense that contributions by Member States can be both larger and smaller than the basic pay-in depending on their unemployment rates. The tender specifications states, on p. 6, that with experience rating, contributions \u201cto the supranational scheme differ by Member States and are related to the past history of (short-term) unemployment of that Member States (with some rule for updating).\u201d This is consistent with a symmetrical approach, but it is also an option with which the expert team is most aligned with. Symmetrical approach means that no Member State should not accumulate larger and larger positive imbalances vis-\u00e0-vis the EUBS fund and thus is an important instrument to reassures governments and the public that there will be no large scale permanent transfers. If the symmetry were removed for experience rating, there would be a strong pressure to add it for claw back as an alternative, which would be against the tender specification, but \u2013 more importantly \u2013 much more disruptive and discrete in operation. 4.3 Claw-back - proposal ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 50 Claw-back is essentially a safety valve in the system that exists to provide guarantee to Member States that regardless of circumstances, Member States\u2019 contributions and pay- outs should roughly balance over the long run. Like the experience rating, claw-back should be simple, robust and counter-cyclical (or at least not pro-cyclical). Counter- cyclicality requires both a delayed and gradual application of the claw-back. To ensure the counter-cyclicality, the analysis proposed a period of three years the claw-back is implemented. This delayed implementation is important to ensure inter-temporal consistency. This is a concern that has also been raised by some of the 28 experts consulted for the feasibility analyses at the Member State level. If claw-back would be activated sooner, it would imply a substantial burden to Member States that are still in recession or the early stages of recovery. This would also affect the credibility of the claw-back mechanism. One issue not considered before is whether claw-back should be automatic or discretionary. In other words, should claw-back mechanisms be initiated automatically if conditions are met or should they be dependent on a decision of an authority (probably a political authority)? Given the terms of reference, it should generally be automatic since the purpose of the claw-back is to ensure that no country is a major long-term net beneficiary of the mechanism, which the experience rating itself does not necessarily guarantee (or guarantees only over a very long term period of 20-30 years). However, this analysis will argue for a well-structured possibility of limitations to claw-back based on a discretionary decision by a political authority (e.g. Council of Ministers). It would allow to better distinguish ex-post permanent and temporary shocks. As already argued the difference is only clear ex-post and the possibility of claw-back reduction could solve situations when a permanent shock led to a combination of lower long-term output and high long-term spending on unemployment insurance. It could be tied to structural reforms (or their outcomes) and thus incentivise better performance following shocks \u2013 opposite of moral hazard. It would not necessarily undermine the \u201cno transfer\u201d guarantee of the claw-back as the experience rating should (more gradually) lead to a similar outcome and the suspension of claw-back could be temporary. One caveat in the scenario in which a claw-back could be postponed or cancelled, however, is that this has implications on the legal feasibility of the scheme. This would violate the no bail-out clause in Article 125 TFEU. As can be read in Task 2D: \u201c Combining experience rating with claw-back mechanisms and minimum requirements with regard to activation policies leads to an overall system that sets enough incentives for national labour policies to reform their labour markets. If therefore an EUBS provides for experience rating, claw- back and minimum requirements with regard to activation policies, it can be considered as not violating Article 125(1) TFEU. It is also worth mentioning at this point that the EUBS should not include any kind of mechanism to ease these three elements in case of an economic crisis .\u201d The economic impact of excluding the claw-back become visibile in the simulations for V17 (this appears to be one of the EUBS with the highest redistributive effects).The claw-back is asymmetric in this proposal in the sense that it is activated towards countries that \u201cowe\u201d funds to the EUBS, but not to ones that have a large positive balance. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the tender states on p. 6 that claw back is \u201can ex-post mechanism aimed at preventing excessively lasting transfers from the scheme towards particular Member States\u201d \u2013 so that asymmetry was built into the work from the start. Additionally, it should be noted that since experience rating is symmetric, countries with lower pattern of use will pay less to the Fund, they will just not be entitled to receive additional funding back. For equivalent systems , experience rating and claw-back are substitutes and the claw- back coefficient is essentially the maximum value that experience rating can take. It takes the form of a single coefficient applying to all contributions by a given country at a given time where the coefficient = 2. It applies after 3 years of more than 1% of GDP cumulative negative balance vis-\u00e0-vis the central Fund until the balance declines below 1% of GDP. For clarity, we remind the reader that the \u2018coefficient\u2019 is depicted by 1 + 0.025 * F i,t in the pay-in formula. Note that the value of this coefficient is equal to 2 when F is equal to ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 51 40 (implying that the scheme is used in all past 40 quarters). The pay-in formula would then look like this: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc66 \u2212 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc65 \u2217 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 \u2217 2 For genuine systems, we suggest that the claw-back is paid by Member State governments (which then determine what will be the financial source) rather than by employers and employees. Our suggestion is for an annual 0.2% GDP contribution that would start to be paid after 3 years of more than 1% of GDP cumulative negative balance vis-\u00e0-vis the central Fund and would continue to be paid until the balance drops below 1% of GDP. The appropriateness of this value has been confirmed in the simulations performed in Tasks 3B/C. The reason for this proposal is that if a claw-back is activated, the country is likely to be still in a prolonged bout of unemployment or just recovering from it. Employers and employees from such a country would already be paying higher contributions after the 3- yearly revision of the experience rating. Additional automatic and significant increase of labour taxation under such circumstances because of temporary surge in unemployment benefits is not an advisable policy. It would also add to technical complexity of the system for employers and employees. The figure 0.2% of GDP was chosen based on the combination of the following: - it is the penalty under the SGP for violation of preventive or corrective rules - given that that the average annual size of the gross contributions / payments from the EUBS can be estimated in the range of 0.1 \u2013 0.4% of GDP (depending on the version of the system), it should be sufficient in all but most extreme circumstances to bring down the imbalance below 1% of GDP within a few years. 4.4 Stylised examples of joint operation of experience rating and claw-back This section presents some stylised examples and shows how experience rating and claw- back would operate under such circumstances. The reason for doing that is to make it easier for the reader to imagine how the proposed system would operate in practice. These stylised examples are based on simple calculations and do not replace actual simulations that will be undertaken as a part of Task 3. We present four possible cases: - A temporary and short-lived shock that hits the economy : the shock increases the short-term unemployment rate and hence raises the country\u2019s use of the EUBS. The experience rating is active; the claw-back mechanism is never activated. As the shock was of a temporary and short-lived nature, the experience rating suffices to keep the country within the bounds of a negative cumulative balance vis-\u00e0-vis the Fund of 1% of GDP. This scenario therefore singles out what the impact of the experience rating could be. - A temporary but longer-lasting shock : as the shock is longer lasting in this scenario, both the experience rating and the claw-back are active. Claw-back is activated after a period of 3 years of a negative cumulative balance exceeding 1% of GDP. When the claw- back is activated, the balance is quickly falls to below the 1% level, after which claw- back is stopped. This scenario thus has the objective to show how experience rating and claw-back could operate together . - A severe temporary or permanent shock : given the severity and duration of the shock, in such a scenario both the experience rating and claw-back would become operational. However, in our proposal we mentioned that the claw-back mechanism could be suspended for some time, to avoid impeding economic recovery of countries hit by such shocks (as stated above, suspension would be subject to the approval of the Council, in the case of the genuine EUBS). This scenario illustrates a case where experience rating is active from the start , but insufficient. Claw-back should therefore be activated after 3 years of a negative cumulative balance larger than 1% of GDP but is not because it is ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 52 suspended for 2 years. After this period, claw-back becomes active and quickly lowers the cumulative balance. - A severe temporary or permanent shock: this scenario is similar to the previous one. The main difference is that we show that suspensions of the claw-back could also mean that in the end the mechanism is never activated at all. This happens because the experience rating manages to reduce the negative cumulative balance to the 1% level after a sufficiently long period of time. In summary, in this scenario the experience rating is the sole mechanism that is operational . In each scenario, we start off with a shock that hits the economy in the first quarter of year zero. In each graph, we start from a situation in which the country already has a cumulative negative balance vis-\u00e0-vis the central Fund that takes a value of 0.5% to 0.6% of GDP. This number was chosen in a purely arbitrary way, for illustration purposes only. Still, in the simulation exercises of Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) (which cover genuine and reinsurance schemes), the negative cumulative balance of several countries does in fact reach the 0.5% of GDP level or even surpasses it (examples are Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland). In the first scenario, we start from a shock that is small, temporary and short-lived. An example of such a shock could be the economic downturn in the United States in 2001, which has been described as short and shallow (Kliesen, 2003). The downturn lasted for about 8 months. Note that in the graphs presented below, we explore the potential impact of the shock of the cumulative balance of the country vis-\u00e0-vis the Fund through time, the length of the shock is not represented in the figures 18 . In Figure 11, we show a potential scenario that may have resulted from a small, temporary and short-lived shock. In this scenario, the experience rating on its own is likely to suffice to keep the country within the bounds of 1% of GDP net balance so the claw-back would not be activated. This outcome is desirable from the system\u2019s point of view. In the graph, the country\u2019s negative net balance increases from the first quarter of year zero until the second quarter of year four, after which the balance starts to go down. The country is going through an economic recovery phase. 18 Furthermore, one has to be aware that these graphs were created with the purpose to elucidate how the interaction between experience rating and claw-back could work, which means that the time line presented is likely to be longer than it would be in reality. This, however, allowed us to generate sufficiently large graphs that would illustrate our point. ",

The experience rating by itself is sufficient to keep the country within the bounds of 1% of GDP net balance. Source : Authors\u2019 elaboration. A second possibility is that the shock that hit the economy was small and temporary, but longer lasting. To clarify what \u2018longer lasting\u2019 could mean in this case, we draw on the literature. For the US, Labonte and Makinen (2002) find that the average length of a recession during the post-World War II period is equal to 11 months. Some examples for the US that meet with this criterion are the April 1960-February 1961 recession (10 months, contraction of GDP 1.6%) and the December 1969-November 1970 recession (11 months, contraction of GDP 0.6%) (Labonte and Makinen, 2002). In these cases, the downturn lasted longer than the average, but the impact on GDP could be described as relatively limited. We use this scenario as an example of what could happen if the shock was small, temporary, and longer lasting, but causing the claw-back to become operational. If the shock had been temporary, but longer lasting, the increasing experience rating might have brought the net balance below the 1% of GDP or it might be somewhat above threshold after 3 years. In that case, claw-back would be activated and this, together with the experience rating is likely to decline the country\u2019s net balance below the 1% of GDP threshold in 1-2 following years. This outcome is desirable from the system\u2019s point of view. This scenario is depicted in Figure 12 . The claw-back is activated after 3 years (in the first quarter of year 5), which reduces the cumulative deficit to less than 1% of GDP in the last quarter of that year. 0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 1 1,1 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 y0 y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 y8 y9 y10 n e t G D P b a l a n c e time line Stylised example of a temporary and short-lived shock 1% of GDP EXPERIENCE RATING : is sufficient to keep the country within the bounds of 1% of GDP net balance CLAW-BACK : is not activated in this scenario shock in y0 q1 ",

The experience rating by itself is not sufficient to keep the country within the bounds of 1% of GDP net balance, the claw-back is activated after three years of a deficit of over 1%. Source : Authors\u2019 elaboration. The final scenario that we explore is what would happen if the shock had been permanent, or even if it had been temporary but very severe. In the first two scenarios, we also considered temporary shocks, but assumed that their impact on the real economy remained limited. One element that needs further clarification, therefore, is how we differentiate between non-severe (small/mild) and severe temporary shocks. In case of a severe shock, we assume that although the shock is temporary, it does have a strong impact on GDP and unemployment. According to Labonte and Makinen (2002), the most severe recession in their sample is the double-dip crisis of the early 1980s. Between January 1980 and July 1980, GDP contracted 2.2% while the maximum unemployment rate was 7.8%. Shortly afterwards, between July 1981 and November 1982, GDP contracted 2.9% and the maximum unemployment rate reached 10.8%. Another severe recession was that between November 1973 and March 1975. Then, GDP contracted with 3% and the maximum unemployment rate was 9%. The depth or severity of a recession can thus be evaluated on the basis of its impact on GDP growth. For the United States, for example, GDP fell by 27% during the Great Depression and unemployment peaked at 25%. In more recent recession, the impact on GDP and unemployment has never reached these levels. In the Great Recession, for instance, the numbers are 4.3% and 10% for the US respectively. One can imagine that in such a case, a country might find itself high above the cumulative balance at 1% of GDP threshold for claw-back, while, at the same time, it would be under significant fiscal stress. Here a well-structured mechanism for deciding whether all or part of the claw-back would be suspended if needed. The decision would be political in the end, meaning taken by the Council, but it should be on the proposal of the Commission and based on estimates of: - severity and permanent nature of the shock - reforms undertaken or committed by the country to counter the effect of the shock ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 55 However, one has to be aware of the potential legal implications of such a suspension (see above). Suspension of the claw-back would not suspend experience rating, so the country would likely continue as net payer for some time to come. This is likely to bring Member States frequently below the 1% of GDP threshold anyway. The final two stylised examples in Figure 13 and Figure 14 below, present the case of a severe temporary or permanent shock. Some historical examples that could match with such shocks are the Great Depression of the 1930s and the transition of Eastern Europe in the 1990s. In both stylised examples, we consider what might happen if the claw-back mechanism does not become active after 3 years, as it would normally do, but is suspended instead. The scenario in Figure 13 presents a case in which the claw-back is activated after 5 years in the first quarter of year 7 (it is suspended for two years), then quickly reducing the country\u2019s cumulative net balance to 1% of GDP. The scenario in Figure 14 shows a case in which the claw-back initially is suspended for 3 years (which means that it would become active in the first quarter of year 8), but is never activated as the experience rating sufficed to bring the cumulative balance of the country back to the 1% of GDP threshold. We again emphasise that these figures are presented here to make it easier for the reader to understand how experience rating and claw-back could operate under different \u2013hypothetical- circumstances. They are based on simple calculations and cannot be considered substitutes for the simulations part of Tasks 3B/3C. Figure 13. Stylised example of a severe temporary or a permanent shock.

Debt-issuing possibility In the case of debt-issuing, when the global balance of the EUBS becomes negative, the Fund can bring it to 0 by borrowing on the market. If debt-issuing is not possible, then the resources needed to avoid a negative financial position of the EUBS will be contributed by the Member States, in proportion to their GDP. The proposal is the same for both the equivalent and genuine schemes. There are three options for dealing with potential annual imbalance in the EUBS as a whole: - issuing debt to cover the imbalance - adjusting some of the variables of the scheme to achieve balance (replacement rate, eligibility\u2026) - requiring some additional contributions by the Member States to cover the shortfall (notice that in this case the Member State may, in turn, be in the necessity of borrowing resources to pay these contributions to the Fund) ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 57 The authority to issue debt can be capped ex-ante, which would be politically more acceptable, but would also necessitate provisions for dealing with imbalances exceeding the cap (reducing benefits or special contributions by Member States). One issue that should influence the possibility and the extent of the debt-issuing is the type of shock one finds in the EU/Euro Area. If shocks are asymmetric, then the case for issuing debt is weaker due to the fact that at any point in time there will always be a group of countries that contributes and a group that borrows from the Fund. According to Allard et al. (2013), a surprising number of asymmetric shocks have hit European countries since the establishment of the European Union. However, common shocks are also likely, as the 2008/2009 crisis and its aftermath made very clear. Hence, while an EUBS without borrowing powers can already be appealing given that it offers the possibility to insure countries against asymmetric shocks, additional benefits could be generated by a debt-issuing EUBS. Without debt, the system must be able to deal with the lack of backstopping through a combination of the remaining two options. Given the institutional complexity of the European Union, the solution should be automatic and pre-determined rather than left to discretion. It is likely that balancing the EUBS\u2019 reserves by reducing the level or duration of individual entitlements during a crisis would lead to bad social outcomes, and that it would hit the economy in a moment of crisis. In light of these considerations, we suggest that in the cases where debt-issuing is not foreseen the solution comes from paying an additional contribution. For the equivalent EUBS, there are two options if the Fund balance goes below 0. If it is allowed to borrow, it borrows from the financial market; if not, it increases the contribution of the Member States, proportional to their GDP to achieve annual balance. In other words, Member States pay an extra contribution until it is needed to keep the Fund afloat. For the genuine EUBS , there are three options if the Fund balance becomes negative. If it is allowed to borrow, it does so from the financial market. Debt issuing is possible if the supranational fund can borrow money from the capital markets in order to cover short-term imbalances. If the Fund is not allowed to borrow, there are two options: - increasing individual contributions in all Member States by a temporary coefficient - asking for a special contribution of the Member States, proportional to their GDP, which the Member States would be allowed to raise as they see fit Since the Fund\u2019s depletion is likely only when a major symmetric shock hits and increasing individual contributions by a temporary coefficient is equivalent to increase in labour taxes across all Member States, this does not appear to be an optimal policy combination. Therefore, we propose that the funding mix for a special contribution would be determined by the Member States governments. This option should also be used for any build-up of the Fund reserves at its start. Technical aspects of both options (borrowing, special Member State contribution) would be expanded in more detail in deliverables under Tasks 2C and 2D. Legal, political and technical challenges connected to implementation of either option are likely to be substantial, but are not tied to policy analysis of the 18 EUBS options as such. Therefore, the expertise will be provided in Task 2. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 58 6. Basic EUBS According to the tender specifications, in a basic genuine EUBS, the supranational fund pays out the UB according to the pre-defined replacement rate to the unemployed person for a pre-defined number of months. Each single country is free to increase the paid amount or the duration at its own expense. Virtually every study on EUBS (with the exception of Delpla, 2012) has recommended this type of EUBS (see next section). 7. Top-up EUBS According to the tender specifications, in a top-up genuine scheme, every eligible unemployed person is guaranteed a given replacement rate and duration. If the national UBS is generous enough to cover these costs, then the supranational fund does not contribute to the unemployment benefit of the unemployed citizens. If, however, the national UBS does not meet the minimal duration and replacement rate requirements, then the supranational fund supplements the payments of the national fund by the necessary amount to meet these requirements. As such, this type of scheme might be better understood as filling the gap between the supranational and the national allowance rather than topping up. The two schemes are similar in one respect: both impose minimal standards for the requirements and generosity of unemployment benefits, and leave countries free to implement more generous systems at their own cost. One key difference concerns which countries receive money from the supranational fund: in the basic scheme, every country can be a beneficiary; in the top-up scheme, countries with a UBS more generous than the standard cannot be beneficiaries. Another important difference is in terms of cost of the supranational scheme. The amount of contributions to finance the basic EUBS at the supranational level would be much higher than the contributions needed to finance only the top-up scheme, as the latter requires to pay only for those countries with less generous UBS. Hence, in a top-up scheme, countries have an incentive to reduce the generosity of their UBS, as noticed by Delpla (2012). In game theory terms, we may say that the top-up scheme is not strategy-proof, in the sense that individual countries do not have an incentive to choose what they think is the optimal level of generosity for their UBS. However, this problem may be mitigated if there were a claw-back or any other provisions that bring the long-term financial position of countries close to neutrality. The majority of papers in the literature that discuss in some depth the functioning of the European insurance scheme suggest the basic option (Beblav\u00fd and Maselli, 2014; Dullien, 2012, 2013). The only paper suggesting something that can be considered a top-up scheme is Delpla (2012). However, the author\u2019s proposal is somehow more complex, as it is based on the idea that workers, when taking a job, may decide to sign a European labour contract instead of the national one. The European labour contract would be the same as the national one except for a few provisions, among which a higher level of unemployment benefits (although the paper is not very clear in this respect). Please note that in the modelling exercise, variant N.6 is the only one that can only be modelled in the forward-looking analysis. The reason is that EUROMOD does not contain historical policy rules of national unemployment benefit systems (spanning the period 1995-2013) which is why their simulation is not possible in the backward-looking analysis.

        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 59 8. Cyclical variability The cyclical variability of an EUBS is the extent to which some of the parameters defining the EUBS (for example, the replacement rate or the duration) are a function of variables related to the economic cycle. In this research project, cyclical variability is defined as a dichotomous variable, so that it is present in V15 only. We propose to define cyclical variability as an extension of the unemployment benefits for a period of maximum 6 months, in addition to the normal provision, as long as the short-term unemployment rate in the previous quarter is higher than the 10 years average short-term UR + 3%. These benefits would be financed from the general EU budget. It is argued in Beblav\u00fd et al. (2015) about the American system that \u201cone of the added values of the federal system lies in the possibility to extend benefits in exceptional cases of severe recessions in one or more states, i.e. when the stabilisation tool is most needed. This takes place via the extended and emergency benefits, with the former partially and the latter completely financed at the federal level. 19 Extended benefits are the geographically redistributive part of the system. {\u2026} The possibility to top up national systems whenever there is no sign of recovery in the economy is certainly an interesting feature. Such decisions, however, can be taken in the United States relatively quickly. For additionality to be implemented in the EU, automated decision-making would be necessary given the intrinsic slow nature of decision-making at the European level.\u201d As explained in detail by Whittaker and Isaacs (2014), in the US the extended benefits (BE) programme is \u201cpermanently authorized and applies only to certain states on the basis of state unemployment conditions\u201d. The emergency benefits instead need to be explicitly authorized by the Congress, which did so eight times in the past: in 1958, 1961, 1971, 1974, 1982, 1991, 2002 and 2008 (ibid). The Department of Labor produces trigger notices indicating which states qualify for both EB and emergency benefits and provides the beginning and ending dates of payable periods for each qualifying state (ibid). The total maximum number of weeks an unemployed worker is eligible for benefits is between 40 and 93 weeks; that is between 10 and 23 months. In light of these considerations and taking into account the differences between the EU and the US we propose that, in variant N15, cyclical variability is implemented in a non- discretionary manner as a part of ex-ante defined conditions. For a non-discretionary decision it is therefore necessary to define a triggering variable. For this, we propose the short-term unemployment rate, consistently with the selection of the trigger in equivalent system (see section E.3 for a discussion of why short-term unemployment rate is superior to other indicators). One could imagine two forms of cyclical variability: longer benefits and higher benefits. We lean towards the former following the rationale of the US system, in which it is the lack of vacancies that makes it necessary to help the economy and the unemployed worker in the transition towards a better phase of the cycle, more than the generosity of the system. As a result of this discussion, we recommend that benefits are extended for a period of maximum 6 months, in addition to the normal provision as long as the short- term unemployment rate in the previous quarter is higher than the 10 years average short-term UR + 3%. These benefits would be financed from the general EU budget. Had cyclical variability been in place since 2000 in this form, it would have been activated 19 times in the EU, all of them after 2008. This is consistent with the idea of extending the benefit in case of major downturns. 19 During the recent Great Recession the federal government paid 100% of the cost for EB benefits and all EUC08 benefits. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 60 The additional proposal is to link cyclical variability also to a European rather than national cycles and therefore to be activated in case of EU-wide major downturn. We propose as definition of deep shock a recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth) in half+1 of the Member States simultaneously. Also in this case, unemployment benefits would be granted to the short-term unemployed workers for up to 6 additional months. With these considerations in mind, we reach the following proposal. At the policy-level, we propose to have two forms of cyclical variability: one tied to the national-level and one tied to the EU-level. In both cases, cyclical variability is not automatic, and only occurs in exceptional situations. At the EU-level, cyclical variability would have to be granted. At the national-level, Member States should have the option to ask for an extension of benefits when this would be needed. We refrain from proposing an automatic cyclical variability mechanism for a variety of reasons. First of all, the duration of the benefits already is relatively long, unlike in the US. Secondly, when benefits would be extended automatically, this would imply that countries would have to pay back more in the future (which is an additional burden). Moreover, the mechanism is likely to interfere with the labour market institutions of the Member State and with the idea of a \u2018non-transfer\u2019 Union. Note that the EU-level cyclical variability will not be part of the modelling exercises, given that it should only be used in highly exceptional circumstances. National-level cyclical variability will be modelled, and in this case we assume that any country that would \u2018qualify\u2019 for an extension of unemployment benefits would indeed make use of it. 9. Duration The duration is the number of months during which the unemployment benefit is paid out. Throughout the ToR, there seems to be the assumption that the replacement rate will not vary by month, although this is not necessarily the case in the national UBS. According to the tender specifications, the benefits are paid from the beginning of the 4 th month after losing employment to the end of the 12 th month in the baseline EUBS, from the beginning of the 1 st month to the end of the 12 th month in the variant option 7, and from the beginning of the 4 th month to the end of the 6 th month in the variant option 8. 20 Within the Eurozone, in 2010, duration was longest in Belgium (with no upper limit) and shortest in Malta and Slovakia (6 months). However, in about half the countries duration was between 8 and 12 months (European Commission, 2013). It seems reasonable to expect that the EUBS maximum duration would be between 6 and 12 months. The latter maximum duration would imply that the duration of the UB would have to be extended in almost half of the countries. In contrast, if the maximum duration were chosen to be 6 months, then in no country it would be needed to extend the UBS duration. Most simulation studies set the maximum duration to 12 months (Dullien, 2007, 2012, 2013; Beblav\u00fd and Maselli, 2014; Dolls et al, 2014). The micro-simulation study by Jara and Sutherland (2014) proposes a slightly different scheme, in which benefits can be paid out until the twelfth month, but starting from the fourth month, so that the duration 20 The ToR does not specify if \u201cmonth 3\u201d means the point in which the 3 rd month after losing employment ends (and the 4 th month begins \u2013 which is our interpretation) or the point in which the 3 rd month after losing employment begins. However, the inclusion of \u201cmonth 0\u201d in V1 makes this point clear, since the unemployment month cannot start before the beginning of the first month. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 61 is actually 9 months, but the payment is postponed compared to the UBS proposed in the rest of the literature and existing in every European country. This is in line with the way duration is specified in the Tender (except in V7). According to Strauss et al. (2013), this excludes from the benefits very short-term unemployment (such as unemployment while changing jobs), or seasonal unemployment. This is an important point. As is explained elsewhere in the project, a three-month waiting period in the beginning of unemployment means that many will first receive benefits from the national schemes, and then switch to the EUBS. In several countries, the national schemes will be restarted when the EUBS has stopped, or alternatively the social assistance system comes into play. This is operationally and administratively difficult and it is likely associated with considerable fluctuations in the benefit amounts. The feasibility analyses therefore suggest to start the EUBS in month zero. This, however, has to be weighed against the fact that the EUBS is not necessarily intended to cover very short-term fluctutations and seasonal unemployment which are not directly related to the functioning of the EMU. Economic literature usually argued, both on the basis of theoretical models and of empirical results, that the longer the duration of benefits, the lower the incentives of the unemployed to look for jobs (see Card et al., 2007, for a review). This has usually been an argument to favour shorter benefits duration. However, as the Card et al. (2007) results indicate, the effect of benefits duration on job search may be much weaker than it was previously thought. 10. Replacement rate The replacement rate is the proportion of the reference wage that will be paid out as an unemployment benefit, so that the unemployment benefit equals the reference wage times the replacement rate. The replacement rate is 50% (baseline variant), 35% (variant 9) or 60% (variant 10), and it is applied to the gross wage. In the next section, we suggest that national governments can convert the reference wage to the net wage using an appropriate conversion ratio. A replacement rate can imply a very different benefit level, depending on whether the reference wage is gross or net. Given that most countries and simulation studies use the gross wage as the reference wage, it is convenient to refer to gross wages in this document as well. Across the European Union, \u201cgross replacement rates vary greatly between 80 per cent in Luxembourg and 13 per cent in the United Kingdom. Gross replacement rates are on average somewhat higher in Eurozone countries, around 50 per cent, as compared to slightly below 40 per cent in countries outside the common currency.\u201d (Esser et al., 2013, p. 9). Micro-simulation studies on EUBS usually set the replacement rate at 50% (Jara and Sutherland, 2014; Dolls et al., 2014). Macro-simulation studies cannot compute the benefit at the individual level via a replacement rate, but usually decide on a replacement rate and they translate this decision into assumptions on the UBS costs. Again, usually the choice falls on a replacement rate of about 50% (Dullien, 2007, 2012, 2013), although Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) choose a slightly lower replacement rate (40%). Replacement rates fixed at this level seem to be a reasonable compromise between the social demand for mechanisms that stabilise household income in difficult economic moments, and the risk of distortionary incentives that too generous unemployment benefits may have on the job search effort of the unemployed (Krueger and Mueller, 2010). Hence, we chose 50% of the gross wage as the replacement rate for our EUBS scheme. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 62 11. Reference Wage The reference wage is defined as the average wage in the last x months (where x may be equal to 1), either net or gross. The reference wage is the last gross monthly wage. However, we propose that national governments have the option to convert this to net wage in such a way that the replacement rate for the net wage would be equivalent to 50% replacement rate for the gross wage for the average worker. We also suggest that national governments in countries with flat-rate unemployment benefits can convert the benefit into a flat-rate benefit if the flat-rate benefit is equivalent to 50% of the gross average wage. In 2013, 11 out of 17 Eurozone countries used gross wages as the reference wages, and three used net wages (AT, FI and DE). For the other three countries (IE, MT and GR) the distinction was not relevant, because the benefits are flat-rate or structured in a way similar in some respects to a flat-rate scheme (Esser et al., 2013). Micro-simulation studies (Jara and Sutherland, 2013; Dolls et al., 2014) usually compute benefits using gross wages as a reference. In macro-economic simulation studies, it is usually not explicitly mentioned whether the EUBS would use gross or net wages as the reference wage. One exception is Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014), who use total compensation, meaning gross wage plus employer social security contributions. These authors make the interesting case that gross wage is not ideal for a supranational UBS, because it includes social contributions paid by the employee but not by the employer. Hence, the gross wage can be changed by national legislation by moving a part of the social contribution from the employer to the employee (or vice versa), while leaving both net wages and social contributions unchanged. This is not possible with nominal compensation, which includes both social contributions paid by the employee and by the employer (Eurostat, 2015). As a result, the nominal compensation would seem more robust to strategic decisions of the governments aiming at maximising the revenues from the EUBS. Despite this argument, we choose the gross wage as the reference wage, following the majority of authors and countries. The second element that defines the reference wage is the period over which it is calculated. This can be very different across the European Union, ranging from the Netherlands, where the reference wage is the last salary, to Lithuania, where the average wage over the last three years is used instead (Esser et al., 2013). Simulation studies often do not explicitly mention over how many salaries the reference wage is computed. Usually, the reference wage is equal to the most recent wage (e.g. Jara and Sutherland, 2013), although in some cases it is equal to the average over more periods (12 months in the study by Dullien, 2007). In general, there are no compelling arguments for choosing a particular value for x (the number of monthly wages of which the reference wage is the average). If x is low, the reference wage will typically be higher, so the replacement rate will have to be lower to guarantee the same level of benefits compared to a scheme where x is higher. Furthermore, if x is low, there will be an advantage for those workers who enjoyed large salary growth in the last months or years. As salary increase is higher among younger workers, this means that, from a generational point of view, a low value of x tends to advantage the younger generation. We chose for x=1, following the choice of many studies and countries, and because of the improved intergenerational equity outcome. There are also no compelling arguments for choosing between net or gross wage. As the income tax system is progressive in most countries, using the net wage as the reference wage seems to be more progressive, as there is more difference in gross than in net wages. However, this depends on whether unemployment benefits are taxed or not. If they are taxed, then an element of progressivity is introduced even if the gross wage is used as a reference. Across Europe, there are countries that tax unemployment benefits ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 63 and collect social contributions from them, countries that do not, and countries that apply special forms of taxation (Esser et al., 2013). We choose the gross wage because it is consistent with the choice of most countries and papers in the literature. National conversion of the reference wage from gross to net Some countries use the net wage as the reference wage, meaning that the whole operational system (including data collection and processing) of their UBS works on the basis of net wages. We believe that it would be difficult for these countries to adjust to using gross wages as the reference. One solution to this problem could be that the national system defines a new replacement rate to be applied to the net wage. The new replacement rate could be chosen (in agreement between the European Commission and the Member State) in such a way that the unemployment benefit received by the average worker remains the same as with using the EUBS replacement rate and the gross wage as the reference. This will not affect the simulations carried out in the context of our research project, because it is supposed to imply only minor variations in the level of the benefits received by single individuals. 12. Eligibility Eligibility rules determine which unemployed citizens qualify for UB. They define some minimum requirements for EUBS coverage, which in turn affect the incentives in place for individuals and the stabilisation effect of the EUBS. We call this \u2018narrow eligibility\u2019, as it concerns the entitlements conditions for the unemployed to qualify for UBs, and it is therefore different from Venn (2012) who includes activation policies. According to the tender specifications, eligible workers will be those who became unemployed after working (not necessarily consecutively) as employees for 3 (full-time equivalent) months out of the last 12 in the baseline specification, 3 months out of the last 6 in the variant 11, and 12 months out of the last 24 in the variant 12. Eligibility rules indirectly determine the coverage rate, defined by Esser et al. (2013) as the number of insured persons as a percentage of the labour force (hence a proxy for the proportion of unemployed individuals who qualify for benefits). The coverage rate is about 75% both in the Eurozone and in the European Union at large (Esser et al., 2013). However, the rate can be very different from country to country, ranging from full coverage (95% or more) in Finland, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Sweden, to less than 60% in Spain, Slovakia, Italy, Poland and Romania. This depends on which minimum conditions are set in place to be eligible for unemployment benefits. For example, Romania has a very low coverage rate because the self-employed are excluded from the UBS, and a large proportion of the Romanian workforce is self-employed. Hence, including having worked as an employee as a minimum condition for eligibility may reduce the potential of the EUBS to tackle economic shocks by excluding a large proportion of workers from the insurance mechanism, as already noticed by Strauss et al. (2013). In other cases, such as Italy or Spain, a low coverage rate may be partly due to restrictive minimum conditions in terms of the number of months that the insured worker must have worked in the past months. In Italy and Spain this number is 12, as in variant 12, which may be expected to produce a relatively low coverage rate as a result. The coverage rate of a potential EUBS is difficult to determine a priori, because it must be computed once the eligibility rules have been defined. Macro-simulation studies of the EUBS circumvent this problem by defining a \u201cpick-up rate\u201d, i.e. by supposing that the eligibility rules will be such that the coverage rate will equal the pick-up rate that they use in the simulation. For example, Beblav\u00fd and Maselli (2014) assume a pick-up rate of 75%, Pisani-Ferry et al. (2013) assume that the pick-up rate will be the same under the EUBS as it is in the current NUBS, and Dullien models the pick-up rate as a function of short-term unemployment. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 64 One particularly important eligibility rule determines how many months the citizen must have worked in a specified period prior to remaining unemployed, in order to receive UB. For example, at the moment of becoming unemployed, a citizen may be required to have worked at least 3 out the last 12 months to qualify for UB (this is the baseline option specified in the tender). Hence, this eligibility rule is defined by an employment record needed to qualify (in terms of number of months \u2013 3 in the previous example) and a reference period used to assess the employment record (12 in the previous example). The ratio between these two gives the implicit minimum share of months/time worked needed to qualify (25% in the previous example). In the literature reviewed in this chapter, the relevant variable for eligibility is always the proportion of months worked in a given reference period, and the additional requirement that these months have been worked consecutively (as it is the case in the national legislation of some countries) is never mentioned. Hence, when referring the number of months worked during a reference period, we do not mean consecutive months. Finally, it is to be decided whether these months should be worked full-time or not. A number of countries rely on the full-time equivalent number of months (Strauss et al., 2013). We choose this indicator for the amount of time worked, because it does not exclude part-time employees a priori, but at the same time it excludes those workers that have worked for a relatively long period but only a very limited amount of hours. Within Europe, there is considerable variation in this respect. The implicit minimum share ranges from 14% (France) to 75% (Latvia), although this share is between 40 and 60% for almost half of the countries. The reference period ranges from 3 months (SK) to 60 (ES), with a large majority of countries somewhere in between 18 and 36 months. Also in the existing literature there is variation with respect to the eligibility requirements of the EUBS. For example, Jara and Sutherland (2014) maintain the national implicit minimum share unaltered for every country, whereas Dolls et al. (2014) require that the unemployed has had any labour income in the last 12 months, hence setting the implicit minimum share very close to 0. A second important set of eligibility rules determine which categories of workers are covered. For example, these rules determine if self-employed or agricultural workers are eligible to receive the benefits. Micro-simulation studies of EUBS usually include the self- employed in the scheme (Jara and Sutherland, 2014; Dolls et al, 2014). In fact, there is no theoretical argument for excluding self-employed workers from the UBS, and Strauss et al. (2013) write that including self-employed has the potential to increase the stabilisation effect of the EUBS. We would recommend the self-employed workers of all European countries to be included in the EUBS, at least for the purposes of our simulation. However, including the self-employed in the EUBS may be difficult for administrative reasons, as these workers are not necessarily in the main national unemployment schemes, and have instead access to different schemes. This would undermine the basic idea of an EUBS that is implemented at minimal cost by relying on the existing national administrative structure for collecting payments and operating transfers (an idea proposed by virtually all the literature on the topic, see e.g. Dullien 2007, 2012, 2013; Andor, 2014; Beblav\u00fd and Maselli, 2014; Vetter, 2014). The feasibility of including the self-employed in the EUBS should be assessed in light of political and administrative considerations. The question of eligibility is in reality more complicated than what has been suggested so far. For example, many countries define qualifying periods by reference to insurance or contribution payment, rather than employment. They also tend to specify certain periods which are assimilated to employment for this purpose, such as child-rearing. Furthermore, some Member States exempt certain people from the qualifying period or allow that the reference period is extended in some cases. For the simplicity of the analysis, we define eligibility in such a way that these arrangements would not apply for establishing entitlement to the EUBS. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 65 13. Capping A UB is capped if it cannot exceed a given proportion of the national average wage. For example, if the reference wage of an unemployed citizen is 3000 EUR and the replacement rate is 70%, then her expected UB is 2100 EUR. However, if the average national wage is 1000 EUR and there is a capping at 150% of the average national wage, then the aforementioned unemployed citizen will receive only 1500 EUR. According to the tender specifications, capping is set at 150% of the average national gross wage in the baseline EUBS, at 100% in the variant 13, and at 50% in the variant 14. Capping exists in a number of UBS, such as those of the US and Greece (Dullien, 2007). Dullien (2007) suggests that, although the literature for the US suggests to cap the unemployment benefits at two thirds of the average national wage, in Europe it would be more appropriate to cap them at 50% of the national wage. The reason is that choosing a European limit of two thirds of the average national wage would mean that many European countries should increase the limit that they chose in their national legislation. Delpla (2012) suggests capping benefits at 2000 EUR euro-wide (with the possibility of introducing lower caps for countries where wages are lower than the European average). This would be equal to around 100% or 75% of the average European wage, depending if the author referred to net or gross wage. In terms of the efficacy of the stabilisation mechanism, it seems that per euro spent on the UBS, more consumption is generated if the cap is low, because the propensity to consume is higher when the income is low. For example, if households are cash- constrained and the cap is set at a very low level, say 500 EUR, then it is likely that almost every euro spent as a transfer to the household will be spent on consumption. From a social point of view, however, introducing a low cap may produce disappointment in some households that will see their lifestyle dramatically worsening as a consequence of unemployment. Furthermore, needless to say, if the cap is set very low, the financial flow towards the economy hit by a recession may be too low for stabilization purposes. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 66 F. C ONVERGENCE , MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS , ACCESSION CRITERIA AND OPT - INS / OPT - OUTS This section is dedicated to a number of questions that often arise when the idea of a European unemployment benefits scheme is discussed. All questions are related, at least to some extent, to the design of the scheme and are therefore also treated here. Some of these issues have also been considered in earlier research on an EUBS. 1. EU vs. EA? The first question is whether a common unemployment benefits scheme should be introduced for the EU28 or for the Euro Area only. This question, in essence, is of a political nature. Within this project, we therefore do not recommend one option over the other but instead provide an overview of the arguments in favour or against each of them. We do, however, make the case for a compulsory participation , in order to avoid adverse selection. The key question therefore is: for which group of countries should participation be compulsory, the EU or the EA? In case of the latter, would that imply that other EU Members can also join the scheme if they would want to? In recent years, much attention has focused on the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union. In order to establish this goal, many have called for a supranational automatic stabiliser for Europe. The 2015 Five Presidents\u2019 Report is the latest high-level document in which the need for such a stabiliser is emphasised. The lack of fiscal capacity in the EMU has widely been recognised as an important threat to the sustainability of the system. This evidence seems to suggest that the case for a stabilisation tool is particularly strong for the Euro Area. A similar conclusion is attained on the basis of the Communication on the Social Pillar of the EMU, published on 8 March 2016. Moreover, the Banking Union also concerns Eurozone countries, with the possibility for the remaining EMU countries to step in, in light of the fact that non-members of the EA would also benefit from a better stabilisation in case of economic shock. While we have argued that participation in the EUBS should be compulsory, we do have to point out that the consequences of an approach based on voluntariness are not studied in this project. Such an approach, in which countries would be free to decide on whether or not to participate in an EUBS, would bring specific issues and problems with it (also in relation to the idea of accession criteria, as indicated below). Yet during the consultations with the relevant experts and networks for Task 4, the question of \u2018 opt- outs \u2019 was raised on several occasions. We therefore present a brief assessment of the implications of an opt-out (at the start of the EUBS or when it is already in place) here. In principle, there are two opt-out modalities that can be even combined: - involuntary - voluntary Involuntary opt-out at the start of the EUBS functions in the same way as accession criteria (on which more details are provided in the next section). Accession criteria may provide Member States that do not want to join the EUBS an easy way out: depending on the criteria, they can indefinitely postpone their participation by not complying with the criteria (i.e. no explicit opt-out is needed). Involuntary opt-out during the EUBS functioning comes down to a temporary or permanent suspension of membership in the scheme. Since the EUBS is a fiscal instrument, there is no insuperable technical obstacle to temporary suspension. From a broader political and economic perspective, there could be two possible arguments for temporary suspension: - if the Member State very seriously breached its duties under the relevant legislation (e.g. not transferring resources, not providing data etc.) ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 67 - if the Member State\u2019s economic situation were such that its continuing participation could threaten the viability of the whole EUBS In both cases, there are alternative remedies \u2013 use of courts or fines in former, backstopping the scheme in the latter case. In the latter case, the potential negative political and economic fallout would be that the rest of the Union cut off a Member State precisely in a situation where it was most fragile and vulnerable, which could also undermine the stabilisation that the EUBS could bring for severe economic disruptions.Voluntary opt-out either at the start or during the functioning of EUBS would bring problems of adverse selection. At the same time, this might make the EUBS more politically palatable for countries that would otherwise not agree to participate and potentially block the whole undertaking. A possibility not to enter the mechanism but irreversibility once a Member State does enter therefore has some merits, primarily of political nature. Opt-out during the course of the scheme, in contrast, does not appear to have any such merits and would give rise to severe complications in terms of payment of balance (either negative or positive) and create conditions for a variety of highly strategic approaches by Member States. From the legal point of view, a European unemployment benefits scheme can be implemented either within or outside of the current EU legal framework. In case of the former, one has to be aware that in principle an EU legal act binds all 28 Member States, except for explicit \u2018opt-outs\u2019 in such a legal act. In case of the later, the scheme can be adopted under the rules of enhanced cooperation. Then, the EUBS must be compulsory for at least nine Member States and it cannot undermine the internal market or economic, social and territorial cohesion). 2. Accession criteria Closely related to the previous topic is the issue of accession criteria. It can be read in the Five Presidents\u2019 Report (2015) that the creation of a risk-sharing facility comes only after a certain degree of economic convergence: \u201c Such a step should be the culmination of a process that requires, as a pre- condition, a significant degree of economic convergence, financial integration and further coordination and pooling of decision making on national budgets, with commensurate strengthening of democratic accountability. This is important to avoid moral hazard and ensure joint fiscal discipline. \u201d Labour markets and welfare systems are highly heterogeneous in Europe and deliver very different results in terms of efficiency and equity. There is no doubt that further convergence in both economic reality and policy-making would make functioning of the EUBS (or related mechanisms) easier and more politically palatable. A further convergence of policies would most probably have some impact on the capacity of national economies to absorb shocks and the size and pattern of net transfers, thus reducing the risk of moral hazard. Nevertheless, the desirability of convergence should not be confused with the desirability of establishing some sort of Maastricht-type of criteria that countries would have to fulfil in order to enter the system. Such criteria are neither necessary nor desirable for several reasons. First, the EUBS is designed to avoid permanent net transfers between countries. The existence of correction mechanisms like the experience rating and claw-back is such that countries that use the system more, also contribute more into it. In a similar manner, smokers pay a higher premium for their life insurance. The experience rating and claw-back are found to be effective, there is no country that is a permanent net beneficiary or contributor across all 18 variants. This means that the insurance works, despite the cross country differences and does not need convergence criteria. This argument is further reinforced by the analysis of the normality of shocks which shows that unemployment shocks generally are normally distributed in Europe. The third argument against convergence criteria is related to the political economy of the system. Adverse selection issues require that the EUBS is compulsory for all Member States (as ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 68 also indicated above). Creating convergence criteria could give the possibility to reluctant Member States to drag indefinitely their participation without an explicit opt-out. 3. Convergence and minimum requirements 3.1 Convergence We already briefly introduced the subject of convergence in the previous paragraph but, given its importance in the current policy debate, we go in more depth here. Besides stabilisation, a common unemployment benefits scheme may contribute to convergence. More specifically, an EUBS may spark an enhancement of national unemployment insurance schemes. It could, even without formal obligations, encourage Member States to align their national systems with the European system to ensure smooth transitions between the schemes. The European system generally is more comprehensive than what is currently guaranteed in the Member States. For example, the eligibility conditions in the baseline EUBS are easier to meet than those in 26 of the national systems. The EUBS covers a larger portion of unemployed workers, compared to the national schemes. Figure 15. Number of countries where eligibility conditions are more, less or equally stringent in the EUBS (in comparison to the NUBS) By the time the EUBS expires, after nine months in the baseline scenario, unemployed workers again are in the hands of the national unemployment benefit system. This transition typically is accompanied by a jump that, depending on the country, is large or small, and nearly always entails that workers are entitled to lower benefits (if not zero). In many countries, unemployed workers would fall back on social assistance instead (or first on unemployment insurance and later on social assistance). This jump is an undesirable outcome, from the economic as well as from the administrative point of view. While the EU cannot force countries to adjust their systems, one can easily imagine that the creation of an EUBS triggers a convergence of national schemes towards the European scheme, to facilitate transitions between the safety net of the European scheme and their own. Another way to achieve convergence would be to impose minimum requirements. European minimum requirements on the quality of unemployment benefits and the quality of activation of the national insurance schemes could be introduced. Such minimum requirements would serve a twin goal: improve national schemes\u2019 stabilisation capacity and mitigate institutional moral hazard. More details on this are presented in the next section. 05 10 15 20 25 30 EUBS is more generous NUBS is more generous Equal Unclear Eligibility Conditions (baseline, V11 and V12) baseline (3 months in last 12 months) V11 (3 months in last 6 months) V12 (12 months in last 24 months) ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 69 3.2 Minimum requirements for national schemes This section introduces the idea of minimum requirements in the analysis of the 18 potential EUBS. As stated in the Terms of Reference, both the equivalent and genuine EUBS could be linked to some minimum requirement(s) for NUBS and activation policies. Such minimum requirements could, for example, be related to the eligibility conditions of the scheme \u2013 which shape the quality of unemployment benefits (e.g. linked to contributory conditions or vesting period; coverage of part-time employment and self- employed individuals). A careful analysis of minimum requirements in the context of the EUBS can therefore be a valuable exercise. The two most important questions to be asked are: what is the rationale behind the creation of minimum standards; and what aspects of the labour market policy should they concern? The rationale for the creation of standards is based on one main argument: the need to ensure that every national system reaches a minimum stabilisation capacity. This implies that minimum requirements are applied to features of the EUBS such as eligibility and generosity. Yet, for technical as well as political reasons, the EUBS is likely to be accompanied by a substantial decentralisation of eligibility conditions to Member States (this also becomes clear in the legal and operational analyses conducted for Task 2B). These two necessities clash with each other. As far as the stabilisation capacity is concerned, we show in Table 16 21 that national systems present extremely different features, expressed in terms of gross replacement rates, coverage ratios and duration of the benefits. 21 Given that the input data for this exercise will be largely contained in national reports for Task 2A and their analysis will be done in Task 2B, we propose that further analysis of this aspect is conducted as part of Task 2B. However, this deliverable contains a brief comment on minimal requirements for national schemes that is important in terms of simulations to be performed under Task 3. ",

Source: European Commission and SPIN database. As becomes clear in the modelling exercises in Tasks 3B /C, EUBS coverage ratios are generally higher than those of the national schemes. 22 There are several factors thay may contribute to this result. Examples are stringent work history requirements, exclusion of part-time workers with a number of hours of work below a certain threshold or stringent eligibility tests related to the nature of unemployment. Minimum requirements may not only concern the quality of unemployment benefits, as was discussed so far, but can also relate to the quality of activation. The latter are crucial 22 Our initial concern about the coverage of the 18 EUBS, especially in case of the genuine schemes, was refuted by the results of Tasks 3B/C. Initally, we had argued that the EUBS could be ineffective when its coverage is low, e.g. when only 40% of the short-term unemployed are actually entitled to benefits. A low coverage could results from several factors, such as non- coverage of self-employed. To rule out that the EUBS would only have a limited coverage, and subsequently a limited stabilisation capacity, we had proposed that at least 75% of the short- term unemployed should be covered in each country (and that countries had to ensure this number was reached \u2013 if there is a consistent undershooting, Member States would have to adjust eligilbity conditions). Tasks 3B/C suggest that this target can easily be reached in the different Member States. We therefore no longer propose the 75% rule. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 71 to prevent of moral hazard. The analysis of the experience of countries with multi-tiered unemployment insurance schemes in Task 1A highlights that such minimum requirements play a major role. Many countries have stringent activation policies, which are motivated by a concern for individual and institutional moral hazard (or, from a broader perspective, embody the quality of social rights). In a multi-tiered unemployment system, the higher level of government may set standards or minimum requirements as these are labelled in Task 1A for the lower level of government (when activation is their responsibility). As explained in Task 1A, \u201cminimum requirements can be the result of specific inter-institutional agreements (as in Belgium, with regard to activation), or of a consensus established among the lower level governments (as in the Swiss case, with the non-binding guidelines issued by the inter-cantonal cooperation conference)\u201d. Even though Task 1A suggests that minimum requirements for activation play a major role in many countries (e.g. Austria, Belgium and Denmark), the level of detail and the strictness of the requirements or standards differs on a case-by-case basis. The introduction of an EUBS, genuine or equivalent, should be accompanied by a better coordination of activation policies across countries. In order to introduce minimum requirements, however, a strong political consensus would be required. As indicated above, these issues could be avoided by allowing for opt- outs, but this would undermine the stabilisation capacity of the scheme. Another point relates to the legal and operational dimensions and the degree to which Member States are free to design their own scheme (stabilisation vs. subsidiarity). These issues are also discussed elsewhere in this report. A final point is that strong minimum requirements would go a long way to strengthen the stabilisation capacity of national schemes, which currently is much differentiated and weak. On the other hand, minimum requirements are politically and economically unrealistic without a backstop and external funding source. However, especially when needed the most, national governments may have the incentive to scale down their national scheme in order to save funds. ",

The aim of the section is to provide the reader with an overview of the main results and conclusions from tasks 1, 2 and 3 of the project. The section further aspires to highlight the output of each variant. To this end, we produce a summary fiche that shows the features of the scheme and briefly outlines its economic and legal and operational impact for each variant. A fiche is composed of an easy-to-handle table, which in turn comprises four sub-sections. All fiches are based on a common template, which makes it easy to compare different variants. In the remainder of this section, we first discuss the template of the fiches in more detail. Then , the 18 fiches are displayed. More details on the 18 summary fiches As indicated above, the main goal of the summary fiches is to provide a clear and concise overview of the main features for each of the variants, the results of the economic assessment and those of the legal and operational assessment. A summary fiche (i.e. the overview table) is therefore structured into four sub-tables, each one dedicated to a single topic: - The first sub-table is labeled \u2018 general remarks\u2019 . This sub-table lists the main strengths and weaknesses of the variant. - The second sub-table is titled \u2018 features\u2019 . This sub-table summarises the main features of which the variant is composed. The features that are discussed include the type of scheme, the trigger , basic or top-up , the duration , the replacement rate , eligibility , capping , cyclical variability , experience rating , claw-back , debt- issuing possibility, and the reference wage applied in the scheme. - The third sub-table is labeled \u2018 economic impact \u2019 . This sub-table presents the results of the micro-economic and macro-economic simulations , discusses the value added of the variant and addresses the risk of moral hazard . For the micro- economic simulations, the fiche includes a discussion of distributional issues. For the macro-economic simulations, the variant\u2019s macro-economic stabilisation as a percentage of GDP and net transfers are considered. The value added of the scheme is analysed in terms of its impact on labour mobility, on structural reforms and on markets\u2019 and economic agents\u2019 confidence in the economic future of the EMU. - The fourth sub-table is called \u2018 legal and operational impact\u2019 . This sub-table consists of two main parts. In the first part, the variant\u2019s compatibility with the national laws and practices of the Member States is evaluated. This part covers the legal side, the operational side, the role of the social partners, the easiness and the speed of implementation, and potential interactions with other branches of social policy. The second part deals with the compatibility of the variant with the EU legal framework . This part deals with the legal and operational aspects. In the second sub-table, three columns are shown. The first column describes the feature of interest (e.g. replacement rate). The second column comprises a summary or overview of this feature. More specifically, this column indicates how the feature was set- up or designed (e.g. the replacement rate is set at 50% of the last gross wage). The third column contains the main results and/or a country analysis (e.g. a replacement rate of 50% is low compared to the current rate in country x but high in comparison with the current rate in country y). In case of the equivalent schemes, for example, the third column would present how many times the trigger would be pulled and in which countries it would be activated most/least/not at all. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 73 The final two sub-tables of the fiche also show these three columns, in addition to a fourth column that holds a colour code (red, yellow or green). The idea behind this colour code is to visualise the information provided in the first three columns in a clear and intuitive way. This allows the reader to quickly gain more insight into the economic and the legal and operational impact of the variant considered. In the fourth column, green implies that the impact is positive (e.g. variant has a large stabilisation capacity) or that potential negative effects are mitigated (e.g. only a limited risk of moral hazard), while red reflects the opposite situation (e.g. small stabilisation capacity, large risk of moral hazard). Yellow represents cases that fall between these extremes; e.g. that are potentially problematic for some countries (e.g. sufficient stabilisation capacity in the most advanced economies but not in the East).

The 18 fiches Fiche V1 General remarks Summary/Overview Main strengths Performs very well in stabilisation terms (especially in post-recession), trigger strikes balance between an EUBS that works continuously and one that only functions in severe crises, high redistribution, few legal and operational barriers, easy and fast to implement Main weaknesses Breach of Article 125(1) TFEU, no experience rating so claw-back becomes more relevant and less tools to mitigate moral hazard Features Summary/Overview Country Analysis/Results Type Equivalent Trigger The trigger is activated when the short-term unemployment rate exceeds its moving average of the last 40 quarters plus 1 percentage points Trigger is activated 80 times during 2000- 2014, in all years and in 22 countries. It is never activated for BE, DE, FR, AT and FI. IE, GR, ES, CY, PL, PT and SI benefit 5 times or more. Basic or top-up Not applicable Duration 9 months: benefits are paid from the beginning of the 4th month after losing employment to the end of the 12th month (M3-M12) Baseline case, most Member States seem to offer benefits for 6 to 12 months, but a lot depends on the case. CY, CZ, HU, LT, LV, MT, SK, UK are generally less generous. Replacement rate 50% of reference wage (gross wage is the default option) Baseline case, broadly in line with rates in most countries. Only DK, LU, NL and SE have consistently higher rates. Eligibility Workers who became unemployed after having worked, not necessarily consecutively, as employees for 3 (full-time equivalents) out of the last 12 months (3M out of 12M) Baseline case, EUBS is less stringent than NUBS in 26 Member States. Capping Unemployment benefits cannot exceed 150% of average national gross wage Baseline case, very high in comparison with caps in the majority of countries, adverse effects (high-income earners proportionally better off). Cyclical variability No Baseline case, in line with bulk of countries (exceptions are AT, ES, LT, PL). Experience rating No Violates no bail-out, but redistributive impact more visible. Claw-back Yes, the pay-in is doubled after 3 years of more than 1% of GDP cumulative negative balance vis-\u00e0-vis the central Fund until the balance declines below 1% Does not pose any legal or operational barriers as such. Activated in FI (2000, 2001), LT (2013) and Pl (2005-2007), the pay-in is equal to 0.2% of GDP in these years (backward-looking). Forward-looking: Claw-back is activated in countries directly hit by macro economic shocks, when shock is asymmetric (as in scenarios C and D). Claw-back activated the most in case of symmetric shocks of prolonged duration (scenario B). Debt-issuing possibility Yes, the Fund can borrow money from capital markets to cover short term imbalances Does not pose any legal or operational barriers as such.

The number of net recipients increases in case of symmetric shocks. few MS permanent net contributors/recipients Forward-looking: In term of within country distributional effects: EUBS would have a positive effect on poverty and inequality reduction. On average, poverty would be reduced by 0.35 percentage points in the presence of the EUBS, while inequality measured by the Gini coefficient would be reduced by around 0.15 percentage points, in the year when short-term unemployment rises in most countries. Compared to other genuine schemes, variant 7 would have a larger effect on poverty/inequality reduction than variants for which duration oif unemployment benefit is smaller than 12.

        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 129 A PPENDIX I: G LOSSARY In this section we give a summary definition of the features that characterise each equivalent and genuine scheme. Equivalent EUBS. Equivalent EUBS are those in which financial transfers from the supranational fund occur only from and towards Member States, and not directly towards unemployed individuals. The transfers may still reach unemployed individuals indirectly, in the case in which the supranational fund pays the national state which in turns direct the funds towards its unemployed citizens. Genuine EUBS. Genuine EUBS are those in which financial transfers from the supranational fund target directly unemployed individuals. Trigger (Section E.2). The trigger is the condition determining when financial transfers from the supranational fund towards a particular country should occur. A trigger is defined by the choice of an indicator and of a threshold. When the indicator, for a particular country, exceeds the threshold then the supranational fund pays to the country the agreed claim. Experience rating (Section E.4). In a system with experience rating, the payers to the system contribute to a different degree depending on their past experience with unemployment. For example, in the US, where the payers are the employers, the tax due to finance the UBS is higher for companies that have laid off more workers in the past. In a similar way, countries where the short-term unemployment rate is higher or more volatile may be requested to pay a higher contribution, relative to their GDP, than other countries. Claw-back (Section E.4) . Claw-back is a mechanism which reduces a potential, long- term positive (negative) net contribution by a Member State by increasing (decreasing) the amount that the Member State has to pay in the supranational fund. For example, say that the Netherlands comes to be a net beneficiary of the Fund after a number of years that the system is in place, meaning that this country has paid in the system less than what it has received. Then, the Dutch contribution to the supranational fund would be increased as a result. Debt issuing possibility (Section E.5). Debt issuing is possible if the supranational fund can borrow money from the capital markets in order to cover short-term imbalances. Basic EUBS (Section E.6). In a basic genuine EUBS, the supranational fund pays out the unemployment benefits (UB) according to the pre-defined replacement rate to the eligible, unemployed persons for a pre-defined number of months. Each single country is free to increase the paid amount or the duration at its own expense. Top-up EUBS (Section E.7). In a top-up genuine scheme, every eligible unemployed person is guaranteed a given replacement rate and duration. If the NUBS is generous enough to cover these costs, then the supranational fund does not contribute to the unemployment benefit of the unemployed citizens. If, however, the NUBS does not meet the minimal duration and replacement rate requirements, then the supranational fund supplements the payments of the national fund by the necessary amount to meet these requirement. (Notice that this implies that countries with a generous system only pay into the EUBS, but are less likely to receive any contribution). Cyclical variability (Section E.8) . The extent to which some of the parameters defining the EUBS (for example, the replacement rate or the duration) are a function of variables related to the economic cycle. An example of a UBS exhibiting a certain degree of cyclical variability is that of the United States, where if the recession is particularly ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 130 severe, there are several options for providing unemployed citizens with \u201cextended benefits\u201d (i.e. increasing the duration of the unemployment benefits). Duration (Section E.9). Number of months during which the unemployment benefit is paid out. Throughout the call for tender, there seems to be the assumption that the replacement rate will not vary by month, although this is not necessarily the case in the NUBS. Replacement rate (Section E.10). Proportion of the reference wage that will be paid out as an unemployment benefit, so that the unemployment benefit equals the reference wage times the replacement rate. Reference wage (Section E.11) . The reference wage is defined as the average wage in the last x months (where x may be equal to 1), either net or gross. Eligibility (Section E.12) . Eligibility rules determine which unemployed citizens qualify for UB. One particularly important eligibility rule determines how many months the citizen must have worked in a specified period prior to remaining unemployed, in order to receive UB. For example, at the moment of becoming unemployed, a citizen may be required to have worked at least 3 out the last 12 months to qualify for UB (this is the baseline option specified in the tender). Eligibility conditions define some minimum requirements for EUBS coverage, which in turn affect the incentives in place for individuals and the stabilisation effect of the EUBS. Capping (Section E.13) . A UB is capped if it cannot exceed a given proportion of the national average wage. For example, if the reference wage of an unemployed citizen is 3000 EUR and the replacement rate is 70%, then her expected UB is 2100 EUR. However, if the average national wage is 1000 EUR and there is a capping at 150% of the average national wage, then the aforementioned unemployed citizen will receive only 1500 EUR. ",
        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 131 A PPENDIX II: A DDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE SELECTION OF THE CUT - OFF POINTS IN THE DESIGN OF THE TRIGGER This Appendix complements our discussion of the trigger in Section E.2 above, as it presents six figures to further illustrate the differences between a threshold based on percentage points and one based on standard deviations. For each of the cut-off points that we selected (0.1, 1 and 2), we provide two graphs. The first graph shows the values of the short-term unemployment rate when the cut-off is added (e.g. STUR plus 0.1% vs. STUR plus 0.1 times the standard deviation). The second graph reveals the number of times the trigger is pulled in both cases. 10 years moving average + 1 (percentage points or standard deviation) In Figure 16, we compare what the average values of a short-term unemployment rate + 1% vs. + 1 standard deviation. In most cases these values are similar. Moreover, the two series are highly correlated (the correlation coefficient equals 0.98). The value of 1 is our \u201cstormy day\u201d scenario. In Figure 17, we use the same values to count how many times the scheme would be triggered by each of the two options. The number of events is the same in 10 out of 27 countries. It differs by 1 in five countries. When the differences are larger, such as for Belgium, Germany, France, Austria and Portugal, the standard deviation-based scheme generally triggers more easily. In some cases, the trigger is not activated at all (e.g. Belgium, Germany, France, Austria and Finland). Note that even in the years before 2000, the trigger would not have been activated in Belgium, Germany and Austria (neither when the percentage points approach is used, nor in the case of standard deviations). In France, it would have been triggered in 1993 and 1994 for the percentage points approach as well. In Finland, the trigger would have been pulled in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 when the percentage points approach is used and in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 when the standard deviations approach is taken.

        "Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme 2017 132 We then repeat the same exercise with 0.1 and 2 standard deviations. These values can be considered as proper cut-off points respectively for the \u201crainy day\u201d fund (0.1) and for the \u201creinsurance\u201d (2). 10 years moving average + 0.1 (percentage points or standard deviation) Figure 18 and Figure 19 show the values and the number of times the trigger is pulled when 0.1 is used as a value instead of 1. This value covers our \u201crainy day\u201d scenario. Figure 18 again shows that in terms of values, both approaches yield similar results. The pattern detected in Figure 19 is similar to that found before. The graph also illustrates that in this case the trigger is activated in many cases and it is activated at least once in every country. Interestingly, by setting the trigger this low, all countries benefit from the scheme. Many shocks are covered. For some countries, a very high trigger would still enable them to benefit, whereas for other countries the possibility to benefit is much lower. This is also clear from the analysis based on a value of 2 (percentage points or standard deviations) below. 0 3 1 4 0 4 5 5 7 0 2 6 2 4 4 4 2 2 0 5 7 1 5 2 0 2 3 6 3 1 4 2 4 3 6 6 2 5 6 2 3 7 5 2 5 4 4 10 4 5 2 0 2 5 02468 10 12 B e l g i u m B u l g a r i a C z e c h R e p u b l i c D e n m a r k G e r m a n y E s t o n i a I r e l a n d G r e e c e S p a i n F r a n c e I t a l y C y p r u s L a t v i a L i t h u a n i a L u x e m b o u r g H u n g a r y M a l t a N e t h e r l a n d s A u s t r i a P o l a n d P o r t u g a l R o m a n i a S l o v e n i a S l o v a k i a F i n l a n d S w e d e n U n i t e d K i n g d o m N u m b e r o f c a s e s Trigger Number of times trigger based on short term unemployment is activated during period 2000-2014 for all countries Mov Avg + 1 Mov Avg + 1SD ",

In this case, the differences in values appear to be somewhat larger than before, but for many countries they remain quit close. The number of times the trigger is activated, however, has gone down substantially. When the trigger is based on percentage points, it is activated only 32 times during 2000-2014 in the EU27. When it is based on the standard deviation, this number increases to 44. Several countries cannot benefit in any of the cases in any of the years. Other countries, especially in the east and south of Europe, still qualify. Although many of them appear to qualify for benefits in both cases, some countries only benefit when the trigger is based on the standard deviation (as was noted before). Many of the countries that can benefit when the cut-off is set to \u20182\u2019 will still benefit if it is much higher (e.g. 3). This is also clear from Figure 9 that presents on overview of different cut-offs for each of the countries in period 2000- 2014. Figure 20.
