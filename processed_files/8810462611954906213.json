        "Editorial by P\u00e1draig Flynn Welcome to this third edition of Forum magazine, which is devoted to the Second European Social Policy Forum which took place in Brussels in June 1998. This exciting event, a highlight in the calendar of the European Commission, brought together over 1 500 people from all the corners of Europe, including the countries of central and eastern Europe. They represented community groups, voluntary organisations, NGOs, trade unions, employers, governments, the public sector, private companies, foundations and research institutes. Above all, the participants at the Forum represented European citizens \u2014 from within and outside the Union - and their interests, opinions and concerns on the most important social issues on the European agenda. It is the mix of different voices which made the Forum such an important and successful event. This edition of Forum can only give a brief, but I hope stimulating, overview of the numerous different debates, discussions and indeed arguments which took place on a wide range of issues over the course of three days. The Platform of European Social NGOs and the European Trade Union Confederation jointly produced one of the most innovative parts of the event - the Open Forum. This helped to give a more interactive role in the debates to all organisations, thus ensuring that the views of as many people as possible were heard at the Forum. The Social Policy Forum perhaps raised many more questions than it answered. The social policy challenges we face in Europe \u2014 to create jobs, to guarantee social protection for all and to promote participation in society \u2014 are complex. It is only through continuous debate and exchange of experience that we can hope to ensure that all the relevant views and opinions are considered. The Forum is an excellent example of civil dialogue in action at the European level, but it is not the only example. I will continue to work with the representatives of the NGOs and the social partners to enrich the dialogue which we already have on a myriad of issues. For this reason, I will ensure that our civil society partners have a continued role in the development of social policy at the European level. // / *\\s ",
        "Progress in the EU employment strategy n the short time since its inception, the E u r o p e an Union's employment strategy has made much headway. Back in November 1997 at the extraordinary jobs summit in Luxembourg, EU leaders agreed to put in hand an integrated strategy for employment based on sound macroeconomic pol icies, a well-functioning single market and labour market mod ernisation. They also endorsed the 1998 employment guidelines. These guidelines provided the framework for national employ ment policies in 1998. The Member States' national action plans (NAPs). setting out how they intend to implement each of the guidelines, were submitted to the European Commission and evaluation of the plans provided the backdrop to the Commission's communication 'From guidelines to action \u2014 The national ac tion plans for employment'. This served as the basis for discus sion at the Cardiff European Council of Member State leaders last ]une. Mid-October saw the Commission adopt three important doc uments. The proposal for the 1999 employment guidelines main tains the four-pillar structure of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities; the main aim being to con solidate the path mapped out in the 1998 guidelines. Five is sues were emphasised as in need of greater attention: proactive tax and benefit measures; the need for lifelong learning; barriers to the employment of disabled groups and ethnic minorities; the jobs potential of the services sector; and difficulties in reconciling work and family life. The joint employment report, which reviews the state of the labour market in every Member State, weighs up what each has done to put into practice the 1998 employ ment guidelines. In a comprehensive review, the report assesses each country's progress in the four pillars of the European employ ment strategy. While not shying away from criticism, the report is upbeat about the headway made across the Union as a whole, highlighting examples of current good practice that other Member States might usefully adopt. The 1998 employment rates report \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 of fers a statistical overview of the size and make-up of the work force in the Member States and examines the EU's performance against that of its major partners. The main point to emerge is that the Union's overall employment rate is well below that for the USA and has actually fallen over the past two decades. The report examines the reasons for this and offers suggestions for closing the gap and harnessing fully the employment potential of the labour force. On 11 and 12 December, EU leaders meeting at the Vienna Council adopted conclusions on the basis of the joint employment re port and on the implementation of the guidelines for employ ment. It also agreed the employment guidelines for 1999. All three papers are available in full on-line at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg05/index_en.htm and are summarised in press releases at: http://europa.eu.int/rapid/start/cgi/guesten.ksh (references: IP/98/887, IP/98/888 and IP/98/889] ",
        "Equality is the future In May, the European Commission adopted its 1997 report on equal opportunities for women and men, presenting the most important national and Union-wide developments over the year (COM/98/302 final). Three points get special mention. The first, the agreement of the Amsterdam Treaty, introduces new pow ers relating to equal opportunities: Article 13 will permit ap propriate action to combat all discrimination while Article 141 extends the scope of the former Article 1 19 by giving equal treatment a specific legal base. Next is the progress made in the mainstreaming strategy to integrate gender issues into all other relevant policy areas. The European Commission itself has appointed 29 officials to ensure the various directorates- general do just that and proposals were tabled to include equal ity in Structural Fund and development cooperation schemes. Finally, in recognition of the fact that a higher number of women in the labour market will contribute to the employment growth the EU needs to secure its prosperity and welfare systems, the new employment strategy (see above) establishes equal op portunities as one of the four pillars which must underpin Member State employment policies. These and other matters were discussed at a conference on 21 and 22 September in Brussels, which attracted 500 participants from across the EU and the applicant countries. An exhibition on equal opportunities and good practice in Europe was on show, featuring stands from the Community action programme, DG V and organisations working for equality across Europe. In a number of workshops, specialists presented their views and visions, and the sometimes controversial debate that ensued was rounded off with a session entitled The added value of European equality policy'. Unit D.5 of DG V deals specifically with equal opportunities. You can find the relevant website page at: http://www.dg5b.cec/en/temp/equ_opp/index_en.htm The report on equal opportunities for women and men has been published (see publications section on page 29). Industrial change \u2014 the economic and social implications In November, a high-level group chaired by Per Gyllenhammar delivered its final report on the economic and social implications of industrial change. The report looks at ways in which change can be anticipated and pre-empted, and offers suggestions for dealing with the effects of company and sectoral restructuring. The importance of effective studies and forward planning is stressed as is the shift towards a more adaptable, entrepreneurial cul ture. Also highlighted is the need for strong links between gov ernment, business and academia to generate an ongoing process of skill updating. Among the innovations mooted in the report is the creation of a Europe-wide Observatory' to act as a social dialogue forum, gathering and disseminating information and best practice. The report also floats the possibility of sanctions against firms that respond to industrial change by downsizing without proper retraining or chances of future employment for their employees. The report is available as a publication - see poge 30 ",
        "Europe direct \u2014 Strengthening the dialogue with citizens and business A major event at the Cardiff Summit was the launch by Commission President, Jacques Santer, and UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, of 'Europe direct', a new service which gives peo ple user-friendly telephone and Internet access to information and advice about the EU and their rights in it. Seven Commission Directorates-General, including V, contribute to the seivice, which offers five main facilities: (1) a mailbox service for questions about general EU issues; (2) a new 'EU-routemap for jobseekers' and other guides, which give a general overview of your rights and opportunities in the single market; (3) a jobs database, backed up by the personalised informa tion and advice provided to mobile jobseekers by the EURES network and its Euroadvisers; (4) topical fact sheets on, for example, how to obtain a resi dence permit or recognition of a diploma; (5) a 'signpost service' to help people overcome practical prob lems in exercising their single market rights. A multilingual expert team directs callers to an EU, national or local body that can provide further assistance.

The communication, which is designed to enable dialogue to play Its full part in modernising and strengthening Europe's social dimension, is based on four strands: Information: The Commission has established more efficient channels for exchanging information with all the social part ners and it encourages the European social partners to follow up the outcome of the European social dialogue with their af filiates at national level. Consultation: Alongside the communication, the Commission adopted a new framework to introduce more flexible social dia logue bodies which can be easily extended to new sectors. Participation requires a joint request by representative organi sations from both sides of industry in a given sector. Similarly, at cross-industry level, the advisory committees will be streamlined and the Commission will ensure that all social part ners are consulted on policy developments. Employment partnership: The Commission adopted a propo sal to reform the Standing Committee on Employment. The proposal aims to strengthen exchanges between the Commission, the Council and the social partners, on the basis of the Council resolution on the employment guidelines. Negotiation: The Commission confirms its support for the de velopment of real collective bargaining at European level with in the legislative framework laid down under the agreement on social policy. This framework will now be incorporated into the Amsterdam Treaty. ",
        "Budget lines for NGOs unblocked On 10 June 1998 the European Commission temporarily suspend ed some 100 budget headings, following a ruling by the European Court of Justice of 12 May 1998 (C-106/98), which set out a num ber of rules for implementing the EU budget. They state that any ex penditure on Union activities re quires both a budget entry and a legal basis i.e. a piece of sec ondary legislation (regulation, directive or decision) authorising it (the only exceptions are non-significant operations). The Commission took charge of veri fying budget lines without such a basis. By mid-July, about three quarters of the budget lines were totally or partially unblocked, when the Commission was satisfied that they fulfilled the cri teria laid down in the Court's ruling. For most of the headings still blocked, a proposal for a legal basis was pending with the Council and the European Parliament. The remainder could not be implemented in ac cordance with the Court ruling. Only where there were exist ing legitimate expectations would operations go ahead in 1998 (for example, if a contract had already been signed). The budget Council and trialogue meeting between the Council, European Parliament and Commission of 17 July 1998 arrived at a long-term solution to the problem of legal bases Participants at the European Social Policy Forum initiating a red card campaign for the unblocking of several budget lines and reached an ad hoc agreement on implementation of the 1998 budget. In addition, the Council and the European Parliament re inforced their commitment to speeding up the adoption of pending legal bases. As part of this solution, the Commission resumed implemen tation of politically sensitive budget lines. Furthermore, a Com mission communication of 16 September 1998, redirected measures for combating social ex clusion to prepare new operations under the Amsterdam Treaty. Most of the 1998 budget lines have now been unblocked. The Commission also empowered Commissioner Erkki Liikanen, responsible for budget and administration, to sign a draft inter- institutional agreement between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission as a long-term solution to the issue. The agreement specifies that only appropriations for pilot projects, preparatory measures and autonomous operations can get the go-ahead without legal bases. The cost of pilot proj ects and preparatory measures cannot exceed ECU 107 mil lion per year. Free movement of workers On 22 July, the Commission adopted three legislative propo sals to update and clarify citizens' rights to move about the EU to take up work. The first two amend and update Regulation 1612/68 and Directive 68/360, the two core pieces of EU legislation that have guaranteed freedom of movement for workers within the Union for the past 30 years. The amendments support the European employment strategy by removing obstacles to greater labour market mobility. They deal with equal treatment for work ers who choose employment in another Member State, clari fy and simplify the rules on residence and set out the rights of families who move to join a migrant worker. The third propo sal is for a decision to merge two existing tripartite consulta tive committees \u2014 one on free movement of workers, the other on the coordination of social security schemes \u2014 into a single tripartite advisory body with a clearer policy focus.

        "Dossier The future world of work Parallel session A Rapporteur: Peter Townsend, University of Bristol Advancing the debate on the future of social policy: the second European forum on social policy The forum, which was held in Brussels from 24 to 26 June, was an opportunity for some 1 500 representatives of the European Institutions, governmental and employers' organisations and public authorities to debate the future of social policy in Europe. The highlights and various activities of the three-day event are set out below. e\u00a15^ : \u00c4 g fi '\u00bb > j \u03b9\u00b7 ^ f Chairman Wim van Weizen and rapporteur Peter Townsend talking to participants at session A On 24 June in the afternoon, in the orange room, built like a modern cin\u00ad ema and able to hold several hundred people, the big screen flickered: sparks flying during precision welding; cut: computers and modern com\u00ad munication technologies; cut: a group of elderly people. The European Commission's video set the scene for the workshop's discussion of the range of topics revolving around the future of work. The mes\u00ad sage: rapid technological development was transforming Europe's economy, while the growing number of older people and persis\u00ad tently high unemployment demanded political solutions. What could Europe do, what could the Member States do, to retain their social character despite social systems creaking at the limits of their capac\u00ad ities? And could the crisis on the labour markets be resolved? These questions were debated intensively by participants and speak\u00ad ers in the workshop 'The future world of work' during the first two days of the social policy forum. The speakers on the podium reflected the various social actors involved. Renate Hornung\u00adDraus was there on behalf of the European employers' association UN1CE, while Mike Allen represented the NGOs, Karl\u00adJohann L\u00f6nnroth the European Commission and Penny Clarke the European trade unions, with Professors Peter Townsend and Carlo Borzaga as the scientific experts. After a few brief words of introduction by the Chairman, Wim van Weizen, Member of the European Parliament, the discus\u00ad sion focused directly on the crucial question: where are the obsta\u00ad cles to more employment? Renate Hornung\u00adDraus highlighted over\u00adrestrictive and over\u00adcomplicated labour legislation as a major obstacle. 'Anyone who wants to start a business and employ people is forced to get a lawyer. This is not on!' The laws gov\u00ad erning night work or work on screen were too restrictive for businesses, so deregulation was urgently required. And employ\u00ad ees would have to get used to lifelong learning In future. 'The pressure on workers is constantly increasing. We're again sup\u00ad posed to work more, be flexible and learn, learn, learn. Only to be burnt out at 45 and no longer wanted anyway?' A member of the European association of the unemployed had taken up the microphone, with his image projected on screen at three times normal size so everyone could see him. Chairman Wim van Weizen thought too that employability, i.e. getting the right qualifications for the labour market, was certainly an important point. However, only four out of every 10 unemployed people in Europe didn't have suitable occupational training. This also shows that there is not enough work to go round!', he stated, attempting to steer the discussion towards government support measures. The problem of excessive indirect labour costs was then quickly raised. ",
        "'Our system punishes labour and favours capital investment', argued a Finnish participant, 'we have to look together for new tax models with a neutral impact on the labour market.' Denmark had tried to finance social insurance from VAT but had failed to get this past the European Court of Justice. Karl-Johann L\u00f6nnroth, on the podium representing the European Commission's DG V, then intervened and, citing the imminent arrival of the single currency area, called for closer coordina tion between social and labour market policies in Europe 'to prevent unemployment being exported from one EU Member State to another.' He also mentioned the European employ ment strategy, recently adopted at the Luxembourg Summit, which called for coordinated action by the Member States fol lowing precisely defined guidelines. Speakers and participants wondered whether high economic growth would be enough to eliminate the problems. However, the answers were fairly sceptical: growth alone would do lit tle to improve matters. Work had to be redistributed, felt Penny Clarke, and cutting working hours could create new jobs. Could salvation be found in the service society, should Europe follow the model of the US jobs miracle with its low wages? 'We'd then have more work, for, say, self-employed porters or attendants \u2014 but would end up with a poverty problem!' argued an Austrian. According to a Portuguese lady, 'the problem is that services such as care for the elderly or children are in prin ciple urgently needed, but hardly any money can be earned from them.' This babel of tongues posed no problem, since an entire team of 'interpreters was busy explaining what was said. Even the hard of hearing could follow the discussion, with inter preters familiar with sign language hurrying over, stool in hand to sit next to them. Again and again, Wim van Weizen bravely had to remind con tributors to keep it short. Many in the audience had something to say, and the chairman had to squint against the light to make out the raised hands and call people to speak. The numerous contributions were not just confined to analysing and assessing the problems. A man high up in the audience introduced himself as a Spaniard and wanted just to say that the 'First employee programme', launched by the Spanish gov ernment to help the self-employed recruit their first employ ees, had already created two million jobs in Spain. Professor Carlos Borzaga pointed to another employment-inten sive but little considered area: 'social' enterprises such as co operatives, foundations and societies. 'Just because they are not intended to make a profit, we get the impression they are inefficient. But they are not.' His position was supported by participants who pointed out that governments all channelled economic aid and subsidies to companies that cut employment, while social organisations were left empty-handed even though they kept or even created jobs. In the end, it was clear to everyone that something could be done, but this required governments to make changes to their tax and aid systems. Daniele Meulder of the Free University of Brussels mentioned just some examples currently under dis cussion in Europe: a CO2 tax, a 'bit' tax on computers \u2014 all opportunities for reducing taxes on labour. But nothing had come of them. As Mike Allen put it succinctly: 'There are any num ber of good ideas, but also a lot of interests that block change. ' A member of the audience added: 'We should be clear about one thing: if we want to change anything, we'll need enor mous perseverance.' Elke Br\u00f6der ",
        "Chairman Karl\u00adGustav Schermar) and rapporteur Luc Carton at session \u0392 Social protection: adapting to changing needs \u2014 Parallel session \u0392 Rapporteur: Luc Carton, Fondation Travail-Universit\u00e9, Brussels Main issues This session aimed to examine the future of social protection and the roles of those responsible for managing and provid\u00ad ing public social services at the national, regional and local level. Gabrielle Clotuche of DG V considered that the key words in the preparatory report were employability, demographic age\u00ad ing and social exclusion. There was a call for a working group to follow up this report, involving in particular the NGOs, the public social services and the social partners, to study best part\u00ad nership practices and how to better integrate the users or clients of social services in policy formulation. Debate Rapporteur Luc Carton considered there was agreement among participants on a wide definition of social protection including not only social security schemes and social policies, but also services and benefits to ensure the well\u00adbeing of all members of society: in particular housing, education, health and social services. The prevention of exclusion was unanimously recognised as the highest priority of social policy. For most participants, adapt\u00ad ing social protection in the context of a changing European society means maintaining or restoring current mechanisms of solidarity as well as developing this protection: new needs must be recognised, defined with the populations themselves, and addressed by new services and benefits. It also requires a rein\u00ad forcing of the bonds between civil and social dialogue and greater involvement by employer organisations in the process. Approaches to the general principles of social protection var\u00ad ied. The platform of European social NGOs and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) emphasised 'equality' and collective responsibility, whereby revenues and benefits must, in every case, guarantee dignity for each individual. In con\u00ad trast, the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe (UN1CE) recommended a new balance between indi\u00ad vidual and collective responsibility, in particular through the development of supplementary insurance for the most solvent part of the population. Social protection should therefore, in certain cases, redefine its scope to target people most exposed to social risks. All present conceded that in most Member States, financing social protection relies too heavily on employment. Contrary to the employers' position, the NGOs and ETUC proposed low\u00ad ering social charges by spreading the load on all revenues and factors, especially on deductions reserved for savings, income revenues and energy. The majority of participants perceived the development of the social dimensions of European integration as the vector of reg\u00ad ulation and d\u00e9mocratisation: the decisive progress of economic, and monetary integration makes the emergence of a European social policy indispensable, through the establishment of coor\u00ad dination procedures, positive convergence and gradually, com\u00ad mon standards. The recent strengthening in the coordination of employment policies was seen as a key element in the emer\u00ad gence of a European social policy. Despite agreement on the need to reach a new socioeconomic compromise, there was intense discussion on the meaning of this compromise and the interpretation of subsidiarity. A small minority of participants considered that the exclusive compe\u00ad tence of the Member States in social matters could be a guar\u00ad antee against the risks of deregulation and greater commercialisation of social protection at the European level. 10 ",
        "Having a break at Cybercaf\u00e9 More generally, some saw the reinforcement of social protec tion, not only as the necessary redistribution that imposes val ues of equality and solidarity, but also as a factor of economic growth. Others, however, believed that economic recovery could not be obtained except at the price of more selective solidar ity, allowing for more competitive European economies. Several participants emphasised that some of the broad eco nomic guidelines, discussed at the Cardiff Summit in June, appeared to diverge from the objective of the development of social cohesion and the thrust of the forum. The notion of employability was widely debated. The NGOs and ETUC in particular stressed how essential it was to affirm workers' rights to training \u2014 with or without employment \u2014 and not to introduce new conditions limiting the right to unem ployment benefits. Many interventions highlighted the risk of placing the responsibility for unemployment on workers with out employment, without considering employer responsibility as regards quality, security and volume of work. Indeed, unemployment cannot be attributed wholly to a lack of training among the active population, especially when qual ified work is unavailable and many workers are obliged to accept jobs for which they are overqualified, as ETUC asserted. Similarly, the notion of employability suggests greater respect for work ers' rights: today, however, too many older workers, descen dants of immigrants, women and young people have irregular or atypical work. Finally, numerous strategic themes linked to the emergence of new needs were addressed. The strong presence of the European and national networks fighting against poverty mobilised atten tion towards proposing that actions to combat exclusion should be comprehensive and preventive, and centred on the struc tural causes of instability and impoverishment. Listening to and using the language of these vulnerable groups are key ways to fight poverty. The networks called on the Commission for the means to carry out a European study on the social situa tion of these groups. Socio-demographic changes affect benefits in relation to peo ple with long-term illnesses, the very old, or people with a disability, as well as benefits and services concerning children. These new demands call for close involvement in the daily lives of individuals, families and local communities. The European network of directors of social services emphasised the central role of the users of social services in their design and man agement. Because of the increase in working women and the changes in family structures we need to develop, at all levels, factors to ensure effective equality between men and women and, according to the platform of European social NGOs, accurate individualisation of social rights. Conclusions Despite the diversity of opinions, common threads including the new complexity of social issues \u2014 in particular the inter dependence between territories, areas and actors \u2014 are based at all times on the enhancement of democracy. The establish ment of new social indicators, to report on trends in inequal ities, and systematic procedures to evaluate public policies were regarded as invaluable instruments, allowing for expression, analysis and debate by all relevant actors, an explicit condition of social cohesion, which the participants agreed to define as the capacity of a society to desire equality.

        "Promoting participation and citizenship \u2014 Parallel session C Rapporteur: Maria-Grazia Giannichedda, University of Sassari As proposed in the background report drawn up by Ms Giannichedda. the participants at this workshop focused debates on four key issues: maximising active participation and citizenship, by remov ing barriers, addressing challenges and seizing opportunities; mobilising actors and promoting cooperation between NGOs, the social partners and the public authorities: supporting participation and citizenship by promoting rights and flanking measures, in particular via the new provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty; promoting integrated and sustainable development and mobilising to this end all Community policies, including the Structural Funds. Debate In her summary account of this workshop the rapporteur, Ms Giannichedda, began by highlighting the two key focuses of the session: the promotion of rights and partnership. 'Citizenship' and 'participation' are key to the idea of building Europe 'as a Europe of citizens, a Europe of rights and a Europe for all its citi zens'. All participants stressed the need to speed up the process of achieving this goal. Though this may be obvious to people working in the field, it was stressed that not everybody is aware to the same degree of the suffering of those whose rights are denied and those who have difficulty gaining access to their rights. There are doubts that this goal can be achieved in the short term, and we need to look at the reasons for and sources of these doubts. If we are to build a social Europe we have to increase our com mitment and develop new compromises between the economic and the social spheres. Participants stressed that the time was now right to establish a legal basis for the promotion of rights and the necessary measures at strategic level, medium-term level and in response to the achievements of the Amsterdam Treaty. Building on the work of the Comit\u00e9 des Sages, the participants provided tangible examples of the interdependence of social, civic, cultural and economic rights. Without social rights for all, politi cal rights become restricted to the privileged few and depend, as they once did, on succession. There was consensus on the importance of working on civil and social rights together, at pre sent social rights merely constitute a general principle. Getting social rights acknowledged by the Amsterdam Treaty was set as a priority. The NGOs and ETUC officially launched a campaign for a bill of rights. Such a proposal, which should receive Commission back ing, would fall under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty allow ing the Commission to take action to fight discrimination. The partnership approach is seen as a way of bridging the gap between civil and social rights and bringing them closer together. The initial debate at grass-root level In all Member States would stress the importance of European citizenship and rights. A col lective campaign would also help to address subjects related to rights and citizenship such as the problems of the poor, young, dispossessed, and severely disabled \u2014 those whose voices are not heard. Ms Murrant, who experiences poverty on a daily basis, worked with the ATD movement to produce a paper analysing her own situation. She pointed out that representation never really corre sponds exactly to the true situation: representation is all too often only partial and some people are left out. Ms Lisa Chatfield from County Durham Youth Council spoke about young people's participation. She put forward the notion that par ticipation by young people should increasingly involve them in making decisions which affect their lives, thus giving them the opportunity to learn from the experience over time. Mr Brunoldl gave a detailed account of Italy's experience of territorial pacts. Initially projects concentrated on SMEs, tourism, 12 ",
        "the food industry and business services; more recent pacts, however, focus on training and links with the social economy. New, alternative forms of working are being exploited. Though difficulties have arisen, these initiatives, which set up wide- scale partnerships, are doing well and progress is being made. Experience shows that citizenship and participation are feasi ble goals so long as citizens can access their rights. Action is necessary at both strategic and legal level and through the revision of the Treaty, taking existing texts as a basis. Many were of the opinion that participation was a means and not an end in itself. The difficulties in managing partnerships stem from different methods of governing; hence the need to exchange information, best practice and tangible experi ences. NGOs often find civil dialogue does not gain proper recognition so progress in institutionalising it is slow. What is required, therefore, is action to make civil and social dialogue complementary. The rapporteur called for everyone to take part in the revision of the Treaty by making representations to their local and national governments as well as to relevant organisations. 'The Commission and Member States must urgently resolve current difficulties over funding non-governmental organisations and social policy Initiatives and should enhance the resources available to NGOs so that they can develop appropriate democratic and accountable structures at European level and participate fully in policy making debates.' Hugh Fraiser, Combat Poverty Agency, Ireland Conclusions The EU should encourage and promote the development of examples of good practice to facilitate participation by marginalised groups and 'invisible' citizens. We need to exam ine barriers to citizenship and participation and the different means and opportunities to bring them down. Two Spanish girls gave an account of their youth organisation which raises awareness locally of various issues, especially racism. Their example highlighted the parallel between fra ternity and interdependence. Ms Giannichedda saw this as an important message and emphasised that by working together in a fraternal way we can move closer to political \u00a1deals. 'This debate on participation and citizenship cannot be removed from the reference to values of justice and soli darity. Exclusion and discrimination are inconsistent with Europe's democratic ideal'.

        "Open forum at the forum On 25 June 1998 in the afternoon, visitors to the European social policy forum thronged into the central hall. After one glance at the clock and another at the floor plan, they disap peared to the left and right behind the stands. The open forum of non-governmental organisations was now under way, with the presentation and discussion of 48 projects run by European non-governmental organisations (NGOs) concerned with social issues. With only 1 5 to 20 minutes set aside for each topic, including the ensuing discussion, the speakers briskly began their talks in the eight booths arranged by theme behind the stands. At 2.50 p.m. in booth 2, Heinz Stieb of Austria's Volkshilfe took his place in the quarter-circle. His topic: 'NGOs and police against prejudice'. The goal of this campaign, said Stieb, was to improve the human climate, i.e. to learn from one another and elimi nate prejudices about both migrants and police work. Superficial knowledge gained from the media and own subjective expe riences needed to be supplanted by factual knowledge and face- to-face encounters. The Austrian briefly outlined the history of the project. The initiative launched in 1997 by the Volkshilfe in Austria \u2014 bringing together police and public officials and migrant representatives \u2014 was now a network stretching across 1 1 European countries. From Barcelona to Bologna, Saint Denis, Rotterdam, Frankfurt, Berlin, Greenwich and on to Copenhagen, public authorities and NGOs had joined together to offer their police forces training in contacts with migrants. The measures differed, since each country had a differently organ ised police force and different ethnic minorities. But the goal was the same: not to convert, but to provide information about the other side. The methods and results of all Individual proj ects were scientifically evaluated, and the network was co ordinated by the Volkshilfe. 'How have the police responded?' one visitor wanted to know. 'Very well,' replied Heinz Stieb. 'We have also had positive feedback from the interior ministries.' The audience was par ticularly interested in the training methods. However, time was running out and at booth 2, devoted to the theme 'Combating racism and xenophobia', a colleague from the migration pol icy group was already waiting. Now it was his turn to present European projects devoted to the fight against racism. There was a little jostling as the visitors wanting more information started to leave behind Heinz Stieb while others with the migra tion policy group pushed into the small arena, closed off by black curtains yet still open to the outside. Outside at the Volkshilfe stand, Stieb replied to questions that could not be answered In detail during the meeting. Visiting cards were exchanged, details scribbled quickly on paper. 'All people working in the field', said Stieb afterwards. There were people active in the social professions right across Europe, who were just as inter ested in contact addresses in their own countries as in the approaches adopted in neighbouring countries. An ideas marketplace, information transfer, an exchange cen tre: the contributions at the open forum were all these things. Some were also more: a demonstration of own initiative. Booth 6 was entitled 'Doing it for ourselves'. Ushers helped people find their way in. A glimpse through the curtain, behind It a 14 ",
        "One of the half-hour workshops at the open Forum flickering television set. But no advertising beauties or people heavily made up for the camera. Only faces marked by the hard grind of daily life: homeless people in Scotland. End of video. Alex Lowe and Ricky Turner explained how the pictures came about and what they had achieved for the homeless. What was special about this was... they did it all by themselves. Both speakers were familiar with life in the rough. They were there back in 1994 when the 'Speakout group' was founded in Glasgow. The first Scottish conference of the homeless was now their theme, an event attended by 250 people living on the streets. The main problem had been getting there. How could homeless people with no income and nowhere to live pay for their trip to Glasgow? Some support had been forth coming, from Oxfam among others, but the funding all had to be organised \u2014 there was no generous backing. At the con ference, the homeless had expressed their concerns, needs and demands on a graffiti wall and in front of a video camera. A committee they themselves elected had summarised what was said as a basis for drawing up the 'Homeless charter', which was adopted at a second meeting. Main points: the right to accommodation, better management in hostels for the home less, access to medical care, financial aid, and an end to the massive discrimination that was 'worse than for any other social group'. It was extraordinary to see homeless people explain ing their own situations, demonstrating social abilities not nor mally associated with the homeless in the public mind. Alex Lowe went on to say that several members of the committee had died during the work on the charter: a young woman had committed suicide, another had succumbed to a heroin over dose, while a man aged just 41 had 'died of natural causes.' What were Speakout's achievements, the audience wanted to know. Alex Lowe thought there were quite a few, mention ing that the Homeless charter was now part of the syllabus at colleges for social workers. The group had set its sights on lob bying and fund-raising. A homeless man had just produced a CD, called 'Young girl on the street', with all proceeds going to the movement. And when the Scottish Parliament was to be elected next year, said Lowe, Speakout and the homeless would be knocking at their door. 'Testimonies' formed part of many contributions. While NGO representatives were speaking, the people they were talking about were usually present too on video \u2014 whether old peo ple, destitute women, families with problems, the disabled or gypsies and travellers. The idea was not just to talk about those with problems in society \u2014 they should and could also speak for themselves. The range of themes and projects discussed covered nearly all social interests. This concentrated presenta tion of the social problem areas of Europe could have been overpowering. However, this was not the impression at all. In the booths and at the NGO stands, the focus was more on approaches designed to provide hope and achieve success. At 4.30 p.m. in booth 3, ideas and projects for creating new jobs were on the agenda. And now the experts were having their say. There were hardly enough seats to.go round, and some of the audience were having to stand. Karl Birkholzer and G\u00fcnther Lorenz of the European network for economic self- help and local development were presenting the findings of a study. Its aim was to identify model social enterprises in France, Italy, Sweden, Germany, the UK and Spain and examine the reasons for their success. 'The context is: away from social 15 ",

For 'social security can no longer be built just on economic growth', i.e. on rapid economic growth filling the coffers of national gov\u00ad ernments, which could then distribute their largesse among the socially disadvantaged. In its search for exemplary models, the team focused principally on the link between social enterprises and the community. Here Is where strawberries came into the picture. The 'strawberry field strategy' of social cooperatives in Italy involved providing social welfare or training in co\u00ad operatives with 10 to 30 workers in close collaboration with the local administration. No cooperative ever grew any bigger, instead it created new small units. Just like strawberries prop\u00ad agated when they could grow no further, explained Karl Birkholzer. The slides on the overhead projector showed the social enter\u00ad prises found by the experts to work in practice: for example, the local district enterprises in France. Politicians, local Inhab\u00ad itants and housing associations played a big role in these 'R\u00e9gies de quartier'. They set up the enterprises and their workers then maintained the green areas, the community areas and the hous\u00ad ing stock. Another example is the job creation enterprise Atlantis, from Brandenburg in the structurally weak eastern part of Germany. With this firm, the focus was on high\u00adtechnology. It offered environmental services and supplied solar and photo\u00ad voltaic equipment. And trained previously unemployed peo\u00ad ple for new jobs and a new market. In Sweden's J\u00e4mtland, an entire village had taken an initiative \u2014 against the 'greying' of the population. Young families would not stay in such a remote area without any industry nearby, so a village cooperative had been set up to promote the local economy: attracting busi\u00ad nesses and stimulating tourism. What social enterprises all have in common, said Lorenz, is that their work had social goals and was not aimed at max\u00ad imising profit. These cooperatives, social enterprises and job\u00ad creation firms preferred to work with the unemployed and the socially disadvantaged. 'But what about money?', a lady in the audience wanted to know. 'Can these social enterprises man\u00ad age on what they earn from their services and products?' 'Not at all.' G\u00fcnther Lorenz made it clear that none of these firms was profitable. Without public subsidies, these not\u00adfor\u00adprofit businesses could not manage. 'How do normal companies view 16 ",
        "the existence of public service enterprises, which indeed com pete with them?', asked another in the audience. That ranged, replied Lorenz, between slight irritation and acceptance. Just because of this irritation, however, 'social enterprises in Europe need a legal framework, which they have not had so far.' And they needed social auditing to identify more closely the social benefits and efficiency. Two in the audience then both wanted to know more about the financing. 'There are institutions that finance social enterprises, even if it is only pump priming. If anyone wants to find out more, I will be outside in a moment.' Even while the discussion was continuing, a few participants crept shyly from their seats to grab the information on dis play. A young Italian post-graduate was happy to find \u2014 at last \u2014 something she had been seeking unsuccessfully for nine months: useful information on social enterprises in Europe. Responding to a request, G\u00fcnther Lorenz took a thick book out of his briefcase: the price being DEM 39. However, the Briton wanting to buy It had only Belgian francs in his wallet. A bit of calculating was now required, via UK pounds. Some people rushed off elsewhere, but others with important ques tions buttonholed the two speakers in front of the booth. Outside, at the display stands, there were small gathering points. Solidad, the umbrella organisation of European welfare asso ciations, and the NGO platform constantly drew small groups of people. As did Commissioner P\u00e1draig Flynn. When the cham pagne glasses clinked, the moment had arrived. By pressing a button, Commissioner Flynn had just launched EURES, the European job mart, onto the Internet. So now information on jobs in the EU Member States could be called up on-line. When the last of the discussions at the open forum began, focusing afresh on the fight against racism, equal rights for all, and new ideas and services, the European social policy forum too availed itself of a new service. It went chatting on-line. The cybercaf\u00e9, a regular haunt of weary coffee and informa tion addicts, had been turned at short notice into a huge Internet centre, with more than 20 PCs. Staff of the Commission's DG V and P\u00e1draig Flynn stood by to receive questions from the World Wide Web. A number of surfers took this opportunity to have pressing queries answered. Question put by 'Christian' to Flynn: 'Are both men and women entitled to time off work when a child arrives? Or are only women entitled to parental leave? Is this regulated at all at European level?' It took a little while for the question and then the response to be translated. Christian received his answer from Flynn: 'Yes, of course, both men and women are enti tled to parental leave, under European regulations as well.' Thomas then questioned whether there was still any place for social policy 'in the age of the hard euro, for which all Member States are tightening their belts?' And a friendly football fan regularly reported from the depths of the Internet the latest scores of the two World Cup first-round games going on at the time. That too was the European social policy forum. Part of life, not outside looking on. Elke Brader 17 ",
        "Panel discussion The Chair, Marie-Claude Vayssade, honourary Member of the European Parliament, introduced the following topics for panel discussion, based on questions contributed by forum participants: \u2022 the kind of cohesion existing between economic and social policies in the EU/the effect of the structure of monetary union on the development of social Europe; \u2022 the concept of partnership and the need to give greater priority to the security enshrined in procedures in certain Member States; \u2022 the Structural Funds after 2000 and how to ensure the involvement of all social players in the decisions and operation of policies and funds, for example, should the Funds be redirected to combat increasing exclusion by way of poverty and geography?; \u2022 equality between men and women and how to help single parents, 90 % of whom are women. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Liedekerke UNICE Individual conclusions from the panel Quintin Oliver, former director, NICVA Mr Oliver considered that seven or eight years ago social issues were a latecomer to the debate with respect to economic issues, but now there is the beginning of a creative interaction which reflects the significance and indivisibility of the social and the economic. 'However, there is still much progress to be made. There is political dialogue. There is social dialogue. Yet there is no meaningful civil dialogue because the mechanism to imple ment it is missing'. Since the first forum there has been little interaction and no negotiation to parallel the political dialogue between governments and the social dialogue between trade unions. He proposed a stronger structural connection between NGOs and decision makers. Furthermore, the concept of part nership is overused, sometimes misused. He called for more structure, appropriate budgets, and decision making powers to filter down to the lowest level. 'Only at the local level can you change things within a framework of standards and equalities'. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Liedekerke, UNICE The creation of wealth together with redistribution are key ques tions at the root of all topics. The problem in Europe is that the systems of redistribution worked for a number of years but they are no longer in line with current realities. We need reform to enable us to effectively reconcile economic requirements with the need for fair social measures'. On the Structural Funds, she agreed with the ETUC, that com bating exclusion coincides with combating poverty. However, on behalf of UN1CE, she expressed concern about their reform, particularly of the European Social Fund (ESF). If the ESF helps Increase social protection, by making people more employ able as a result of training, then this is positive. Concerns arise, however, when different measures are intended. 'Equal opportunities have developed more rapidly than other areas and there has been a lot done at the EU level. The chal lenge now is to derive the full advantage from the legislative framework.' She referred to the social partners' success in nego tiating European agreements on parental leave and part-time work, as well as securing the principle of non-discrimination at the EU level. 18 ",
        "Quintin Oliver, former director, NICVA Emilio Gabagllo. Secretary General, ETUC 'However, I'm struck by the negative image of part-time work. It is important for employers and for women because they are at a juncture where it is difficult to reconcile working and family life'. Ms de Liedekerke acknowledged the semantic problem of the term 'European social model' and the diversity of ways social partners are involved in the various Member States masked by the term. In the social dialogue, what is negotiated on are issues within the social partners' field of competence, leav ing social protection matters to the representatives at the EU level. 'There is hence a difference In tasks: the NGOs are active in fields where UNICE has no role outside the workplace.' Emilio Gabaglio, Secretary General, ETUC Emilio Gabaglio also considered what the European social model should be. 'The mix of economic and social policy is now break ing down. The model is becoming vulnerable because the face of Europe has changed. We need to adapt. We are more vul nerable because politicians are exploiting this vulnerability.' More immediately, the introduction of the social chapter into the Amsterdam Treaty meant that Europe had gone some way to redress the balance but not far enough. He referred to the need to develop in parallel with the economic and monetary convergence strategy. 'Whilst EMU is strong, the European employment strategy is just beginning. Social convergence is of the essence too.' He agreed with Ms Wilkinson on the importance of the employ ment guidelines, whilst also recognising that they are not fully In line with basic policy lines as regards social matters. He noted a contradiction between certain guideline proposals and a rec ommendation by the Council of Ministers in 1992 regarding social protection. 'Discussions on social protection should be open, all-inclusive and on the basis of transparent procedures. 1 am not opposed to reform provided it is well founded on principles of solidarity, fairly negotiated and respects the rights of citizens'. As a trade union movement, ETUC's response to social exclu sion is seen in the light of fighting unemployment and creat ing jobs. On the question of whether Europe is responsible for generating exclusion, Mr Gabaglio believes there is a link with the present rate of unemployment for which Europe is respon sible. 'The guidelines are still backward looking so the euro has to be used as a springboard to create jobs and growth on a sustainable basis \u2014 I just don't know if it will succeed.' The next guidelines should reinforce the chapter on equality. 'It is necessary to strengthen policies which invest in childcare, the care of the elderly and to introduce structures to enable women to have full access to the labour market.' He gave ETUC's support of the move to open civil dialogue at the EU level, calling it a logical result of the structure used at all levels. 'ETUC further supports any measure to increase democ racy and citizen participation. The EU needs a fresh intake of air as regards social policy with support through the organi sations. We need proper democratic social rights at the European level.' He recalled the campaign for a European charter for a bill of rights, launched by the platform of European social NGOs and ETUC, due to the fact that various proposals had not been taken into account by the IGC. 19 ",
        "Miguel Angel Cabra de Luna fundaci\u00f3n ONCE Marie-fran\u00e7oise Wilkinson. Chair, platform of European social NGOs Miguel Angel Cabra de Luna, Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE Mr de Luna agreed on the need for a convergence between economic and social policy and emphasised that the NGOs should not be outside the debate. At the same time he maintained that the fight against unemployment was not the NGOs' main task. He saw the fight against social exclusion as one of the major challenges facing Europe. The Structural Funds should concen trate more on preventative measures as opposed to purely giv ing assistance. He expressed satisfaction about the European agreement on part-time work, pointing out that it was not just for women, and that unless there was automatic social protection for part- time workers covered by the agreement the sector would not function properly. 'We need a proper framework to ensure part- time work is a choice rather than an imposition, a right and not just the second best option.' Mr de Luna referred to the 1995 Copenhagen Summit where parties from civil society, particularly vulnerable groups were consulted on designing a measure related to social develop ment. He maintained that the structures of representative democ racy and social dialogue were not enough and that it was necessary to take account of the points of view of civil society for the new social pact. He called for the draft regulations on a European status to be adopted as soon as possible. Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Wilkinson, Chair, platform of European social NGOs Ms Wilkinson also appreciated the need to seek a compromise between economic and social aspects. She emphasised that so far the Treaties had recognised economic, financial and bud getary matters but that social Issues had little regulation at the EU level. She continued by saying that the balance therefore needed to be redressed. 'The NGOs believe the social should dominate over the economic. Social issues are not merely depend ent on economic ones, as a properly functioning society is cru cial for the economy as well. Unless we take measures in the future, the social aspect will play second fiddle and competi tiveness will continue to take precedence over solidarity, whereas it should be the other way around.' Ms Wilkinson believed that Europe deals with social protec tion in an indirect fashion. She underlined the seriousness of the lack of public debate on the tendency towards cutting pub lic expenditure as per the guidelines. 'The recommendations have indirect consequences for social protection and like it or not Europe must learn to deal with social protection openly and democratically. We need to re-dlscuss statutory changes and include public debate in the next revision of the Treaties.' She viewed the revision of the Structural Funds as an oppor tunity to ensure they are used more in combating exclusion, and although this objective is part of the Funds it is not in the text at the moment. 'One of the ways the excluded popula tion can be taken account of better \u00a1n the Structural Funds is to support and encourage partnership with the NGOs in the planning and implementing of the programmes. You simply can't fight exclusion If you don't include the relevant people and organisations in the discussions.' Ms Wilkinson acknowledged the point made by Mr Oliver on the call for a deepening of democracy at all levels. She stressed the urgency of developing civil dialogue, as something that should come about independently of the revision of the Treaties. She noted the platform's proposals to the European Commission 20 ",
        "Jytte Fredensborg. Secretary General. CEEP and expressed the hope of receiving replies soon in order to begin serious discussions. 'However, it's not just a question of approaching the political authorities. We must remember our own responsibility in seeing that rights of expression pre vail In our own organisations and that we are ensuring a voice from the grass-roots level right up. But we can't carry this out unless we have the practical and financial means to do so. This is why we are hoping for a positive solution to the prob lem of the budgetary lines \u2014 otherwise all the preparatory work will be in vain.' Jytte Fredensborg, Secretary General, CEEP 'In Denmark the word 'social' creates confusion when one dis cusses European matters. Social is something decided and is the responsibility for government and local authorities, as is the case for labour market policies', attested Ms Fredensborg. Like Mr Cabra de Luna, Ms Fredensborg considered that the key to fighting exclusion lies in prevention. For example, the way In which new production systems cause exclusion should be examined. The fight against exclusion should also be con sidered in all EU policies: in competition, CAP etc. Furthermore when the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified, Article 137 will enable the Council to adopt measures on a qualified majority basis and this can be used to introduce legislation to fight exclusion. 'Legislation is very much influenced by people's language, so there still remains a lot to be done'. Speaking about partnership, Ms Fredensborg also highlighted the importance of local involvement. 'We care about our role as a social partner. I believe labour market partners discussing and negotiating on labour market issues obviously has great value. Indeed, I am a great fan of all democratic systems in Europe and I note the wish of the NGOs that they are all are included in the democratic proc ess. The one thing that worries me, however, is that we are always trying to create ways for new decisions when we should work in the systems we already have.' Lesley Kilmurray 21 ",
        "A lively Internet chat A live Internet chat took place on Thursday 25 June in the cybercaf\u00e9. It was the first time the Commission had used this particular communication tool at a conference. Commissioner Flynn, DG V officials and occasionally representatives of NGOs answered questions from the public and from people attending the forum who were able to follow the chat on PCs around the hall. The chat lasted an hour and a half and proved lively and use ful. About 70 people took part at one time or another In the discussion which was largely in English but with questions also being asked and answered in French, German, Spanish, Italian and Dutch. Sometimes the number of participants In Internet chats is so great that it can be difficult to follow the questions and answers. It can be a little like listening to a radio programme where several people are talking at the same time. The degree of difficulty is multiplied when the chat that takes place is in more than one language and the replies therefore take longer. Often it will take a minute or two for a question to be trans lated and replied to and in the meantime further questions and answers appear on the screen, making it difficult to relate answers to the original question without a lot of scrolling up and down. On this occasion, however, the number of partic ipants was sufficient to have a wide-ranging discussion but not so great that it became too difficult to follow. Some of the participants displayed a healthy sceptical atti tude towards European social policy, which made for a lively chat with some straight talking and a little gentle banter. Questions ranged from detailed ones about employment and social policy, to more general ones about food aid. The fol lowing exchanges were typical of the spirit in which the chat was conducted, and the wide range of issues raised: 22 ",

After the new employment title in the Treaty it is clear that social policy has a greater role in European policy than before. <FR2> <Eric> to Flynn: How can training for employment help if there are no jobs to go into? <Flynn> FR2, Eric: We must identify the new sources with job potential. The technological age brings many new job opportunities. The key is to have people trained to meet the new requirements. <IT1> If social policy is a priority for Member States, why can't they find a legal basis to unfreeze finances? In the absence of European financial support, what should NGOs do? <heysel3227> Commissioner: How will the Commission ensure that the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty will be accelerated... especially in the light of the European court ruling? <NL1> NL Jan: When are you going to deblock the financing for the NGOs? <Flynn> To NL1 - Jan - On 17 July the Council, Commission and Parliament will be looking at this issue together. We hope that the results will be positive. <Flynn> to Heysel 3227: Could you please specify which court case you are referring to? <heysel3227> Flynn: the court ruling concerning social exclusion. <ES2> from ES infopoint2: Why is it we always have to wait so long for answers to the difficult questions? <Flynn> to Heysel 3227: Do you mean the Court case referring to the legal basis of the budget headings? <heysel3227> Flynn: Yes <Flynn> to Heysel 3227: The ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the legal basis of a given budget heading are clearly two separate issues. The Commission services are currently undertaking a thorough examination with a view to clarifying the problems relating to a number of budget headings. <heysel3227> Flynn: I don't think these are different issues, because the 1999 budget would go without problems if the Treaty is ratified! <Flynn> to Heysel 3227: The Court in the case mentioned earlier required that a budget heading have a basis in Community secondary legislation, i.e. a regulation, a directive etc... The ratification of the Treaty is therefore not related to the Court case. <NL1> NL Karel: Will the accession of new Member States not diminish what they have already achieved in the social field? Or will the accession mean the social bankruptcy of Europe? And who is going to pay for all this? The taxpayer again? <Flynn> NL1, Karel, Accession: No, the aim is to use the period of negotiations to bring the candidate countries up to the same standards as we have in the EU. Funds are earmarked from the PHARE and the Structural Funds' budget for this purpose. <E$2> from ES infopoint: As a result of the common agricultural policy, tonnes of butter, milk and cereals are thrown away or rot in store houses. Why not send it to the countries where they need the food? <Flynn> ES2 to ES infopoint: The Commission aims to have humanitarian policy geared towards structural changes in developing countries. As pointed out earlier, the Commission does send food when necessary. It does not have responsibility for situations like the one you described at national level. <ES2> from ES infopoint2: Why does European Union money go to regulating the agricultural sector and not to manufacturing or research? I think that these sectors will produce the jobs of tomorrow. <Flynn> ES2, ES infopoint2: We know that the budget for the agricultural sector is too high and we are trying to bring about the necessary reforms. But you must remember that we are not alone with the problem \u2014 the USA also has major budget spending on agriculture. As regards spending more on manufacturing or research, I agree on research. We need to invest more in knowledge and technology. But I do not agree about manufacturing. The best policy there is the one we are following. <FR2> <Anna> Would it not be useful to analyse the environment in national action plans - environmental tax is an example, but there are geographical, cooperation and other aspects? This is from the point of view of non-EU Member States or associated countries. <Flynn> FR2, Anna: Promoting sustainable economic growth is very much present in the employment guidelines which require an integrated approach to employment promotion. The Commission is working to implementa recent communication on employment and the environment which would provide for concrete action to implement the employment strategy in this field. The questions and answers have been grouped together to make the transcript easier to read. The full transcript of the chat is on the DG V Internet site at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg05/jobs/forum98/en/chat_en.htm All in all, the Internet chat was considered to be a useful com plement to the forum, and probably worth repeating in the future.

        "An inviting exhibition area 'Inviting' is the first word that comes to mind to describe the exhibition area occupied by Forum 98 on social policy. The word would also describe the layout of the exhibition space of around 1 600 m', which not only offered visitors an excellent overview but also made for easy access to the individual stands. The same, once again, could be said of the cybercaf\u00e9 offering general access to the Internet sites of various organisations exhibiting and to the Forum 98 site. ing to the platform of the European NGOs in the social field.
