        "4 (cid:39)(cid:48)(cid:51)(cid:38)(cid:56)(cid:48)(cid:51)(cid:37) Environment and climate change are nowadays of major concern for European citizens. Every day Europeans hear about global warming, melting of ice, health problems related to environmental degradation, sustainable transportation, pollution in costal areas, and so on. Environmental awareness among European citizens is taking shape but it needs to be improved. European research in the field of environment (including climate change) has a very rich history and achievements, and will continue to play an important role in the years to come. To build an environmentally sustainable economy Europe needs to invest more in knowledge and innovation. Environmental research has three overarching goals to comply with these challenges: to determine the environmental tipping points and trends, to assess the impacts of environmental change and, above all, to develop a capacity to respond by providing new knowledge, technologies and strategies for the sustainability of our planet, and for the wellbeing of European citizens. Through successive European Research Framework Programmes, European researchers contribute to finding solutions to environmental issues. This is sought via strategic partnerships, which will allow to build a European Research Area (ERA) and a knowledge- society based on education, research and innovation. However, as environmental problems have no borders and require a global approach, European research is also promoting important cooperation with third countries, such as USA, China, Russia, India, Brazil, as well as with the Mediterranean, African and Latin American regions. This brochure summaries environmental research funded by the European Union and is divided in two parts. The first provides the context of environmental research \u2013 the historical roots and the political framework as well as an introduction to environmental research in the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), under the theme \u201cEnvironment (including climate change)\u201d, an ambitious research programme. The second part gives an overview of the ten research priorities within the \u201cEnvironment (including climate change)\u201d research theme, and highlights some of the most successful projects in environmental research. I sincerely hope that this comprehensive overview of European environmental research will help convey the main challenges and goals we are facing and to raise awareness of the value of environmental research in our everyday life for the sustainability of our planet.

Environmental concerns have also been on the policy agenda since the European Union was created in 1957. The International Geophysical Year (IGY) was launched in the same year, the first attempt to coordinate global measurements of the Earth, the oceans, the atmosphere and the sun. It also pointed out for the first time that carbon dioxide was building up in the atmosphere. The decades since then have witnessed increasing public concern about our environment and the damage being done to it, alongside greater research efforts to increase knowledge and find solutions. The first environmental directive of the European Economic Community (EEC) was passed in 1967 1 , covering the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances, followed by a first attempt to address the impact of vehicle emissions on air pollution three years later. But it was in 1973 that the first \u201cEuropean Environment Action Programme\u201d was launched, along with the \u201cProtection of the Environment Programme\u201d. In the same year, the Environment and Consumer Protection Directorate was established, the precursor to the current DG Environment (DG ENV) and DG Health and Consumer Protection (DG SANCO). The environmental action programmes continued into the 1980s, and in 1981 the creation of the DG for Environment, Nuclear Safety and Civil Protection coincided with the launch of the Environmental Protection and Climatology research programme. But it was with the introduction of the First Framework Programme (FP1) in 1984 that EU research for the environment as we know it began to take shape. 1 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&lg=en&typ e_doc=Directive&an_doc=1967&nu_doc=548. ",
        "6 The Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development, called Framework Programmes (FP) for short, are funding programmes created by the European Union to support European research. The first FP was launched in 1984 and since then they have increased in both size and ambition. From the start, the purpose of the Framework Programmes has been to encourage transnational collaborative research projects \u2013 an essential requirement for all EU-funded projects has been that research teams come from more than one EU Member State. Over time this has developed into the strategic goal of creating a European Research Area that allows for the integration of the EU\u2019s scientific efforts. Further afield, the Framework Programmes have also been instrumental in encouraging research cooperation with international partners across the globe. Each Framework Programme has had different specific objectives and actions, but there has been a trend since the 1980s away from hard scientific and technological research towards multidisciplinary research focused on social demands. At the same time, the Framework Programmes aim to address the problem of fragmentation at the European level and the increasing complexity and costs of high- level research \u2013 which few Member States have the resources to address and undertake alone. Framework programmes (cid:35)(cid:86)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:1)(cid:80)(cid:71)(cid:1)(cid:85)(cid:73)(cid:70)(cid:1)(cid:38)(cid:54)(cid:1)(cid:39)(cid:83)(cid:66)(cid:78)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:76)(cid:1)(cid:81)(cid:83)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:66)(cid:78)(cid:78)(cid:70)(cid:84) E U R O S ( B I L L I O N S ) 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 FP1 (1984-87) FP2 (1987-91) FP3 (1990-94) FP4 (1994-98) FP5 (1998-02) FP6 (2002-06) FP7 (2007-13) EUROPEAN RESEARCH: THE \u201cADDED VALUE\u201d FP1 introduced the concept of coordinated European Community research within an established timeframe and structure. The guiding principle was (and remains) to support research which benefits from the \u201cadded value\u201d of being conducted at the European level, a principle that has gradually evolved into the concept of the European Research Area (ERA) 2 . Environmental issues have been a part of the Framework Programmes from the beginning. However, whereas the primary focus of FP1 was technological and on energy (which captured 49 per cent of the budget), 2 See http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/index_en.html for more information about the European Research Area. ",
        "7 subsequent Framework Programmes began to incorporate a more multidisciplinary \u201csystems approach\u201d and focus on Europe\u2019s economic and social needs, including environmental protection. Environmental research was an obvious beneficiary: problems like polluted waterways or acid rain do not respect national boundaries so need to be tackled in a coordinated way. The need for cross-country collaboration paved the way for environmental R&D becoming a research priority of the Framework Programmes. Early examples of environmental research collaboration are the European Arctic Stratosphere Ozone Experiment (EASOE) 3 , which started in 1989 in response to concerns about the ozone layer (and as part of the EU\u2019s commitment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol), and the ECHIVAL Field Experiment in a Desertification Threatened Area (EFEDA) project 4 , launched in 1990, which sought to bring an integrated response to water shortage in semi-arid regions. INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH Expanding environmental awareness in Europe was reflected in the growing funds allocated to environmental research. By the time FP3 was launched in 1991, environmental research and marine sciences already had a budget of 410 million ecus (or euros \u2013 the conversion rate was one to one). FP4 (1994-98) research in the environment and climate had a budget of 914 million ecus / euros (with a further 243 million dedicated to marine sciences and technologies, or MAST). FP5 (1998-2002) saw the budget rise to \u20ac2.1 billion in the programme \u201cEnergy, Environment and Sustainable development\u201d with \u20ac1.1 billion dedicated to the \u201cEnvironment and Sustainable Development\u201d sub-programme. FP6\u2019s \u201cSustainable Development, Global Change and Ecosystems\u201d programme had a total budget of \u20ac2.3 billion (of which \u20ac853 million supported 280 projects in the \u201cGlobal Change and Ecosystems\u201d sub-programme). The \u201cEnvironment (including climate change)\u201d theme of FP7 (2007-13) was allocated a budget of \u20ac1.9 million.

        "8 MAJOR RESULTS FROM FP5 AND FP6 Environmental research progressed notably in the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes \u2013 FP5, running from 1998-2002, and FP6, from 2002 to 2006. At a time when the idea of a European Research Area first began to surface, the Framework Programmes reinforced the strength of environmental research within Europe and with its research partners. Reflecting this, FP-funded environmental research achieved a number of results in this period. FP5-funded research within the \u201cEnvironment and Sustainable Development Programme\u201d focused on four key actions which followed a problem-solving approach: Sustainable management and quality of water; 1. Global change, climate and biodiversity; 2. Sustainable marine ecosystems; 3. The city of tomorrow and cultural heritage. 4. In addition research and technological development was conducted in the fields of natural hazard research, earth observation, and the socio-economic aspects of environmental change and sustainable development. Research infrastructures were also created and reinforced, in particular in the areas of climate and global change, marine, and natural hazards research. Notable research successes were in marine research, especially the development of integrated management tools for European seas and coastal regions. FP6 built on the work of FP5, with a total of 280 projects supported by EU funds in the \u201cGlobal Change and Ecosystems\u201d programme. The thematic coverage grew to ten areas, the most important of which in terms of budgetary allocation were: research into the impact and mechanisms of greenhouse gas (21.4 per cent of the total), the water cycle (19.9 per cent), and biodiversity (17.3 per cent). Notable in FP6\u2019s structure was the growing space given to international cooperation and SME support, reflecting on the one hand the need for more research cooperation with third countries, and on the other the need to strengthen the links between scientists and industry. The need to support policymakers was also recognised, and a new research tool tailored specifically for the purpose was created across the FP, the \u201cScientific Support to Policies\u201d projects (see below). Major research was undertaken in the polar regions, including climate change research in the Arctic, while mitigation strategies were developed in the urban, marine, and soil areas. ",

This is the region where Green parties first found political footing and where waste recycling first became standard practice. Member States have also committed themselves to a number of national and international environmental conventions: from the use of pesticides to the trade in endangered species, from urban air quality to the Kyoto Protocol 5 , the EU is dedicated to environmental political action. Environmental concerns and the public demand for policies that support the environment are likely to grow even further in coming years. Public concerns about environmental degradation and unsustainable development, the greater visibility of environmental disasters around the world and preoccupations about the future have created a powerful stimulus for politicians to act. Climate change is a case in point. There is now political consensus that climate change is a fact and that action must be taken. This consensus was notably achieved following the release of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007. The report presents findings that show most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20 th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. In addition, discernible human influences now extend to other aspects of climate, including ocean warming, continental average temperatures, temperature extremes and wind patters. The credibility of the IPCC, in which many leading European climate scientists are involved, lends weight to the argument that climate change is a problem that needs to be tackled urgently. For new policies to be effective and to be accepted by society, they need to have a strong rationale, especially through scientific evidence. Scientific research also offers the prospect of providing solutions to environmental problems. Environmental research is thus given the twin tasks of both raising awareness and providing solutions. It is through this increased knowledge that more accurate predictions can be made about the future and concrete steps proposed to avoid the worst climate change scenarios from taking place. THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY Sustainable development is a core objective of the European Union: we need to ensure that our present socio-economic development does not compromise our future. Current EU policies are based on the renewed Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) of June 2006, where research and development plays an important and multifaceted role. 6 5 The protocol is part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. See http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/kyoto.htm for more information. 6 See http://ec.europa.eu/sustainable/sds2001/index_en.htm for details about the 2001 SDS, and http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/ en/06/st10/st10117.en06.pdf for the renewed strategy document. ",
        "10 The renewed strategy identifies seven key challenges: Climate change and clean energy 1. Sustainable transport 2. Sustainable consumption and production 3. Better management of natural resources 4. Public health 5. Social inclusion 6. Global poverty. 7. Multi-faceted by nature, incorporating environmental, economic and social concerns, sustainable development is tackled in a similarly multi-faceted way in the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7). 7 The FP7\u2019s integrated approach identifies the need for cross-cutting thematic contributions, concepts and improved measuring tools. The Cooperation Programme, the largest part of FP7 (with around 60 per cent of the budget) has ten themes, each of which calls for sustainable development-related research. These focus for example on enhancing energy and resource efficiency, increasing the quality of the monitoring and management of natural resources and on boosting the development of smart technologies leading to sustainable production and consumption. New short- and long-term visionary concepts will be called for in order to break the link between economic prosperity and environmental degradation. Finally, in terms of monitoring sustainable development, improved indicators and impact assessments will be developed. 7 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_412/l_41220061230en00010041.pdf for a full transcript of the decision. ",
        "11 As illustrated in the table below, each of the key challenges identified by the renewed SDS is addressed in the FP7 Cooperation Programme. FROM SCIENCE TO POLICY: STRENGTHENING THE LINK The importance of scientific research for policymakers is now well-established. However the risk remains that the research proves little relevant to policymakers, or even that significant scientific conclusions fail to reach the attention of policymakers. The European Commission, aware of this potential problem, have introduced new instruments to strengthen the link between science and policy. One such instrument, introduced in FP6, was called Scientific Support to Policies (SSP). The overall objective was to support European Community policies by providing demand-driven scientific contributions targeting specific policy needs. While policy-driven research is nothing new, the SSP structure formalised the mechanism and made it explicit. In particular, it has broadened the field of policies supported by research and has strengthened the links between science and policy. Environmental research has fed into policies developed not only at DG Environment (notably the 6 th Environmental Action Plan 8 ), but also at DG Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, DG Education and Cultural Affairs, and DG Health and Consumer Protection. Environmental research in FP6 was particularly geared towards informing policymakers. Policy-focused research priorities in the \u201cGlobal Change and Ecosystems\u201d thematic area included: \u201c Environmental Assessment (soil, water, air, noise, including the effects of chemical substances) \u201d; \u201c Environmental Technologies for support 8 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2002/l_242/l_24220020910en00010015.pdf. The Plan is under review, and the Commission\u2019s communication can be found at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2002/l_242/l_24220020910en00010015.pdf.

FP7 continues where FP6 left off, addressing in a integrated manner those areas that require urgent policy action, filling the knowledge gaps revealed by previous research (for example, the need to better understand the influence of ocean movements on climate), and addressing emerging issues. The research supports EU-level policies, thematic strategies, programmes and directives, as well as needs arising from the implementation of international commitments at the EU-level. All of the four activities in the \u201cEnvironment (including climate change)\u201d theme include projects that are geared towards policy support.

        "13 European water is under pressure. According to European Commission statistics, one-fifth of surface water is threatened by pollution, almost two-thirds of drinking water is overexploited and half of the wetlands are endangered. Water-related environmental research has been carried out for many years through the Framework Programmes. The RIANA system, for example, was developed in the 1990s to rapidly detect dangerous substances in rivers. Water-based research continues today with around half of the first calls for proposals in FP7 devoted directly or indirectly to water. This research feeds into EU policies. Europe has taken the quality of its water resources seriously for some time, with the first directives introduced in the 1970s. European water policy underwent a thorough review in the 1990s, leading to the adoption of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 1 in 2000. This streamlines the large body of legislation (on sewage treatment, drinking water, 1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2000/l_327/ l_32720001222en00010072.pdf. pollution, etc) into one over-arching strategy. The WFD also demands a global approach, based on river basins rather than national boundaries. In that way downstream users do not have to pay for upstream polluters. The main aims of the WFD are to: expand the scope of water protection; achieve \u201cgood status\u201d for all waters by 2015; base water management on a river basins approach; use a combined approach of emission limits and quality standards; get prices right; involve citizens; streamline legislation. With a timeframe running to 2027, the WFD is set to transform the quality of our water resources and the way we use them. Spotlight on water security ",

Theme six is called \u201cEnvironment (including climate change)\u201d: with a total budget of \u20ac1.9 billion, it will be the cornerstone of environmental research in Europe.

The budget allocated to environmental research has more than doubled in comparison to FP6 (the EU budget contribution has increased from \u20ac852 million in FP6 to a projected \u20ac1.9 billion in FP7), and this is reflected in more projects, resources and, ultimately, ambition. Environmental research in FP7 has multiple strategic goals which aim to raise our knowledge about the environment and propose policy and technological solutions to deal with environmental problems facing Europe and the world, like the loss of biodiversity and the melting of the Arctic icecap. Research for the environment is multifaceted and interdisciplinary, and while this brings many challenges it also offers wide scope for increasing knowledge and providing solutions. CONSTRUCTING AN ENVIRONMENTAL EUROPEAN RESEARCH AREA The broad strategic goal is to further the integration of environmental research across the region. One of the underlying motivations behind the Framework Programmes has been the creation of the European Research Area (ERA) \u2013 an ambitious attempt to leverage greater and faster results from the combined research resources of the EU through improved coordination. This means joint research projects that cross national borders (as supported by the Framework Programmes), greater coordination between national research programmes (as encouraged in the ERA-NET scheme 9 ) and greater researcher mobility (as encouraged by ERA-MORE 10 ). 9 See http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/index_en.cfm?p=9_eranet. 10 The European Researcher\u2019s Mobility portal can be found at: http://ec.europa.eu/eracareers/index_en.cfm. ",
        "15 Environmental research benefits from this. There is less chance for duplication in research \u2013 instead research topics that would normally be beyond the scope of national institutions or programmes can be tackled jointly. A good example of this is research in marine biodiversity: most information to date has been fragmented and local, yet EU-funded research has allowed scientists from across Europe to come together and build a profile of marine biodiversity across the continent. GREENING THE ECONOMY In order for the European Union to meet its environmental commitments, it is necessary to move onto a more sustainable growth trajectory. That means using consumption and production systems that have a low environmental impact while providing new economic opportunities, growth and employment. Research into environmental technologies, one of the four main activities of the \u201cEnvironment (including climate change)\u201d theme, is at the forefront of this drive. Technologies that improve integrated water management, that improve waste treatment or which phase out animal testing \u2013 these are just some examples of environmental technologies being investigated in FP7. Through the introduction of such technologies, we shall be able to reduce the negative impact of human activities on the environment and manage resources more efficiently. It also means greening the economy, which will allow Europe to move into a state where economic growth is no longer synonymous with resource depletion. A GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP International cooperation is an integral feature of the Framework Programmes. It ranges from increased researcher mobility 11 to large scale international collaboration efforts like the ITER nuclear fusion project 12 . It is growing in scale, as the benefits of greater collaboration become apparent \u2013 there are now more than 100 countries involved in EU research programmes. Environmental research is a particularly good example of this, since many environmental challenges, like desertification, do not follow national and regional borders and are replicated across the world. By combining research teams from across the world specialised in desertification new data and scientific solutions can more easily be found. Environmental research sponsored by the EU already has a good track record in international cooperation. The \u201cGlobal Change and Ecosystems\u201d programme was the thematic programme with the most third country research participation in FP6. It allocated more than \u20ac37 million, or 4.6 per cent of the total budget to fund third country participants in European research teams. A good example of successful international cooperation in the \u201cGlobal Change and Ecosystems\u201d programme is the ALARM project 13 , focused on biodiversity, which brought together 200 scientists working in 67 institutions from 35 countries around the world, including 17 non-EU countries. International cooperation in research is often anchored in institutional agreements between the EU and third countries. Some nearby countries like Switzerland and Turkey are associated and contribute individually to the FP and benefit as full members of the European Research Area (ERA) and can participate in EU research 11 The ERA-MORE researcher\u2019s mobility portal is encouraging this (http://ec.europa.eu/eracareers/index_en.cfm), as is the People programme within FP7 (http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/people/home_en.html). 12 http://www.iter.org/. 13 http://www.alarmproject.net/alarm/.

        "16 projects like any EU member state. Researchers and institutions in the developing world also participate and can receive budgetary support to assist them. Finally an increasing number of science and technology (S&T) agreements have been made between the European Union and third countries like China, Japan and the USA, ensuring closer research collaboration and mutual benefits 14 . The main novelty in FP7 compared to previous programmes is that international cooperation has been mainstreamed, with any third country researcher or institution being able to participate in FP7 calls. In addition, there are projects dedicated specifically to international cooperation (with a geographical focus in the developing world for example). These are called Specific International Cooperation Actions (SICAs), and they accounted for around one-sixth of first round calls in 2007, including research into the health impacts of drought and desertification and into river basin twinning initiatives as a tool to implement EU water initiatives. RAISING AWARENESS Most environmental threats are discreet and long-term by nature. The loss of biodiversity has been occurring for centuries. Environmental risks to our health often take many decades to build up. For that reason, it is crucial that public awareness of these issues is maintained, if only to put environmental issues on the political agenda and encourage policymakers to act. The need to keep environmental concerns on the political agenda is therefore an important implicit aim of FP7, as it was for preceding Framework Programmes. Evidence from research is one of the most important tools for this. A good example of this is climate change. The debate surrounding climate change has raged since the 1970s, and it is overwhelming scientific evidence that has slowly undermined the arguments of doubters and helped to achieve consensus on the issue. The link between greenhouse gases and global warming, and the large body of evidence that these greenhouse gases are primarily man-made, has raised public concern and put such initiatives as carbon trading and clean technologies on the policy agenda. EU-funded environmental research continues to provide insights into what is happening to our environment, in Europe and further afield. This greater knowledge of the intricate processes underway allows policymakers to devise legislation that allows our societies to adapt to and mitigate the most harmful effects. NOVELTIES OF FP7 FP7 shows close continuity with preceding Framework Programmes in furthering trans-national research, for example. It is also reinforcing initiatives that were successfully introduced in previous years, like the ERA-NET scheme. At the same time, there are a number of novelties that have been introduced in FP7. One major novelty is the creation of the European Research Council (ERC), which will effectively work as a national research council at the European level. The ERC has been established to encourage groundbreaking science proposed by leading researchers themselves 15 . The ERC will also take more responsibility for project implementation. A more obvious difference with the previous Framework Programmes is the sheer size of the total FP7 budget, triple the size of FP6. This increases the scope of research and supports the EU objective of reaching R&D spending that is 3 per cent of GDP by 2010. The structure of FP7 is also larger and more integrated, with the 14 See http://ec.europa.eu/research/iscp/index.cfm?lg=en&pg=countries for a complete list of these agreements. 15 See http://erc.europa.eu/.

        "17 breakdown into four major areas \u2013 \u201cCooperation, \u201cPeople\u201d, \u201cIdeas\u201d, and \u201cCapacities\u201d (with a fifth, Euratom, dedicated to nuclear research). The main area, \u201cCooperation\u201d, is also specifically dedicated to the major research subjects of European research. Finally the length of the Framework Programme has been extended, from five to seven years. This is in acknowledgement of the typical life cycle of research projects, and the time needed for good research to be successfully planned and concluded. Within the environmental research theme, there is also evidence of both novelty and continuity with previous Framework Programmes. For example, new activities are to be supported in the fields of environment and health, environmental technologies, sustainable development and earth observation. Sustainable development has been mainstreamed as a component and objective of all European research (not just environmental). Above all, environmental research in FP7 is building on the successes of previous environmental research, with the following research themes the main fields in which the research will be conducted. FP7 ACTIVITIES Directorate I in the Research Directorate General is in charge of implementing and overseeing the environmental research programme, which is composed of four main research activities Climate Change, Pollution and Risks: As the title of the overall research theme suggests, climate change is a major focus of environmental research in FP7, a reflection of growing public and political concern. This research activity has three interlinked components (called sub-activities): \u201cPressures on environment ",
        "18 and climate\u201d, \u201cEnvironment and health\u201d, and \u201cNatural hazards\u201d. The focus will be on developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. Sustainable Management of Resources: This activity encompasses two sub-activities: \u201cConservation and sustainable management of natural and man-made resources and biodiversity\u201d, and \u201cManagement of marine environments\u201d. The focus will be on improving the knowledge base about natural resources and developing ideas for their sustainable management. Environmental Technologies: As the name suggests, this activity, is concerned with the development of applications that offer better protection to the environment than current alternatives. It is divided into three sub-activities: \u201cEnvironmental technologies for observation, simulation, prevention, mitigation, adaptation, remediation and restoration of the natural and man-made environment\u201d, \u201cProtection, Conservation and Enhancement of Cultural Heritage, including Human Habitat\u201d, and \u201cTechnology Assessment, Verification and Testing\u201d. Earth Observation and Assessment Tools for Sustainable Development: This activity has two major components: the development and integration of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the development of forecasting methods and assessment tools for sustainable development. Cross-cutting issues such as dissemination activities, communication actions, management of networks of national contact points (NCPs) and coordination of international cooperation are also addressed in order to improve the visibility of the ERA. 10 specific research areas which are addressed by these activities can be found in the second part of this brochure. TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS AND JOINT TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES By the start of 2007, thirty-one European Technology Platforms (ETPs) had been set up. The aim: bringing together stakeholders, under industrial leadership, to define and implement a Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) of research and technological progress in the medium- and long-term. The ETPs are an important tool for defining future research priorities. Of the thirty-one ETPs, twelve have a \u201csustainable development\u201d element, and four have a specific link to environmental research \u2013 including the Food for Life, the Sustainable Chemistry and the Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform. FP7 aims to strengthen the ETPs and go beyond through the creation of Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs): public- private partnerships which will have the task of implementing ETP SRAs. Six areas have so far been identified for JTIs, including Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), and Fuel Cells and Hydrogen. ",
        "19 COORDINATING NATIONAL PROGRAMMES One of the novelties of FP6 was the creation of ERA-NETs, set up to encourage collaboration and, eventually, integration between national and regional research programmes in similar fields. The idea is that bottom- up collaboration between national research funding agencies will help further the cause of the European Research Area. At the simplest level this means the exchange of best practice and research, and the coordination of respective national programmes to avoid unnecessary duplication. At the most ambitious level this means the launching of joint programming and calls and the integration of each others\u2019 research budgets into a common pot. Fifteen environmental ERA-NETs were formed in FP6. Environmental ERA-NETS will be further developed under FP7, including in new areas such as Environment & Health and Cultural heritage. Furthermore, FP7 offers the possibility to ERA-Nets to upgrade to ERA-NET Plus, where the Commission offers to top up to a third of joint research projects in a joint call. The ultimate aim is full programme integration across countries. This might lead to an \u201cArticle 169\u201d initiative that allows for financial participation by the European Community in research programmes undertaken by several Member States 16 . 16 Article 169 of the EC Treaty allows for Community support in research projects, through financial participation and closer coordination. As it requires high-level authorisation (from both the European Parliament and Council) it is usually reserved for major projects \u2013 the first one, on \u201cEuropean and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership\u201d (EDCTP) was launched in FP6, and further are expected over the course of FP7. See ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/coordination/docs/169_faq_270505.pdf for more information. ",
        "20 PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION The increase in private funding of research is critical if one of the key objectives of the Lisbon Agenda is to be met: achieving 3 per cent of GDP in R&D across the European Union (compared to 1.85 per cent in 2005). Since only around 55 per cent of R&D is financed by the private sector (compared to up to three-quarters in Japan and South Korea), involving businesses more closely in research is seen as critical to achieving this goal. Concurrently with this goal is the more general aim of bridging the gap between research and development. Too often cutting-edge research does not leave the laboratory, and it has been recognised that the link between scientists and the private sector needs to be reinforced. Both large companies and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have a role to play. Typically, large companies have the means and scope to lead research consortiums. SMEs meanwhile can contribute through their specialised niches, and the applied knowledge they can bring. Private involvement in Framework Programmes started in the 1980s, and was sought to be enhanced with the establishment of the ETPs that is now helping to structure the public-private relationship. SMEs in particular are encouraged to participate in all research actions and, in FP7, a significant number of SME-relevant research topics were identified in the first calls for proposals for research in the \u201cEnvironment (including climate change)\u201d theme. Given SMEs\u2019 natural interests, their main participation is in environmental technologies research, which offers the possibility of creating applications that can be brought to the market. CROSS-THEMATIC APPROACHES More than ever before, cross-thematic collaboration is seen as one of the goals of European research. Just as the focus has shifted from pure science and technological innovations to addressing socio-economic issues, so the need for an interdisciplinary approach has grown. Environmental research has been at the forefront of this trend, and EU-funded environmental research projects in past and present Framework Programmes typically include researchers from many different disciplines: biologists and ICT engineers working on a biodiversity database, for example, or conservation scientists working with climatologists on cultural heritage. And this is set to continue: the FP7 \u201cCooperation\u201d programme has its \u20ac32.4 billion budget divided into ten research themes, with ample opportunities for the cross-fertilisation of research interests amongst each other. In practice, this would be enhanced in particular through coordinated or joint calls for proposals among various themes. A spectacular example of such cross- thematic cooperation in FP7 is the ambitious joint call on biorefineries, which takes a life cycle approach to biofuels, and in which the Environment (including climate change) takes part. Such activities will support the EU\u2019s recently launched ambitious energy and climate change strategy. ",
        "21 Fish used to detect water pollution in river systems. Intelligently designed buildings that can cut energy consumption by half or more. Micro-organisms that can produce detergents, vitamins or biofuels. Environmental technologies are concrete solutions to environmental problems or ones that leave a minimal environmental footprint. The European Commission launched the Environmental Technologies Action Plan (ETAP) in January 2004 1 . The aim is to stimulate the development and use of environmental technologies by removing financial, economic and institutional barriers to their development and uptake. Indeed, environment technologies are seen as the sphere where the G\u00f6teborg and Lisbon Agendas can meet. The tension between greater competitiveness and sustainability concerns can be resolved if environmental technologies are encouraged: greater use of technology (competitiveness) with a small environmental impact (sustainability). Eco-industries in the EU have an estimated turnover of some \u20ac227 billion, around a quarter of the world market, and as such the EU is a world leader in the field. However green technologies are still relatively niche (goods and services produced by eco-industries represent around 2 per cent of the EU\u2019s combined GDP). The ETAP seeks to change this situation. Market conditions need to be 1 See http://ec.europa.eu/environment/etap/index_en.htm. improved, with \u201cgreen investment funds\u201d created to reduce risks, and national road maps towards environmental technologies elaborated (including the framing of policies and incentives to bolster eco-innovation creation and use). The links between research and markets, between scientists and end-users, also need to be closer. This can be seen in the emergence of technology platforms in EU-funded research, and the increasing participation of both large multinationals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in research projects. By making explicit the link between research, innovation and industrial development, more environmental technologies conceived in the laboratory can find their way to the marketplace. The more the merrier when it comes to greening the economy. Engineering a greener future ",

        "24 Climate change Climate change is arguably among the most pressing concerns on the environmental agenda, and now certainly the most well-known amongst the public. From initial observations of global warming and proposed ideas about the root causes, a steady consensus has built up that climate change is one of the most serious threats facing the world today, and moreover that it is largely humanity\u2019s fault. It is therefore our responsibility to deal with it. EU research is conducted to increase knowledge about what exactly is happening to our climate, specifically the causes and consequences. Effort is also being spent on improving our modelling so that the future climate can be predicted more accurately. Through this research, it will then be possible to develop effective adaptation and mitigation strategies that will minimise the worst impacts of climate change. CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH: ITS EUROPEAN ROOTS Research into climate change has an illustrious European history. In the 19th century Germany\u2019s Wladimir K\u00f6ppen laid the foundations for climatology, while in the 1930s it was the British scientist Guy Stewart Callendar who first drew the link between rising carbon dioxide levels and global temperature. Climate change research has been present in the EU\u2019s Framework Programmes since the 1980s. An early focus was on the stratosphere and on the ozone layer in particular. The EU was at the heart of the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988. In the 1990s, research concentrated on the carbon cycle \u2013 the first network, called Euroflux was launched in 1996. In the following year, the EU Member States signed the Kyoto Protocol. Since then climate change research has proliferated in size and complexity. FP5 supported a number of projects in key action two of the environmental research programme, \u201cGlobal Change, Climate and Biodiversity\u201d. FP6 supported 31 projects on climate change, with research areas ranging from atmospheric pollutants to the prediction of climate change and its impacts. The growing body of scientific knowledge helps to support future research needs and provide a more accurate picture for policymakers. ",
        "25 CLIMATE CHANGE IN FP7 Research in FP7 aims to support projects that analyse the pressures on the environment and climate from natural and man-made emissions and improve our understanding of the complex climate system. Results from FP6 projects, for example from research in carbon sinks and strateospheric ozone, have been taken into consideration and emerging concerns are to be addressed, like ocean acidification and possible changes to the thermohaline circulation. Six research areas have been identified: 1. The Earth System and Climate: Functioning and abrupt changes 2. Emissions and Pressures: Natural and anthropogenic 3. The Global Carbon cycle - Greenhouse Gas budgets 4. Future Climate 5. Climate Change Natural and Socio-economic Impacts 6. Response strategies: Adaptation, Mitigation and Policies Moreover, it is now requested to many of the new projects working on technology development to produce also a full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The analysis of these data will support a better appreciation of the potential changes to the greenhouse gas balance due to the full market exploitation of these technologies. With the first calls in 2007, the research projects will provide a major step forward in our knowledge about climate change and the strategies needed to combat its most harmful effects. SPOTLIGHT ON AMMA The African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) 17 project is one of nine climate change research projects in FP6 that focus on areas outside the EU. The \u20ac35 million AMMA project, launched at the start of 2005, brings together 131 funding and participating institutions from 28 countries in Europe, Africa and North America. Its focus is on the West African monsoon region, an area that has changed dramatically since the 1950s, witnessing progressively drier conditions. This has had major environmental and socio-economic effects. Climate change in coming decades is likely to increase the region\u2019s vulnerability, and the AMMA project aims to provide locals with improved assessments about future rainfall patterns, as influenced by natural variability and by anticipated global climate change. Mobilising an unprecedented amount of both financial and human resources, the project will provide important insights into the effect of climate change on tropical regions. Its focus is not just on weather patterns but also on the socio-economic impact of climate and monsoon change, especially on crop yields, water resources and health. 17 http://amma.mediasfrance.org/ ",
        "26 Natural hazards Floods in Europe, earthquakes in North Africa, hurricanes in the Caribbean. Mankind has been at the mercy of natural disasters for millennia. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was a stark reminder to the world of how vulnerable we still are. Now the threat of climate change could bring even more such danger as the frequency of extreme weather events increase. The scientific community has responded with various initiatives to mitigate the impact of these natural hazards. A system of beacons is being placed in the world\u2019s oceans as an early warning system for future tsunamis. Japanese researchers are world-leading in the creation of building materials and structures that can resist earthquakes. In Europe, where floods constitute the most significant natural hazard, efforts are being made to improve river management and to develop other strategies that can mitigate the effect of flooding. DISASTER MITIGATION The EU has supported research on natural disasters in its Framework Programmes since the 1980s, focusing on floods, landslides, earthquakes, forest fires, avalanches and volcanic eruptions \u2013 all phenomena that have affected Europe in recent years. Natural disasters cannot really be prevented \u2013 it is beyond our means to stop hurricanes from occurring or volcanoes from erupting, but land use in vulnerable areas strongly affects their impact. Therefore research has focused on providing vulnerability assessment methodologies for land use planning, early warning tools, as well as risk assessment techniques for pre- and post-disaster planning and mitigation. Examples of such research includes forest fire behaviour modelling or landslide and avalanche mitigation techniques. Natural disaster research has increasingly taken a holistic and integrated approach to the management and mitigation of natural disasters. Helping to achieve this is the Euro-Mediterranean Disaster Information Network (EU-MEDIN) 18 , set up during the course of FP6, which promotes the accessibility of research results, and techniques for data integration and harmonisation of methods for the disaster science community in the European and Mediterranean regions. 18 http://www.eu-medin.org/ ",
        "27 NATURAL HAZARDS RESEARCH IN FP7 In FP7 environmental research, natural hazards research will be undertaken to improve the management of disasters. In particular, research will look into creating integrated risk assessments, including those that combine spatial planning, mapping and modelling. Furthermore a multidisciplinary approach will be taken that better understands the various factors at work as well as the impact of natural hazards on the environment and on society. Moreover, research is also developing technologies for forecasting, measuring and damage prevention and minimisation. Natural hazards under the spotlight for the first round of calls included storms, volcanic threats, floods and avalanches, though more hazards will be covered as more feedback from FP6 projects emerge. Natural hazards research supports the implementation of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction 19 and its framework for action (2005-15), which uses a multidisciplinary and integrated approach. At the European level, research contributes to EU activities like civil protection that aims to better protect people, their environment, property and cultural heritage in the event of major natural or man-made disasters. SPOTLIGHT ON FLOOD RESEARCH Climate change over coming decades will probably see Europe exposed to ever greater flood risks, with major flood events in recent years raising the alarm bells about future trends. The situation has been aggravated in recent years by the unsustainable management of river systems, including construction activity in major flood plains. EU-funded research in flood risk management has been occuring since the 1980s, but gathered noticeable pace in FP6. The \u20ac14 million FLOODsite project 20 launched in early 2004 is the largest flood research project to date, bringing together 36 partners from 13 countries. It focuses on the physical, environmental, ecological and socio-economic aspects of floods. The main expected outcome is the development of an integrated European flood risk analysis and management methodology and new techniques that support flood risk management. In addition the HYDRATE project is developing concepts to advance our capability to monitor the hydrometeorological processes which control flash flood triggering at small hydrological scale, which is a key element for effective flash flood risk mitigation. At the same time, CRUE 21 was one of the first environmental ERA-NETS, an opportunity for national and regional agencies across Europe to improve their cooperation in the funding of flood risk research. 19 http://www.unisdr.org/ 20 http://www.floodsite.net/ 21 http://www.crue-eranet.net/ ",
        "28 Environment and Health Environmental factors like noise or air pollution can have a negative effect on human health, and opinion polls show that Europeans are increasingly concerned about the influence of these factors on their and their children\u2019s health. There are worrying trends that reinforce this concern. Cancer rates are increasing at around one per cent per year, while fertility rates are declining. Allergies and asthma are also up around five per cent per year. Air pollution and exposure to chemicals are commonly seen as causes, while there are new environmental threats linked to emerging technologies like mobile phones and nanotechnology. Even global warming may cause unpredictable health issues, for example as climate change allows diseases to spread to previously unreachable regions. AT THE FOREFRONT Europe has been at the forefront of research into environment and health (E&H) for many years. One of the priorities of the fourth European Commission Medical and Health Research Programme (1987-1991) was \u201cenvironment and lifestyle-related health problems\u201d, as well as research into passive smoking and chemicals exposure. The baton was also taken up by the first and second Biomedicine and Health Research Programmes (BIOMED1 and 2) during the 1990s, with themes focused on risks in occupational medicine and diseases of major socio-economic impact. A more integrated approach to E&H began to emerge in the Fifth Framework Programme (1998-2002). E&H topics were mainly covered in the first theme, \u201cQuality of Life and Management of Living Resources\u201d 22 , with 92 projects E&H initiated. FP6\u2019s budget for E&H research increased from around \u20ac40 to \u20ac50 million. POLICY CONTEXT One of the main drivers for E&H research is the European Commission\u2019s Environment and Health Action Plan (EHAP), adopted in 2004 and set to run to 2010. The plan aims to improve our understanding of the links between environmental factors and health, and is partially inspired by the need to link policy with research results. E&H is part of the Sustainable Development Strategy, and it is recognised that an early response to E&H threats will lighten the burden on public health sectors. 22 http://cordis;europa.eu/life/ ",
        "29 Moreover, in June 2007 entered into force the new REACH regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. In this context, it is expected that research will improve today's risk-assessment methodologies and will make available new testing methods that reduce, replace and refine the use of animals for toxicological and eco-toxicological safety testing. The European Commission also engages actively with international bodies like the World Health Organisation (WHO) on initiatives like the Children\u2019s Health and Environment Action Plan for Europe (CEHAPE) 23 and the OECD\u2019s Task Force on Endocrine Disruptors 24 . FP7 AND ONWARDS E&H research is to receive a significant boost in overall funding during FP7. The area is also becoming more fully integrated into environmental research. Several priorities can be identified through the whole programme: 1. Health impacts of climate change 2. Health effects of environmental stressors other than climate change 3. Methods and decision support tools for environmental health risk analysis and policy development 4. Methodologies of risk assessment for chemicals 5. Alternative testing and screening methods for industrial chemicals, refining, reducing and replacing the use of animals Other FP7 themes \u2013 in particular \u201cHealth\u201d and \u201cFood, Agriculture, Fisheries and Biotechnology\u201d \u2013 will complement these E&H activities. In addition, an E&H related ERA-NET is launched, allowing for greater coordination between national and regional research-funding institutions in Europe. SPOTLIGHT ON INTERPHONE As the take-up of mobile phones began to take off at the end of last century, increasing concerns were voiced about the potential health effects, particularly of the strong electromagnetic fields (EMFs) that they created. The European Commission responded by financing a raft of eight major research projects over the course of FP5, some of which were continued into FP6. One of these projects was INTERPHONE (International case control studies of cancer risk in relation to mobile telephone use) 25 , which brought together research teams from 13 countries in Europe and elsewhere, under the coordination of the World Health Organisation\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer. The focus was on three cancer tumour groups. The EU funded the international coordination effort and the work of nine research teams in the European Research Area. The results are still being processed from all the national datasets, but initial indications are that regular mobile-phone users are at little risk, though long-term and intensive use could increase risk, especially of acoustic neuromas. 23 http://www.euro.who.int/childhealthenv/policy/20020724_2 24 http://www.oecd.org/document/63/0,3343,en_2649_34377_2350207_1_1_1_1,00.html 25 http://www.iarc.fr/ENG/Units/RCAd.html ",
        "30 Natural resources management An implicit goal of environmental research is about getting to know the human impact on the environment with a view to minimising its negative effects. Indeed sustainable development, a major goal of the European Union is precisely about that \u2013 making sure our current economic growth and way of living does not jeopardise that of future generations. As our economic growth and way of living is based to a large extent on the exploitation of natural resources, it is essential that we learn to better manage these resources to make sure our exploitation is not detrimental. Of these natural resources, soil and water are the most critical: prudent soil and watershed management are essential for our own wellbeing, while research into desertification helps us to understand the processes by which soil and water resources are depleted. DEVELOPING RESEARCH, SUPPORTING POLICY EU-funded research in soil and watershed management and desertification issues has been going on for many years. An early example of research was based on concern with the state of Europe\u2019s waterways, and during FP4 a number of projects focused on new pollution prevention techniques, like the bioreactor developed to treat water polluted with hydrocarbons (called BIOTREAT). This effort was accelerated in FP5. One of the key actions of the \u201cEnergy, Environment and Sustainable Development\u201d programme focused on the sustainable management and quality of water. Research was also conducted into preventing land degradation and desertification, continuing a theme that environmental projects had focused on during the 1990s. One of the nine main research areas in FP6 was on the water cycle, including soil-related aspects, with over fifty projects supported. In line with research trends, the focus was on interdisciplinarity, with research themes like integrated management strategies and the link between hydrology and the climate process. Good examples of this were Euro-limpacs 26 , an integrated project that evaluated the impacts of global change on European freshwater ecosystems, or AQUASTRESS, another integrated project addressing the various problems of disparity between demand and availability of water in Europe. Desertification was also tackled in an integrated manner: for example, DeSurvey 27 was an FP6-funded project that sought to deliver a compact set of integrated procedures that aimed to complement desertification assessment tools with early warning and vulnerability forecast systems. ",
        "31 This area of research is directly linked and contributes to a broad number of EU Environmental policies under the EU\u2019s 6th Environmental Action Programme, like the Thematic Strategy on sustainable use of natural resources 28 , the Soil Thematic Strategy 29 , the Water Framework Directive 30 as well as the EU Water Initiative (EUWI) 31 that contributes to the water targets of the UN Millennium Development Goals. Finally desertification research is linked to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification 32 , to which the European Community and its member states are signatories. NATURAL RESOURCES IN FP7 Research funded in this area looks at natural resources, man-made resources (the urban context) and biodiversity. Research into integrated resource management, water resources and soil research and desertification continue to be supported. New research initiatives include river-basin twinning and helping international cooperation partners get involved in integrated resource management. Another research area, linked more to land management, will focus on integrated forest research, and is expected to build on previous efforts undertaken in sustainable forest resource management. FP7 research will improve the knowledge base and develop advanced models and tools necessary for sustainable management of resources, helping to mitigate resource degradation. Soil research will be influenced by the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection developed by DG Environment. SPOTLIGHT ON AQUATERRA AQUATERRA 33 is a \u20ac20 million project funded under FP6. The integrated project, bringing together 45 institutions from across Europe, started in mid-2004 with a timescale of 60 months. It aims to provide the scientific basis for improved river basin management by investigating the river-sediment-soil-groundwater system as a whole, and by integrating both its natural and its socio-economic aspects \u2013 looking at a variety of such systems both in time and in space, and from a micro to a regional scale. AQUATERRA aims at a better understanding of the system as a whole by identifying relevant processes, quantifying the associated parameters and developing numerical models of the groundwater-soil-sediment- river system to identify adverse trends in soil functioning, water quantity and quality. The project has a strong interdisciplinary focus, aiming to bring out new insights through combining different scientific fields. Given its large scope, the project has been divided into eleven sub-projects, ranging from investigations into the transport and turnover of inorganic and organic solids and solutes (called FLUX) to COMPUTE, which models the fate of pollutants at different scales. 26 http://www.eurolimpacs.ucl.ac.uk/ 27 http://www.desurvey.net/ 28 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/ 29 The following webpage provides a good overview: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/soil/index.htm 30 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/index_en.html 31 http://www.euwi.net/ 32 http://www.unccd.int/ 33 http://www.attempto-projects.de/aquaterra/ ",
        "32 Biodiversity Biodiversity is the rich array of life on Earth, with all its interactions and beauty. It includes both wild and cultivated species, and not only serves human needs but also underpins human wellbeing. Unfortunately human activities are causing a rapid loss of biological diversity \u2013 and the ecosystems it comprises \u2013 across the world. The UN\u2019s Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 34 found that most of the planet\u2019s ecosystems are degraded or managed unsustainably. Biodiversity loss is almost always irreversible \u2013 especially when it comes about through species extinction. The loss of biodiversity often has significant impact on human activity and wellbeing, especially when that loss makes it difficult for an ecosystem to provide a service on which humans depend. In Europe, decades of overuse of natural resources has led to significant species depletion and biodiversity loss. Some 600 species of European animal and plant species are threatened with extinction. Large mammals that once roamed Europe are now almost everywhere absent. Birds that were common in the recent past are gone; frogs, fish, flowering plants\u2026 the list goes on and on. The habitats of many migratory species are under threat, but so are certain breeds of domestic stock, while strains of fruit and crops that once characterised specific regions of Europe are now gone or endangered. Extinction need not be global to have an effect. Even local extinction of some key species, including for example top predators, or pollinators, can have significant environmental effects. PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY European research is focused on assessing and forecasting changes in biodiversity and understanding the dynamics of different habitats and ecosystems, both terrestrial and marine. The relationship with society and the economy are also investigated in order to comprehend what the harmful effects are, both on the environment and on human health and society, and how these can be mitigated. Through such research, biodiversity risk assessments can be formulated that will allow us to better manage, conserve and rehabilitate our ecosystems, enabling our society to switch towards a more sustainable development trajectory. Framework Programmes have been supporting biodiversity research for many years. During the 1990s, much of this research was concentrated on understanding marine biodiversity, like the FP4-funded MIDAS project that looked at biodiversity in microorganisms 35 . Ecosystem vulnerability was also a concern in FP5, with projects focused on assessing and conserving biodiversity. In FP6, \u201cBiodiversity and Ecosystems\u201d was one of the main areas of environmental research, with 38 different projects supported, looking at a range of themes from taxonomy to the impact of trees on biodiversity. ",
        "33 As biodiversity research has gathered pace, the need for better networking and integration has materialised. Since 1999, the main European organisation in this respect has been the European Platform for Biodiversity Research Strategy (EPBRS) 36 which has driven the EU biodiversity research agenda and worked to ensure that the research contributes to halting the loss of biodiversity. CONTINUED EFFORTS IN FP7 FP7 research on biodiversity builds on the efforts made from previous research. Biodiversity research can be found mainly in the sustainable management of resources and management of marine environments activities and will be focusing on the social, environmental and economic contributions of biodiversity. The work supports the EU\u2019s proposed Action Plan on halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 37 . Biodiversity is also being approached as a cross-thematic research theme, and research projects that address biodiversity concerns can be found in other FP7 Cooperation research themes like Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. In addition, under the FP7 Capacities programme, a major \u20ac370 million biodiversity research infrastructure called Life Watch34 is also to be set up. SPOTLIGHT ON ALARM The ALARM project (Assessing Large Scale Risks for Biodiversity with Tested Methods) 38 is a \u20ac16.7m biodiversity project funded under FP6 that brings together 54 institutions from Europe and beyond. Based on a better understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, it proposes to develop and test methods for assessing major environmental risks and human impacts especially on biodiversity and ecosystems. The project builds on previous biodiversity research, helping to integrate the results and proposals made. New methods being developed include one that focuses on socio-economic pressures using a step-by-step methodology, evidence that research on biodiversity loss necessarily requires an interdisciplinary and holistic approach. 34 http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.aspx 35 http://cordis.europa.eu/data/PROJ_MAST/ACTIONeqDndSESSIONeq13753200595ndDOCeq4ndTBLeqEN_PROJ.htm 36 More information can be found on their website: http://www.epbrs.org/ 37 http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/667&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en 38 http://www.alarmproject.net/alarm/ ",

Oceans are home to an enormous range of species, many still undiscovered, from the largest known animal, the blue whale, to centuries-old coral and the microscopic phytoplankton that play a vital role in determining Earth\u2019s climate. The oceans are also an integral part of our climate system, important vectors for transporting weather across the world and climate regulators in their own right. Humanity\u2019s relation with the marine environment has for centuries been one of exploitation, yet it is only as the environmental threats emerge that we are beginning to learn about the complexity and richness that they contain. And environmental degradation in the marine environment is likely to have a major impact on the planet as a whole and humanity in particular, especially as around 40 per cent of the world\u2019s population live within 100km of the coastline and hundreds of millions are dependent on the oceans for their livelihood. MARINE RESEARCH Despite its small relative size, Europe has a very large coastline (of around 200 000 km), around double the size of Africa\u2019s 39 . With a long and rich maritime history, it is only natural that Europe also has a rich marine research heritage. Early examples of EU-funded marine research include EROS (European River Ocean System) 40 , an interdisciplinary project started in 1988 that set out to gather information about Europe\u2019s coastal environment, and the Marine Science and Technology (MAST) programme 41 that ran throughout the 1990s. Marine research is increasingly set within the context of EU policies. Following extensive consultations, the European Commission launched in October 2007 an integrated maritime policy for the European Union through the \u201cBlue Book\u201d. The new policy seeks to integrate different maritime activities, building on strengths in European marine research, technology and innovation. It is anchored in the Lisbon Agenda\u2019s focus on jobs and growth while respecting the overarching commitment to environmental sustainability. 39 See http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/coastal-marine/variable-61.html for figures 40 http://cordis.europa.eu/eesd/src/mtr_putting.htm 41 http://cordis.europa.eu/mast/home.html ",
        "35 MARINE RESEARCH IN FP7 Specific research will focus on improving our understanding of the impacts of human activities on the ocean and seas and on marine resources. The seas that surround Europe, from the Black Sea to the Baltic, are facing serious environmental threats, and much of the research will be investigating processes such as pollution and eutrophication. Deep sea ecosystems, one of the least known of the marine environments will be a particular focus of research interest. With the first FP7 calls launched in 2007, several projects due to be supported have a wide thematic scope: from an investigation of habitat-species relationships to life forms in extreme environments. By increasing our knowledge about the complex marine world, we can mitigate the damage we are doing to it. In later calls, research into environmental technologies geared for the marine environment will help to lessen the negative impact of human activity. SPOTLIGHT ON MARBEF As human threats to the coasts and seas around Europe are increasing, it is necessary to tackle the problem using a more holistic approach and at a global level. The project called Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning (MarBEF) 42 is one of eight networks of excellence (NoE) funded during FP6. The EU is contributing \u20ac8.7 million to this project which started in February 2004 with a timeframe of 60 months. It aims to integrate research by bringing together more than 700 marine scientists from 92 institutes (56 as project partners with a further 36 associated). The project has the challenging goal of creating a virtual European Institute on Marine Biodiversity with a long-term research programme and dedicated links to industry and the public at large. At the same time, the research interests are highly diverse including, but not limited to, marine ecology, taxonomy, and socioeconomic sciences. The aim is therefore not just research integration within the same scientific fields but across disciplines as well. 42 http://marbef.org/ ",

These are all interrelated under the umbrella of \u201csustainable multifunctional land management\u201d. Land is subject to intense pressure, as in the case of intensive agriculture. These stresses may affect biodiversity as well as impact on rural society. The challenges that we face in creating a model of sustainable agriculture are obvious. The shift to a production pattern that is less intensive and puts less pressure on natural resources still needs to be implemented, and will also involve changes in the food production, distribution, and consumption systems. Around 75-80 per cent of Europeans live in towns and cities 43 , and with urbanisation gaining pace across the world, the quality of city life is under the spotlight, with dangers like pollution, traffic congestion, and disease contagion all risks. The need to create sustainable cities and towns is therefore very urgent if the goal of sustainable development is to be reached. Europe\u2019s coastal regions are also under increasing pressure, with around two-fifths of the total European population living on or near the coast, alongside increasing migration and construction development, especially in the Mediterranean region 44 . Competing interests like tourism, industry and environmental conservation add to the threats that vulnerable coastal ecosystems face. RESEARCH ROOTS , POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS EU research into urban, rural and coastal management has strong antecedents. New urban planning and transportation methods were the focus of concentrated research during the 1990s 45 . FP5 had a strong urban management component with its key action \u201cThe city of tomorrow and cultural heritage\u201d, introducing the relevance of cultural heritage to the concept of sustainable development for the first time. 43 http://grida.no/geo/geo3/english/420.htm 44 See http://epaedia.eea.europa.eu/page.php?pid=504 for a discussion of the environmental threats facing Europe\u2019s coasts 45 http://www.lutr.net/ ",
        "37 Research on land management focused on multifunctional land uses, looking at land from a holistic perspective to understand how different patterns of use cause different stresses, what the consequences of these stresses are, and how they can be managed or corrected. Research looked at land use in terms of soil, agriculture, forestry resources and coastal zones, investigating the supply chains that link them to the wider economy / society to ensure they were being used sustainably. All this research has fed into the policy pipeline. In 2006 the European Commission launched the Thematic Strategy on the Urban Environment 46 , one of seven foreseen in the 6th Environmental Action Programme. Informed by extensive research, the strategy proposes a variety of actions in environmental management, sustainable urban transport, training, and exchanges of best practice and dialogue between local authorities. Similar strategies are being developed for soil protection 47 . In 2007, the Commission also released new guidelines for Integrated Coastal Zone Management 48 . The European Union also leads the way as concerns its international commitments in urban, rural and coastal management. These include the UN Human Settlements Programme, UN HABITAT 49 and participation in the Aalborg Commitments initiative 50 for sustainable cities. Examples of supporting research include the FP6-supported SUSTAINFO project 51 , that set up a research database and publications that support local authorities and experts in developing local sustainable development initiatives, as well as PLUREL, the Peri- urban Land Use Relationships project that researches strategies / sustainability assessment tools for urban- rural linkages. THE FP7 CONTRIBUTION In FP7, one of the research areas focuses on urban development. The initial calls concern urban metabolism and methods of optimising resource use. Research dedicated to integrated water resource management is also expected to look at coastal management. SPOTLIGHT ON SPICOSA SPICOSA 52 is an acronym for the \u20ac14.6 million project Science and Policy Integration for Coastal System Assessment. The project forms part of efforts to improve Integrated Coastal Zone Management and improve the sustainability of coastal systems. A multidisciplinary assessment framework is being developed that balances ecological, social and economic aspects \u2013 using a holistic approach that can help to reconcile often conflicting interests. Bringing together 54 institutions, the project was launched in 2007, at the end of the FP6 cycle. The main goal will be the creation of an operation Systems Approach Framework (SAF) that can effectively assess different policy alternatives. Strategically the project will also confront the important challenge of multidisciplinary science in creating a working science-policy interface that can accurately describe complex systems like Europe\u2019s coastlines. 46 See http://ec.europa.eu/environment/urban/home_en.htm 47 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/soil/index.htm 48 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/iczm/home.htm 49 http://www.unhabitat.org/ 50 http://www.aalborgplus10.dk/ 51 http://www.susta-info.net/ 52 http://www.spicosa.eu/index.htm ",

In general they are lean and resource-efficient technologies that can help to reduce the impact on the environment. Environmental technologies are about greening the economy and as such are the missing link between raising competitiveness in the European economy and making sure that our development is sustainable. POLICY CONTEXT The strategic importance of environmental technologies has been highlighted by the EU\u2019s Environmental Technology Action Plan (ETAP) 53 launched in 2004 by both DG Environment and DG Research. The main axes of the Action Plan are getting the technologies from research to markets, improving market conditions and acting globally. Improving the take up of environmental technologies means reinforcing the links between research institutions and industry. The creation of the European technology platforms, that create public- private partnerships on a specific research topic, for example in water research or in photovoltaics, are helping this process. Market conditions need to be stimulated, and there are many tools that can be used for this. Policymakers can set performance targets that encourage environmental technologies. Another popular tool is environmental financing arrangements or tax concessions. Finally governments can act as end-users, stimulating demand by opening up public procurement to green products. Environmental technologies are not just meant to help Europe, but can be used throughout the world. Environmental technologies need to be developed and promoted in the developing world, in particular, hardest hit by environmental threats but often without the means to develop such technologies on their own. The EU is therefore committed to supporting eco-technologies in the developing countries and promoting foreign (green) investment. 53 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/etap/index_en.htm ",
        "39 CUTTING EDGE IN FP7 Environmental technologies research in FP7 will use a systems approach, aiming to integrate all components of the process while taking into account external factors, thus helping to decouple growth from resource depletion. The environment of technological creation will also be considered, from eco-efficiency assessments to considerations about life cycle management and market barriers. Environmental technologies research will look at technologies for water, soil, waste, clean , built and marine environments and more in general to technologies for adapting and mitigating the impact of climate and environmental change (not in the energy and transport sectors). Another relevant area of research looks at the technologies for the protection of cultural heritage and human habitats. Environmental change is one significant threat to the sustainability of the European cultural heritage. To tackle this challenge stronger research efforts will be devoted, all over FP7, to better assess and further understand the damage mechanisms, and find the best possible measures and means to ensure the preventive conservation of cultural heritage especially through advanced technologies and tools. A high transferability of results especially to sensitive cultural heritage sites, in Europe and beyond, is expected. SPOTLIGHT ON MEMBRANE BIO-REACTORS The increasing use and sustainability of membrane related technologies open recently new opportunities to membranes bioreactors (MBR) for municipal waste water treatment and water reuse schemes. These reactors make use of membrane technologies for keeping high concentrations of active biomass inside the reactor, allowing better treatment and biomass-free effluents. The estimated market growth rate for this technology is above 10 % within a sector still dominated by conventional technologies. The potential of the promising MBR technology was fully recognised by the EC that decided to launch in 2005 an initiative going from basic to applied research and aiming to identify and solve major current drawbacks. The MBR-Network initiative comprises a set of 4 FP EC funded projects, namely AMEDEUS, EUROMBRA, MBR- TRAIN and PURATREAT, which all together represent a budget totalling about \u20ac 16 million of which around \u20ac 9 million are provided by the Community. About 50 institutions, research centres or companies are involved in this initiative that is the worldwide largest in this specific area. Significant breakthroughs are being achieved by the MBR-Network not only in terms of improved design parameters, operating conditions and life costing but also in fundamentals addressing issues like water pre- treatment, flow patterns, hydraulic and biological modelling or advanced control systems. Aspects of plant upgrading, technology transfer, training and MBR technology standardisation are well integrated forming a coherent picture within a powerful knowledge and experiences dissemination tool embedded in the MBR- Network website 54 . 54 http://www.mbr-network.eu ",

Scientific research over the ages has enhanced these skills so that the scale and the precision of our observations have increased markedly. Now research efforts in the field of earth observation are seeking further integration of land and sea-based sensor networks with space-based platforms that can allow us to observe and compare on a global scale. Better coordination and integration means better results, giving policymakers more accurate information as they draw up environmental legislation to protect society and nature. INCREASING SCRUTINY Europe is one of the world\u2019s leading players in the advancement of EO technologies and related environmental applications. European remote-sensing satellites cover all of the Earth\u2019s climatic zones, while European ground-based, air-based and ocean-based monitoring devices serve users by providing high quality observation data for subjects as diverse as urban planning, adaptation to climate change, disaster reduction, disease control and humanitarian relief. Examples of earlier Framework Programme-funded research include: \u25cf ESONET 55 , an FP6 network of excellence that aims to promote the implementation and the management at the European-scale of a network of long-term multidisciplinary observatories in European seas; and \u25cf AMMA 56 , an FP6-funded integrated project that aims to improve our ability to predict the West African Monsoon, a natural phenomenon of crucial importance to the Sahel region; Earth observation projects are increasingly being integrated into the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, or GEOSS, which brings together 71 partner countries from around the world as well as the European Commission (see Spotlight). 55 http://www.oceanlab.abdn.ac.uk/research/esonet.php 56 http://amma.mediasfrance.org/ ",
        "41 FP7 EFFORTS In FP7, Earth Observation research will essentially contribute to the implementation of GEOSS. Four building blocks toward the establishment of GEOSS are emphasised: 1) Integration of European activities within GEO, with a project on the monitoring of the carbon cycle at the global level and a contribution to a global biodiversity observation system; 2) Cross-cutting research activities relevant to GEO with a research topic on environment and health foreseen in 2009-2010; 3) Emerging earth observation activities, with projects monitoring the ocean interior, seafloor, and subseafloor, and participating in the development of a Global Soil Observing System; 4) Developing capacity building activities in the domain of earth observation in the EU and in developing countries, with several projects working on a georesource information system for Africa, improving observing systems for water resource management, and GEONETCast applications for developing countries. Research activities funded in the first round of FP7 calls both contribute to GEOSS and benefit from the knowhow and collaborations with international partners. Future calls are foreseen on topics that address the social priorities of GEOSS. Examples include projects to develop meteorological hazard observation systems or earth observation in support of the EU Technology Platform on Sustainable Mineral Resources. Moreover, technological research on environmental measuring and monitoring systems and devices is also carried out. SPOTLIGHT ON GEOSS The Global Earth Observation (GEO) is an intergovernmental body of 71 member states, the European Commission and 46 organisations. The mandate of GEO, outlined in 2005 in a ten-year implementation plan, is to strengthen cooperation and integrate earth observing systems to create GEOSS, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems. GEOSS will address a number of social concerns: \u25cf reducing loss of life and property from natural and human-induced disasters; \u25cf understanding environmental factors affecting human health and wellbeing; \u25cf improving the management of energy resources; \u25cf understanding, assessing, predicting, mitigating, and adapting to climate variability and change; \u25cf improving water resource management through a better understanding of the water cycle; \u25cf improving weather information, forecasting, and warning; \u25cf improving the management and protection of terrestrial, coastal, and marine ecosystems; \u25cf supporting sustainable agriculture and combating desertification; \u25cf understanding, monitoring, and conserving biodiversity. GEOSS is a step towards achieving the UN Millennium Goals 57 and the EU\u2019s Sustainable Development Strategy 58 . It will also help the further implementation of environmental treaty obligations. Improved observation will allow for more accurate predictions about the future state of our world. 57 http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ 58 See http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/ for more information about this ",

As the concept is translated into practice and policy, it is increasingly urgent to create assessment tools that can effectively monitor its successful implementation \u2013 tools that can for example assess the sustainability of public work projects. In order to avoid potential shift of burdens (among different regions, different timeframe, different impact categories, etc), Life Cycle Thinking has been recognised by the European Commission as the most suitable methodological framework for most product-related Sustainability discussions. Sustainable development was defined by the UN Brundtland Commission 59 in 1987 as development that \u201cmeets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d. Sustainable development is now also accepted as one of the core objectives of the European Union. At its 2001 meeting in Gothenburg, the European Council adopted the Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) 60 . After a five-year period the Strategy was renewed in June 2006 61 , making explicit the key challenges and the actions required to address them. These are: \u25cf Climate change and clean energy; \u25cf Sustainable transport; \u25cf Sustainable consumption and production; \u25cf Conservation and management of natural resources; \u25cf Public health; \u25cf Social inclusion, demography and migration; and \u25cf Global poverty and sustainable development challenges. The renewed SDS was elaborated at the same time as FP7, and it is safe to say that they reflect each other. In particular, the need for sustainable development research expressed by the SDS is taken into account throughout the entire seven-year Framework Programme. 59 The Commission was named after its chair, the Norwegian politician, Gro Harlem Brundtland.

        "43 SUSTAINABLE PRECEDENTS Sustainable development research has only become explicit since the late 1990s, as the concept of sustainable development gained ground. One of the four thematic programmes of FP5, which ran from 1998 to 2002, was called \u201cEnergy, Environment and Sustainable Development\u201d. Bringing together both environmental and energy research, the stated aim of this programme was to contribute to sustainable development by focusing on key activities crucial for social wellbeing and economic competitiveness in Europe. It was the first time that sustainable development was seen as a cross-thematic research issue. FP6 continued the trend. In the \u201cSustainable Development, Global Change and Ecosystems\u201d programme, sustainable development was still primarily an energy concern (focused on sustainable energy and transport systems), but it was also present in the \u201cGlobal Change and Ecosystems\u201d priority. This was devoted to environmental research and the last research area was devoted to Sustainable Development concepts and tools as a crosscutting issue horizontal to other research areas. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN FP7 As the decision that paved the way for FP7\u2019s launch in December 2006 states, the \u201coverarching aim\u201d of the \u20ac32.4 billion \u201cCooperation\u201d programme is for \u201csustainable development\u201d. Sustainable development has therefore been mainstreamed: projects touching or focusing on sustainable development can be found throughout the research programme, not just in environmental research. The first calls have a multiple focus: (cid:495)(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:39)(cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:83)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:73)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3) study the implications of EU budget scenarios, as well as trade and cooperation policies, on sustainable development.

SPOTLIGHT ON NATURNET-REDIME The NATURNET-REDIME project developed educational tools that help us to understand sustainable development. NATURNET is creating a web portal that brings together scattered sustainable development data from around the world in one interoperable internet architecture. REDIME concentrates on \u201clearning through modelling\u201d, by integrating qualitative reasoning (QR) tools that are being developed in artificial intelligence research. The idea is to translate the knowledge generated by sustainable development specialists into tools that can be exploited on the Internet. NATURNET-REDIME brings together 19 partners from across Europe and Brazil, including ICT and environmental researchers, as well as end-users such as schools and municipalities. The tool should become very useful for raising awareness (especially in schools) and for helping to simplify impact assessments (especially for local authorities). ",
