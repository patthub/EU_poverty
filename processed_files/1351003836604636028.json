        "(4) Pursuant to Article 32(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, 50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities shall be borne by the Member State concerned and 50 % by the Community budget if the recovery of those irregularities has not taken place within four years of the primary administra- tive or judicial finding, or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts. Article 32(3) of the said Regulation obliges Member States to submit to the Commission, together with the annual accounts, a summary report on the recovery procedures undertaken in response to irregularities. Detailed rules on the appli- cation of the Member States \u2019 reporting obligation of the amounts to be recovered are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD ( 1 ).

(5) Pursuant to Article 32(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. Such a decision may only be taken if the costs already and likely to be incurred total more than the amount to be recovered or if the recovery proves impossible owing to the insolvency, recorded and recognised under national law, of the debtor or the persons legally responsible for the irregularity. If that decision has been taken within four years of the primary administrative or judicial finding, or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts, 100 % of the financial consequences of the non-recovery should be borne by the Community budget. In the summary report referred to in Article 32(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 the amounts for which the Member State decided not to pursue recovery and the grounds for the decision are shown. These amounts are not charged to the Member States concerned and are consequently to be borne by the Community budget. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of the said Regulation. (6) In clearing the accounts of the paying agencies concerned, the Commission must take account of the amounts already withheld from the Member States concerned on the basis of Decision 2007/327/EC. (7) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 and Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95, this Decision does not prejudice decisions taken subsequently by the Commission excluding from Community financing expenditure not effected in accordance with Community rules, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 The accounts of the German paying agency \u2018 Baden-W\u00fcrt- temberg \u2019 , the Italian paying agency \u2018 AGEA \u2019 and the Slovak paying agency \u2018 APA \u2019 concerning expenditure financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee Section, in respect of the 2006 financial year, are hereby cleared.

The clearance covers the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts transmitted in the light of the reports established by the certification bodies. (2) The time limits granted to the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia referred to in Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 ( 2 ) laying down detailed rules for the application of the procedure for the clearance of accounts of the EAGF for the submission to the Commission of the documents referred to in Article 8(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006, have expired.

The clearance covers the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts transmitted in the light of the reports established by the certification bodies. (2) Pursuant to Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 ( 2 ) on data to be transmitted by the Member States and the monthly booking of expenditure financed under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), account is taken of the 2007 financial year of expenditure incurred by the Member States between 16 October 2006 and 15 October 2007. (3) The time limits granted to the Member States referred to in Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 ( 3 ) laying down detailed rules for the appli- cation of the procedure for the clearance of accounts of the EAGF for the submission to the Commission of the documents referred to in Article 8(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006, have expired. (4) The Commission has checked the information submitted and communicated to the Member States before 31 March 2008 the results of its verifications, along with the necessary amendments. (5) In accordance with the first and second subparagraphs of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006, the accounts clearance decision referred to in Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 determines, without prejudice to decisions taken subsequently in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Regulation, the amount of expenditure effected in each Member State during the financial year in question recognised as being chargeable to the EAGF, on the basis of the accounts referred to in Article 8(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and the reductions and suspensions of monthly payments for the financial year concerned, including the reductions referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 9(4) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006. Pursuant to Article 154 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities ( 4 ), the outcome of the clearance decision, that is to say any discrepancy which may occur between the total expenditure booked to the accounts for a financial year pursuant to Article 151(1) and Article 152 of that Regulation and the total expenditure taken into consideration by the Commission in the clearance decision, is to be booked, under a single article, as additional expenditure or a reduction in expen- diture. (6) In the light of the verifications made, the annual accounts and the accompanying documents permit the Commission to take, for certain paying agencies, a decision on the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the annual accounts submitted. The details of these amounts were described in the Summary Report that was presented to the Fund Committee at the same time as this Decision. (7) In the light of the verifications made, the information submitted by certain paying agencies requires additional inquiries and their accounts cannot be therefore cleared in this Decision.

        "(8) Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 lays down that monthly payments are to be reduced for expenditure effected by the Member States after the deadlines laid down therein, in accordance with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2040/2000 of 26 September 2000 on budgetary discipline ( 1 ) and Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. However, under Article 9(4) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006, any overrun of deadlines during August, September and October is to be taken into account in the accounts clearance decision except where noted before the last decision of the financial year relating to monthly payments. Some of the expenditure declared by certain Member States during the abovementioned period was effected after the deadlines and for some measures the Commission did not accept any extenuating circumstances. This Decision should therefore fix the relevant reductions. In accordance with Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, a decision will be taken at a later date, fixing definitively the expenditure for which Community financing will not be granted regarding those reductions and any other expenditure which may be found to have been effected after the fixed deadlines. (9) The Commission, in accordance with Article 14 of Regu- lation (EC) No 2040/2000, Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006, has already reduced or suspended a number of monthly payments on entry into the accounts of expenditure for the 2007 financial year. In the light of the above, to avoid any premature or temporary reim- bursement of the amounts in question, they should not be recognised in this Decision, without prejudice to further examination under Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. (10) The first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 lays down that the amounts that are reco- verable from, or payable to, each Member State, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(1) of the said Regulation, shall be determined by deducting monthly payments paid during the financial year in question, i.e. 2007, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with paragraph 1. Such amounts are to be deducted from, or added to, the monthly payment relating to the expenditure effected in the second month following the clearance of accounts decision. (11) Pursuant to Article 32(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, 50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities shall be borne by the Member State concerned and 50 % by the Community budget if the recovery of those irregularities has not taken place within four years of the primary administra- tive or judicial finding, or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts. Article 32(3) of the said Regulation obliges Member States to submit to the Commission, together with the annual accounts, a summary report on the recovery procedures undertaken in response to irregularities. Detailed rules on the appli- cation of the Member States' reporting obligation of the amounts to be recovered are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 885/2006. Annex III to the said Regulation provides the model tables 1 and 2 that have to be provided in 2008 by the Member States. On the basis of the tables completed by the Member States, the Commission should decide on the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities older than four or eight years respectively. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. (12) Pursuant to Article 32(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. Such a decision may only be taken if the costs already and likely to be incurred total more than the amount to be recovered or if the recovery proves impossible owing to the insolvency, recorded and recognised under national law, of the debtor or the persons legally responsible for the irregularity. If that decision has been taken within four years of the primary administrative or judicial finding or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts, 100 % of the financial consequences of the non-recovery should be borne by the Community budget. In the summary report referred to in Article 32(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 the amounts for which the Member State decided not to pursue recovery and the grounds for the decision are shown. These amounts are not charged to the Member States concerned and are consequently to be borne by the Community budget. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of the said Regulation. (13) In accordance with Article 30(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, this Decision does not prejudice decisions taken subsequently by the Commission excluding from Community financing expenditure not effected in accordance with Community rules, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Without prejudice to Article 2, the accounts of the paying agencies of the Member States concerning expenditure financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) in respect of the 2007 financial year are hereby cleared.

        "The amounts which are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State pursuant to this Decision, including those resulting from the application of Article 32(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, are set out in Annex I. Article 2 For the 2007 financial year, the accounts of the Member States' paying agencies in respect of expenditure financed by the EAGF, set out in Annex II, are disjoined from this Decision and shall be the subject of a future clearance Decision.

        "COMMISSION DECISION of 30 April 2008 on the clearance of the accounts of the paying agencies of Member States concerning expenditure financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) for the 2007 financial year (notified under document number C(2008) 1712) (2008/397/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy ( 1 ), and in particular Articles 30 and 33 thereof, After consulting the Fund Committee, Whereas: (1) On the basis of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States, accompanied by the information required, the accounts of the paying agencies referred to in Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 are to be cleared. The clearance covers the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts transmitted in the light of the reports established by the certification bodies. (2) Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 ( 2 ) on data to be transmitted by the Member States and intermediate payments of expenditure financed under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), account is taken of the 2007 financial year of expenditure incurred by the Member States between 16 October 2006 and 15 October 2007. (3) The time limits granted to the Member States referred to in Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 ( 3 ) laying down detailed rules for the appli- cation of the procedure for the clearance of accounts of the EAFRD for the submission to the Commission of the documents referred to in Article 8(1)(c) of Regu- lation (EC) No 1290/2005 and in Article 7(1) of Regu- lation (EC) No 885/2006, have expired. (4) The Commission has checked the information submitted and communicated to the Member States before 31 March 2008 the results of its verifications, along with the necessary amendments. (5) In accordance with the first and third subparagraphs of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006, the accounts clearance decision referred to in Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 determines, without prejudice to decisions taken subsequently in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Regulation, the amount of expenditure effected in each Member State during the financial year in question recognised as being chargeable to the EAFRD, on the basis of the accounts referred to in Article 8(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and the reductions and suspensions of intermediate payments for the financial year concerned, including the reductions referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 16(4) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006. (6) In the light of the verifications made, the annual accounts and the accompanying documents permit the Commission to take, for certain paying agencies, a decision on the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the annual accounts submitted. The details of these amounts were described in the Summary Report that was presented to the Fund Committee at the same time as this Decision. (7) In the light of the verifications made, the information submitted by certain paying agencies requires additional inquiries and their accounts cannot be therefore cleared in this Decision. (8) The second subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 lays down that the amounts that are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(1) of the said Regulation, shall be determined by deducting the inter- mediate payments paid during the financial year in question, i.e. 2007, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with paragraph 1. Such amounts are to be deducted from, or added to, the following intermediate payment or the final payment.

        "(9) Pursuant to Article 33(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, 50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities shall be borne by the Member State concerned and 50 % by the Community budget if the recovery of those irregularities has not taken place prior to the closure of a rural development programme within four years of the primary administra- tive or judicial finding, or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts, or on the closure of the programme if those deadlines expire prior to such closure. Article 33(4) of the said Regulation obliges Member States to submit to the Commission, together with the annual accounts, a summary report on the recovery procedures undertaken in response to irregularities. Detailed rules on the application of the Member States' reporting obligation of the amounts to be recovered are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 885/2006. Annex III to the said Regulation provides the model tables 3 and 4 that have to be provided in 2008 by the Member States. On the basis of the tables completed by the Member States, the Commission should decide on the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities older than four or eight years respectively. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 33(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. (10) Pursuant to Article 33(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, after closure of a rural development programme Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. Such a decision may only be taken if the costs already and likely to be incurred total more than the amount to be recovered or if the recovery proves impossible owing to the insolvency, recorded and recognised under national law, of the debtor or the persons legally responsible for the irregularity. If that decision has been taken within four years of the primary administrative or judicial finding, or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts, 100 % of the financial consequences of the non-recovery should be borne by the Community budget. In the summary report referred to in Article 33(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 the amounts for which the Member State decided not to pursue recovery and the grounds for the decision are shown.

Member States were invited to take the Integrated guidelines for growth and jobs into account in their national reform programmes (hereinafter \u2018 NRPs \u2019 ). (2) Member States submitted their NRPs by October 2005, which the Commission assessed and reported on in its contribution to the 2006 Spring European Council. (3) The 2006 Spring European Council took note of these documents and identified four priority areas (R & D and innovation, business environment, employment opportu- nities and an integrated energy policy) within which it agreed a limited number of specific actions which it urged Member States to complete before the end of 2007. (4) In accordance with the conclusions of the 2006 Spring European Council, the Member States presented annual reports on the implementation of the national reform programmes (implementation reports). These implemen- tation reports were analysed by the Commission, which presented its findings in the 2007 Annual Progress Report. (5) On the basis of this analysis, a number of country- specific recommendations were issued to the Member States in 2007. In order to pursue the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs in a coherent, integrated manner, these recommendations were adopted in a single instrument, in the Council Recommendation 2007/209/EC of 27 March 2007 on the 2007 update of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and the Community and on the imple- mentation of Member States \u2019 employment policies ( 3 ). This approach reflected the integrated structure of the NRPs and implementation reports, as well as the necessary consistency between the employment guidelines and the Article 99(2) broad economic policy guidelines, as underlined in Article 128(2) of the Treaty.

        "(6) The Commission analysed the response to the recom- mendations as presented in the 2007 Implementation Reports of the Member States, and has presented its analysis of this response in the Strategic Report. On the basis of this analysis, and recognising that it takes some time to implement structural reforms, this document provides a proposal to largely maintain these recommendations, fine-tuning them in light of progress made since their adoption in spring 2007. (7) To implement fully the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, this Recommendation should also contain specific recommendations to the Member States belonging to the euro area. (8) In order to reinforce coordination of reforms and enhance the multilateral surveillance process in Council, Member States should set out detailed and concrete actions addressing their specific policy responses to the country-specific recommendations and \u2018 points to watch \u2019 in their national reform programmes and the subsequent annual implementation reports, and furthermore the Commission should provide more analytical under- pinning to the proposed recommendations, HEREBY RECOMMENDS that Member States should take action along the lines set out in the Annex and report on their follow- up in their next programmes in the framework of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.

        "ANNEX BELGIUM 1. In the light of Belgium \u2019 s 2007 Implementation Report and the Commission \u2019 s assessment of progress made to implement key structural reforms and based on the Integrated guidelines for growth and jobs, the following conclusions are appropriate: 2. Belgium has made good progress in implementing its National Reform Programme (NRP) over the 2005-2007 period. Belgium has shown some progress in fulfilling the commitments agreed by the 2006 Spring European Council in the four priority action areas. 3. The Implementation Report shows some policy response to the Council recommendations, but further reform is still necessary. There has been some response on the additional areas identified in the Council conclusions as requiring attention. The Implementation Report also specifically addresses the recommendations issued to the euro area countries. 4. Among the strengths shown by Belgium \u2019 s 2007 Implementation Report are the emission reduction policies and the promising results of the guidance and monitoring system of unemployed people. 5. The policy areas in the Belgian NRP where challenges need to be tackled with the highest priority are reducing the tax burden on labour whilst strengthening fiscal consolidation and improving labour market performance. Against this background it is recommended that Belgium: \u2014 continue its efforts to further reduce the tax burden on labour towards the average of its neighbouring countries, especially by reducing the tax wedge on low-skilled workers, while strengthening fiscal consolidation, \u2014 reinforce the policy measures to improve the performance of its labour market through a comprehensive strategy, in accordance with an integrated flexicurity approach, to enhance labour market participation, lower regional disparities, and increase participation in lifelong learning. 6. In addition, it will be important for Belgium to focus on the following challenges: to fully implement the strategy aiming to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances, including expenditure restraints, fiscal surpluses, and a persistent reduction of government debt; urgently take further measures to improve competition in gas and electricity markets, including through independent and effective regulators and additional measures concerning transmission and distribution operators; to increase substantially its commitment to stimulating R & D and innovation notably by increasing both the level and impact of public funding and developing a coordinated policy mix at all levels; continuing the implementation of the measures to increase the employment rate for older workers and vulnerable groups, monitor their impact and, if need be, take further activation measures. BULGARIA 1. In the light of Bulgaria \u2019 s 2007 Implementation Report and the Commission \u2019 s assessment of its National Reform Programme (NRP) and based on the Integrated guidelines for growth and jobs, the following conclusions are appro- priate: 2. Overall, the NRP focuses on the right challenges, but in some areas more concrete measures need to be developed, in particular as regards further strengthening administrative capacity as well as urgently and significantly reducing red tape to make the business environment more dynamic and competitive. Given the growing economic imbalances it is particularly important for Bulgaria to accelerate the implementation of its NRP in order to create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and jobs in the medium to longer term. 3. The NRP \u2019 s strengths include a clear problem analysis and right prioritisation and sequencing of reforms as well as strong political ownership. Important provisions for a tight monitoring of progress at the highest political level have been put in place, which should prove an effective tool for ensuring a rapid and effective implementation of the NRP. The NRP is furthermore underpinned by a tight fiscal policy which offers a solid basis for accelerating the needed structural reforms to ensure long-term growth.

        "4. The policy areas in the Bulgarian NRP where challenges need to be tackled with the highest priority and budgetary impacts of measures and details on the monitoring and evaluation procedures should be clearly spelled out are: administrative capacity; macroeconomic imbalances; red tape; and the functioning of the labour market. Against this background, Bulgaria is recommended to: \u2014 urgently further strengthen administrative capacity in particular focusing on key government functions, including regulatory authorities, and the judiciary, \u2014 contain the growing current account deficit and inflationary pressures, in particular by a tight fiscal policy, improving the quality of public expenditure and promoting wage moderation and flexible wage-setting that keeps wage developments in line with productivity gains, \u2014 adopt new measures and rapidly implement adopted measures to substantially cut red tape and shorten procedural delays in order to improve the business environment (in particular for SMEs and facilitating start-ups), which will also help in the fight against corruption, \u2014 increase the quality of labour supply and the employment rate by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of active labour market policies and further reform the education system to raise skills to levels that better match labour market needs and reduce early school leaving. 5. In addition, it will be important for Bulgaria over the period of the NRP to focus on: taking further measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances, in particular with regard to potential risks in terms of adequacy and sustainability of pensions; ensuring all necessary pre-conditions for strong competition in network industries; elaborating an integrated policy for R & D and innovation notably aimed at reforming the public R & D system, shifting public support to R & D \u2014 based on an overall R & D intensity target for 2010 \u2014 towards more competitive funding focused on key priorities; tackling undeclared work by strengthening institutional capacity to perform inspections and ensure legal enforcement; completing the lifelong learning strategy and increasing participation.

Among the strengths shown by French 2007 Implementation Report are: R & D and innovation reforms; the concrete results of measures in the area of ICT; the priority given to industrial policy ( p\u00f4le de comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 ); the reform aimed at giving more autonomy to universities and the comprehensive set of measures announced to improve the functioning of the labour market, including through changes in legislation. 5. The Implementation Report presents a noticeably modified strategy in which employment is to become a factor of economic policy aiming at enhanced growth. Whilst the second stage of the reform of the Galland Act has been adopted, full implementation and introduction of new measures remain necessary to ensure effective competition in services markets. It is important that France further strengthens its budgetary efforts in order to simultaneously implement a concerted reform strategy and further consolidates public finances. Significant or sustained further measures are needed to achieve budgetary consolidation, to increase competition in network industries and to improve labour market performance. Against this background, it is recommended that France: \u2014 ensure the sustainability of public finances, taking into account the ageing of the population, by strengthening the pace of budgetary consolidation and debt reduction, and \u2014 cyclical conditions permitting \u2014 aim to reach the medium-term objective (MTO) by 2010.

In the light of the 2007 Hungarian Implementation Report and the Commission \u2019 s assessment of progress made in implementing key structural reforms and based on the Integrated guidelines for growth and jobs, the following conclusions are appropriate: 2. Hungary has made limited progress in implementing its National Reform Programme (NRP) over the 2005-2007 period. Hungary has shown some progress in fulfilling the commitments agreed by the 2006 Spring European Council in the four priority action areas. 3. The Implementation Report shows a mixed policy response to the recommendations adopted at the Council. There has been some policy response on the additional areas identified in the Council conclusions as requiring more attention. 4. Among the strengths shown by the 2007 Implementation Report are: strong improvements on fiscal consolidation, the adoption and implementation of various structural reform steps, the shortening of the setting-up time for businesses and the efforts to reduce administrative costs, the introduction of further incentives to work and to remain on the labour market and the transformation of undeclared work into formal employment. 5. The policy areas in the Hungarian NRP where challenges need to be tackled with the highest priority are: continuing with the fiscal consolidation and correcting the excessive deficit as planned, further improving the sustainability of public finances, improving the labour market situation of disadvantaged groups, reducing persistent regional disparities in employment and reforming the education and training systems. Against this background, it is recommended that Hungary: \u2014 continue to implement the necessary measures to ensure a durable reduction of the government deficit and of the public debt ratio, with increased reliance on the expenditure side, including through the establishment of more thorough and comprehensive fiscal rules, \u2014 continue to reform the public administration, healthcare, pension and education systems with a view to ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability and improving economic efficiency. This should include steps to further limit early retirement, reduce the number of new recipients of disability pensions and further restructure healthcare, \u2014 reinforce active labour market policies to improve the labour market situation of disadvantaged groups; and reduces persistent regional disparities in employment, \u2014 ensure access to high quality education and training for all, upgrade skill levels, and increase responsiveness of education and training systems to labour market needs. 6. In addition, it will be important for Hungary over the period of the NRP to focus on the following challenges for the future: further reforming the public research system, increasing the effectiveness of public R & D expenditure and improving linkages between public and private R & D; reducing and redirecting State aids; improving the regulatory environment through further reducing administrative burden and legislative simplification; introducing further incentives to work and to remain in the labour market; ensuring better reconciliation of work and private life; completing the establishment of the integrated employment and social services system; transforming undeclared work into formal employment; and implementing the lifelong learning strategy.

        "ROMANIA 1. In the light of Romania \u2019 s 2007 Implementation Report and the Commission \u2019 s assessment of the National Reform Programme (NRP) and based on the Integrated guidelines for growth and jobs, the following conclusions are appro- priate: 2. Overall, the NRP focuses on the right challenges. However, in some critical areas, such as strengthening administrative capacity and improving the business environment, the programme lacks ambition. In other areas, information about the content of measures, their timelines and budgetary support is sometimes lacking which makes it difficult to assess whether measures will bring solutions to the problems and challenges identified. 3. The programme \u2019 s strengths include initiatives aimed at implementing a medium-term expenditure framework, reducing non-wage labour costs and reforming research structures. 4. The policy areas in the Romanian NRP where challenges need to be tackled with the highest priority are: strengthening administrative capacity, addressing overheating and improving budget planning and the quality of expenditure; cutting red tape and activating labour supply and raising skill levels. Against this background, it is recommended that Romania: \u2014 urgently strengthen administrative capacity at both central and local levels of government by building up effective regulatory, control and enforcement capacity, \u2014 avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policy to contain the growing current account deficit and inflationary pressures, keep wage developments in line with productivity growth and improve budget planning and execution as well as the quality of public finances by reviewing the composition of public spending and by reducing and redirecting State aid to horizontal objectives, \u2014 take rapid measures to reduce substantially administrative procedures and delays to obtain authorisations as part of a coherent better regulation policy in order to improve the business environment, which will also help in the fight against corruption, \u2014 implement an integrated approach to increasing employment, activity rates and productivity levels, especially by accelerating reforms of the education system to respond better to labour market needs, by reducing early school leaving, by significantly increasing adult participation in education and training; and by transforming subsist- ence/semi-subsistence farming into sustainable employment. 5. In addition it will be important for Romania over the period of the NRP to focus on: taking further measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances, in particular with regard to potential risks in terms of adequacy and sustainability of pensions; reinforcing measures to tackle fragmentation of the research base whilst ensuring that planned increases in public research funding yield effective returns by vigorously implementing the national R & D and innovation strategy and by regularly monitoring its results; pursuing a more integrated approach to infrastructure development and roll-out of ICT; intensifying efforts to tackle undeclared work; improving the effectiveness and geographical scope of public employment services, particularly to assist vulnerable groups.

EURO AREA MEMBER STATES 1. In the light of the 2007 Implementation Reports of the euro area Member States, and the Commission \u2019 s assessment of progress made in implementing key structural reforms and based on the Integrated guidelines for growth and jobs, the following conclusions are appropriate: 2. Based on their Implementation Reports, the euro area Member States have been making some progress in implemen- ting policy measures that improve the functioning of the euro area. 3. Significant further reforms are necessary to fulfil the microeconomic and employment recommendations. The progress recorded in 2007 concerning the macroeconomic area needs to be sustained. 4. Among the strengths shown by the 2007 Implementation Reports of the euro area Member States are: budgetary adjustment in 2007, the implementation of legislation to foster financial market integration, and wage bargaining systems more conducive to wage flexibility in some Member States. 5. The policy areas in the euro area where challenges now need to be tackled with the highest priority are: the sustainability of public finances and their contribution to growth; competition in product markets, especially in services, financial integration and competition in financial retail services, in order to facilitate adjustment and more flexible prices; adequate wage developments at the aggregate, sector, regional and occupational level in line with productivity developments in order to ensure competitiveness; flexicurity in labour markets in accordance with the agreed common principles; and more labour mobility in order to foster labour market adjustment. 6. Against this background it is recommended that the euro area Member States together with their country specific recommendations: \u2014 continue pursuing budgetary consolidation towards their medium-term objectives in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, hence striving to achieve an annual structural adjustment of at least 0,5 % of GDP as a benchmark. The Eurogroup in April 2007 agreed on \u2018 taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions, most euro area members would achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009 and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest \u2019 . Budgetary positions where medium-term objectives have been attained should be maintained, \u2014 improve the quality of public finances by reviewing public expenditures and taxation and by modernising public administration, with the intention to enhance productivity and innovation, thereby contributing to economic growth, employment and fiscal sustainability, \u2014 effectively implement measures that improve competition, especially in services, and step up measures that promote the full integration of financial markets and the competition in retail financial services, whilst strengthening stability arrangements and supervisory convergence, \u2014 improve flexibility and security on labour markets, inter alia , by implementing flexicurity principles tailored to the specific circumstances of each Member State and fully compatible with sound and financially sustainable public budgets, better aligning wage and productivity developments so as to enhance growth and competitiveness, and enacting measures to promote labour mobility across borders and between occupations. 7. To maximise policy synergies, which are stronger in a monetary union, and enhance political ownership of reforms, euro area Member States should continue to strengthen policy coordination in the context of the Eurogroup and in international forums, and existing agreements for the external representation of the euro area should be fully implemented. This would significantly contribute to successfully addressing policy challenges within the euro area and in the global economy. The Eurogroup \u2019 s April 2007 Berlin orientations on public finances are a welcome step in this regard. Euro area Member States are invited to take into account these recommendations in their national policies. The Eurogroup will regularly review their implementation.
