        "In brief The social situation in the European Union 2001 I Introduction With a view of disseminating information on the social situation to a larger public, this booklet pre sents the key findings of the Social Situation Report, 2001 which is the second annual Report produced jointly by DG Employment and Social Affairs and Eurostat'. This annual Report provides a broad description of the social situation in Europe. Using harmonised sta tistical information at EU level, it allows the monitoring of different social developments across Member States and the assessment of their impact on European citizens' quality of life. The Lisbon Summit highlighted social policy as a core element in Europe's strategic goal of becoming \"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based eco nomy capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion \". Subsequently, the European Social Agenda, endorsed at the Nice European Council, provided the political basis for the consolidation of a comprehensive strate gy of mutually reinforcing economic, employment and social policy. A widespread consensus exists on the fact that the strengthening of the European economy and its social model will result from policies promoting synergy and positive interaction between economic growth, employment and social cohesion. A better understanding of the different dimensions of the social situation and their inter-play is a prerequisi te for a successful implementation of this strategy. The Report will contribute to such an improved compre hension of the multiple dimensions of living standards of European citizens. By providing qualitative and quantitative analysis on European social trends, it represents a powerful tool for policy makers at European, national and regional level involved with the modernisation of the European social model. The Report not only addresses the interests of policy makers and the academic community; it is also aimed at people in the socio-economic field, NGOs, social partners and every single citizen who is interested in having an in-depth look at contemporary society and willing to contribute to the debate on and the imple mentation of the European Social Agenda. Social policy Social quality / Social cohesion Competitiveness/ Dynamism Full employment / Quality of work Economic policy Employment policy The policy mixes to be established to create a virtuous circle of economic and social progress should reflect the interdependence of these policies and aim to maximise their mutual positive reinforcement.

        "In brief The social situation in the European Union 2001 II The social situation ... The last decade has witnessed a steady improvement in average living conditions across the Union. Economic and social policies have helped enhance opportunities for better lives in many areas. Yet, pro\u00ad gress may also generate new challenges and highlight the problems and unacceptable conditions still to be tackled. At the same time novel demands are on the horizon as Europe's transformation to a knowledge\u00ad based society takes off. The successful policies of the past and present must be adjusted and updated to deal with the new developments and challenges. Population \u2022 Life expectancy at birth continues to rise \u00ad over the last 50 years life expectancy has increased by 10 years. More importantly, disability \u00ad free life expec\u00ad tancy is increasing too. Not only will there be more years to life, Europeans may also expect more life to years. Women can now expect to live for 74 years without any severe disability and men, 69 years. \u2022 At the other end of life, fertility levels are no lon\u00ad ger falling to the extent they were just a few years ago, but in most Member States they have remained at very low levels.

For that reason the social and economic impact of ageing will be particularly pronounced in the next decades. \u2022 The fact that Europe is faced with the prospect of more older people and a shrinking workforce is without doubt the most crucial fall\u00adout from ageing. \u2022 The number of smaller and single person households is increasing but household structures remain dif\u00ad ferent between the North and the South. \u2022 The growing immigration from outside the Union is concentrated on the economically dynamic regions and the big urban areas. As a result most big cities are becoming more multicultural in composition. ",
        "In brief The social situation in the European Union 2001 Living conditions The level of satisfaction among Europeans is impressive: 83% declare themselves to be satisfied with their health, 77% with their life in general, and 67% with their income. Graph 3 Percentage of population satisfied with their life in general (aged 16 and over) \u0392 very satisfied fairly satisfied EL \u03a1 I D EU-15 F \u0392 A E UK FIN IRL L NL S DK Source: Eurobarometer 53 - 2000 \u2022 Health is an absolute priority for Europeans, who generally are less materialistic than often expected. In their ranking of the main determinants of their quality of life they put health before income and place family life as a close third priority. \u2022 Education is another important factor in life quali\u00ad ty, one which impacts not just on employment and income but also on health and social participation. It is therefore of great consequence that levels of edu\u00ad cational attainment have been doubled over the last 30 years: 74% of the 25-29 olds now have a post- compulsory education. Yet, on the threshold to the knowledge-based society it is untenable that almost a third of the cohort still fails to reach this level and thus risks being left behind. While the development of life-long learning will open many new opportuni\u00ad ties for training and up-grading after school, it is difficult to take advantage of these if one failed to attain an education at upper secondary level in the first place.

        "In brief The social situation in the European Union 2001 Income distribution \u2022 Income differences in the EU are still large, both within and between Member States. \u2022 Member States with lower average incomes tend to have greater income inequalities.

        "In brief The social situation in the European Union 2001 III ... and the policy challenges \u2022 The rise in the number of the very old poses a chal lenge to systems of health and long-term care and to our ability to contain demand through the promotion of healthy ageing lifestyles. \u2022 The shrinking of the labour force and the increase in pensioners gives particular pertinence to the Union's existing efforts to raise the activity and employment rates of all of working age, since this can improve economic dependency rates and thus modify the economic and social effects of deteriora ting old age dependency rates. \u2022 As baby boomers approach the age of early retire ment it becomes increasingly crucial to find ways to improve employment opportunities for older wor kers and to enable and motivate them to seize these possibilities. Adjusting well to an ageing work force will require important changes in labour market and work place practices of age management. \u2022 Current inequalities in income distribution, edu cation and health preclude the disadvantaged from participating in society to their full potential. \u2022 The growing availability of knowledge combined with improved individual capabilities for processing and sharing information, is raising the expectations of citizens - there is a growing tendency among people to expect higher quality, tailor-made, custo mised responses to their needs. \u2022 Participation is a crucial factor in the formation of social cohesion. Thus a considerable challenge for the building of a socially cohesive Europe relates to the extent to which we can secure sufficient access for all to participate in markets, politics and civil society. \u2022 As employment levels are rising and more Europeans getto participate in paid work it becomes increasin gly important to strive not just for more, but also for better jobs and to focus on the quality of work. \u2022 And as Europe succeeds in raising the employment rate of women and older workers it becomes increa singly important to achieve a higher degree of reconciliation between work and family life. \u2022 High levels of emigration and ageing in several EU regions present a threat to economic growth and social progress. \u2022 The growing number of non EU nationals living in the Union underlines the importance of measures aimed at securing a rapid integration of newco mers into economic and social life. The welfare systems of Member States have provided European citizens with good protection and contribu ted significantly to the development of social cohesion. These welfare systems have furthermore adapted well to a number of challenges over time. They now have to adjust to the accelerating pace of demographic changes and the requirements of a rapidly evolving knowledge-based economy. Appropriate ways must be found to counteract and contain the ageing and shrinking of the labour force and the pressure on pension and health expenditure emanating from demographic trends. The information revolution presents welfare systems with the challenge to ensure that the opportunities offered by new tech nologies are exploited to the full while the risks of negative side effects are minimised. Achieving sustainable economic growth and full employment amid a successful transition to a know ledge-based, yet older Europe, will require that scarce human resources are treated with much more care than in the past, which gives a new importance to social policy. The current inequalities in income distri bution, education and health represent a barrier to people participating in society to their full potential. Yet, this report also highlights some of the positive interactions between income, education, health and employment which we can build on, when developing our resources of human capital. Social policy is not only an instrument for arriving at a more equitable society. Where it is cost-effective, it can contribute substantially to a more effective and pro ductive economy. This underlines that there is a need to monitor social trends and analyse their overall impact on the economy and society in order to design the most adequate and efficient social policy response. ",

Overall, the smallest differences are found in Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and Sweden, although a sectoral analysis produces different results. In general, the gap bet\u00ad ween the sexes appears to be narrowing: in 1995, the average for the Union was 26%. Although it is not possible to determine whether women are paid less for equal work, it can be concluded that women are in lower-paid positions.
