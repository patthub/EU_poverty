        "Study on the longer-term impact of European Union funding of research in the field of Environment and Health December 2010 The present report, \u00abStudy on the longer-term impact of European Union funding of research in the field of Environment and Health\u00bb, highlights the main achievements of research projects funded by the European Union (EU) during Framework Programme 5, 6 and 7 (first three calls). It also evaluated the contribution of EU-funded research to the implementation of the European Environment and Health Action Plan (EHAP) 2004-2010. Carried out by an independent consultant, COWI, the study shows many positive impacts of EU funding of environment and health research: FP has stimulated research and other activities at national level, and has contributed to restructuring, integration and networking within many sub-areas of environment and health to build a European Research Area. However, the study identified important issues such as integrated environment and health risk assessment, indoor air quality, human biomonitoring, and changing climate, for which further research efforts are required to provide better scientific support for preventing major environment-related diseases such as cancer, asthma, and allergies.

There is also objective evidence that projects funded by the FPs have contributed to numerous EU policies. (cid:129) An important longer-term impact of the EU funding is that the environ- ment and health research has created an important common European re- search platform with a very high degree of legitimacy among the actors. Actors expressed a wish to increase the European cooperation on environ- ment and health research further in the years to come. This could take place within the framework of a second phase of the EHAP or a similar initiative. (cid:129) When assessing the most important research areas on environment and health from different angles, both via written documents, e-survey and in- terviews there seem to be agreement that the themes mentioned in the EHAP and FP funding are still relevant. Themes of special importance re- flecting a high degree of EU added value in the years to come are 1) De- velopment of common EU methodology; 2) Exposure and health impacts of chemicals: and 3) Effects of Climate Change. Combined exposures, e.g., via indoor air, are existing research areas that need more attention and focus in the future. There is a need to focus on medium term on methodological development to reach new high-quality medium- to long- term policy-relevant conclusions that brings the European environment and health research to an even higher level than where it stands today. 6 ",

        "Study on the longer-term impact of European Union funding of research in the field of Environment and Health This understanding has been central to the European Environment and Health Strategy 2 adopted in 2003. Its long-term vision is to address the links between health and environmental problems, and to reduce diseases linked to environ- mental factors. European Environ- ment and Health Strategy The Strategy is implemented in cycles. In its first cycle from 2004-2010 it aims to establish a good understanding of the link between a) childhood respiratory diseases, asthma and allergies; b) neurodevelopment disorders; c) childhood cancer; as well as d) endocrine-disrupting effects on the one hand, and on the other hand their related environmental factors, including i) indoor & outdoor air; ii) dioxins; iii) heavy metals; iv) endocrine disrupters; v) electromagnetic fields; and vi) the urban environment. 3 In 2004, the Strategy was thus followed up by the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 (EHAP), concentrating on building the body of common EU environment and health information and on developing a Euro- pean approach to human bio-monitoring. European Environ- ment and Health Ac- tion Plan 2004-2010 (EHAP) The Action Plan is centred on three main objectives 4 : (cid:129) Improve the information chain by developing integrated environment and health information (covering the specific actions 1 to 4) (cid:129) Fill the knowledge gap by strengthening research on environment and health and identifying emerging issues (covering the specific actions 5 to 8) (cid:129) Response: review policies and improve communication (covering the spe- cific actions 9 to 13). The research related actions are: 5) Enhance coordination and joint activities on environment and health; 6) Target research on diseases, disorders and expo- sures; 7) Develop methodological systems to analyse interactions between envi- ronment and health: 8) Ensure that potential hazards to environment and health are identified and addressed. Projects funded under the FP5 contributed to the formulation of the European Environment and Health Strategy. Later contributions to the implementation of especially the four above-mentioned research-related specific actions of the European Environment and Health Action Plan (2004-2010) are made by pro- jects under the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programmes of Research (FP6 and FP7).

        "Study on the longer-term impact of European Union funding of research in the field of Environment and Health The environment and health-related research activities have primarily been supported under certain specific thematic priorities and themes of the different Framework Programmes on Research. 5 These activities, however, have also aimed to advance the general state of the science in numerous areas of envi- ronment and health and have also striven to support relevant policies at EU and national levels. At the launch of the EHAP 2004-2010 it was set out that, in addition to regular monitoring by the Commission, the Action Plan should be subject to an interim or midterm review in 2007, as well as to a final evaluation of the first cycle of the Action Plan in 2010. 6 , 7 , 8 Monitoring of the Environment and Health Action Plan 2.2 Objectives of the study e of the EHAP and proposing fund- In this context, the main aims of the present study were (cid:129) to evaluate the impact, especially regarding policies, and the relevance of (cid:129) to aid in the prioritisation of future actions in view of a potential second - The specific objectives are to: Analyse and summarise FP5, FP6 and FP7-funded research projects on r Before introducing a potential second phas ing of new research in FP7 and possibly FP8, it is considered important to as- sess the extent to which the relevant research projects supported under the pre- vious and current Framework Programmes on Research has fulfilled the goals set for the individual actions of the EHAP 2004-2010, and whether they have contributed to the environment and health policy goals of the European Union. environment and health research carried out since the launch of FP5 in 1998. phase of the EHAP as well as the preparations for future EU research pro grammes and activities.

It was agreed that each project is mapped regarding both its main goal and possible sub-goals. Projects describing the sub-goal as a secondary object are shown in both the FPs and the EHAP actions, but they are only classified once with regard to the number of projects, budget or contribution to EU or national activities/policy, respectively.

The EU projects we judged to be very suited to this form of training. A long list of emerging and re-emerging issues was brought up by the experts. Everyone had his/her priorities, but further developing integrated risk assess ment tools, information systems, human bio-monitoring and policy-relevant results on indoor air pollution was mentioned by s in the years to come, yet not all were convinced that a second phase of the EHAP was the only way to reach this goal.

The funding scheme for these projects was a Network of Excellence (NoE), the main aim of which was to combat fragmentation in a particular area of science. 15 An Commission-funded expert team made in 2008 a review of the NoEs and the conclusion was that the objectives of the NoE scheme were ambiguous and the scheme was successful to a limited extent only regarding the general objective of developing integrated and sustainable \u2018virtual centres of ex- cellence\u2019. However, the NoE \u2018experiment\u2019 is seen as valuable and important because it showed that in such organisational setting valuable collective goods can be produced that would not result from other arrangements. Some NoEs have even come close to achieving the originally defined objec- tives. 16 The idea behind the GA2LEN network was the cooperation between European groups on asthma and allergies on a long-term basis. The NoE was successful in creating a European Research Area (ERA) of excellence in the field of allergy and asthma. Some activities, e.g., EAACI-GA2LEN Allergy 17 Schools have continued after the network has ended (http://eaaci.net/activities/ga2len/ga2len-events). The main objective of CASCADE as a Network of Excellence 18 was to act as an integrated research network in the field of chemical contaminants in food. It was originally composed of 19 partner uni- versities and institutes but has been additionally expanded through the introduction of new partners. CASCADE is today a highly multidisciplinary network, featuring a wide array of scientific disci- plines including risk assessment, toxicology, biochemistry, molecular biology, mouse genetics, in- silico and in-vitro methodologies and several additional research areas. In addition, from the start the CASCADE NoE developed an extensive training (e.g., an international post-doc programme [CASCADE-FELLOWS] has been established to continue the research and researcher exchange ac- tivities of CASCADE) and dissemination scheme. A key feature of NoEs and CASCADE is the re- quirement to become established in such a fashion that network activities would remain active even after the EC funding period. Thus, it has established a Non-Profit Association to continue network activities in the future (CASCADE ACERT). 15 Source as above and, e.g., http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=205939&sectioncode=26 16 http://www.ecnis.org/images/stories/ecnis/documents/news/expert_group_on_the_future_of _noes_final_report.pdf. 17 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00822.x/full 18 http://www.cascadenet.org/projectweb/portalproject/CASCADE%20NoE%20becomes%20 CASCADE%20ACERT.html 24 ",

Action 7 has the high- est total budget of the actions evaluated in this project (EUR 271,531,750). The highest funded sub-goals are \" Methodologies, techniques, and models to ad- dress complexity in environment/health interactions \" (EUR 70,017,528) with 19 projects, and \" Integrated risk assessment methodologies and models for evaluating cumulative effects, interaction between stressors and their influence on human health \" (EUR 63,378,525) with 13 projects, respectively (Table 6, Appendix 1). Regarding contribution to EU, international or national activi- ties/policy all sub-goals contribute to EU activities/policy (one to 11 projects) only six contribute to international and ten to national activities/policy. Examples of projects include HEIMTSA 19 and INTARESE 20 , which are an integrated systemic approach. The two projects are developing a methodo- logical framework and a set of tools and indicators for integrated assessment that can be applied across different environmental stressors (including pollut- ants and physical hazards), exposure pathways (air, water, soil, food) and pol- icy areas. HEIMTSA, INTERESE and other projects looking at environ- ment/health interactions were discussed at the 2009 conference in Luxembourg \" Bridging the gap: Using science to inform the development of policy \" 21 . The main conclusion was that integrated Environmental Health Impact Assessment (IEHIA) will become even more important in the years to come. Indoor air quality, a main theme on the conference, was seen as an example of a research field where the integrated approach will continue to create policy-relevant re- sults and new legislation in the future.

        "Study on the longer-term impact of European Union funding of research in the field of Environment and Health Box 5-2 Examples of projects included in Action 8 The FP6-funded EDEN) project 22 received EUR 11 million to catalogue, understand, model and map the environmental, economic and societal factors that help diseases to spread. A strong European research and expertise network in vector-borne diseases was developed. The EDEN project developed predictive models which can indicate when and where disease outbreaks may happen because of cli- mate change, changing habitats or even new viruses or diseases. These models may help us get pre- pared for potential future epidemics. The project focused on diseases transmitted by sandflies, mos- quitoes, or ticks, and rodents. Methods have been developed to monitor climate and environmental changes, using the resulting indicators in disease modelling and developing tools for risk assessment, thereby enabling improved public health decision making at the national and European levels. A strong PhD network has been implemented, and many workshops and meetings have been held, in- cluding an international conference organised in Montpellier (France), in May 2010. The EDEN in- formation system is now internationally recognised and supported by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Besides the numerous publications and PhD theses released during EDEN, key scientific messages are: (i) Disease emergence is a complex phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a single cause, and each emerging infectious disease is a special case. The causes may vary from place to place; (ii) Social, economic and behavioural changes may be more important than climate or environmental changes in explaining disease upsurges; (iii) Long-term, and high-quality, field and public-health data are essential to correctly identify the most important drivers of disease emergence; (iv) Quantitative predictive models are needed to develop useful early-warning tools. Recent events such as the Pakistan earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Si- chuan earthquake, the European heat waves and the cyclone in Myanmar reveal the vulnerability of societies to extreme events. The main goal of the MICRODIS project is to strengthen prevention, mitigation and preparedness strategies in order to reduce the health, social and economic impacts of extreme events on communities. Specifically, the objectives of MICRODIS are 23 : - to strengthen the scientific and empirical foundation on the relationship between extreme events and their health, social and economic impacts; - to develop and integrate knowledge, concepts, methods, tools and databases towards a common global approach; - to improve human resources and coping capacity in Asia and Europe though training and knowl- edge sharing. It should be noted that the project is still ongoing. The main strength of this project is that the project involves an international consortium of sixteen partners from across Europe and Asia, with full spec- trum of experts from those involved at the EU level through to global policy level. Finally, the two non-research focused actions: Action 12 ( Improve indoor air quality , theme 3; eight projects) and Action 13 ( Follow developments regard- ing electromagnetic fields , theme 3; 11 projects) are covered to a medium ex- tent except for action 13 in the FP5, which is covered to a high extent (Tables 8, 9 and 10, Appendix 1). This is not surprising, since these actions are primar- ily non-research actions. 22 Emerging diseases in a changing European environment: http://www.eden-fp6project.net/ 23 Health and socio-economic impacts of extreme events:http://www.microdis-eu.be/. 26 ",
        "Study on the longer-term impact of European Union funding of research in the field of Environment and Health In the interviews it was stated, however, that the specific actions 5 to 8 of the EHAP are broadly and generically formulated to catch new and emerging is- sues, and it was confirmed that actions 12 and 13 are not primary research ac- tions and may as such confuse the overall picture of the mapping. Some experts remarked in the interviews that it is not so much the number of projects, but rather the results and quality of them that count. One expert stated that the weakness of many EU projects is that they have unrealistic objectives and many partners of variable quality. It is therefore questionable if they will con- tribute to important new results. Another stated that high-quality projects may make significant contributions to accumulating knowledge in the E&H area and probably also to formulating new policies, and it was underlined that these pro- jects are characterised by strong and visionary project leadership and concrete objectives. Viewpoints received by interviews: It is the results and qual- ity of the projects that count The interviews showed some concern about securing proper utilisation of the results of the many projects. Equally, concern was expressed over what will happen when the European E&H action plan terminates in 2010 and how re- sults can be brought forward. In general, it was perceived among the interview- ees that the environment and health issues were handled better by the FP5 and the FP6 compared to the FP7. Therefore it is important to create the \"right han- dles\" for the future work. Concern about the future of environ- ment and health re- search In conclusion: Conclusions regard- ing Q1 In the FP5 all relevant EHAP actions are covered to a high extent except for action 12. The same pattern is observed in the FP6 and the FP7 except for ac- tions 12 and 13. This is not surprising since these actions are primarily non- research actions, which was confirmed in the interviews. Furthermore, some experts remarked in the interviews that it is not so much the number of projects, but rather the results and quality of them that count. Interviewees also ex- pressed concern regarding what will happen when the EHAP terminates in 2010 and how results can be brought forward. Regarding the mapping, many of the projects (118) contribute to EU activi- ties/policy and much fewer to international (16) or national (19) activi- ties/policy respectively. This number of contributions may be biased since the mapping is based on project abstracts and web pages, which may not be up- dated or sufficient comprehensive. 27 ",

Current estimates of the European health impact of especially fine par- ticles in the air are large. However, available estimates are primarily based on exposure-response relationships established in studies from North America. There is an urgent need to perform studies in Europe on recent and current exposures, and to use refined exposure assessment tools. Thus the re- search objective is to provide new assessments of the risks for health of populations affected by poor air quality. The focus is on vulnerable groups, such as children and pregnant mothers; asthma and respiratory disease, high blood pressure and cardio-vascular disease; mortality and cancer amongst other conditions. The overall strategy is to take advantage of health data from European cohort stud- ies. The project will integrate health and environmental data. 26 An earlier project on the same theme was \"AIRNET\" funded by FP5 27 . AIRNET was very policy oriented and had five working groups meeting regularly, and producing reports aimed at a non- specialist audience to explain contributions from different fields and disciplines of air pollution. Stakeholder needs were incorporated into these working groups by having the reports address a num- ber of \u2018frequently asked questions\u2019 originating from stakeholder presentations and a specific survey among stakeholders conducted in the early stage of the project 28 . The project is assessed to have had significant influence on the ongoing policy process in the area. 29 ENNAH funded by FP7 is a network on noise and health, 30 focussing on producing information that is useful for the further development of, e.g., the Environmental Noise Directive by examining whether existing noise maps can be used to establish any adverse effects of noise on health. Accord- ing to the project webpage research on noise and health has been significantly advanced by two pre- vious EU funded projects: RANCH 31 which examined relationships between aircraft and road traffic noise at school and children\u2019s cognition and health, and HYENA 32 which explored the impact of aircraft and road traffic noise on blood pressure in adults. ENNAH will take this work further. ENNAH includes a specific training part, a younger researcher exchange programme. In the interviews it was suggested that the EU projects have an important role in educating national researchers in Member States. As much of the E&H re- search are highly specialised, EU co-funded high quality research courses may provide extra added value and at the same time promote the needed integration and use of common methodologies etc. Action 6 ( Target research on diseases, disorders and exposures ) covered in all 43 projects distributed over seven sub-goals. Three of these may be underrepre- sented since the sub-goals 'Exposure to and effects of heavy metals' only funded two projects, 'Causes of environment-related diseases via epidemiological stud- ies focusing on gene-environment interactions' funded three projects and 'Envi- ronmental exposures and neuro-developmental disorders ' four projects. In addi- s one tion, two of the sub-goals also received quite low EU contribution wherea 25 : http://www.env-health.org/a/3571.

        "Study on the longer-term impact of European Union funding of research in the field of Environment and Health ( 'Causes of environment-related diseases via epidemiological studies focusing on gene-environment interactions' ) received fairly high contribution. The latter also shows that many projects have this area as sub-goal as secondary objective (Table 5, Appendix 1). Box 5-5 Example of projects included under Action 6 ANEMONE 33 ( Assessment of neurobehavioural endpoints and markers of neurotoxicant exposures ), funded by FP5, was mapped under the sub-goal 'Environmental exposures and neurodevelopmental disorders ') ylmercury is present worldwide in seafood and freshw . Meth ater fish. Accumulation of methylmercury in species that contribute to the human diet results in increased exposures in many fishing communities. This contaminant often occurs along with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). ANEMONE followed a large cohort of children from the North Atlantic area from birth to 7 years of age as well as their mothers to investigate exposures to methylmercury and PCBs and the effect on cognitive functioning. Their conclusions were worrying: Unexpected patterns of persistent pollutants in marine food chains in the North Atlantic were discovered; Concentrations of PCBs found in fulmar egg and muscle are in the same range as previously seen in the pilot whale, thereby significantly con- tributing to human exposures. Brominated flame retardants were also found in the babies. In the co- hort of children examined, PCB concentrations averaged about 60% of the concentrations in their mothers, but concentrations in the children increased with the duration of the breastfeeding period. Children with different degrees of prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs and other halo- genated organic pollutants have been examined at age seven, and performance on neurobehavioural tests decreased at higher prenatal methylmercury. The results support the notion that action should be taken to protect the developing brain from toxic effects caused by pollutants. This conclusion is highly relevant to the DG SANCO and EFSA risk assessment activities as regards food contaminants. GABRIEL 34 ( A multidisciplinary study to identify the genetic and environmental causes of asthma in the European Community ), funded by FP6, was classified in the mapping under the sub-goal ' Causes of environment-related diseases via epidemiological studies focusing on gene-environment interac- tions'. It involved over 150 scientists from 14 European countries, using the latest research across a variety of disciplines, including genetics, epidemiology and immunology, to identify key factors in the development of asthma. The final results of this integrated project will be available in the second half of 2010. DEER 35 ( Developmental effects of environment on reproduction ), funded by FP7, was mapped under the sub-goal ' Long-term health impacts of exposure to environmental stressors (chemicals, air pollu- tion and noise) '). Many of the male reproductive health issues (low sperm count, testicular cancer, low production of male hormone), which a large portion of the male population in the Western coun- tries face today are thought to arises because of mal-development and malfunction of the fetal testis. These reproductive disorders are thus thought to comprise a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). Several pieces of evidence suggest that common environmental chemicals, probably acting together in mixtures or in combination with other factors (genetic, lifestyle) could contribute causally to TDS. However, there are numerous obstacles to proving this scientifically, such as the long latency (up to 40 years) between cause (in fetal life) and health consequence, coupled with inherent difficulties in 33 http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/pdf/env_health_projects/chemicals/c- anemone.pdf 34 http://www.gabriel-fp6.org/ 35 http://www.eu-deer.net/ 31 ",

DEER will take advantage of existing human birth cohorts/samples with their associated chemical exposure analyses. Established animal and in vitro models will be used to improve our understanding of foetal testis development and func- tion and its relationship to male reproductive development. The complexity of real-life chemical ex- posures will be tackled by new bioinformatics approaches for assessing associations between real-life exposure scenarios and effects in humans. Results will be available in 2012 and are likely to contrib- ute to EU chemicals-related policies.

It e n 2009. The project conclusions underlines the need of nded i time to examine cumulative stressors, it looks into the nature of uncertainties and identify and qualify the most relevant risks. Main focus should be given to the receptor instead of the single stressor. 37 There is also a need for more efforts on mechanistic understanding and for a mechanism-based framework for interpreting mixture/multiple stressor effects.

Case studies are developed with application of full chain methods. The study also has specific focus on training and capacity building. 39 Together with INTARESE, HEIMTSA will produce an Integrated Toolbox, which will consist of three complementary parts: (i) A Guidance System, explaining Integrated Environmental Health Impact Assessment (IEHIA) and what it takes to apply it in real-life situations, including worked examples from both projects and in particular on the Common Case Study; (ii) A Toolkit of selected stand-alone tools; (iii) An Integrated Environmental Health Impact Assessment Computational System (IEHIACS).

As i can be seen, some of the larger projects are relevant for more than one EHAP action (Box 5-8). NANOIM NET, funded by FP7 and consisting of 24 partner instit PACT utions, is an open network that has become very popular for both researchers in and outside Europe. NanoImpactNet will create a scientific basis to ensure the safe and responsible development of engineered nanoparticles and nanotechnology-based materials and products, and will support the definition of regulatory measures and implementation of legislation in Europe. The work is focused on human hazards and exposures, hazards and fate of nanomaterials in the environment, impact assessment, communication, integration and nomenclature, and coordination and management. Discussions about strategies and methodolo- gies are usually initiated through workshops covering the various topics. All researchers and stake- holders dealing with the issues are invited to participate. After these workshops, the researchers col- laborate to produce thorough reports and sets of guidelines reflecting the consensus reached.

The network is part of the large EU NanoSafety Cluster 46 . The cluster is a Commission initiative to maximise the synergies between the existing FP6 and FP7 projects addressing all aspects of nano- safety including toxicology, ecotoxicology, exposure assessment, mechanisms of interaction, risk assessment and standardisation. Participation in the NanoSafety cluster is voluntary for projects that commenced prior to April 2009, and is compulsory for projects started since April 2009. The HiWATE project was funded under FP6. The main objective of the project was to investigate potential human health risks (e.g., cancer, premature births, small for gestational age, semen quality, still birth, congenital anomalies) associated with long-term exposure to low levels of disinfectants (such as chlorine) and disinfectant by-products (DBPs) occurring in water for human consumption and use in the food industry. The study comprised risk/benefit analyses including quantitative as- sessments of risk associated with microbial contamination of drinking water versus chemical risk and compares alternative treatment options. The results should be improved risk assessment/management. The project held a final workshop in the spring 2010 with many participants but the results from this is not yet publicly available.

Overall, c - ugh the research-related Actions in the EHAP seem to be well cov- t principle, and no projects were found with the main focus of \"early warning o emerging threats\", the area of nanoparticles is an example of an emerging issue receiving quite a lot of E&H research funding within a relatively short period of time. Conclusions regard- Efforts are still s ing Q2 218 projects have been funded distributed over 25 sub-goals; 11 of these sub- goals suffer from few projects funded, although these may have received ade- quate EU contribution and also contributed very well to at least EU activi- ties/policy. The reason for the relatively few projects funded within specifi sub-goals may be due to, e.g., few or poor quality applications, the topics not having been opened in calls for proposals, or few research institutions within the specific area or small universities which are not able to manage big EU pro jects. Even tho ered, policy requests from policy-makers still emerge. They want answers to specific policy questions and recommend new research, because they need to solve newly emerged E&H problems. The Scientific Committees of the Com- mission can offer advice, but sometimes they also recommend new research priorities like, e.g., antimicrobial resistance, an area in which they made a join recommendation in 2009. needed to addres policy needs 45 ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/nanotechnology/docs/compendium-nanosafety- cluster2010_en.pdf, page 100. 46 http://www.nanosafetycluster.eu/ [FP6/FP7]) 34 ",

This is also relevant for the action 12 which is only covered to a lesser degree. Optimally, this would require that the projects are a step ahead to be able to deliver answers when the E&H challenge is debated in a political con- text. In FP5 information \", the policy-related goals were especially addressed in the sub- theme \" Strengthen scientific basis for decision-making and Priority setting for environment and health policy \", where 62 projects have contributed to the EU activities/policy, 13 to national activities/policy and seven to international poli- cies. In contrast, the two other sub-themes have almost not contributed to na- tional, international or EU policies (Table 1, Appendix 1). The CREDO cluster of projects represents an excellent example of FP5 (Box 5-8). B The CRED ster on chemical risks (' The Cluster of Resea O clu rch into Endocrine Disruption in Europe' ) is an example of a cluster of projects often referred to by the interviewees and the project coordinators who were interviewed as part of this study. The cluster consisted of four projects (EDEN, FIRE, EURISKED, and COMPRENDO) encompassing 63 laboratories in Europe and with a total budget of approximately EUR 20 million 2003- 2006. 47 It was launched as a direct response to the call to enhance research efforts by the European Commission\u2019s Strategy on Endocrine Disrupters. The project gave important input to the REACH policy initiative. The results of the cluster showed, among others, the conventional approach of estimating no-observed-effect-levels for chemicals is inadequate for capturing low-dose effects of endocrine disrupters. The benchmark method should be given preference. The determinants of additive combination effects of several endocrine disrupters with a common mode of action are now well understood. Endocrine disrupters of relatively low po- tency and at low exposure levels can still work together to produce significant combination effects when they are present in sufficient numbers. Furthermore, a wide variety of endocrine disrupting chemicals has been found together in human tissue specimens, and in specimens of wild fish. Existing mode of action screens that focus on oestrogenic, anti-androgenic and thyroid disrupting properties of chemicals do not keep pace with advances in basic knowledge about hormone signalling. Signalling cross-talk, especially with fast kinase signalling, needs to be taken into account during the screening of chemicals. The reproductive and developmental effects of certain endocrine disrupters are compa- rable across phyla, from invertebrates to mammals. Newer EU projects funded on endocrine disrupters can be found on the EU webpage on endocrine disrupters: http://ec.europa.eu/research/endocrine/projects_ongoing_en.html The same pattern is observed in FP6 (Table 2, Appendix 1) and FP7 (Table 3, Appendix 1) where many projects contribute to EU policy related goals and e, much fewer to international and national policies.

It is seen as d in so an essential element in a strategy for environmental health impact assessment. The four main objectives of the 22-partner ESBIO coor- dination action, funded by FP6, were 50 : (i)Development of a coordinated approach for biomonitoring based on existing expertise and experiences available in Member States surveillance programmes and results from research; (ii)Elaboration how biomonitoring results can be integrated most efficiently with environmental monitoring and registered health data; (iii) Develop strategies to communicate biomonitoring results to stakeholders (population affected, regulators, politicians) including the estab- lishment of websites publicly available and with links to national and international activities resulting in full transparency for the stakeholder; and (iv) Elaboration of scenarios for the use of biomonitoring results for policy making. The project prepared the terrain for a longer-term HBM activity in Europe, by providing, inter alia , a concept for coordination for a harmonised approach to HBM in Europe, an updated European inven- tory of biomonitoring and guidelines for data collection (sampling, chemical analysis and data man- agement) 51 . In December 2009 the COPHES consortium ( 'Consortium to perform human biomonitoring on a European scale ') began work towards an EU HBM framework, based on preliminary work under- taken by ESBIO. COPHES activities will be accompanied by a feasibility study called DEMOCOPHES (funded by the EU LIFE programme) started in October 2010 52 . COPHES consists of 35 institutions in 27 European countries. It will develop a functional framework allowing the collection of comparable HBM data throughout Europe. Indeed, currently the many studies in EU too often gather fragmented data that do not allow full exploitation. The framework will also include a roadmap for integration of HBM data with envi- ronmental and health information and will address ethical aspects specific for the collection and stor- age of human material and data.

This is an example of a project where policy actions will be a reaction of eventually strong and veri- fied documentation of a health risk. Understanding the impact of the PFCs in our diet will enable Europe to take better decisions regarding the food production chain and to improve the quality of life. If the results indicate that exposure in Europe is at potentially hazardous levels, then the project will have a great socio-economic impact on strategic decisions, regulations, release limits, product substi- tutes, etc. In addition, a representative assessment of the exposure levels in Europe will strengthen the global inventory of the PFC issue, which is of general interest to mankind.

New issues emerge mainly as a result of the analysis of routine monitoring data and through exploratory science. It is suggested by the stakeholder in question that the Commission increase funding of the latter activities and develop effective means of reviewing results. Some of the interviewees had similar suggestions. At the same time, interviewees mention that there is a need for long-term focus when selecting research projects/activities to be funded. It is a challenge to combine a long-term focus with the fulfilment of relevant political short-term needs for policy advice, and to pass science-based legislation that addresses upcoming problems.

This area has emerged as an important sub-area in environment and health, partially due to public concerns and political initiatives such as the European strategy for nanotechnology and the nanotechnology Action Plan, adopted in 2004. The Commission has continued to support research activities on indoor air quality as was stated in the midterm review. However, in the second phase 2007-2010, only a few projects were launched (Table 8, Appendix 1). Not sur- prisingly, interviewees generally mention their own research area as important supplemented by a few more areas, which in most cases involved indoor air quality. An explanation to this is probably that most people spend most of their time indoors.

There seems to be an almost total agreement on the need for keeping up the work on methodological issues. There is also agreement that E&H research is extremely complicated and is get- ting even more so. The need for data and data quality is increasing. A major problem identified by the interviewees is th in the long term. This problem needs to be addressed in a potential second phase of EHAP. An example mentioned is the current lack of mechanisms to ensure the continuation of a database. Many FP6 and FP7 projects are loo for a solution to this problem, for example by transferring the information to different European authorities or agencies, e.g., the European Environment Agency, the European Food Safety Authority, the European Chemicals Agency or the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Because of the nature of the E&H area - e.g. cancer develops over 10-30 years - almost all interviewees called for a long-term focus.

(cid:129) The actions cover 25 sub-goals. Some sub-goals seems to be covered to a less extent e.g., \" Consolidate ongoing research in priority areas \" (Action 5) or \" Causes of environment-related diseases via epidemiological studies focusing on gene-environment interactions \" (Action 6) but many projects mention these actions as secondary object. This leave only three sub-goals identifying gaps: \" Exposure to and effects of heavy metals \" (Action 6), \" Improved health sector planning for future extreme weather events \" (Ac- tion 8) and \" Rapid assessment of emerging threats \" (Action 8) where no projects were funded and no projects pointed on secondary objects within these sub-goals.

If the necessary expertise is not present in the Committee, quick tenders could be developed when the need arises.

The experts in the Commission have the necessary skills but not the time and focus for this special task. The communication specialist should inform Commission experts and policy-makers about results from the projects, and provide the scientific community with updated policy guidance.

        "90 The results of the mapping exercise are also presented in relation to the EHAP actions, see the following tables. In the context of the significant overlap between sub-goals for the first period of the EHAP cycle (2004-2006) and the second period of the EHAP cycle (2007-2010), the mapping related to EHAP actions will be presented together for both period so that repetition is avoided. A total of 19 projects is classified as Action 5 \"Integrate and strengthen European environment and health research\", see Table 4. Six falls within the sub-goal \"Analyse results of projects and national initiatives relevant to policy making \", five within the sub-goal \"Consolidate ongoing research in priority areas\", eight within \"Strengthen networking between researchers, policy makers and stakeholders\" and one within \"Organise conferences and/or workshops to highlight results and their relevance to policy development and identify needs for the future\". In relation to the latter it must be added that the Commission has organised or otherwise contributed during the six years of the Action Plan numerous events engaging various stakeholders including national and EU policy makers e.g.: - Workshop on biobanking 2009 (Brussels, 2009) - Endocrine disrupters: four international workshops to discuss testing strategies and current state of the art (2005, 2006, Brussels, Helsinki, Prague); - Environmental cancer risks: one international workshop to highlight results of framework programme projects (2005, Warsaw) - Health risks related to exposure to electromagnetic fields: a workshop highlighting the final results of the FP6-funded EMF-NET coordination action (Brussels, 2006) - Climate change and health risks: workshop (Brussels, 2005) - 6th European Conference on Noise Control and Global Noise Policy workshops, (Tampere, 2006) - 10th International Congress of Toxicology (Tampere, 2004) - EUROTOX2009 congress (Dresden, 2009) - 12th International Congress of Toxicology (Barcelona 2010) - International Polar Symposium (Brussels, 2007); - Health risks related to indoor and ambient air quality: three workshops with extensive stakeholder participation (Brussels, 2007, 2008, 2009) - Risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis: workshop on harmonisation of risk analysis of food chemicals (Brussels, 2005) - 1st international risk assessment conference (Brussels 2008) - Two workshops on cost/benefit and uncertainty analysis (Brussels, 2007); - Open Stakeholder Consultation: Priorities for Environment & Health Research in FP7 (Brussels 2006); - International conference on environmental epidemiology and exposure (Paris, 2006); - Intergovernmental Midterm Review of Environment and Health (Vienna, 2007) - International Public Health Symposium on Environment and Health Research (Madrid 2008) - Fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health (Parma, 2010) - Environment and Health Action Plan Consultative Forum meetings (twice a year until 2008, once in 2009 and 2010 in Brussels and Luxembourg) ",

Under the 5th Framework Programme four projects as Action 5, 46 as Action 6, 22 as Action 7, 10 as Action 8, three as Action 12 and eight as Action 13. Under the 6th Framework Programme six projects were classified as Action 5, 11 as Action 6, 28 as Action 7, 19 as Action 8, two as Action 12, one as Action 13 and one did not fall under the chosen themes/sub-goals and is therefore classified as \"Other action\". Under the 7th Framework Programme nine projects were classified as Action 5, ten as Action 6, 29 as Action 7, 24 as Action 8, three as Action 12 and finally two as Action 13.

The results of the mapping exercise have been reviewed by Dr Tuomo Karjalainen, Scientific Officer, Directorate-General for Research in order to verify the findings. In cases where he felt the mapping of individual projects was incorrect in accordance to his knowledge of the projects, the mapping was corrected following his suggestions. The project description of a substantial amount of projects under the 5th Framework programme (FP5) does not mention specifically that the obtained scientific basis will strengthen the scientific basis for decision-making, priority setting policy or public opinion on environmental health. These have been classified as \"Strengthen scientific basis\" since they do not fall under sub-goals in the breakdown structure. Many of the projects in the FP5 (1998-2002) were completed before the EHAP was implemented. These have been classified under the first period of the EHAP 2004-2006, unless a project was initiated before 2004 and clearly falls under the sub-goals of the second period of the EHAP 2007-2010. During the mapping exercise, it became apparent that two thematic areas related to the 6th Framework Programme (FP6) needed to be added to the breakdown structure. These thematic areas are \"Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health\", funding research especially on the development of new in vitro tests to replace animal experimentation, and \"Nanotechnology and nanosciences, knowledge-based multifunctional materials and new Verification 5th Framework Programme 6th Framework Programme ",
        "105 production processes and devices (NMP)\", funding research on environmental and health risks of nanomaterials, will be added to the mapping exercise. What had already been mapped at that stage was screened to make sure that no project belonging to those categories was mapped otherwise. As opposed to FP5 and FP7, the booklet \"European Research on Environment and Health Projects of the Sixth Framework Programme edited by the Climate Change and Environmental Risks Unit, Environment Directorate\" did not provide enough information to support the mapping exercise. The mapping of FP6 was instead based on a Project Fact Sheet from the CORDIS webpage (http://cordis.europa.eu/fp6/projects.htm) and, if necessary and available, the project webpage or project report summery. Very few projects were classified based on material apart from that of CORDIS. In general, information about the contribution to policy-making on international, EU or national level was not included in the Project Fact Sheet from CORDIS, and many have thus been classified as \"NA\". When using CORDIS we leaned on the action line label to classify the projects in terms of thematic priority. Thus, projects labelled as action line \"FOOD\" in CORDIS are classified as thematic priority: \"Food quality and safety\". The action line \"SUSTDEV\" translates into thematic priority: \"Sustainable development, global change and ecosystems\", the action line \"POLICIES\" gives the thematic priority: \"Policy-oriented research in Specific Activities Covering a Wider Field of Research\", the action line \"NMP\" gives thematic priority: \"Nanotechnologies and nanoscience, knowledge-based multifunctional materials, and new production processes and devises\" and finally the action line \"LIFESCIHEALTH\" gives the thematic priority: \"Life Science; Innovative Medicines Initiative, poverty-related diseases, stem cells\". In the 7th Framework Programme (FP7) under the \"Environment\" theme, the two sub-goals: \"Study of multiple exposures via different exposure routes\" and \"Identification of pollution sources and new or emerging environmental stressors potential health effects \u2026\" could overlap. In the mapping process, they are distinct in that the first focuses on multiple sources and/or exposure routes, while the latter encompasses research on single categories of pollution sources. Accordingly, projects investigating different types of chemicals would be classified as \"Identification of pollution sources and new or emerging environmental stressors potential health effects \u2026\" In relation to the mapping of FP7, the theme \"Eutatom programme 'Radiation Protection' activity\" was added to distinguish projects funded by the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for nuclear research and training activities as a category. As with FP6, what had already been mapped at that stage was screened to make sure that no project belonging to those categories was mapped otherwise. There is a possible overlap between Action 3 \"Develop a coherent approach to bio-monitoring in Europe\" and Action 7 \"Develop Methodological Systems to analyse interactions between environment and health\" sub- goal \"Development and validation of technologies and diagnostic tools (e.g. biomarkers and biosensors) addressing real-life exposures\". Information was provided by Tuomo Karjalainen that two specific projects should be 7th Framework Programme Action 3 ",
        "106 classified under Action 3. The rest has been classified under Action 7 since it was justifiable according to the description of the sub-goal in the breakdown structure. In Action 6 of the EHAP the sub-goal, \"Environmental exposure and endocrine disrupting effects\" will also encompass projects focusing on hormone disruptions and reproduction disorders in relation to environmental exposure. Referring to the sub-goal explanation in Action 6, all projects in this action about allergy is classified under the sub-goal \"Environmental exposures and respiratory diseases\" irrespective of whether projects concern respiratory allergy. In Action 7 of the EHAP, the initial screening focuses on whether the project develops methodological systems or merely uses existing methods. Still, if a project's primary focus is not the development of methods, it can be classified under action 7 if the aim and objectives clearly fall under one of the sub-goals of the action. A project does not have to correspond with all the characteristics mentioned in the sub-goal. Hence, a risk analysis of food would be classified as \"Risk/benefit analysis of food\". To be classified in Action 8 in the EHAP, projects have to focus on potential, environmental hazards to health. Hence, a project would not be classified under Action 8 if it does not focus on environmental hazard as a separate issue. The short version of two sub-goals in Action 8 are very similar; \"Impact of global environmental change on human and animal health (env)\" and \"Impact of global environmental change on human and animal health (health)\". The results of the mapping exercise should therefore bee seen in the light of the very distinct description provided in the \"research focus\" of the breakdown structure. The research focus of the two sub-goals are \"To launch a research action on the assessment of Global Change-driven factors linked to the risk of introducing and spreading emerging human diseases\" and \"To investigate the impact of global environmental change including extreme weather events and other effects of climate change on human health and animal health\" respectively. No projects have been classified under Action 10 of the EHAP even though almost all large Integrated Projects and Networks of Excellence funded by FP6 had more or less extensive training activities. This is the case of approximately 15 projects funded by FP6. In the mapping exercise, they have been classified under Actions 6, 7 and 8. Although many FP6 projects had a training component, none of them was purely focused on training and for this reason they cannot be classified under Action 10. A single project is classified as other action, since it did not fall under the descriptions of any of the actions dealt with in the mapping exercise. During the mapping the use of the category have also been used a temporary classification. To exemplify this, some projects conduct target research and improve knowledge of priority diseases, disorders and exposures not described in Action 6.

        "Study on the longer-term impact of European Union funding of research in the field of Environment and Health December 2010 The present report, \u00abStudy on the longer-term impact of European Union funding of research in the field of Environment and Health\u00bb, highlights the main achievements of research projects funded by the European Union (EU) during Framework Programme 5, 6 and 7 (first three calls). It also evaluated the contribution of EU-funded research to the implementation of the European Environment and Health Action Plan (EHAP) 2004-2010. Carried out by an independent consultant, COWI, the study shows many positive impacts of EU funding of environment and health research: FP has stimulated research and other activities at national level, and has contributed to restructuring, integration and networking within many sub-areas of environment and health to build a European Research Area. However, the study identified important issues such as integrated environment and health risk assessment, indoor air quality, human biomonitoring, and changing climate, for which further research efforts are required to provide better scientific support for preventing major environment-related diseases such as cancer, asthma, and allergies.
