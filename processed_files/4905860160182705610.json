        "5 It is unacceptable in a democratic and equal society that women continue to earn on average 15% less than men and 25% less in the private sector. The present report, carried out by a group of independent economic experts, highlights once again this well known and yet disturbing reality. The pay gap between women and men persists and there is little evidence of improvement. The origins of the gender pay gap are to be found beyond the legal framework. Legal action is, therefore, not enough. Pay inequality is a reflection of various inequalities between women and men on the labour market, such as segregations in sectors, occupations and work patterns, access to education and training, biased evaluation and pay systems, and stereotypes. Women and men are legally equal, but they are not economically equal. Is the existence of a gender pay gap so surprising when five times more women than men work part-time? Should we not try to understand why only one in three managers is a woman? Is it acceptable that women work predomi- nantly in sectors or occupations where wages are the lowest? The authors of this report emphasise the need for multi-dimensional policies to address the underlying causes of the gender pay gap. The Commission fully subscribes to this approach. The Roadmap for equality between women and men adopted by the Commission on 1 March 2006 is the Commission's contribution to promoting equality between women and men in the European Union and abroad. Among the key actions planned for 2007, the Commission intends to present a Communication on the gender pay gap which will identify the factors behind unequal pay and define concrete actions to reduce the gender pay gap. The present report constitutes a very useful contribution to the preparation of the Communication from the Commission.

        "Introduction Reducing the gender pay gap is an important topic on the European political agenda. Since 1999 it has been part of the European employment strategy and policy efforts have intensified over the years. In 2003, Member States were called on to formulate targets in this respect in order \u2018to achieve by 2010 a substantial reduction in the gender pay gap in each Member State through a multi-faceted approach addressing the underlying factors of the gender pay gap includ- ing sectoral and occupational segregation, education and training, job classifications and pay systems, awareness raising and transparency\u2019. This report addresses the gender pay gap. Data will be provided on the extent and the development of the gender pay gap for 25 EU Member States (EU-25). In addition, the report contains information from three EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and two candi- date countries (Bulgaria and Romania). In particular, the report focuses on how public policies try to reduce wage differences between women and men. Facts The gender pay gap refers to the differences between the wages earned by women and by men. In order to take into account differences in working hours and the impact of the income tax system, most estimates are based on differences in gross hourly wages. The gender pay gap is then calculated as the ratio of women\u2019s average gross hourly wage to men\u2019s average gross hourly wage, or as the difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s gross hourly wage as a percent- age of men\u2019s average gross hourly wage. Yet, esti- mates of the gender pay gap differ widely, depending on the data available, the specific sample, and the method used. As a consequence, there is wide varia- tion in results over time, between countries and even among studies for a particular country. Despite all variation, there are a few regularities, however. In comparison to a random sample of the total popula- tion, the gender pay gap is much lower if only a sam- ple of new entrants in the labour market is investigat- ed; the gender pay gap thus tends to widen with age. Secondly, the gender pay gap is smaller in the public sector and thirdly the pay gap is higher for married employees and significantly lower for singles. The data presented in this report are based on the Structure of Earnings Survey 2002 (SES). This survey is considered the most reliable source with respect to harmonised pay data. Unfortunately, however, the data cover only employees in the private sector (NACE C to K), excluding the public sector, healthcare and education. This might influence the extent of the gender pay gap in two ways: women tend to be over- represented in the public sector and the extent of the gender pay gap is smaller in the public sector com- pared with the private sector. On the basis of the SES data, it appears that, at the level of the EU-25, the gender pay gap is almost 25% (data for Malta, Iceland and Liechtenstein are missing). The largest gap is found in the United Kingdom (30%), the smallest in Slovenia (11%). Comparing the development of the gender pay gap over time is a complicated affair, pri- marily because of data problems. Yet, the gender pay gap at the level of the EU-25 seems to be fairly stable over the last decade. The variation is, however, large, with some countries showing a decrease and others an increase. Origins The gender pay gap is determined by several factors. Traditionally, within the context of human capital the- ory, differences in pay are explained by differences in individual characteristics like age, education and experience. Evidence suggests, however, that these differences only play a minor role in the persistence of the gender pay gap. The improved educational situa- tion and the increased female participation rate have diminished gender-specific differences in individual characteristics, although in some countries gender differences in experience still play a role. Instead, the gender pay gap seems more related to the level of occupational segregation and the wage structure. Women tend to work in different occupations and industries than men and are penalised because of that. The extent of the penalty may differ, though, depending on the wage structure; a more com- pressed wage structure is likely to diminish the gen- Executive summary 7 T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 7 ",
        "der pay gap. This implies that, in order to reduce the gender pay gap, not only differences in activity and employment rates need to be addressed, but also dif- ferences in the wage structure and differences in the remuneration between men and women. The current trend towards a more decentralised and individualised system should in this respect be assessed as a rather worrying development. As wages are increasingly set at local or company level, inter- firm and inter-industry wage differences may increase, thereby potentially increasing the gender pay gap. In addition, the rise of a variable and performance- based pay system may increase the overall wage dif- ference between men and women. In fact women seem to be swimming upstream: women with an improved educational background, fewer children and shorter periods of employment interruption are confronted with a labour market with growing wage differentials and a reduced share of collectively agreed wages and wage components. As a result, the differences in wages remain more or less the same. This conclusion emphasises the need for effective policies targeting both female labour market partici- pation as well as institutional factors like wage forma- tion systems and the overall wage inequality. Policy responses The European Member States indicate a rather diverse picture when it comes to tackling the gender pay gap. In quite a number of countries, the gender pay gap has little profile either in the public debate or on the policy agenda. In other countries, though, the persistence of the gender pay gap has initiated sever- al policy initiatives targeted towards closing the gen- der pay gap. Some policies refer to improving the effectiveness of equal pay legislation aiming at tack- ling direct or indirect gender wage discrimination. More effective equal pay policy may demand addi- tional legislation, for example the obligation on employers to justify pay differentials and to apply transparent and understandable systems of remuner- ation. Most countries are, however, rather reluctant to interfere in the wage-setting mechanism which is seen as the primary responsibility of social partners. The emphasis on deregulation and voluntary action by employers severely limits the support of an effective \u2018comparable worth strategy\u2019. Although the principle of equal pay for men and women applies to work of equal value, most countries refrain from audits of internal pay formation in order to identify discrimina- tory elements, or from introducing wide-ranging pay evaluation schemes that cross the boundaries set by companies and branches of industry. Other policies targeted towards closing the gender pay gap try to enhance equal opportunities and aim at more continuous employment patterns. Available and affordable childcare is seen as an import precon- dition in this respect. In only a few countries is child- care seen as a social right and offered at highly sub- sidised prices. In other countries, public subsidies are limited and childcare services are only supplied through the private market at high prices; this no doubt affects the earning capacity of women nega- tively. Improving leave arrangements is another important part of equal opportunities policy. In order to improve the relative earnings of women it should be taken into account, though, that the leave should not be too long and should be equally divided between men and women. An equal division implies in any case that the leave should be paid, whereas reserving weeks for the father might also be extreme- ly helpful. Another element of equal opportunities policy would be to encourage young girls to consider a wider range of occupational options. Breaking down occupational rigidities is important and may be part of the answer to the problem of unequal pay. Yet, remedies for the gender pay gap that promote a change in occupational choices leave unspecified who will take the important and growing jobs in the care and services sector. Too much emphasis on de-segre- gation without changing the wage structure may also leave room for a new segregation based on ethnic lines. In that respect, reassessing the relative wage of female-dominated jobs might be a more appropriate strategy. A third lever refers to wage policies aimed at redu- cing wage inequality and improving the remuneration of low and/or female-dominated jobs. Actual policy initiatives in this respect vary from a general policy towards increasing the level of the minimum wage to a re-evaluation of low-paid jobs. The actual policy mix may depend on national particularities and the pre- vailing analysis of the origins of the gender pay gap. The emphasis on deregulation and voluntary action by employers may restrict national policy options in some countries, especially with regard to wages. In these circumstances social partners (especially trade unions) may take over and actively campaign for a more gender equal wage structure.

        "Best practices Taking into account the different socioeconomic backgrounds, the national reports present a broad range of innovative policy initiatives that may be gathered under the heading \u2018best practices\u2019. The availability of relevant information is an important starting point when tackling the gender pay gap. Therefore, the dissemination of information among relevant actors such as employers and employees is an important tool to raise awareness of the extent and seriousness of the problem. Actual policy in this respect varies from initiating a study, to the organisa- tion of a national Equal Pay Day and the introduction of legislative measures with respect to gathering data at the company level. In addition, social partners are important allies when tackling the gender pay gap. As the national reports show, social partners seem increasingly willing to take action to reduce the gender pay gap, especially with respect to providing information and awareness raising. The establishment of gender-specific institutions is another important step to support the implementa- tion of equal pay legislation. Initiatives in this respect refer to setting up an office for equal treatment, or improving the institutional mechanism for gender mainstreaming. In addition, some countries report the creation of equal pay task forces, with the main task to mobilise all relevant actors in the field of equal pay and to vitalise the debate on equal pay. Another line of policy initiatives is directed towards a more integrated system of wage setting. According to EU legislation, men and women should be paid equally for equal work or for work of equal value. In order to determine the value of a job, job evaluation systems are often used, which, however, may be (in)directly discriminatory against women. It is there- fore important that a critical assessment of system- specific characteristics and criteria is made. In several countries, policy initiatives are aimed at the develop- ment and application of gender-neutral systems of job evaluation (comparable worth strategy). In addi- tion, some national reports provide good practices with respect to wage setting at the sectoral or com- pany level. Finally best practices refer to legal measures. As described above, the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value is part of EU legislation and all countries have included this principle in their national legislation. Countries may take additional legal measures to improve the effectives of the equal pay legislation. Best practices in this respect refer to the obligation posed on employers to bargain on equal pay, and \u2018gender duty\u2019 on public authorities, in order to promote equal opportunities between men and women. Summarising the current state of affairs, it appears that most best practices refer to the availability and dissemination of information. That is: the best prac- tices refer to actions undertaken to disseminate knowledge and raise awareness of the extent and seriousness of the problem. This is an important first step, yet still a long way from presenting actual solu- tions. Only a few countries provide examples of more offensive strategies like legal measures enforcing equal pay or policies directed towards strengthening the infrastructure. Conclusions The persistence of the gender pay gap, its low profile in a considerable number of European countries and the rather cautious attitude that is implied in the best practices emphasise the need for an effective policy framework at the level of the European Union. Setting targets might be helpful in this respect. As part of the European employment strategy in 2003, the Member States were called on to formulate targets to achieve a substantial reduction of the gender pay gap in 2010. In 2005, however, the EES has been revised with more emphasis on integrating employment policies with macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in order to maximise the synergies and to increase their effi- ciency. In the new set-up, the reduction of the gender pay gap is no longer formulated as a special target but included in two general guidelines. Moreover an explicit time frame is not stated. As a result, the atten- tion on the gender pay gap seems to be lost in other employment issues. In order to increase the profile of the gender pay gap at the national level, it seems essential to formulate concrete objectives and timeta- bles on the closing of the gender pay gap at the Euro- pean level. Depending on the national situation these objectives should be implemented in the individual countries along the lines of the open method of coor- dination.

        "Einf\u00fchrung Die Reduzierung des Einkommensunterschieds zwi- schen den Geschlechtern (Gender Pay Gap) ist ein wichtiges Thema in der europ\u00e4ischen Politik. Seit 1999 ist dieses Thema Teil der europ\u00e4ischen Besch\u00e4f- tigungsstrategie, und die politischen Ma\u00dfnahmen wurden im Laufe der Jahre intensiviert. Im Jahr 2003 wurden die Mitgliedstaaten aufgefordert, dies- bez\u00fcglich Ziele zu formulieren, \u201eum bis 2010 eine wesentliche Reduzierung des Einkommensunter- schieds zwischen den Geschlechtern in jedem Mit- gliedstaat durch eine vielschichtige Vorgehensweise zu erreichen, bei der die zugrunde liegenden Fak- toren des Gender Pay Gap, darunter die sektorale und berufliche Segregation, Ausbildung und Fortbil- dung, Arbeitsplatzbewertungen und Lohnsysteme, Sensibilisierung der \u00d6ffentlichkeit und Transparenz ber\u00fccksichtigt werden\u201c. Der vorliegende Bericht befasst sich mit dem Einkommensunterschied zwis- chen den Geschlechtern. Er enth\u00e4lt Daten \u00fcber das Ausma\u00df und die Entwicklung des Gender Pay Gap in den 25 EU-Mitgliedstaaten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus enth\u00e4lt er Informationen aus drei EWR-L\u00e4ndern (Island, Liech- tenstein und Norwegen) und aus zwei Bewerberl\u00e4n- dern (Bulgarien und Rum\u00e4nien). Insbesondere konzentriert sich der Bericht darauf, wie die \u00f6ffentliche Politik versucht, Einkommensunterschiede zwischen Frauen und M\u00e4nnern zu reduzieren. Fakten Der Gender Pay Gap bezieht sich auf die Einkommens- unterschiede zwischen Frauen und M\u00e4nnern. Um arbeitszeitbedingte Unterschiede und die Auswirkun- gen des Einkommensteuersystems zu ber\u00fccksichti- gen, basieren die meisten Sch\u00e4tzungen auf den Unterschieden beim Bruttostundenlohn. Der Gender Pay Gap wird dann als das Verh\u00e4ltnis des durch- schnittlichen Bruttostundenlohns von Frauen zum durch- schnittlichen Bruttostundenlohn von M\u00e4nnern bzw. als der Unterschied zwischen dem Bruttostundenlohn von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern als Prozentsatz des durch- schnittlichen Bruttostundenlohns von M\u00e4nnern berechnet. Dennoch weichen die Sch\u00e4tzungen des Gender Pay Gap abh\u00e4ngig von den verf\u00fcgbaren Daten, der ausgew\u00e4hlten Personengruppe und der verwendeten Methode stark voneinander ab. Daher gibt es je nach Zeitpunkt, Land und sogar je nach Studie f\u00fcr ein bestimmtes Land oft v\u00f6llig unter- schiedliche Ergebnisse. Trotz aller Abweichungen sind jedoch bestimmte Regelm\u00e4\u00dfigkeiten festzustellen. Im Vergleich zu einer zuf\u00e4llig ausgew\u00e4hlten Gruppe der Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung ist der Einkommensunterschied zwischen den Geschlechtern viel niedriger, wenn nur die Gruppe der Berufsanf\u00e4nger untersucht wird, w\u00e4hrend der Gender Pay Gap mit dem Alter tenden- ziell zunimmt. Zweitens ist der Gender Pay Gap im \u00f6ffentlichen Dienst geringer und drittens ist er bei verheirateten Arbeitnehmern h\u00f6her und bei ledigen Arbeitnehmern deutlich niedriger. Die Daten in diesem Bericht basieren auf der \u201eVer- dienststrukturerhebung 2002\u201c, Structure of Earnings Survey 2002 (SES). Diese Erhebung gilt als die ver- l\u00e4sslichste Quelle f\u00fcr harmonisierte Daten in Bezug auf L\u00f6hne und Geh\u00e4lter. Leider beziehen sich die Daten jedoch nur auf Arbeitnehmer in der Pri- vatwirtschaft (NACE C bis K) ohne die Bereiche Gesundheitswesen und Bildung. Dies k\u00f6nnte sich auf das Ausma\u00df des Gender Pay Gap auf zwei Arten auswirken: Frauen sind im \u00f6ffentlichen Dienst nor- malerweise \u00fcberrepr\u00e4sentiert, und das Ausma\u00df des Gender Pay Gap ist im \u00f6ffentlichen Dienst im Ver- gleich zur Privatwirtschaft geringer. Auf der Grundlage der SES-Daten scheint es, dass der Gender Pay Gap auf der EU-25-Ebene fast 25% betr\u00e4gt (die Daten f\u00fcr Malta, Island und Liechtenstein fehlen). Die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Differenz ist im Vereinigten K\u00f6nigreich festzustellen (30%) und die kleinste in Slowenien (11%). Der Vergle- ich der Entwicklung des Gender Pay Gap im Laufe der Zeit ist haupts\u00e4chlich aufgrund von Datenproblemen eine komplizierte Angelegenheit. Dennoch scheint der Gender Pay Gap auf der Ebene der EU-25 in den letzten zehn Jahren ziemlich stabil zu sein. Es gibt jedoch gro\u00dfe Abweichungen. So ist in einigen L\u00e4n- dern ein R\u00fcckgang und in anderen L\u00e4ndern ein Anstieg zu verzeichnen. Urspr\u00fcnge Der Gender Pay Gap wird von mehreren Faktoren bestimmt. Traditionell, im Kontext der Humankapi- taltheorie, werden Unterschiede bei L\u00f6hnen und 11 Zusammenfassung T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 11 ",
        "Geh\u00e4ltern durch Unterschiede bei individuellen Merk- malen wie Alter, Ausbildung und Berufserfahrung er- kl\u00e4rt. Es ist jedoch erwiesen, dass diese Unterschiede in Bezug auf das Fortbestehen des Gender Pay Gap nur eine geringe Rolle spielen. Die verbesserte Aus- bildungssituation und die gestiegene Erwerbs- t\u00e4tigkeit von Frauen haben geschlechtsspezifische Unterschiede bei individuellen Merkmalen verringert, obwohl geschlechtsspezifische Unterschiede bei der Berufserfahrung in einigen L\u00e4ndern immer noch eine Rolle spielen. Stattdessen scheint der Gender Pay Gap mehr mit dem Grad der beruflichen Segregation und der Lohnstruktur zusammenzuh\u00e4ngen. Frauen arbeiten oft in anderen Berufen und Branchen als M\u00e4nner und werden daf\u00fcr benachteiligt. Das Ausma\u00df der Benachteiligung kann unterschiedlich sein, obwohl abh\u00e4ngig von der Lohnstruktur eine kompri- miertere Lohnstruktur den Gender Pay Gap eher ver- ringert. Das bedeutet, dass zur Reduzierung des Gen- der Pay Gap nicht nur Unterschiede bei den Erwerbs- und Besch\u00e4ftigungsquoten ber\u00fccksichtigt werden m\u00fcssen, sondern auch Unterschiede bei der Lohn- struktur und Unterschiede in der Verg\u00fctung von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern. Der aktuelle Trend zu einem dezentralisierten und individualisierten System sollte in diesem Zusammen- hang als eine eher Besorgnis erregende Entwicklung beurteilt werden. Da die L\u00f6hne zunehmend auf lokaler oder Unternehmensebene festgesetzt wer- den, k\u00f6nnten Lohnunterschiede zwischen Unternehmen oder Branchen zunehmen und dadurch m\u00f6glicherweise den Gender Pay Gap vergr\u00f6\u00dfern. Dar\u00fcber hinaus k\u00f6nnte die zunehmende Anwendung eines variablen und leistungsabh\u00e4ngigen Lohnsys- tems den Gesamtunterschied zwischen den L\u00f6hnen von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern vergr\u00f6\u00dfern. Frauen scheinen n\u00e4mlich gegen den Strom zu schwimmen: Frauen mit einem besseren Bildungshintergrund, weniger Kindern und k\u00fcrzeren beruflichen Auszeiten sind mit einem Arbeitsmarkt mit zunehmenden Lohn- differenzen und weniger tariflich festgelegten L\u00f6hnen und Lohnbestandteilen konfrontiert. Als Folge dessen bleiben die Unterschiede bei den L\u00f6hnen mehr oder weniger gleich. Diese Schlussfolgerung zeigt, wie wichtig effektive politische Ma\u00dfnahmen sind, die sowohl die Beteiligung von Frauen am Arbeitsmarkt als auch institutionelle Faktoren wie Lohnbildungssys- teme und die allgemeine Ungleichheit bei den L\u00f6h- nen zum Gegenstand haben. Reaktionen der Politik Die europ\u00e4ischen Mitgliedstaaten gehen ganz unter- schiedlich vor, wenn es darum geht, den Gender Pay Gap in den Griff zu bekommen. In einer ganzen Reihe von L\u00e4ndern hat der Gender Pay Gap nur einen gerin- gen Stellenwert, sei es in den \u00f6ffentlichen Debatten oder auf der politischen Agenda. In anderen L\u00e4ndern hat jedoch das Fortbestehen des Gender Pay Gap mehrere politische Initiativen ins Leben gerufen, deren Ziel die Aufhebung des Einkommensunterschieds zwi- schen den Geschlechtern ist. Einige politische Ma\u00dfnah- men beziehen sich auf die Verbesserung der Effektivit\u00e4t der Rechtsvorschriften \u00fcber die Anwendung des Grundsatzes des gleichen Entgelts f\u00fcr M\u00e4nner und Frauen mit dem Ziel, direkte oder indirekte geschlechtsspezifische Lohndiskriminierungen zu bek\u00e4mpfen. F\u00fcr eine effektivere Politik zur Anwendung des Grundsatzes des gleichen Entgelts f\u00fcr M\u00e4nner und Frauen sind m\u00f6glicherweise zus\u00e4tzliche Rechtsvorschriften erforderlich, zum Beispiel die Verpflichtung der Arbeitgeber, Lohnunterschiede zu rechtfertigen und transparente und verst\u00e4ndliche Verg\u00fctungssysteme anzuwenden. Die meisten L\u00e4nder str\u00e4uben sich jedoch dagegen, in den Lohnfestset- zungsmechanismus einzugreifen, der als die Hauptver- antwortung der Sozialpartner angesehen wird. Indem der Schwerpunkt auf Deregulierung und freiwillige Ma\u00dfnahmen seitens der Arbeitgeber gelegt wird, wird die Entwicklung einer effektiven Strategie zur F\u00f6rderung von Entgeltgleichheit von Frauen und M\u00e4n- nern erheblich eingeschr\u00e4nkt. Obwohl der Grundsatz des gleichen Entgelts f\u00fcr M\u00e4nner und Frauen f\u00fcr gleich- wertige Arbeit gilt, weigern sich die meisten L\u00e4nder, die interne Lohnbildung zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, um diskri- minierende Elemente zu identifizieren, oder weitre- ichende Lohnbewertungssysteme einzuf\u00fchren, die \u00fcber Unternehmens- und Branchengrenzen hinausgehen. Andere politische Ma\u00dfnahmen, deren Ziel die Schlie\u00dfung des Gender Pay Gap ist, versuchen die Chancengleichheit zu verbessern und streben eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Kontinuit\u00e4t der Besch\u00e4ftigungsmuster an. Das Angebot einer erschwinglichen Kinderbetreuung gilt hierf\u00fcr als eine wichtige Voraussetzung. Nur in wenigen L\u00e4ndern wird Kinderbetreuung als soziales Recht angesehen und zu stark subventionierten Preisen angeboten. In anderen L\u00e4ndern sind die staatlichen Subventionen beschr\u00e4nkt, und Kinderbe- Zusammenfassung 12 T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 12 ",
        "treuungsleistungen werden nur auf dem privaten Markt zu hohen Preisen angeboten. Dies wirkt sich zweifellos negativ auf die Verdienstm\u00f6glichkeiten von Frauen aus. Die Verbesserung der Regelungen betref- fend Mutterschutz, Elternzeit und Erziehungsurlaub ist ein weiterer wichtiger Bestandteil der Politik zur F\u00f6rderung der Chancengleichheit. Um die relativen Einkommen von Frauen zu verbessern, sollte jedoch ber\u00fccksichtigt werden, dass die Erwerbsunter- brechung nicht zu lange dauern und zwischen M\u00e4n- nern und Frauen gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig verteilt sein sollte. Eine gleichm\u00e4\u00dfige Verteilung setzt auf jeden Fall voraus, dass die Auszeit bezahlt sein sollte, wobei es auch sehr hilfreich sein k\u00f6nnte, einige Wochen f\u00fcr den Vater vorzusehen. Ein weiteres Element der Politik zur F\u00f6rderung der Chancengleichheit w\u00e4re, junge M\u00e4d- chen dazu zu ermutigen, ein breiteres Spektrum beruf- licher Optionen in Betracht zu ziehen. Die Aufl\u00f6sung starrer beruflicher Muster ist wichtig und kann ein Teil der L\u00f6sung des Problems der ungleichen Entlohnung sein. Allerdings lassen L\u00f6sungsvorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr die Bek\u00e4mpfung des Gender Pay Gap, die eine \u00c4nderung der Berufswahl von M\u00e4nnern und Frauen bef\u00fcr- worten, offen, wer die wichtigen und immer mehr werdenden Stellen im Pflege- und Dienstleistungssek- tor besetzen wird. Wenn der Schwerpunkt zu sehr auf die Aufhebung der Geschlechtertrennung gelegt wird, ohne die Lohnstruktur zu \u00e4ndern, k\u00f6nnte dies auch zu einer erneuten Segregation auf der Grund- lage ethnischer Unterschiede f\u00fchren. In dieser Hin- sicht k\u00f6nnte eine Neubewertung des relativen Einkommens bei Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen, die von Frauen dominiert sind, eine angemessenere Strategie sein. Eine dritte Strategie besteht in einer Lohnpolitik, deren Ziel es ist, die Ungleichheit bei den L\u00f6hnen zu reduzieren und die Bezahlung bei Niedriglohnarbeits- pl\u00e4tzen oder von Frauen dominierten Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen zu verbessern. Die gegenw\u00e4rtigen politischen Initia- tiven in diesem Bereich reichen von einer allgemeinen Politik zur Erh\u00f6hung der Mindestl\u00f6hne bis zu einer Neubewertung von Niedriglohnarbeitspl\u00e4tzen. Der tats\u00e4chliche Politikmix kann von den nationalen Besonderheiten und der ma\u00dfgebenden Analyse der Urspr\u00fcnge des Gender Pay Gap abh\u00e4ngen. Indem der Schwerpunkt auf Deregulierung und freiwillige Ma\u00dfnahmen seitens der Arbeitgeber gelegt wird, k\u00f6nnen die M\u00f6glichkeiten der nationalen Politik in einigen L\u00e4ndern, insbesondere in Bezug auf die L\u00f6hne, eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden. Unter diesen Umst\u00e4n- den sollten die Sozialpartner (insbesondere Ge- werkschaften) das Ruder \u00fcbernehmen und sich aktiv f\u00fcr eine Lohnstruktur, bei der mehr auf die Gleichstellung von M\u00e4nnern und Frauen geachtet wird, einsetzen. Beste Praktiken Ber\u00fccksichtigt man die verschiedenen sozio- \u00f6konomischen Hintergr\u00fcnde, enthalten die nationalen Berichte ein breites Spektrum an innovativen politi- schen Initiativen, die unter der \u00dcberschrift \u201ebeste Praktiken\u201c zusammengefasst werden k\u00f6nnen. Die Verf\u00fcgbarkeit relevanter Informationen ist ein wichtiger Ausgangspunkt f\u00fcr die Bek\u00e4mpfung des Gender Pay Gap. Deshalb ist die Verbreitung der Informationen unter den beteiligten Akteuren wie Arbeitgebern und Arbeitnehmern eine wichtige Voraussetzung, um das Bewusstsein f\u00fcr das Ausma\u00df und die Tragweite des Problems zu sch\u00e4rfen. Die gegenw\u00e4rtige Politik in diesem Bereich reicht von der Initiierung einer Studie \u00fcber die Organisation eines nationalen \u201eEqual Pay Day\u201c bis zur Einf\u00fchrung gesetzlicher Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Erhebung von Daten auf Unternehmensebene. Dar\u00fcber hinaus sind die Sozialpartner wichtige Verb\u00fcndete bei der Bek\u00e4mp- fung des Gender Pay Gap. Wie aus den nationalen Berichten hervorgeht, scheinen die Sozialpartner zunehmend bereit zu sein, Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Reduzierung des Gender Pay Gap zu ergreifen, ins- besondere wenn es um die Bereitstellung von Infor- mationen und um Sensibilisierungskampagnen geht. Die Errichtung geschlechterspezifischer Institutionen ist ein weiterer wichtiger Schritt auf dem Weg der F\u00f6rderung der Einf\u00fchrung von Rechtsvorschriften \u00fcber die Anwendung des Grundsatzes des gleichen Entgelts f\u00fcr M\u00e4nner und Frauen. Diesbez\u00fcgliche Ini- tiativen haben die Einrichtung einer Gleichbehand- lungsstelle oder die Verbesserung des institu- tionellen Mechanismus f\u00fcr die Gleichstellung von Mann und Frau (Gender-Mainstreaming) zum Gegen- stand. Zus\u00e4tzlich berichten einige L\u00e4nder \u00fcber den Einsatz von Arbeitsgruppen f\u00fcr Entgeltgleichheit von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern, deren Hauptaufgabe es ist, alle beteiligten Akteure im Bereich der gleichen Entloh- nung von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern zu mobilisieren und die Debatte \u00fcber Entgeltgleichheit von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern zu beleben. 13 The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 13 ",
        "Eine andere Richtung politischer Initiativen strebt ein integrierteres Lohnfestsetzungssystem an. Gem\u00e4\u00df den Rechtsvorschriften der EU sollten M\u00e4nner und Frauen f\u00fcr gleiche oder gleichwertige Arbeit gleich bezahlt werden. Um den Wert eines Arbeitsplatzes zu ermitteln, werden oft Arbeitsplatzbewertungssys- teme benutzt, die jedoch (in)direkt Frauen diskrimi- nieren k\u00f6nnen. Daher ist es wichtig, die systemspezi- fischen Merkmale und Kriterien kritisch zu beurteilen. In mehreren L\u00e4ndern zielen politische Ini- tiativen auf die Entwicklung und Anwendung von geschlechtsneutralen Systemen der Arbeitsplatzbe- wertung (Strategie zur F\u00f6rderung von Entgeltgleich- heit von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern) ab. Dar\u00fcber hinaus enthalten einige nationale Berichte gute Praktiken f\u00fcr die Lohnfestsetzung auf Sektor- oder Unterneh- mensebene. Schlie\u00dflich beziehen sich die besten Praktiken auf rechtliche Ma\u00dfnahmen. Wie oben beschrieben ist der Grundsatz der gleichen Bezahlung f\u00fcr gleiche oder gleichwertige Arbeit Teil der Rechtsvorschriften der EU, und alle L\u00e4nder haben diesen Grundsatz in ihre nationalen Rechtsvorschriften aufgenommen. Die L\u00e4nder k\u00f6nnen zus\u00e4tzliche rechtliche Ma\u00dfnah- men ergreifen, um die Effektivit\u00e4t der Rechtsvorschriften \u00fcber die Anwendung des Grund- satzes des gleichen Entgelts f\u00fcr M\u00e4nner und Frauen zu verbessern. Die diesbez\u00fcglichen besten Praktiken beziehen sich auf die den Arbeitgebern auferlegte Verpflichtung, \u00fcber Entgeltgleichheit von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern zu verhandeln und die den staatlichen Beh\u00f6rden auferlegte Verpflichtung zur Gleichbe- handlung der Geschlechter, um die Chancengleich- heit zwischen M\u00e4nnern und Frauen zu f\u00f6rdern. Fasst man die aktuelle Lage zusammen, scheint es, dass sich die meisten besten Praktiken auf die Ver- f\u00fcgbarkeit und Verbreitung von Informationen beziehen. Das bedeutet, dass sich die besten Prak- tiken auf Ma\u00dfnahmen beziehen, die ergriffen wer- den, um Wissen zu verbreiten und das Bewusstsein f\u00fcr das Ausma\u00df und die Tragweite des Problems zu sch\u00e4rfen. Obwohl dies ein wichtiger erster Schritt ist, liegen tats\u00e4chliche L\u00f6sungsvorschl\u00e4ge noch in weiter Ferne. Nur wenige L\u00e4nder geben Beispiele f\u00fcr offen- sivere Strategien wie rechtliche Ma\u00dfnahmen, die die Entgeltgleichheit von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern durchset- zen, oder politische Ma\u00dfnahmen, die auf die St\u00e4rkung der Infrastruktur ausgerichtet sind. Schlussfolgerungen Das Fortbestehen des Gender Pay Gap, sein geringer Stellenwert in vielen europ\u00e4ischen L\u00e4ndern und die eher vorsichtige Haltung, die in den besten Praktiken deutlich wird, zeigen, wie wichtig effektive politische Rahmenbedingungen auf der Ebene der Europ\u00e4i- schen Union sind. Hierbei k\u00f6nnten konkrete Zielset- zungen hilfreich sein. Im Rahmen der europ\u00e4ischen Besch\u00e4ftigungsstrategie 2003 wurden die Mitglied- staaten aufgefordert, Ziele zu formulieren, um eine wesentliche Reduzierung des Gender Pay Gap bis zum Jahr 2010 zu erreichen. In 2005 wurde die europ\u00e4ische Besch\u00e4ftigungsstrategie jedoch \u00fcberar- beitet. Dabei wurde der Vernetzung der Besch\u00e4fti- gungspolitiken mit makro\u00f6konomischen und mikro\u00f6konomischen Politiken mehr Bedeutung beigemessen, um die Synergien zu maximieren und ihre Effizienz zu steigern. In der neuen Fassung ist die Reduzierung des Gender Pay Gap nicht mehr als eigenes Ziel formuliert, sondern in zwei allgemeinen Leitlinien enthalten. Au\u00dferdem ist kein genauer Zeitrahmen angegeben. Daher scheint die Aufmerk- samkeit f\u00fcr den Gender Pay Gap angesichts anderer Besch\u00e4ftigungsprobleme in den Hintergrund getreten zu sein. Um den Stellenwert des Gender Pay Gap auf nationaler Ebene zu erh\u00f6hen, scheint es wesentlich, konkrete Ziele und Zeitrahmen f\u00fcr die Schlie\u00dfung des Gender Pay Gap auf europ\u00e4ischer Ebene zu for- mulieren. Abh\u00e4ngig von der nationalen Situation soll- ten diese Ziele in den einzelnen L\u00e4ndern entsprechend einer offenen Koordinierungsmethode umgesetzt werden. 14 Zusammenfassung T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 14 ",
        "Introduction La r\u00e9duction des \u00e9carts salariaux entre les hommes et les femmes est un th\u00e8me important de l\u2019agenda poli- tique europ\u00e9en. Depuis 1999, il fait partie de la strat\u00e9gie europ\u00e9enne pour l\u2019emploi (SEE), et les efforts en termes d\u2019adoption de politiques se sont intensifi\u00e9s depuis lors. En 2003, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 aux pays membres de d\u00e9finir des objectifs dans ce domaine pour \u00abobtenir, d'ici \u00e0 2010, une r\u00e9duction significative, en vue de leur \u00e9limination, des \u00e9carts de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration entre les hommes et les femmes dans chaque \u00c9tat membre, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une approche diversi- fi\u00e9e des facteurs sous-jacents de l\u2019\u00e9cart de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ra- tion, notamment la segmentation sectorielle et pro- fessionnelle, l\u2019\u00e9ducation et la formation, la classifica- tion des emplois et les syst\u00e8mes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, la sensibilisation et la transparence\u00bb. Le pr\u00e9sent rapport porte sur les \u00e9carts salariaux entre les hommes et les femmes, tant du point de vue de leur ampleur que de celui de leur \u00e9volution. Outre les vingt-cinq \u00c9tats membres, le rapport inclut des infor- mations sur trois pays de l\u2019Espace \u00e9conomique europ\u00e9en (EEE) \u2014 l\u2019Islande, le Liechtenstein et la Norv\u00e8ge \u2014 et sur deux pays candidats \u2014 la Bulgarie et la Roumanie. Le rapport se concentre en particuli- er sur la mani\u00e8re dont les politiques gouvernemen- tales s\u2019efforcent de r\u00e9duire les \u00e9carts salariaux entre les hommes et les femmes. Les faits L\u2019\u00e9cart salarial de genre est constitu\u00e9 par la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire per\u00e7u par les femmes comparative- ment \u00e0 celui per\u00e7u par les hommes. Afin de tenir compte des diff\u00e9rences en termes de dur\u00e9e du travail et de l\u2019impact des syst\u00e8mes et bar\u00eames fiscaux, la plupart des estimations sont calcul\u00e9es \u00e0 partir du salaire horaire brut. L\u2019\u00e9cart salarial de genre exprim\u00e9 en pourcentage du salaire horaire brut masculin est \u00e9gal au rapport du salaire horaire brut f\u00e9minin sur le salaire masculin ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart entre le salaire horaire brut des femmes et celui des hommes. Les estima- tions sont cependant tr\u00e8s sensibles au type de don- n\u00e9es disponibles, \u00e0 la population repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans les donn\u00e9es et \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e. Cela peut se traduire par des variations consid\u00e9rables des r\u00e9sultats d\u2019une p\u00e9riode \u00e0 l\u2019autre, d\u2019un pays \u00e0 l\u2019autre, et m\u00eame, pour un pays donn\u00e9, selon les diff\u00e9rentes sources. On observe cependant certaines constantes. Par rapport \u00e0 un \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire de la population totale, l\u2019\u00e9- cart salarial de genre se resserre consid\u00e9rablement lorsque seuls sont pris en compte dans l\u2019\u00e9chantillon les nouveaux entrants sur le march\u00e9 du travail. Cet \u00e9cart tend donc \u00e0 se creuser avec l\u2019\u00e2ge. En outre, l\u2019\u00e9- cart salarial est inf\u00e9rieur dans le secteur public et il est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour les salari\u00e9s mari\u00e9s que pour les c\u00e9li- bataires. Les donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es dans ce rapport proviennent de l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la structure des salaires (ESS) de 2002, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la source la plus fiable en mati\u00e8re de donn\u00e9es harmonis\u00e9es sur les salaires. Mal- heureusement, seuls les salari\u00e9s du secteur priv\u00e9 (NACE C-K) sont couverts, excluant notamment les soins de sant\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Cela peut influer sur l\u2019\u00e9- tendue de l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial mesur\u00e9 pour deux raisons: les femmes ont tendance \u00e0 \u00eatre surrepr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le secteur public, et l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial y est moins pronon- c\u00e9 que dans le priv\u00e9. Sur la base des donn\u00e9es de l\u2019ESS, l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial de genre atteint presque 25% pour l\u2019EU-25 (il n\u2019y a pas de chiffres pour Malte, l\u2019Is- lande et le Liechtenstein). On enregistre le plus grand \u00e9cart au Royaume-Uni (30%) et le plus faible en Slov\u00e9nie (11%). Une comparaison de l\u2019\u00e9volution de ces \u00e9carts est difficile, compte tenu des donn\u00e9es disponibles. Il semble cependant que l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial au niveau de l\u2019Europe des vingt-cinq soit rest\u00e9 rela- tivement stable au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, mais les variations entre les pays sont importantes, certains ayant enregistr\u00e9 une baisse et d\u2019autres une augmentation. Origines de l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial De nombreux facteurs d\u00e9terminent les \u00e9carts salari- aux de genre. Dans le cadre de la th\u00e9orie du capital humain, on a eu tendance \u00e0 expliquer les \u00e9carts de r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations par les diff\u00e9rences de caract\u00e9ristiques individuelles telles que l\u2019\u00e2ge, le niveau de formation et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Les faits indiquent cependant que ces diff\u00e9rences n\u2019ont qu\u2019un faible impact sur le maintien de l\u2019\u00e9cart. Les progr\u00e8s enregistr\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de 15 R\u00e9sum\u00e9 T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 15 ",
        "niveau d\u2019\u00e9ducation et le taux d\u2019activit\u00e9 accru des femmes ont att\u00e9nu\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rences en termes de car- act\u00e9ristiques individuelles, bien que, dans certains \u00c9tats membres, les diff\u00e9rences en termes d\u2019exp\u00e9ri- ence sur le march\u00e9 du travail jouent toujours un r\u00f4le dans l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial. Par contre, ce dernier semble plus \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019importance de la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation professionnelle et \u00e0 la structure salariale. Les femmes exercent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u2019autres professions et travail- lent dans d\u2019autres secteurs que les hommes, ce qui les d\u00e9favorise. L\u2019importance de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment peut varier en fonction de la structure salariale: une distribution plus comprim\u00e9e tend \u00e0 r\u00e9duire l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial de genre. Cela signifie que, pour r\u00e9duire les \u00e9carts salari- aux, il faut s\u2019attaquer non seulement aux diff\u00e9rences en termes de taux de participation et d\u2019emploi, mais aussi aux diff\u00e9rences dans la distribution des salaires et dans les modes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Dans un tel contexte, la tendance \u00e0 une d\u00e9centralisa- tion et une individualisation accrue de la formation des salaires est inqui\u00e9tante. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les salaires sont de plus en plus fix\u00e9s au niveau local ou \u00e0 celui de l\u2019entreprise, les \u00e9carts interentreprises et intersectoriels peuvent se creuser, ce qui peut con- tribuer \u00e0 augmenter l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial. De plus, l\u2019ac- croissement des salaires variables et des syst\u00e8mes liant salaires et performance risque d\u2019accentuer l\u2019\u00e9- cart salarial. En fait, les femmes se retrouvent dans une situation contradictoire, alors que leur niveau d\u2019\u00e9- ducation s\u2019est sensiblement accru, que le nombre d\u2019enfants a diminu\u00e9 et que leurs interruptions de car- ri\u00e8re sont moins longues et moins fr\u00e9quentes; elles font face \u00e0 un march\u00e9 de l\u2019emploi caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 par des diff\u00e9rences salariales croissantes et un affaiblissement des conventions collectives. Au final, les \u00e9carts salari- aux de genre ont tendance \u00e0 se maintenir. Cela souligne la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de politiques et de mesures des- tin\u00e9es simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 accro\u00eetre la participation f\u00e9mi- nine au march\u00e9 du travail et \u00e0 jouer sur les facteurs institutionnels d\u00e9terminant la formation des salaires et influen\u00e7ant l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 salariale. Les politiques adopt\u00e9es Les \u00c9tats membres de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne (UE) dif- f\u00e8rent dans la mani\u00e8re dont ils abordent l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial de genre. Dans un certain nombre de pays, il est peu pr\u00e9sent dans le d\u00e9bat public et ne figure pas \u00e0 l\u2019agen- da politique. Dans d\u2019autres pays, en revanche, le main- tien de l\u2019\u00e9cart des salaires entre les sexes est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de plusieurs initiatives visant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9liminer. Certaines mesures pr\u00e9voient de rendre plus effective la l\u00e9gisla- tion relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9limination des discriminations sex- uelles directes ou indirectes en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ra- tion. Pour \u00eatre plus effectives, les politiques d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des salaires peuvent n\u00e9cessiter une l\u00e9gislation suppl\u00e9- mentaire, par exemple pour obliger les employeurs \u00e0 justifier toute diff\u00e9rence de salaire et \u00e0 appliquer des syst\u00e8mes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration transparents et coh\u00e9rents. Il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que la plupart des pays h\u00e9si- tent \u00e0 intervenir dans la fixation des salaires, consid- \u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant du ressort des interlocuteurs soci- aux. L\u2019accent mis sur la d\u00e9r\u00e9glementation et le volon- tarisme des employeurs en mati\u00e8re de fixation des salaires limite consid\u00e9rablement l\u2019impact potentiel de la strat\u00e9gie du salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur comparable. Bien que le principe de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des salaires entre les hommes et les femmes s\u2019applique pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale, la majorit\u00e9 des pays h\u00e9sitent \u00e0 pratiquer des audits des modes internes de formation des salaires, alors que ceux-ci permettraient de mettre en \u00e9vidence les pratiques discriminatoires, tout comme ils s\u2019abstiennent de mettre en place des mesures d\u2019\u00e9valuation des emplois d\u00e9passant les limites des entreprises et des branches. D\u2019autres mesures visent \u00e0 renforcer l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances et \u00e0 promouvoir des parcours d\u2019emploi plus continus. Dans ce contexte, la disponibilit\u00e9 de servic- es de garde d\u2019enfants \u00e0 un co\u00fbt acceptable est une condition sine qua non. Ce n\u2019est que dans quelques pays que la garde des enfants repr\u00e9sente un droit social et est fortement subventionn\u00e9e. Dans d\u2019autres pays, les subventions publiques sont limit\u00e9es et les services de garde sont priv\u00e9s et co\u00fbteux, ce qui a indubitablement un impact n\u00e9gatif sur leurs r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations moyennes. L\u2019am\u00e9lioration des sys- t\u00e8mes de cong\u00e9s et d\u2019interruption de carri\u00e8re est un autre aspect important d\u2019une politique d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances. Cependant, dans une optique d\u2019augmenta- tion du salaire relatif concernant les femmes, l\u2019inter- ruption d\u2019activit\u00e9 ne doit pas \u00eatre trop longue et devrait \u00eatre \u00e9quitablement partag\u00e9e entre les par- ents, ce qui implique en tout cas que le cong\u00e9 doit \u00eatre r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9. Par ailleurs, le fait de r\u00e9server un cer- tain nombre de semaines au p\u00e8re peut \u00e9galement y contribuer consid\u00e9rablement. Un autre aspect des politiques d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances serait d\u2019encourager les jeunes filles \u00e0 \u00e9largir leurs choix d\u2019orientation pro- fessionnelle. Il est important de faire tomber les bar- ri\u00e8res professionnelles, et cela pourrait r\u00e9soudre en partie le probl\u00e8me de l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 des salaires.

        "choix professionnels ne r\u00e9solvent pas la question de savoir qui occupera les nombreux emplois de services et de soins aux personnes qui sont en pleine expan- sion. Si l\u2019on met trop l\u2019accent sur la d\u00e9s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation sans modifier pour autant la structure salariale, on risque d\u2019aboutir \u00e0 une nouvelle forme de s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation, par exemple en fonction de l\u2019appartenance ethnique. Aussi, une strat\u00e9gie mieux appropri\u00e9e pourrait \u00eatre de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer le salaire relatif des emplois et des pro- fessions fortement f\u00e9minis\u00e9s. Les politiques salariales destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9duire l\u2019in\u00e9gal- it\u00e9 de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et \u00e0 augmenter les taux de salaire des emplois peu r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s et \u00e0 pr\u00e9domi- nance f\u00e9minine constituent un troisi\u00e8me levier. L\u2019\u00e9ventail des mesures possibles est large, partant de politiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales destin\u00e9es \u00e0 augmenter le salaire minimal et allant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la r\u00e9\u00e9valuation des emplois peu r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s. Les combinaisons de mesures peuvent varier selon les particularit\u00e9s nationales et selon l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9vaut pour expli- quer les origines de l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial. Les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019adoption de politiques nationales \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont cependant, pour certains pays, difficiles, du fait de l\u2019accent mis sur la d\u00e9r\u00e9gulation des march\u00e9s du tra- vail et sur les initiatives des employeurs en mati\u00e8re de formation des salaires. Dans ces conditions, c\u2019est aux partenaires sociaux (et en particulier les syndi- cats) d\u2019intervenir et de promouvoir activement une structure salariale plus \u00e9galitaire entre les hommes et les femmes. Meilleures pratiques Compte tenu des diff\u00e9rents contextes socio- \u00e9conomiques, les rapports nationaux pr\u00e9sentent une gamme importante d\u2019initiatives politiques novatrices que l\u2019on pourrait regrouper sous la rubrique des \u00abmeilleures pratiques\u00bb. La disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019informations pertinentes est un point de d\u00e9part important pour r\u00e9duire l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial. Par cons\u00e9quent, la diffusion de ces informations parmi les acteurs, tels que les employeurs et les salari\u00e9s, repr\u00e9sente un outil impor- tant pour sensibiliser l\u2019opinion par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019ampli- tude et \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me. Les politiques suiv- ies dans ce domaine vont du lancement d\u2019une \u00e9tude \u00e0 l\u2019organisation d\u2019une journ\u00e9e nationale sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des salaires et \u00e0 l\u2019introduction de mesures l\u00e9gislatives relatives \u00e0 la collecte de donn\u00e9es au niveau de l\u2019entre- prise. Par ailleurs, les partenaires sociaux sont des alli\u00e9s importants dans la promotion de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 salar- iale. Comme l\u2019indiquent les rapports nationaux, les partenaires sociaux semblent de plus en plus dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 agir pour r\u00e9duire l\u2019\u00e9cart des r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations entre les hommes et les femmes, notamment par la sensibilisa- tion au probl\u00e8me et la diss\u00e9mination de l\u2019information. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019institutions sp\u00e9cifiquement en charge des questions d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les hommes et les femmes constitue une autre \u00e9tape cl\u00e9 pour que la l\u00e9gislation relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 salariale soit effective- ment mise en vigueur. L\u2019instauration d\u2019un service pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement, le renforcement d\u2019un m\u00e9canisme institutionnel visant \u00e0 int\u00e9grer une per- spective d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les hommes et les femmes dans les politiques en sont des exemples. Certains pays font \u00e9tat de la mise en place de groupes de tra- vail sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances qui ont pour t\u00e2che de mobiliser tous les acteurs sur le terrain en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des salaires dans le but de relancer le d\u00e9bat \u00e0 ce sujet. Une autre approche vise \u00e0 introduire un syst\u00e8me de fixation des salaires plus int\u00e9gr\u00e9. Aux termes de la l\u00e9gislation europ\u00e9enne, les hommes et les femmes doivent percevoir un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale. Des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019\u00e9valuation du travail sont souvent utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer la valeur d\u2019une fonction, mais ces syst\u00e8mes peuvent \u00eatre directement ou indirectement discriminatoires pour les femmes. Il importe donc de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation critique des caract\u00e9ristiques et des crit\u00e8res du syst\u00e8me. Dans plusieurs pays, les initiatives prises ont pour objectif d\u2019\u00e9laborer et de mettre en place des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019\u00e9val- uation des fonctions (valeur comparable) non biais\u00e9s par rapport aux diff\u00e9rences entre les hommes et les femmes. Par ailleurs, certains rapports nationaux r\u00e9v\u00e8lent de bonnes pratiques en ce qui concerne la fixation des salaires au niveau sectoriel ou \u00e0 celui de l\u2019entreprise. Les meilleures pratiques font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la l\u00e9gisla- tion. Le principe de salaire \u00e9gal pour travail \u00e9gal ou de valeur \u00e9gale est inscrit dans la l\u00e9gislation de l\u2019UE, et tous les \u00c9tats membres l\u2019ont inclus dans leur l\u00e9gis- lation nationale. Des mesures l\u00e9gislatives suppl\u00e9men- taires peuvent \u00eatre prises au niveau national pour ren- dre l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations plus effective. Les meilleures pratiques dans ce domaine comprennent l\u2019obligation pour l\u2019employeur de n\u00e9gocier dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des salaires et le \u00abdevoir d\u2019int\u00e9gra- tion d'une perspective d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les hommes et les femmes\u00bb pour les pouvoirs publics afin de pro- mouvoir l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances entre les hommes et les femmes. 17 The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 17 ",
        "En bref, il semble donc que la plupart des meilleures pratiques sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 la disponibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la diffusion des informations, ce qui veut dire que les meilleures pratiques se rapportent aux actions men\u00e9es pour dis- s\u00e9miner les connaissances et faire prendre con- science de l\u2019ampleur et de la gravit\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape importante, mais l\u2019on est encore loin des solutions r\u00e9elles. Ce n\u2019est que dans quelques pays que l\u2019on observe des strat\u00e9gies plus directes, comme des mesures l\u00e9gislatives imposant l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 salariale ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 renforcer l\u2019infrastructure en place. Conclusions Le maintien de l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial de genre, sa faible visi- bilit\u00e9 dans un grand nombre de pays europ\u00e9ens et la prudence qui caract\u00e9rise encore les meilleures pra- tiques soulignent combien un cadre politique effectif est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. Il pourrait s\u2019av\u00e9rer utile de fixer des objectifs. Dans le cadre de la strat\u00e9gie europ\u00e9enne pour l\u2019emploi en 2003, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats membres de for- muler des objectifs afin d\u2019aboutir \u00e0 une r\u00e9duction sig- nificative de l\u2019\u00e9cart salarial entre les hommes et les femmes en 2010. Cependant, en 2005, la SEE a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9e pour insister sur l\u2019int\u00e9gration des politiques d\u2019emploi dans les politiques macro- et micro\u00e9- conomiques, afin de maximiser les synergies et de renforcer leurs effets. Dans ce nouveau contexte, la r\u00e9duction des disparit\u00e9s salariales entre les hommes et les femmes ne figure plus comme un objectif parti- culier, mais est incluse dans deux orientations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales. Par ailleurs, un calendrier sp\u00e9cifique n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Il en r\u00e9sulte que l\u2019importance donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart entre les hommes et les femmes se confond avec l\u2019attention port\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres questions dans le domaine de l\u2019emploi. Pour rendre plus visible l\u2019\u00e9cart des salaires entre les hommes et les femmes au niveau national, il est imp\u00e9ratif de formuler des objec- tifs et d\u2019\u00e9tablir des calendriers pr\u00e9cis pour la r\u00e9duc- tion de cet \u00e9cart en Europe. Suivant la conjoncture nationale, ces objectifs devront \u00eatre mis en place dans les \u00c9tats membres suivant la m\u00e9thode de coordina- tion ouverte.

        "Reducing the gender pay gap is an important topic on the European political agenda. Since 1999 it has been part of the European employ- ment strategy and policy efforts have intensi- fied over the years. In 2003, Member States were called on to formulate targets in this respect in order \u2018to achieve by 2010 a substan- tial reduction in the gender pay gap in each Member State through a multi-faceted approach addressing the underlying factors of the gender pay gap including sectoral and occupational segregation, education and train- ing, job classifications and pay systems, aware- ness raising and transparency\u2019 (Council Deci- sion 2003 L197/20). Eliminating the gender pay gap is also an important objective of the recently published \u2018Roadmap for equality between women and men, 2006\u201310\u2019 (EC 2006). The persistence of the gender pay gap, accord- ing to the roadmap, results from direct discrim- ination against women and structural inequali- ties, such as segregation in sectors, occupa- tions and work patterns, access to education and training, biased evaluation and pay sys- tems, and stereotypes. In addition, European social partners, as organ- ised in the Union of Industrial and Employers\u2019 Confederations of Europe (UNICE)/European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME), the European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation and of Enterprises of General Economic Interest (CEEP) and the European Trade Union Confed- eration (ETUC), agreed in March 2005 to reduce the gender pay gap within their \u2018Framework of actions on gender equality\u2019. It is emphasised \u2018that it is very important to better understand the numerous and complex factors explaining wage differences between women and men and take action accordingly\u2019. Joint commitment is seen as essential. In addition, three elements are seen as key to tackle the gender pay gap: providing information on le- gislation and giving guidance on how to help close the gender pay gap at different levels; developing up-to-date statistics and promoting the availability of gender-specific information at the appropriate levels; and, finally, ensuring that pay systems are transparent and gender neutral and paying attention to the possible discrimina- tory effects of secondary elements of pay. This report addresses the gender pay gap. Data will be provided on the extent and the development of the gender pay gap for 25 EU Member States (EU-25). In addition, the report contains information from three EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and two candidate countries (Bulgaria and Romania). In particular, the report focuses on how public policies contribute to reduce (or aggravate) wage differences between women and men. As such the report provides an update and an extension of the reports provided by the Expert Group on Gender and Employment under the auspices of the European Commis- sion. In 2001, a report on the indicators used to monitor gender equality included a chapter on the pay gap and analysed the statistical data available at the European level (Barry et al. 2001). In 2002, an extended report analysed what factors influence differences in pay across the EU in the context of the debate around the adjusted or unadjusted indicator of the pay gap (see Rubery et al. 2002 for the synthesis report on the EU-15). The structure of this report is as follows. Chap- ter 2 provides some facts and figures on the extent and development of the gender pay gap. Chapter 3 deals with the causes. The gen- der pay gap reflects the different status of men and women in the world of paid work, which may relate to differences in age, education, patterns of employment, undervaluation and discrimination. Chapter 4 concentrates on pol- icy responses; several initiatives have been taken to improve the labour market position of women and to diminish wage differentials. Chapter 5 presents information on good prac- tices, while Chapter 6 presents the conclusions. 1. Introduction 19 T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 19 ",

        "The gender pay gap The gender pay gap refers to the difference between the wages earned by women and by men. In order to take into account differences in working hours and the impact of the income tax system, most estimates are based on differ- ences in gross hourly wages. The most com- mon method is to calculate the gender pay gap as the ratio of women\u2019s average gross hourly wage to men\u2019s average gross hourly wage, or as the difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s gross hourly wage as a percentage of men\u2019s average gross hourly wage. In this case, the gender pay gap indicates how many percent- age points the earnings of men have to decrease in order to be equal to those of women. Another method is to use the earnings of women as a reference point. In that case, the gender pay gap indicates how many percent- age points the earnings of women have to increase in order to be equal to those of men (Einarsd\u00f3ttir and Bl\u00f6ndal 2004, cited in M\u00f3ses- d\u00f3ttir et al. 2006: 90). From a policy point of view, this definition seems to be more correct. Yet, as the EU indicators for monitoring the employment guidelines take the earnings of men as point of reference, the gender pay gap in this report is also calculated as the difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s average gross hourly wage as a percentage of men\u2019s average gross hourly wage. Quite apart from differences in definition, esti- mates of the gender pay gap differ widely, depending on the data available, the specific sample, the method used, etc. The same coun- try may have a relatively wide, average or even narrow gender pay gap depending on the data source used (Barry et al. 2001: 86). As a conse- quence, there is wide variation in results over time, between countries and even among stud- ies for a particular country (Rubery et al. 2002: 55\u201360). Yet, despite all variation, there are a few regularities (Barry et al. 2001; Wechsel- baumer and Winter-Ebner 2005; M\u00f3sesd\u00f3ttir 2003, 2006). In comparison to a random sam- ple of the population, the gender pay gap is much lower if only a sample of new entrants in the labour market is investigated. Put different- ly, the gender pay gap tends to widen with age, with women\u2019s relative pay lowest for those aged over 55 years old (European Commission 1998: 62; Barry et al. 2001: 96). Secondly, the gender pay gap is smaller in the public sector. This may be due to the fact that public sector employment typically has a more compressed wage structure compared with the labour mar- ket as a whole, as well as to the fact that the public sector accounts for a higher share of female skilled and professional workers. More- over, public sector employers may be more concerned with equal opportunities\u2019 policies in recruiting and promoting employees than are private sector employers (Barry et al. 2001: 91). It also appears that the pay gap is higher for married employees and significantly lower for singles (Wechselbaumer and Winter-Ebner 2005: 494). Presumably this has something to do with the gender-specific division of paid and unpaid work between the spouses. Gender pay gap in Europe The data presented in this chapter are based on the Structure of Earnings Survey 2002 (SES). This survey is considered the most reliable source with respect to harmonised pay data (Barry et al. 2001). Since 1999, the Member States are obliged to carry out the SES. The ref- erence year of the first (and still most recent) year is 2002. The main results of this survey are available online on the Eurostat website. The SES covers all EU Member States, except Malta. Moreover, the acceding countries (Bul- garia and Romania) are included, as well as Norway and Iceland. Unfortunately, the data cover only employees in the private sector (NACE C to K), excluding healthcare and edu- cation. This might influence the extent of the gender pay gap in two ways: women tend to be over-represented in the public sector and the gender pay gap tends to be lower in the public sector compared with the private sector (see above). In addition, the survey includes enterprises with at least 10 employees (inclu- 21 2. Facts T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 21 ",
        "sion of smaller enterprises was optional). The exclusion of small enterprises may affect the figures for southern countries in particular, given the fact that these countries record roughly 20\u201325% of total private employment in this segment. Employees are all persons who have a direct employment contract with the enterprise or local unit and receive remunera- tion, irrespective of the type of work per- formed or the number of hours worked (Mittag, 2005). Figure 1 provides an overview of the gender pay gap per country. The data refer to 2002, with the exception of the German data, which refer to 2001. In line with the EU indicators, the gender pay gap is calculated as the difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s average gross hourly wage as a percentage of men\u2019s average gross hourly wage. Overtime payments are not included. At the level of the EU-25, the gender pay gap is almost 25% (data for Malta, Iceland and Liechtenstein are missing). The largest gap is found in the UK (30%), the smallest in Slove- nia (11%). Countries like Ireland, Austria, Esto- nia, Cyprus and Slovakia do not seem to be doing very well on this indicator, whereas Poland, Hungary, Sweden, France and Belgium score more favourably. All in all, it appears that the gender pay gap for the new Member States is somewhat smaller than for the former Mem- ber States \u2014 yet the differences are not very large. Developments over time Analysing developments of the gender pay gap over time proves to be a perilous undertaking. The main problem is the quality of data. As Rubery et al. (2002) observe, countries may show unexpectedly strong swings in pay ratios from one year to another, suggesting that these trends may also reflect differences in sur- vey quality. Eurostat provides data on the gen- der pay gap between 1994 and 2004. The tar- get population consists of all paid employees aged 16\u201364 who work at least 15 hours per week. The data are, however, not based on the SES but on several other sources such as the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), the EU survey on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) and national sources. This hampers the comparability considerably. More- over, for several countries there is a break in series and/or not all years are available. Data on the development of the gender pay gap should therefore be treated with more than the usual caution.

        "Figure 2 provides some information on the development of the gender pay gap for the period 1994\u20132004. It should be noted that the gender pay gap in this figure is considerably lower than in Figure 1, due to a different source. Figure 1 is based on SES data covering only the private sector whereas the data in Fig- ure 2 are from the ECHP and SILC, which include both the private and the public sector. On the basis of these ECHP/SILC data, the gen- der pay gap at the level of the EU-25 proves to be fairly stable. Yet, there are quite substantial differences between individual European coun- tries. Some countries indicate a decrease between 1994 and 2004, although the devel- opment is not always linear, but characterised by swings. Moreover, in several countries with a relatively small gender pay gap in 1994, the gap seems to stagnate or even widen. Exam- ples are Sweden (16% in 1994, 17% in 2004) and Denmark (11% in 1994, 15% in 2001, and 17% in 2004, but this might be due to a break in the series since 2002). For the sake of illus- tration, Figure 2 shows the development of the gender pay gap in two countries with a higher than average pay gap (Germany and the UK) and two countries with a lower than average pay gap (Portugal and Italy). The UK shows a decrease, but with relatively large swings (and a break in the series in 2002); the development in Germany seems rather stable (again with a break in the series in 2002). Italy has a small gender gap and is rather stable; Portugal indi- cates large swings, with a clear drop in 2004, which, however, may be again related to a break in the series. The differentiated patterns seem in line with the findings of other studies. ECHP data for the period 1994\u201398, covering the EU-15, reveal no general trend towards closing the gender pay gap: the unadjusted gender pay ratio for all workers increased in eight Member States (in terms of the gender pay gap, this implies a decrease), whereas it decreased in five Member States (Rubery et al. 2002). Data from the har- monised earnings database, which is an annual survey on pay with limited coverage in the EU- 15, over the period 1995\u20132000 show a widening of the pay gap in three countries and a narrow- ing in five countries. Over a longer period of time, however, most countries seem to indicate a decrease in the extent of the gender pay gap. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2002) investigated changes in gender pay gaps over a period of 15 to 20 years. In all countries in the study the pay gap decreased quite substantially.

        "was largest in the United States (38% between 1979 and 1999) and smallest in Sweden (14% between 1975 and 1995). It has to be taken into account, though, that in Sweden much of the narrowing of the gender pay gap had already been accomplished in the 1970s. These empirical findings seem to be confirmed by national research. In France, for example, the average pay of women relative to men\u2019s rose from 64% in the 1960s to 82% in 1996 (research covering full-time workers in the pri- vate and semi-public sectors). Germany has three different sources of data on the gender pay gap. All three sources point towards a decrease over time, though the variation is quite considerable. According to one source, covering full-time employees in manufacturing and parts of the service sector (small firms excluded), the gender wage ratio based on hourly earnings in West Germany increased from 59.9% in 1950 to 73.3% in 1991 and 71.2% in 2004. According to another source, covering employees in all sectors (except the public sector) who had been insured in social insurances during a year, the gender wage ratio was smaller: 76.2% in 1993 and 76.9% in 2001. In the UK the gender wage ratio increased from 72% in 1982 to 82% in 2001. Progress was, however, slower in the 1990s. Among part-time workers, the gender wage ratio increase was considerably lower, rising from 56.8% in 1982 to 59% in 2001. Women in Poland seem to have taken advantage of the change in the eco- nomic system in 1989. Though the estimates on the timing and size vary per study, the results indicate an increase of the gender wage ratio. The same trend is recorded in Hungary. Summary and conclusions There is no such thing as \u2018the\u2019 gender pay gap. Estimates about the differences between male and female wages depend on the data avail- able, the specific sample, and the method used. As a consequence, there is a wide varia- tion in results over time, between countries and even within a particular country. Most sources, however, indicate that the pay gap is relatively small among new entrants in the labour mar- ket, among singles and in the public sector. The most recent SES data for 2002, covering only the private sector, indicate a quite substantial pay gap between men and women. All in all, the gender pay gap in the 25 Member States is almost 25%. The largest gap is found in the UK (30%), the smallest in Slovenia (11%). Compar- ing the development of the gender pay gap over time is a complicated affair, primarily because of data problems. Yet, the gender pay gap at the level of the EU-25 seems to be fair- ly stable over the last decade. Again, however, the variation is large, with some countries showing a decrease and others an increase. Over a longer period of time, though, most countries seem to indicate a decrease in the extent of the gender pay gap. Facts 24 T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 24 ",
        "Theoretical considerations Traditionally, differences in pay are explained by differences in individual characteristics. Especially within the framework of human cap- ital theory, the gender pay gap is analysed in terms of gender differences in productivity- related qualifications like education, training and experience. Given the gendered division of labour, women are considered less likely to invest in market-oriented formal education because they expect a shorter and more dis- continuous working life; an investment in edu- cation will therefore not pay off well in the future. More limited experience and less invest- ment in education will reduce their productivity and will translate in lower wages. Therefore, in order to compare like with like, it is important to adjust the pay data so as to unravel which part of the overall gender pay gap is the result of differences in individual characteristics. In addition to the \u2018classical\u2019 human capital vari- ables, it is quite common to adjust the pay data also for differences in job characteristics. That is: variables like occupation, job level and firm size are included in order to make a more neat comparison. The part of the gender pay gap that cannot be attributed to differences in human capital or job characteristics may be the result of discrimination, an incomplete listing of the relevant explanatory variables, or both (Blau and Kahn 1996, 1997, 2000; Rice 1999; Rubery et al. 2002). As a start, the extent of discrimination may be analysed by adding a gender dummy in the standard wage regression model. The dummy variable captures the effect of sex, holding other things constant. In most studies, how- ever, the gender pay gap is decomposed into an explained and an unexplained part, following the original research of Blinder (1973) and Oax- aca (1973). In this procedure, as a first step, wages are estimated separately for men and women. The total wage differential between men and women can then be decomposed into an explained part E due to differences in char- acteristics and an unexplained residual U, often referred to as the discrimination effect, which is due to both unobservable differences and the differences in rewards for identical characteris- tics. Discrimination in this approach is thus defined as the difference between the observed (\u2018unadjusted\u2019) gender pay difference and the gender pay difference that would pre- vail if men and women were paid according to the same criteria (Rice 1999; Rubery et al. 2002; Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer 2005) (see the statistical appendix for a formal exposition of the Oaxaca\u2013Blinder decomposition). The unravelling of the overall gender pay gap into unequal productivity on the one hand and unequal treatment on the other seems relatively straightforward. Yet, there has been a lot of debate about which variables have to be includ- ed in the wage regression. Especially the status of the control variables like occupation, industry and firm size is controversial. It could be argued that gender differences in these job characteris- tics are a reflection of discrimination rather than productivity, and as such, they should not be included as explanatory variables in the earnings function. As already mentioned by Oaxaca (1973: 699) the controls for occupation \u2018elimi- nate some of the effects of occupational barriers as sources of discrimination. As a result, we are likely to underestimate the effects of discrimina- tion\u2019. On the other hand, the level of discrimina- tion may be overestimated if not all relevant (productivity-related) variables are included. Given the usual difficulties with the available data, the unexplained part may more closely correspond to the \u2018level of our ignorance\u2019, than to the actual level of discrimination. Given these complexities, the \u2018neat compartmentalisation\u2019 between labour market discrimination on the one hand and a set of non-discriminatory filter- ing devices on the other may be deemed as overly simplistic (see for a more detailed criti- cism on this approach Rubery et al. 2002). In addition to differences in individual and job characteristics, the gender pay gap may also be related to the overall structure of wages, that is \u2018the array of prices determined for labour mar- 25 3.

        "ket skills and the rewards to employment in par- ticular sectors\u2019 (Blau and Kahn 2000). Especially following the work of Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1991) on trends in race differentials, the gender pay gap has been analysed within the context of the overall structure of wages. The logic behind this is rather straightforward. Since women, on average, tend to have less labour market expe- rience than men and work in different occupa- tions, the gender pay gap will increase if the return to experience will increase or if the occu- pational wage differences will increase. The same reasoning applies when the gender pay gap is compared between countries; countries with a relative high rewards to skills and expe- rience and a relative large wage dispersion will tend to have larger gender pay gaps \u2014 all else equal. Or, as phrased by Blau and Kahn (2000: 81): \u2018If, as the human capital model suggests, women have less experience than men, on aver- age, the higher the return to experience received by workers regardless of sex, the lar- ger will be the gender gap in pay. Similarly, if women tend to work in different occupations and industries than men, perhaps due to dis- crimination or other factors, the higher the pre- mium received by workers, both male and female, for working in the male sector, the lar- ger will be the gender pay gap\u2019. The structure of wages may be affected by the structure of supply and demand, technological change (strongly growing innovative firms might pay high wages for highly trained work- ers) and by the wage-setting institutions. Cen- tralised systems of wage setting, for example, tend to reduce inter-firm and inter-industry wage variation, thereby potentially lowering the gender pay gap. In addition, because in most (if not in all) countries the female wage distribution lies below the male distribution, centralised systems that raise the minimum pay levels, regardless of gender, may also have a positive impact on the gender pay gap. By tak- ing into account the wage dispersion, the Juhn\u2013Murphy\u2013Pierce decomposition is no longer based on the average worker, as in the Oaxaca\u2013Blinder decomposition, but rather on the distribution of the workers over the wage structure (Blau and Kahn 1996, 2000, 2003; Rubery et al. 2002). Applying the Juhn\u2013Mur- phy\u2013Pierce decomposition to the gender pay gap makes it possible to distinguish between gender-specific factors on the one hand and the effect of a country\u2019s labour market structure on the other. In particular, it is possible to study the effect of the national wage structure when comparing low gap and high gap countries. In addition, the Juhn-Murphy-Pierce decomposi- tion makes it possible to study the impact on the gender pay gap of wage structures becom- ing more (or less) egalitarian (see statistical appendix for a formal exposition of the Juhn- Murphy-Pierce decomposition). In line with the growing emphasis on the importance of wage-setting institutions, Rubery et al. (2002) argue that the increasing interest in gender pay equality in the EU needs to be translated into an active debate on the gender effect of pay policies. The importance of this gender mainstreaming approach is that it shifts the focus from female deficits or defi- ciencies to discrimination within policies and practices as embedded in institutional arrange- ments, social norms, market system and pay policies. Wage structures, according to Rubery et al., are not simply based on the productivity of workers. \u2018The reality is much more messy and reflects current and historical influences. Social norms on the one hand and managerial strategies on the other interact with market processes to shape payment systems. This messy reality allows considerable scope for changing pay structures and practices in both public and private sectors\u2019 (Rubery et al. 2002: 4). The role of social norms and collective wage-setting institutions in generating pay dis- crimination against women also constitutes the core of the argument in feminist literature pointing to the social undervaluation of women\u2019s work as a distinct factor explaining the gender pay gap. According to this argu- ment, the gender pay gap cannot be only explained by gender differences in average human capital characteristics, occupational segregation and direct discrimination by employers, but also by the undervaluation of women\u2019s work in female-dominated occupa- tions and industries (Karamessini and Ioaki- moglou, forthcoming).

        "27 These considerations seem to be confirmed by an EU study on the gender pay gap for 13 EU Member States, based on data from the ECHP (EC 2002). On the basis of this particular data source, it appears that, in 1998, women\u2019s gross hourly earnings were on average 16.2% below those of men. Key issues contributing to the gender gap are earnings differences between men and women with children, gender segre- gation by sector and occupation, with a higher concentration of women in low-paying sectors and occupations, and, in particular, lower earn- ings of women in female-dominated sectors and occupations that cannot be explained by productivity differences between sectors and occupations. When decomposing the gender pay gap by Member State, it appears that the fractions of the gender pay gaps which are due to differences in personal and job characteris- tics of the male and female workforce vary sig- nificantly. Up to half of the gender pay gap in Ireland and Denmark and more than a third in Austria and the UK is the result of differences in personal and job characteristics between men and women. In many southern EU Member States, the observed gender pay gap seems mainly due to differences in the remuneration of personal and job characteristics. In most Member States, therefore, even if the compo- sition of the male and female workforce were identical, substantial gender pay gaps would still subsist. From a policy point of view, the EU study underlines that in order to reduce the gender pay gap different factors need to be addressed: differences in activity and employ- ment rates, differences in the wage structure, differences in the workforce composition and differences in the remuneration between men and women. \u2018In line with other research, the differences in gender pay gaps and related fac- tors across countries, and the evidence on sec- toral and occupational segregation in particu- lar, suggest that both differences in female labour market participation as well as macro- economic and institutional factors, including job classification and wage formation systems, wage structures and overall wage inequality and collective bargaining coverage are likely to impact on gender pay gaps and to explain sub- stantial parts of cross country differences in these gaps\u2019 (EC 2002: 43). Results from national studies The decreasing role of human capital factors on the one hand, and the importance of segrega- tion and the overall wage structure in explain- ing the gender pay gap on the other, seems to be confirmed by most recent national research. Box 1 presents an overview of the relative importance of individual and job characteristics for the EU countries. Again it has to be taken into account that it is fairly difficult to combine the results of the national studies, due to differ- ences in database, methodology, year of analy- ses, etc. Yet, most studies seem to indicate that job characteristics, like occupation and indus- try, account for most of the pay gap. In addi- tion, in a few countries, depending on changes The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses BE The gender wage gap decreased from 15.8% in 1994 to 13.4% in 2001. Part of the reduction is due to improvements in female characteristics over time: the explained part of the gender wage gap decreased from 27% in 1994 to 17% in 2001. Adjusting for individual heterogeneity significantly reduces the adjusted pay gap by increasing the return to observed variables such as experience and education and by reducing the wage penalty associated with low-skilled occupations, a fixed employ- ment contract and a relatively small enterprise size. CZ Human capital factors play a minor role in explaining the gender pay gap (Fischlov\u00e1 and Proke \u0161 ov\u00e1 2003; Jurajda 2003); more important are job characteristics (occupation, company size, sector and ownership) ( K\u0159\u00ed\u017ekov\u00e1 at al. 2006).

        "in the level of female labour supply, gender dif- ferences in experience still play a role (for example, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Slovakia). Origins DK Horizontal and vertical segregation are the most important factors in the explanation of the wage gap. Human capital factors (as education and work experience) contribute to the explanation; other important factors are part-time employment and maternity and parental leave. Human capital factors seem to have a decreasing influence in the period 1997\u20132002 (Deding and Wong 2004). DE The gender pay gap can be attributed to (vertical and horizontal) occupational segregation, but seems to be connected to workplace related remuneration policies as well. Personal characteristics like age, education and years of employment play a minor role (Hinz and Gartner 2005). EE Human capital factors cannot explain the gender pay gap, given women\u2019s high level of educational attainment (Laas 2003). EL Gender differences in educational attainment play a small or insignificant role, while women\u2019s short- er work experience plays an important role in explaining the gender pay gap. A recent decomposi- tion study has found that the most important determinant of the gap is gender differences in labour force participation (Kanellopoulos and Mavromaras 2002), while another attributes this role to occu- pational and industry segregation of employment by gender (Karamessini and Ioakimoglou 2003). ES The level of education is an important factor to explain gender differences in salaries after controlling for other factors, although there is not linearity in the relationship between these variables. Empirical evidence suggests that gender wage differences increase with salaries (Gardeaz\u00e1bal and Ugidos 2005; Garc\u00eda et al. 2001). In particular, the gender gap increases with salaries among people with uni- versity degrees. Among people with primary or secondary education it happens the other way around: the gender gap decreases with salaries (Sim\u00f3n 2006). FR The most recent econometric study of the gender pay gap (using the Blinder\u2013Oaxaca decomposition technique) shows that, out of a total gap of 25.4% (2002 employment survey), working time is the biggest determinant (12% of the gap), job characteristics 8%, whereas human capital plays a negative role (i.e. it has become a positive factor for women), but only at the level of 1.4% (Meurs and Pon- thieux 2005, 2006). IE Findings from national research indicate that a significant part of the gender pay gap is attributable to differences in years of experience and years out of the labour market. In addition, (vertical) segre- gation plays an important role (Barrett et al. 2000; Russell and Gannon 2002). IT All studies applying the Oaxaca\u2013Blinder decomposition found that for the most recent years about 70% of the gender pay gap is due to differences in the remuneration of the characteristics and only 30% or less to differences in characteristics. In addition, research covering a long period seems to indicate that the degree of pay discrimination increases (ISTAT 2005; Rustichelli 2005). CY More than half of the gender pay gap can be explained by differences in average characteristics but much of this explanation includes industry and occupation differences (Chrisofides and Pashardes 2000). LV Women in Latvia are, on average, better educated than men, have longer tenure and total work expe- rience. Taking this into account, it appears that 60% of the pay gap in Latvia has to be ascribed to dis- crimination or unobserved characteristics. Another 15% is due to occupational segregation (Hazans 2005). LT Human capital factors play a minor role in explaining the gender pay gap as women have a relative- ly high level of education. Based on statistical evidence, the official national documents (e.g. nation- al programme of equal opportunities for women and men for 2005\u201309) indicate the importance of horizontal and vertical segregation of the labour market in explaining the gender pay gap. LU The main studies on the gender pay gap in Luxembourg (Lejealle 2001, 2002) show that the occupa- tional differences account for much (40%) of the pay differences between men and women. In addi- tion, gender differences in length of career are also an important factor (30%). (cont.)

        "29 The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses HU Differences in educational attainment play a minor role, yet women\u2019s work experience is still consid- erably smaller, as they interrupt their work more often and for longer periods. Horizontal and vertical segregation plays a decisive role in the extent of the gender pay gap (Galasi 2000). MT No information available. NL Job level is the most important variable in explaining the gender pay gap. Other variables that play a role are age (indicating experience) and working full-time or part-time (Hoeben and Venema 2004). AT Only about 20\u201335% of the gender pay gap can be explained in terms of individual and job character- istics, whereas discrimination makes up about 65\u201380% (B\u00f6heim et al. 2002: 54). Unequal pay can be largely traced back to the unequal evaluation of \u2018men\u2019s work\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019s work\u2019 (Ranftl 2002: 11). Regarding the \u2018explained\u2019 part of the gender pay gap, working time and career breaks as well as ver- tical and horizontal segregation are import determinants (Gregoritsch et al. 2002: 64 et seq.; Lutz 2003: 87 et seq.; B\u00f6heim 2002: 53). PL The relative importance of human capital appears lower than job characteristics. On average, women are better educated, and the gender pay gap is lower for older workers. Variables explaining the gen- der pay gap are: lower number of hours worked by women, occupational and industry segregation, lower pay in the public sector, firm size and less opportunity to earn additional income (Cichomski 2005; GUS 2005). PT Occupational differences account for much of the pay differences between men and women; human capital factors seem to have a decreasing influence, although differences in experience and tenure seem to neutralise the effect of diminishing importance of differences in education (Gonz\u00e1lez, Santos and Santos, 2005). SI Given women\u2019s high level of educational attainment and prevalent full-time employment, human cap- ital and individual factors cannot explain the gender pay gap. More important factors are horizontal and vertical occupational segregation, connected with the traditionally determined and differently valued male and female social/labour market roles and activities (DVD 1998; Seljak 2003; Stanovnik et al. 2006). SK Occupational segregation is extremely important in explaining the gender pay gap; female-domin- ated sectors and occupations are synonymous with low wages. In addition, individual characteristics like age and education play a role (Ve \u010d ern\u00edk 1998). FI A relevant part of the pay gap is attributable to structural components like industry and occupation; personal characteristics like age, education and years of employment play a (very) minor role (Varti- ainen 2001). SE Traditional human capital characteristics like education and years of employment play a (very) minor role. More important factors are the increased wage diversity in general and the fact that the employed in the public sector have lost in comparison with the employed in the private sector (Le Grand et al. 2001). UK Differences in human capital account for a smaller share of the gender pay gap (Joshi and Paci 1998) but differences in work experience do matter, with spells of part-time work having a negative impact on future earnings growth (Francesconi and Gosling 2005; Olsen and Walby 2004; Manning and Petrongolo 2005). Workplace variables are often more powerful than individual characteristics in accounting for gender pay differences (Anderson et al. 2001; Mumford and Smith 2005). IS The available studies do not present separately the importance of human capital factors on the one hand and occupational factors on the other hand when adjusting the gender pay gap. (cont.)

        "The importance of wage-setting mechanisms and the overall wage structure is underlined in several national reports. In particular, the recent trend towards more decentralised sys- tems of wage setting is seen as an important factor (EC 2003). Fuelled by the need for increased flexibility, wage setting increasingly takes place at local or company level. Denmark and Italy are seen as strong examples of this trend. Other countries where this trend is evi- dent are Belgium, Austria, Germany, the UK and the Nordic Member States. Some coun- tries, however, show a trend towards centralisa- tion. Ireland is a clear example in this respect. The changes in the system of wage setting are relevant for the analysis of the gender pay gap as decentralised systems of wage setting are generally associated with increasing wage dis- parities which may translate into a higher gen- der pay gap (see Barry et al. 2002; Blau and Kahn 1997; OECD 2002). Some of the national evidence on the association between wage inequality and the gender pay gap is gathered in Box 2. 30 Origins LI National research on the gender pay gap is missing. Experts point out, however, that occupational segregation plays an important role in explaining the gender pay gap. An additional factor seems to be the years out of the labour market whereas individual characteristics like education and age are no longer important. NO Impact of differences in age and education in the gender pay gap are small. More important factors are different working hours between men and women and occupational segregation, with women dominating lower paid occupations (Barth and Sch\u00f8ne 2006). BG Lower average wages for women are the result of concentration in lower paid positions; on average women are better educated (Agency for Social Analysis 2003). RO No information available. (cont.) Box 1 \u2014 Results of national studies on gender pay gap: the relative importance of individual and job characteristics Source : National reports IT The inequality in the distribution of net earnings decreased from the late 1970s until the end of the 1980s. Egalitarian demands from the trade unions translated into the 1975 reform of the wage index- ation mechanism. In the presence of high inflation rates, this reform applied a strong egalitarian pres- sure on the earnings structure, compressing all wage differentials, including the gender pay gap. At the beginning of the 1990s there was a severe economic crisis resulting in the abolishment of the automatic wage indexation system. In addition, the wage bargaining system was reformed to control wage inflation. These institutional changes, together with the reform of the labour market regulation (enhancing flexibility), contributed to a rising earnings inequality in the early 1990s, including an increase of the gender pay gap (Brandolini et al. 2001). PT Research indicated that firm-specific arrangements have partly offset egalitarian effects of collective bargaining and have increased the wage dispersion. In addition, this wage flexibility has had a nega- tive impact on the gender pay gap (Cardoso and Portugal 2003). SE One explanation as to why the gender pay gap first narrowed and later widened in Sweden, in spite of women\u2019s continued investment in human capital, might be the general development of wage dif- ferences. Between the 1960s and the beginning of the 1980s, the wage differences in general reduced, partly as a result of collective bargaining and a more \u2018solidaristic\u2019 wage policy. During the 1980s the wage differences increased as a result of which also the gender pay gap widened (Le Grand et al. 2001). Another explanation for the specific development of the gender pay gap might be a change in the relative position of the public sector. In 1968 those employed in the public sector earned on average 2% less than those employed in the private sector (controlling for educational level and years of experience). In 1991 this difference had increased to 11% and in 2000 to around 16% (Le Grand et al. 2001: 170). Since a large proportion of the employed women work in the public sector, this development has harmed women more than men.

        "The association between wage inequality and the gender pay gap used to be visible in a lon- gitudinal as well as a cross-section analysis. For example, Barry (2001) demonstrates a positive association between the level of wage inequali- ty, measured as the inter-decile ratio (D9/D1), and the gender pay gap on the basis of the EU- 15 for the year 1995. This positive correlation is, however, not confirmed when the analysis is repeated on the basis of the EU-25 for the year 2002 (see Figure 3). This seems mainly due to a number of new Member States (e.g. Slovenia, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia) and Romania and Bulgaria where the level of wage inequality does not seem to be related to the level of the gender pay gap, perhaps due to the different economic systems of these countries. When looking at the former EU-15, the positive asso- ciation between wage inequality and the gen- der pay gap is more visible. Traditionally, in the Nordic countries wage inequality is rather low, as is the gender pay gap. The same applies to Belgium and Italy. At the other side of the spec- trum are Ireland and the UK. 31 GR AT CY UK SK ES CZ GR NL IEEE LU BG LV RO BE FR IT SE HU PL SI IT DK NO FI 0123 456 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 Source : Eurostat: SES 2002; EC 2005 (wage inequality).

Figure 3 \u2014 Wage inequality and the gender pay gap in the EU-25, Romania, Bulgaria and Norway, 2002 (*) The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses Another important development related to the wage-setting mechanisms is the rise of variable and performance-based pay systems. Variable pay systems may be divided in three main cat- egories (EIRO 2001: 1): 1. payment by result (PBR) schemes, whereby there is a direct relationship between employ- ees\u2019 pay and output (e.g. piece rates); 2. schemes whereby employees are encour- aged to work to certain standards without nec- essarily entailing a direct relationship with pro- duction, such as performance-related pay (PPR) schemes; 3. financial participation schemes whereby workers are entitled to a share of the company\u2019s performance or profitability (e.g. profit-sharing or options). In principle, paying workers more in accord- ance with their performance may be favourable for women and reduce the gender pay gap. An important precondition in this respect is an objective system of performance evaluation. At the same time, however, an increase in per- formance-based pay systems may increase gender wage differences. Firstly, it may be the case that firms limit variable pay to certain jobs, e.g. higher-level jobs or jobs in the heart of the organisation. As a result, men may receive vari- able pay more often than women. Secondly, criteria of evaluation are not always written down. In addition, written criteria may be risky. For example, in the Netherlands flexibility is W a g e i n e q u a l i t y ( P 9 0 / P 1 0 Gender pay gap T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 31 ",
        "quite often used as a criterion in evaluation. This is, however, a criterion that experts in the field of equal pay consider as a potential source of (indirect) discrimination between men and women. Finally, pay for performance systems may easily result in more competition between employees and more overtime. Generally, women are more limited in this respect because of family responsibilities. Summaris- ing, women may be excluded more often from variable pay systems. When included, there is a risk that women will receive less. Data on the extent and level of variable pay are scarce. Moreover, data are difficult to compare because definitions often vary. According to EIRO (2001), an increasing number of firms complement basic pay with an amount of vari- able pay. Yet, throughout Europe, there seems to be considerable variation in the incidence, form and share of employees affected (Cowling 2001). Based on the SES 2002, the EC (2005) provides harmonised data on mean annual bonuses as a share of mean annual earnings. Bonuses are defined rather broadly as \u2018ele- ments related to holidays (such as extra pay corresponding to a 13th month), shift work, productivity, seniority or other factors\u2019 (EC 2005: 194). Spain, the Czech Republic, Portu- gal, Greece, Slovakia and Austria prove to have the highest shares (between 14 and 18%). The impact of bonuses is relatively limited in Poland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, Lithuania, Ireland, Estonia and Bulgaria (less than 5% of mean annual earnings). The data on bonuses are also available by gender. In all but two countries men have a higher share of bonuses than women. In Belgium and Slovakia the share is slightly higher for women than for men. It is unclear what these differences impli- cate for the gender pay gap. See Box 3 for national evidence on the extent and level of variable pay. In two countries, the Netherlands and Finland, more detailed studies are available on gender differences in variable pay. In both countries, women receive less often variable pay than men and these differences are related to occupation- al segregation; women are less often employed in occupations covered by variable pay systems. Moreover, the amounts paid to men are higher than the amounts paid to women. In the Netherlands, in case employees receive a bonus, the gender difference in the absolute level is on average 28%. However, when the bonus is related to the level of the wage, the gender differences disappear. With respect to profit sharing, no gender differences were found. An interesting finding is that, in firms with a works council, the gender differences in individual bonuses are considerably smaller than in firms without a works council (mainly small firms) (PWC Consulting 2002). A Finnish study in 2002 showed that 29% of men receive performance-based bonuses and 14% of women. Moreover, the amounts paid to men were much larger than the ones paid to women: 13% of male wage and salary earners received a bonus of more than EUR 1 000 while the respec- tive proportion among women was only 5%. This difference is largely explained by the fact that more men work in the private sector where these bonuses are more common than in the 32 Origins EE Variable salaries are more common in new workplaces than in older workplaces (Antila and Yl\u00f6stalo 2002). EL A survey carried out by the Institute of Labour of the Greek General Confederation of Labour among 2 016 Greek firms in 2002 revealed that 19% of the firms of the sample declared linking pay with per- formance, 5.5% with profits and 7% with both (Kouzis 2002). The sectors that mostly applied variable pay systems were education and health, hotels and catering, retail, financial intermediation, transport and communication, information technology, and real estate management. Though exact data are lacking, individualised pay seems to be expanding, especially in the growing sectors of services where the unionisation rate is extremely low. IE A study on recent graduates showed that 42% of male recent graduate employees received bonuses compared with 32% of women, and that bonuses to men were valued at around 25% higher than those to women. While such bonuses were mainly in the private sector, better access to occupation- Box 3 \u2014 Extent and level of variable pay T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 32 ",
        "public sector (Lehto and Sutela 2005). 33 The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses al pensions among male than female recent graduates was evident in the public sector. The study con- cludes that these differences add 1% to the gender pay gap (Russell, Smyth and O\u2019Connell 2005). LV Variable salaries are more common in new workplaces than in older workplaces. For about one-fifth of the workers in the Baltic countries, the size of their salary depends entirely on result \u2014 e.g. sales quantity or the equivalent. In Latvia, however, the use of merely result-based pay has decreased a lit- tle within the last five years (Antila and Yl\u00f6stalo 2002). NL Between 2001 and 2003, the share of firms that uses some kind of variable pay system has increased from 40 to 49%. About one third of all companies use individual-based performance pay. There are considerable differences between sectors; performance pay is less common in sectors where the share of women is high. Collective pay for performance is less common than individual pay for perform- ance: 27% of all firms use this form. This form is less used in sectors with a high share of women, suggesting again a possible source of gender wage differences (Bekker et al. 2005). AT The performance-related component of wages has sharply increased. This trend is also noticeable in the public-service enterprises, which are increasingly acting like private companies. The result is that wage incomes are sporadically falling and becoming more flexible (Hermann 2005: 11). PT One of the trends in collective agreements is the reduction of the ranks of the remuneration scales (from 15 to 5, for instance) and their opening so that individual performance can be taken into account (Cerdeira 2004). FI At the firm level, one of the most effective trends from the gender perspective has been the individu- alisation trend in pay systems. The forms can vary from performance-based pay systems to profit shar- ing. These extra bonuses can be individually based, group-based or paid at the organisation level. Performance-based wage arrangements were on the agenda already at the end of the 1980s, but the economic recession held back this development. Currently these forms of payment are increasing again. SE The proportion of employees with a share of the profits has increased for both women and men. This benefit is more common among men than among women (Nelander and Goding 2003). UK Individual or group performance-related pay or profit-related pay have become a fairly widespread feature of UK compensation schemes. Performance-related pay is found in 40% of workplaces, 44% of private sector workplaces and 19% of public sector workplaces. Profit-related pay was found in 37% of private sector workplaces and 21% operated an employee share scheme (Kersley et al. 2005). The 2002 Changing Employer Practices Survey for the ESRC \u2018Future of work programme\u2019 found that 21% of workplaces had increased their use of group incentives and that only 3% had reduced their use of such practices (White et al. 2004). IS More widespread individualisation of pay and the concealment of wages are widely accepted, espe- cially at the firm level in the private sector. The official justification for the individual pay system is the need for performance-related wages to promote efficiency and productivity (see Einarsd\u00f3ttir and Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir 2002: 12). The spread of individual pay settings across the Icelandic labour market and its implications for the gender pay gap has so far not been studied. NO The use of pay for performance systems is increasing; in the private sector the increase between 1997 and 2001 was about 15 percentage points (Barth et al. 2005a). Traditional forms of pay systems (wages per hour) are most frequent in sectors with wage agreements and trade unions. New wage systems are more frequent in sectors without wage agreements. But performance-for-pay systems is increasing both within and outside collective agreements. Performance-for-pay is found more often in large, hierarchical organisations, in companies where employees have a high degree of job auton- omy and in companies that are part of international corporations. Strong competition from product markets, including foreign markets, increases the prevalence of pay for performance. Companies with pay for performance systems pay on average 20% higher wages than companies that have other wage systems (Barth et al. 2005b). Performance pay is more prevalent among groups and industries that pay higher wages in any case. (cont.)

        "Summary and conclusions The gender pay gap is determined by several factors. Traditionally, within the context of human capital theory, differences in pay are explained by differences in individual charac- teristics, like age, education and experience. Evidence suggests, however, that these differ- ences only play a minor role in the persistence of the gender pay gap. The improved educa- tional situation and the increased female partic- ipation rate have strongly diminished gender- specific differences in individual characteristics, although in some countries gender differences in experience still play a role. Instead, the gen- der pay gap seems more related to the level of occupational segregation and the impact of the wage structure. Women tend to work in differ- ent occupations and industries than men and are penalised because of that. The extent of the penalty may differ, though, depending on the wage structure; a more compressed wage structure is likely to diminish the gender pay gap. The current trend towards a more decen- tralised and individualised system of wage set- ting should therefore be assessed as a rather worrying development. In fact, women seem to be swimming upstream: women with an improved educational background, fewer chil- dren and shorter periods of employment inter- ruption are confronted with a labour market with growing wage differentials and a reduced share of collectively agreed wages and wage components (Blau and Kahn 1997). As a result, the differences in wages remain more or less the same. This conclusion emphasises the need for effective policy targeting both female labour market participation as well as institu- tional factors like wage formation systems, the remuneration of women and men, and the overall wage inequality. 34 Origins T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 34 ",
        "In some European countries, the persistence of the gender pay gap has initiated a range of policy measures. In others countries, however, the gender pay gap ranks less high on the national policy agenda and few concrete pro- grammes or policy measures are pursued. Box 4 provides some information on the \u2018national profile\u2019 of the gender pay gap and presents examples of actual policy. In principle, policy responses can be organised along three lines (Karamessini 2006): 1. equal pay policy aiming at tackling direct or indirect gender wage discrimination; 2. equal opportunities policy aiming at encour- aging women to have continuous employment patterns, and de-segregating employment by gender; 3. wage policies aiming at reducing wage inequality and improving the remuneration of low-paid and/or female-dominated jobs. 4. Policy responses 35 BE The gender pay gap ranks rather high on the policy agenda. To date, policies focus on monitoring and awareness raising.

        "Equal pay policies Equal pay policy refers to the equal pay legisla- tion and anti-discrimination laws. The legal framework of the EU with regard to equal pay is quite extensive. The legal basis and imple- mentation of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value is laid down in Article 141 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and in the equal pay directive (Directive 75/117/EEC). National leg- islation and regulations must comply with these provisions. The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice has resulted in a further clarifi- cation. Accordingly European legislation and European jurisdiction impose the following obligations on employers with regard to their remuneration policy (Ranftl 2006): \u2022 the employer must apply the same evaluation criteria to all staff; \u2022 remuneration arrangements must be under- standable and transparent; \u2022 the criteria applied must take into account the nature and type of work; \u2022 the criteria must be free from discriminatory elements. The expected positive effect of equal pay leg- islation on the gender pay gap is reasonably straightforward, although the impact will pre- sumably depend on the effectiveness of the enforcement of the legislation. Several coun- tries (Estonia, Czech Republic, Greece, Ger- many, Poland and Slovenia) report problems in this respect. To take just one example: in Ger- many only individual claims are possible. Although a right for collective claims and group or class claims has been discussed for several years, groups of plaintiffs or organisations are not authorised to file suit. Secondly, rules of procedures for the application of the principle of pay equity are missing. A main problem seems to be the extent to which it is possible to compare jobs on the basis of common and objective criteria. Introducing more explicit rules of procedures would compel the social partners responsible for remuneration to take the principle of equal pay for work of equal value more seriously. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there are no institutions commis- sioned to inform and educate actors on both the legal basis and the process of implementa- tion and with the power to initiate legal action. More effective equal pay policy may demand additional legislation. An example could be the Swedish Equal Opportunities Act (EOA), which states that employers, who employ 10 persons or more, are required annually to survey and analyse pay practices and differentials and pre- pare a plan of action for equal pay. The Equal Opportunities Ombudsman (EOO) should ensure the proper functioning of the EOA and has the power to impose an administrative fine on employers who fail to submit the informa- tion requested. The EOO may also submit requests to the Equal Opportunities Board for the imposition of a penalty on employers who do not observe the rules on \u2018active measures\u2019. Yet, the act only governs relations between individual employers and their employees; it is not an effective instrument for closing the pay gap between female and male-dominated segments of the labour market. Another interesting example of equal pay leg- islation is provided by France. With the law of 9 May 2001, France made it compulsory to nego- tiate equality in companies and sectors and to introduce the issue of equality in all normal bar- gaining topics, including pay. However, only a few (around 50) companies respected this obli- gation. A new draft law on equal pay (March 2006) contains four main themes, of which the abolition of the gender pay gap is the most important. There is a provision to make collect- ive bargaining compulsory in order to abolish pay gaps by December 2010. A diagnosis of existing gaps should be established. In the absence of \u2018loyal and serious\u2019 collective bar- gaining, penalties are envisaged, like the non- registration of pay agreements or the introduc- tion of a financial contribution based on the total wages bill for companies that have not embarked on collective bargaining. The French case is a clear example of legisla- tion which imposes on employers the obliga- tion to justify pay differentials. Most countries are, however, rather reluctant to interfere in the wage-setting mechanism which is seen as the primary responsibility of social partners.

        "38 by employers severely limits the support of an effective comparable worth strategy. Although the principle of equal pay for men and women applies to work of equal value, most countries refrain from audits of internal pay formation in order to identify discriminatory elements, let alone to introduce gender-neutral pay evalua- tion structures that cross the boundaries set by companies and branches of industry. In the UK, for example, the long-awaited report by the Women and Work Commission, which was pub- lished in February 2006, did not include any agreement on compulsory pay audits, although the commission was asked specifically to address this issue in its terms of reference. In Luxembourg, despite the legal obligation to bargain on equality and to adopt equality plans (law of June 2004), social partners seem to have real difficulties in bargaining on equality areas. However, Belgium might be considered to pro- vide a more positive example. The EVA project, set up by the Federal Public Service for Employment, Labour, and Social Dialogue in collaboration with the social partners and with the financial support of the European Social Fund, has been in operation since 2001. \u2018EVA\u2019 stands for analytical evaluation and its goal is to bring the social partners and the industries a step closer to a gender-neutral system and to convince them of the usefulness of an analytical system with regard to equal pay for work of equal value. Initially three objectives were pur- sued: (1) the revision of the existing training programme and sensitisation of the social part- ners; (2) the analysis of the gender effect of the development and the introduction of analytical system of wage setting; (3) the design of a uni- versal analytical gender-neutral job classifica- tion system. The first objective has been realised. However, in the meantime the project has been transferred to the Institute for Equal- ity of Women and Men. It is very likely that the second objective will be put into practice; it is estimated that by June 2006 the analysis will be finished. However, the last objective will almost certainly not be realised. Nevertheless, the results of the project are rated as very pos- itive. To quote Van der Hallen (2003): \u2018As a training pack, it is highly transferable to other countries, because it explains the job evalua- tion process in a very clear, didactic way, with the help of numerous examples. Since gender- neutral evaluation is a matter of \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d, rather than \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d, an awareness-raising campaign similar to the one conducted in parallel with this training pack should prove to be an impor- tant and effective initiative\u2019 (quoted in Meul- ders and O\u2019Dorchai 2006: 28). Equal opportunities policy Another important subset of policy refers to equal opportunities. Given that an uninterrupt- ed career is still a significant factor in explain- ing the overall gender pay gap, it is extremely important to enable women to have more con- tinuous employment patterns. Policies target- ed towards increasing childcare facilities are therefore important. Although data are difficult to summarise, it is quite clear that the availabil- ity and affordability of childcare differs exten- sively over the EU Member States (see, for an overview, Plantenga and Remery 2005). In only a few countries is childcare seen as a social right and offered at highly subsidised prices. In other countries, public subsidies are limited and childcare services are only supplied through the private market at high prices. In a few cases the limited availability of affordable childcare places is acknowledged as a real bar- rier to the uptake of further education or work, especially for low-income families or families with more children requiring childcare; this no doubt affects the earning capacity of women negatively. This point may be illustrated by the situation of Ireland. In 2000, Barrett et al. (2000) identified the provision of comprehensive childcare ser- vices as the key to equality of opportunity on the labour market. Russell and Gannon (2002) draw similar conclusions: \u2018The current findings show that years of work experience and years out of the labour market remain an important influence on the gender pay gap in Ireland. This suggests that policies under the employment strategy to \u2018reconcile family and working life\u2019 are likely to be important in reducing the gender pay gap. Poli- cies such as parental leave schemes, maternity leave, childcare provision, are likely to increase continuity in women\u2019s working lives and there- fore reduce the gap due to time out of the labour market. Similarly, efforts to assist the rein- tegration of those who have been working full- Policy responses T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 38 ",
        "39 time in the home are likely to have an impact on this element of the pay gap\u2019 (quoted in Barry and Murphy 2006: 26). Parental leave is another important part of equal opportunities policy. The effects in terms of the gender pay gap are a bit more compli- cated though. On the one hand, such policies may raise the relative earnings of women by keeping them connected to the labour market and/or particular firms. This may increase the incentives of employers and female workers to invest in firm-specific training. On the other hand, leave facilities might also lower the female participation rate and damage future career paths and earnings, especially when the leave is long. In addition, the actual costs of leave facilities may not be borne by the employers, but passed on to the employee, thereby increasing the gender pay gap if the take-up is not evenly distributed among men and women (which is generally the case). In a study of mandated leave policies in Europe and North America, Ruhm and Teague (1995) con- cluded that leave entitlements of moderate duration (especially when paid) result in higher employment levels. Yet, Ruhm (1996) shows that extended paid parental leave results in substantial wage reductions among female employees. These results indicate two important policy implications; the leave should not be too long and the take-up of leave should be equally divided between men and women. Important preconditions of this equal division are that the leave is paid and that part of the leave is reserved for men. Developments in Denmark may illustrate this point. Since 2002, maternity and parental leave has been expanded: the mother is entitled to four weeks\u2019 leave before the birth of a child, and has a compulsory absence of two weeks\u2019 leave after the birth; fol- lowing this period she is entitled to 12 weeks\u2019 leave. The father is entitled to two weeks\u2019 paid paternity leave during the first 14 weeks after the birth of a child \u2014 normally just after. Sub- sequently each parent is entitled to 32 weeks of parental leave (in total 64 weeks for the par- ents), which they can claim whenever they wish \u2014 and with the agreement of their employer \u2014 until the child is 9 years old. However, only 32 weeks of the total parental leave are paid (at least at the level of the unemployment benefit). The prolonged parental leave and the ending of the system of reserving weeks for the father (from 2002) have resulted in a prolongation of women\u2019s parental leave. The latest figures show that mothers on average take 40 weeks of maternity and parental leave; fathers take on average three weeks. Research reveals that maternity and parental leave weakens mother\u2019s possibilities of a pay raise and that maternity/parental leave is an important explanatory factor of the gender pay gap. In order to restore the balance, the Danish oppos- ition proposed early 2006 to earmark 12 weeks of the paid parental level for the father as an equality measure and an indirect equal pay pol- icy. For women, this would imply that the length of leave would be limited to 18 weeks of maternity leave and 20 weeks of paid parental leave. Another element of equal opportunities policy would be to encourage young girls to consider a wider range of occupational options, and to opt for science and technology, instead of caring, cleaning and catering. Still too often girls opt for traditional female occupations in the care and administrative sector, leading to lower paying careers. Box 5 provides some information of national policies in the field of de-segregation. Breaking down occupational rigidities is impor- tant and may be part of the answer to the prob- lem of unequal pay. Yet, several authors point to the fact that too much emphasis on de-segrega- tion may signal the wrong message as the impli- cit meaning seems to be that it is all about women taking the wrong education and choos- ing the wrong career pattern. In addition, reme- dies for the gender pay gap that promote a change in occupational choices leave unspecified who will take the important and growing jobs in the care and services sector. Too much emphasis on de-segregation also leaves unchanged the wage structure, leaving room for a new segrega- tion based on ethnic lines. Female migrants, for example, might increasingly take up the low-paid jobs in care and personal services, as is already evident in south European countries. Reassessing the relative wage of female- (or male) dominated jobs might in that respect be a more appropriate strategy than tempting girls to give up female- dominated fields in the hope of better pay (Rubery and Smith 2006).

        "Wage policies Finally, wage policies should be mentioned as an important policy lever to address the issue of equal pay. Wage policies in this respect may vary from the introduction of a mandatory minimum wage, thereby setting a floor to the wage struc- ture, to the centralisation of the system of wage bargaining, thereby decreasing inter-industry and inter-firm wage differentials, and the revaluing of low-paid and/or female-dominated jobs, for exam- ple as part of an anti-poverty or equality strategy. The prospect for a successful implementation of such a wage strategy does not seem to be very promising, however, given the current emphasis on decentralised or even individualised systems of wage setting. Yet, some examples of beneficial wage policies are available. In Poland, about 17% of the labour force receives wages below 50% of the average wage. The act of 1 July 2005 amend- ing the minimum wage proposes solutions that should result in the long-term rise of the lowest wages to about 50% of the average wage. Although gender disaggregated data on the recipients of the minimum wage are not available, such a development can potentially improve the earnings of women, especially those who are low- qualified. An interesting development in this respect is the plea to come to a European minimum wage policy. The primary aim of such a policy would be to increase the level of the lowest wages and to pre- vent cross-border wage dumping. Yet, given the fact that the proportion of low-wage earners among women is approximately double to that among men, the introduction of a European mini- mum wage policy would also narrow the wage dif- ferential between men and women and improve the quality and productivity of work. In the \u2018Theses for a European minimum wage policy\u2019 the propos- al is made to raise the minimum wage to a level of at least 60% of the average national wage. As a short-term interim target, all countries should intro- duce a minimum norm corresponding to 50% of the average national wage (Schulten et al. 2005). For the implementation, the authors suggest to rely on the open method of coordination, whereby certain concrete goals and time frames are deter- mined at the European level and then implement- ed within the national framework of the different Member States. An even more targeted wage policy would be to increase the wage level of female-dominated jobs. Finland provides an interesting example in this respect. Since 1971, centralised wage agreements usually included provisions to grant higher rises for female-dominated and low-wage sectors. Their economic effect has been modest but they have been important symbolically in that the social partners have thus recognised the 40 DK Governmental policy strongly focuses on de-segregating the labour market. In early 2005, the Minis- ter for Labour commissioned together with the Minister for Equality and the Minister for Education a study by the National Institute of Social Research on mechanisms of creating and recreating gender segregation in the choice of education and on the labour market. LU The project \u2018Women, sciences and technologies\u2019 has been implemented in response to the low rate of female participation on the labour market and their orientation to female-dominated occupations and industries. The project aims at encouraging young girls to consider a wide range of occupation- al options and to channel them towards future oriented training courses especially in sciences and technology. AT Governmental policy in order to reduce the gender pay gap includes a \u2018qualification offensive for women over the age of 25 with the emphasis on craft-technical occupations and new technologies\u2019, and the \u2018extension of the occupational spectrum for women\u2019. Both policy lines are above all intend- ed to contribute to breaking down gender segregation. SI A decrease in vertical and horizontal segregation and the gender pay gap is stated as one of the four aims for equal opportunities of men and women in employment and work mentioned in the reso- lution on the national programme for equal opportunities.

        "41 The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses importance of promoting equal pay. At present, however, the Confederation of Unions for Aca- demic Professionals in Finland (AKAVA) and the central employers\u2019 confederations would like to scrap these provisions. The former deems them ineffective in their present form because, it claims, they have not helped highly educated women enough. Meanwhile, the employers argue that labour costs in female-dominated and low-wage sectors have increased too much. The Finnish example indicates some of the com- plexities involved in an overall revaluation of low-paid, female-dominated jobs. Given these complexities, equal pay policies (with all their limitations) and reconciliation policies aimed at encouraging continuous patterns of employ- ment among women seem more likely policy directions. Presumably, a greater sensitisation of social partners in equal pay issues is needed to achieve higher than average wage increases in female-dominated occupations and industries. Yet, a higher pay rise for female-dominated jobs might also be the result of shortages in supply, especially in crucial sectors like education and care. In Iceland, for example, after a period in which wage negotiations became more decen- tralised, wage developments in female-dominat- ed institutions and firms have been less favourable than those of male-dominated ones giving rise to widespread unrest among munici- pality workers who are in most cases women working in schools, nurseries and institutions /homes for the elderly. During the autumn of 2005 many municipalities negotiated a special pay rise for those in unskilled jobs as a response to widespread labour shortage and discontent. Trade union involvement Finally, Box 6 gives some information on trade union involvement in wage policies. In particular where national policy is rather weak and focused more on issues of occupational segregation and/or the impact of family responsibilities than on issues of undervaluation as such, social part- ners may take over and actively campaign for a more gender equal wage system. As usual, though, the picture is rather diverse. In some countries trade unions have indeed entered large framework agreements, targeted towards gender mainstreaming and the tackling of the gender pay gap (Belgium, France); in other countries, trade unions play a role in the dissem- ination of information and training tools (the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Iceland), while in still other countries, the commitment of trade unions to reduce gender wage differentials seems rather low (Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Liecht- enstein, Bulgaria). BE In September 2004, the three biggest Belgian unions (socialist, Christian and liberal) signed a Gender Mainstreaming Chart to signal their commitment to make special efforts to promote gender main- streaming. Tackling the gender pay gap and developing a new job classification system are important elements of this commitment. Furthermore, the 2007/08 inter-occupational agreement will be given a feminine dimension. Finally, they are also aware that they should pursue gender parity at the next social elections so that women can defend women which make up half of their affiliates. Although to date none of these declared intentions have been put into practice, they do translate a genuine com- mitment of the unions to the cause of eliminating wage inequality. CZ At the central level there is very little information on how to assess and monitor the gender pay gap. As a result, individual trade unions have no real guidelines on how to address the issue of equal pay in the collective bargaining process. DE Trade unions have not been very active on the issue of equal pay. Collective agreements do not usu- ally contain any specific clause on equal pay either, although some trade unions have developed their own codes of practice for the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women. EL The trade unions\u2019 involvement has been positive but limited to the issue of equal pay for equal work; little attention is paid to equal pay for work of equal value and on the tackling of the gender pay gap. Collective bargaining therefore does not operate as a means of promoting equal pay.

        "42 Policy responses ES Current policies are mainly targeted towards improving the transparency of the collective bargaining process, relating to current practices of selection and promotion, and to the revision and elimination of female categories within occupational classification. FR A national inter-sector agreement on gender balance and occupational gender equality was signed on 1 March 2004 by all major unions. It includes a section on equal pay. Companies committed them- selves to reducing the residual gap (estimated at 5% by INSEE, the French National Institute for Sta- tistics and Economic Studies), which cannot be explained by sectoral or structural effects. Specific action, in order to catch up gradually within time limits, can be embarked upon. At sector level, cri- teria used for job evaluation will be examined in order to rectify any discriminatory effects and take better account of all skills. Solutions will be sought to limit the effects on pay of absences related to parenthood. IE Trade unions\u2019 involvement has been positive but rather limited. A key element of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) is to achieve legislative change to allow \u2018class actions\u2019 to be taken under equal- ity legislation. In addition, the ICTU is looking for a higher level of minimum wage and more resources towards the provisions of childcare services. IT Italian trade unions have never shown a strong commitment to reducing gender differentials. The issue of women\u2019s low pay has traditionally been seen as part of the general problem of economic inequity, so that effort was concentrated on (i) squeezing pay differentials (by industry, by category of employment, by skill grade), up until the mid-1980s; (ii) promoting equal opportunities, in the 1990s. CY While the unions\u2019 involvement and lobbying for the minimum wage legislation (and standard) is important, nothing has been done in the area of minimising the pay gap or the observed occupation- al segregation. LT Trade unions play an active part with respect to minimum wage policy. They also played an active role in the process of initiation, preparation and signing of the bilateral national agreement on the appli- cation of the \u2018Methodology for the assessment of jobs and positions in enterprises and organisations\u2019. However, this agreement has yet to be translated into a programme of action and/or into a set of spe- cific policy initiatives. LU Within the context of the pilot project \u2018Equal pay, democratic challenge\u2019, government and the social partners have committed themselves to review persistent inequalities between women and men regarding pay. HU Under the direction of the National Confederation of Hungarian Trade Unions, a new pilot project has been set up. It consists of two main parts: an interactive database for gender pay gaps, and a moni- toring mechanism. NL Policy initiatives primarily focus on providing information, for example by offering tools on the web- site to check whether one is being paid according to the rules. In addition, in cooperation with the wage indicator project and unions from Belgium and Hungary, Dutch trade unions participate in a project called \u2018Decrease the pay gap\u2019. This project, funded by funds from the European Social Fund (ESF), intends to increase the effectiveness of policies targeted towards diminishing wage differences. Moreover, it intends to empower individual women by informing them on career choices and by train- ing their bargaining skills. AT Since the end of the 1990s, trade unions have developed and implemented gender mainstreaming plans or adopted gender-mainstreamed collective bargaining guidelines. Guidelines refer to both the content of the actual agreements as well as the actual negotiation process. PL Union density is low and decreasing, thus a top priority is the growth of members. The company is the dominant level of bargaining, institutionalisation of industrial relations is low, and when collective bargaining occurs, equal opportunities do not come to the fore. Unions conduct some awareness-rais- ing activities for workers and employers, but these do not feature prominently in the overall context. (cont.)

        "43 The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses PT Some initiatives by trade unions, for example the Aveiro footwear trade union, targeted awareness raising and changing actual pay practices. At a more general level, trade unions provide information and training courses on gender equality for trade union leaders and other union members. SI Some trade unions\u2019 initiatives focus on awareness raising and providing detailed information on wages and career development. SK Social partners pay little attention to equal pay. Yet at the central level, some initiatives are undertak- en to promote equal opportunities in the labour process. FI Policy measures focus on more analytical job evaluation schemes and bringing male- and female- dominated sectors within the same collective agreements. SE Trade unions are important. Although the system of wage setting is largely decentralised, some coor- dinated action is taken on issues like deceasing the gender pay gap between female- and male-dom- inated occupations and sectors. UK Trade unions are important in bringing both employers and the government to the bargaining table over issues like single pay spines and the protection of workers outsourced from the public sector (mainly women). IS Trade unions\u2019 actions focus on awareness-raising initiatives and organising training courses for women in order to improve their negotiating skills.

(cont.) Box 6 \u2014 Trade unions\u2019 involvement in closing the gender pay gap Source : National reports Summary and conclusions The European Member States indicate a rather diverse picture when it comes to tackling the gender pay gap. In quite a number of countries the gender pay gap has little profile either in the public debate or on the policy agenda. In other countries, though, the persistence of the gender pay gap has initiated several policy initiatives tar- geted towards closing the gender pay gap. Some policies refer to improving the effective- ness of equal pay legislation. Other policies try to enhance equal opportunities and aim at more continuous employment patterns; available and affordable childcare as well as paid parental leave for both men and women are seen as important preconditions in this respect. Girls might also be encouraged to choose less tradi- tional occupations in order to enter higher pay- ing careers. A third lever refers to wage policies aimed at reducing wage inequality and improv- ing the remuneration of low-paid (or female- dominated) jobs. Actual policy initiatives in this respect vary from a general policy towards increasing the level of the minimum wage in Poland, to a re-evaluation of low-paid, female- dominated jobs in Finland. The actual policy mix may depend on national particularities and the prevailing analysis of the origins of the gender pay gap. The emphasis on deregulation and vol- untary action by employers may restrict national policy options in some countries, especially with regard to wages. In these circumstances, social partners (especially trade unions) may take over and actively campaign for a more gender equal wage structure. T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 43 ",

        "45 5. Best practices Taking into account the different socioeconomic backgrounds, the national reports present a broad range of innovative policy initiatives that may be gathered under the heading \u2018best prac- tices\u2019. There appear to be four major policy lines: \u2022 policies directed at the availability and dissem- ination of information among relevant actors such as employees and employers; \u2022 policies to develop or strengthen the infra- structure with respect to equal pay; \u2022 policies directed towards a more integrated- system of wage setting; \u2022 policies to develop legal measures enforcing- equal pay. Availability and dissemination of information The availability of relevant information is an important starting point when tackling the gen- der pay gap. Moreover, dissemination of infor- mation is an important tool to raise awareness of the extent and seriousness of the problem. Quite a number of national reports, therefore, address this issue. Box 7 summarises the initia- tives, which vary from initiating a study to the organisation of a national Equal Pay Day. The box also includes three examples of legislative measures with respect to gathering data at the company level, which may be essential for the detailed research into the very nature of pay dif- ferences. As most companies are rather reluc- tant to provide this information, Italy and Portu- gal have taken legislative measures that oblige employers to do so; in Denmark, the Act on Enterprise-based Wage Statistics has been post- poned. In addition, social partners are important allies when tackling the gender pay gap. As the national reports show, social partners seem increasingly willing to take action to reduce the gender pay gap, especially with respect to pro- viding information and awareness raising. BE An Equal Pay Day is established. The aim is to raise the awareness of a very large public with respect to the persistence of gender wage inequality, to discuss wages more openly and to encourage poli- cy corrections. CZ The Committee for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men of the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions ( A MKOS) promotes in its programme \u2018adherence to the principle according to which men and women merit equal pay for equal work or work of equal value\u2019. DK After fierce discussions on the results of studies of the gender pay gap, in 2000 the Minister for Equal- ity forwarded a bill proposing enterprise wage statistics broken down by gender and a ban on the use of wage confidentiality. In 2001, the Act on Enterprise-based Wage Statistics broken down by gender was adopted. After a change in government in late 2001, however, the act has been temporarily post- poned. At the moment discussion is continuing on the conditions under which the law should apply (e.g. such as the size of firms). EL A guide for the integration of gender equality in firms has been published. The guide contains a list of proposals addressed to public administration and social partners aiming at the integration of gen- der equality in firms. Equal pay for work of equal value is one of the five main categories of the pro- posal.

        "46 An awareness-raising campaign was part of the EU-funded project \u2018Equal pay \u2014 Mind the gap\u2019. This project was the first initiative ever taken in Greece extending the equal pay principle beyond the issue of direct wage discrimination against women and drawing attention to the overall gender pay gap as a social problem stemming from different forms of discrimination. IE The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) initiated a small-scale gender and pay project. Under this project, the trade union congress is being funded to carry out activities addressing the gender pay gap under a number of themes, including awareness of the gender pay gap, job evaluation skills and resources, training of trade union officials and vocational training. This involved the development of a toolkit by the ICTU to support managers, officials and activists to address the gender pay gap. IT Public and private firms employing more than 100 employees have the obligation to provide statisti- cal information on the employment conditions of their employees broken down by gender every two years (1991 law on positive actions; Article 9, Act 125/1991). The companies have to give the report to the local equality advisers and to the trade unions at the company level. These reports could be used by equality advisers and/or trade unions to tackle horizontal and vertical segregation, as well as the gender pay gap at the company level. HU Stimulated by the Dutch project \u2018Wage indicator\u2019, an interactive database, called the \u2018E-Barometer\u2019 will be compiled. Age, gender, educational level, occupation and regions will be the main dimensions of the data set. NL The \u2018Wage indicator\u2019 project has been developed. One of the goals of this project is to improve the information about \u2018real\u2019 wages, beyond the information about the \u2018formal\u2019 wages agreed in a specif- ic collective bargaining agreement. In addition, the data set would expand the scope for research and create a better insight in the dynamics of the gender pay gap. AT The Union of Private Employees (Gewerkschaft der Privatangestellten \u2014 GPA) has committed itself to examining all collective agreements within their respective domain in terms of (implicit) gender- related discriminatory provisions and eventually to eliminate them in the course of the next years\u2019 bar- gaining. In addition, in the early 2000s a working group was set up within the Metalworking and Tex- tiles Union (Gewerkschaft Metall-Textil \u2014 GMT), which jointly examined the possibilities of gender mainstreaming in collective bargaining in cooperation with the Equal Opportunities Ombudswoman (Anwaltschaft f\u00fcr Gleichbehandlungsfrag). MT In Malta, where relatively little information is available, a study has been initiated on the gender pay gap. This is regarded as an important step towards assessing the actual gender pay gap and a useful tool for raising awareness. PL Action has been taken to raise awareness of labour laws and workers\u2019 rights. In addition, lawyers, judges, police officers, prosecutors, trade union representatives, employer organisations, labour inspectors, NGO representatives and government officials have been educated and trained. PT The Commission for Equality in Labour and Employment has promoted several gender equality train- ing courses for judges and other agents involved in the process of justice administration, with the pur- pose of promoting a better application of gender equality legislation. Since 2004 all employers, with the exception of central, regional and local administrations, public institutes and other collective public entities, as well as employers of domestic service workers, are obliged during the month of November to display in a visible place (or for online consultation) for a period of at least 30 days, the list of their staff indicating each employee\u2019s earnings (Law No 35/2004, of 29 July, Articles 452 to 457 and 490). This information must be made available to the public author- ities, as well as, on demand, to trade unions and employers\u2019 associations. Non-compliance is consid- ered a minor offence, and depending on the degree of guilt and the firm\u2019s outcomes, the fine may vary between UC 2 and 15 (each UC corresponds to EUR 89). SI The presidency of the biggest trade union confederation called on member trade unions to introduce the gender pay gap problem into the collective bargaining agenda. (cont.)

        "47 SK The Slovak Republic Confederation of Trade Unions prepared and implemented the project \u2018Equal opportunities policies for men and women in trade unions, years 2002\u201304\u2019. The main aim of the pro- ject is to promote the agenda for equality and opportunity in the labour process. One part of the pro- ject is devoted to strengthening the principle of equal pay of men and women at all levels of collec- tive bargaining. SE The Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) is strongly committed to gender equality and gender mainstreaming and publishes on this theme on a regular basis. On International Women\u2019s Day 2006, a report was published which contains, amongst others, a concrete handbook on trade union feminism and which supports active gender equality work in the workplace. LI The government initiated a special award on women- and family-friendly enterprises in 1999 in order to raise employers\u2019 as well as the public\u2019s awareness of gender equality issues. (cont.) Box 7 \u2014 Initiatives with respect to availability and dissemination of information Source : National reports The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses Infrastructure The establishment of gender-specific institu- tions is another important step to support the implementation of equal pay legislation. New initiatives in this respect are reported by Cyprus, Lithuania and Slovakia; see Box 8 for more details. Other countries (the Netherlands, Finland and Norway) report the creation of equal pay task forces. In the Netherlands an equal pay working group has been created to mobilise all relevant actors in the field of equal pay in order to implement all policy tools actively. In Finland a working group has drawn up a programme for equal pay, which pro- posed to set clear targets. In Norway the gov- ernment announced in March 2006 that the first Norwegian commission on equal pay is to be appointed. One of the most important tasks for the commission is to place the issue firmly on the political agenda, and to vitalise the debate on equal pay (see Box 9). CY The Authority Against Discrimination, formed due to an EU directive, is responsible for handling all cases of gender discrimination, including sexual harassment and pay discrimination, both in the pub- lic and private sector. What is innovative and important for this office is that the burden of proof is on the employer and not on the employee and statistical evidence of discrimination is considered ade- quate proof (i.e. if women are generally paid less in company X this counts as sufficient evidence of discrimination against a specific woman). LT Since 1999, the Equal Opportunities Ombudsperson\u2019s institution supervises the implementation of equal rights and opportunities for men and women, laid down in the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania, and investigates complaints relating to direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of sex. Since the establishment of the institution (1999\u20132004), the Ombudsperson\u2019s institution had received 325 complaints; the cases of discrimination at work (in respect of placement, professional career and remuneration) constituted about 28% of all investigations. SK At the end of 2005, the project \u2018Promotion of administrative capacities in gender mainstreaming\u2019 started. Experts from France and Germany will help to build an institutional mechanism for imple- menting gender mainstreaming in governmental as well as non-governmental spheres. In the scope of the project, a new gender website (www.gender.gov.sk ) was launched.

        "Integrated system of wage setting According to EU legislation, men and women should be paid equally for equal work or for work of equal value. In order to determine the value of a job, job evaluation systems are often used, which, however, may be (in)directly dis- criminating for women. It is therefore impor- tant that a critical assessment of system-specif- ic characteristics and criteria is made. As Box 10 shows, policy initiatives in several countries are taken aimed at the development and appli- ance of gender-neutral systems of job evalua- tion (comparable worth strategy). In addition, the national reports of France, the UK and Nor- way provide good practices with respect to wage setting at the sectoral or company level (see Box 11). For example, a Norwegian firm tries to neutralise the impact of parental leave. Legislation As described in Section 34, the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value is part of EU legislation and all countries have included this principle in their national legisla- tion. Countries may take additional legal meas- ures to improve the effectiveness of equal pay legislation. Best practices in this respect are provided by Luxembourg, France and the UK. 48 Best practices NL Commissioned by the Minister for Social Affairs and Employment, the Equal Pay Working Group was created at the beginning of 2006. By actively addressing all relevant actors, including employers\u2019 organisations, employees\u2019 organisations, but also individual employers and employees and other par- ties involved, about the legal rules of equal payments, the Equal Pay Working Group implies a more offensive strategy to combat unequal payment. FI The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health established a working group on 15 November 2004 to draw up a programme for equal pay. The work was finished on 15 May 2005. The main promise of this programme was that the pay gap between men and women, counted by the average monthly pay for normal working hours, would reduce by 5 percentage points from the current 20%, until the year 2015. NO In March 2006 the government announced the appointment of the first Norwegian commission on equal pay. One of the most important tasks for the commission is to place the issue firmly on the polit- ical agenda, and to vitalise the debate on equal pay. The commission will launch concrete proposals for future strategies, not only in connection with the wage settlement processes. The commission should be seen as an important political signal, dealing with issues with implications for a living wage, distributive politics and future pensions. The main reason given for the commission is that gender dif- ferences are still substantial and change rather slowly.

        "49 The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses BE The EVA project has been launched. \u2018EVA\u2019 stands for analytical evaluation and its goal is to bring the social partners and the industries a step closer to a gender-neutral system. Within this project three objectives are pursued: firstly, revision of the existing training programme, organisation of new train- ing courses and sensitisation of the social partners; secondly, the analysis of the gender effect of the development and the introduction of analytical methods on wages; thirdly, the design of a universal analytical gender-neutral job classification method to analyse all job types. DK Efforts are taken to elaborate job evaluation tools between the social partners in the municipal and county sector. In addition, a brochure on the use of job evaluation is published as a tool to promote equal pay in the municipal sector. LU The government and the social partners have committed themselves to analyse the system of job clas- sification (discrimination, correction criterion and gender-neutral systems). The Ministry of Equal Opportunities, with the Chamber of Commerce and private employees, provides a supply of training courses on gender-neutral evaluations of job classifications for firm managers. AT A research project on \u2018Non-discriminatory work evaluation and work organisation\u2019 was completed in 2002. Building on the experience and results of this research project, a guideline for the application of non-discriminatory analytical work evaluation was drawn up in 2004. In addition, a first nationwide collective agreement was signed for social and health services (where the vast majority of employees are women) in November 2003 covering about 35 000 employees in the private sector. This agree- ment lays down a clear-cut, uniform pay scheme providing for nine different pay levels according to skills and vocational experience, which replaces more than 200 different pay schemes provided for in individual company regulations. Box 10 \u2014 Policy initiatives with respect to job evaluation Source : National reports FR The electricity and gas boards EDF-GDF made an occupational equality agreement in 2004 with a specific budget for women\u2019s pay to catch up. The agreement had two ambitions: reducing observed gender gaps and introducing new practices and change mentalities in order to achieve lasting cultur- al changes in favour of occupational equality. A specific target was to reduce an estimated pay gap of 5% over a three-year period. Both local management and unions were involved in achieving the agreement. The additional budget to reduce the gender pay gap represented 0.1% of the total wages bill. The advantage of such an additional budget was that men did not get the feeling that they were being wronged in order to benefit women. UK In 1999 an important agreement was made in the National Health Service (NHS): the \u2018Agenda for change: Modernising the NHS pay system\u2019. One of the main parts of this agreement was the intro- duction of a new integrated pay structure for the NHS. Two important goals of this agenda were to improve the relative position of the very lowest paid workers in the NHS and to ensure as many staff as possible moved to a band that would provide higher maximum pay than previously. First indica- tions are that several groups have indeed improved their rate of pay, e.g. cleaners and healthcare assistants. NO GE Healthcare (1 250 employees in Norway) specialises in the research and production of medical products. In order to change the negative effect of parental leave on wage progression, employees who have been on parental leave are given a wage rise equivalent to an average wage settlement. In addition the employee\u2019s direct superior has a responsibility to be aware of the situation in the next individual assessment. The ambition is that parental leave should not affect the employee\u2019s wage level, either in a negative, or in a positive direction. The establishment\u2019s personnel manager argues that equal pay stimulates productivity; inequalities in wages create dissatisfaction.

        "Summary and conclusions Best practices are supposed to inform other countries and to serve as an important source of inspiration. In essence, looking at and analysing the policy initiatives of others could improve national policies. In this respect, it is rather remarkable that most best practices refer to the availability and dissemination of information. That is: these best practices refer to actions undertaken to disseminate know- ledge and raising awareness of the extent and seriousness of the problem. This is an import- ant first step, yet still a long way from present- ing actual solutions. Only a few countries pro- vide examples of more offensive strategies like legal measures enforcing equal pay or policies directed towards strengthening the infrastruc- ture. In this respect it seems important to increase the profile of the gender pay gap at the national level, for example by setting con- crete targets to be achieved within a suitable time frame within the context of the European employment strategy. 50 Best practices Source : National reports LU Since June 2004 a law is in force that obligates social partners to bargain on equal pay. Under this law, collective bargaining has to include a provision concerning the implementation of the principle of equal pay between men and women. The results of the collective negotiations have to be written down. FR The laws of May 2001 and March 2006 reinforce the obligation of gender pay bargaining in compa- nies and sectors. For the first time the introduction of penalties (financial contribution based on the total wage bill) is mentioned (which may come into effect in December 2010 in case of lack of bar- gaining). UK Gender duty on public authorities. The Equality Act of 2006 amends the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 to place a statutory duty on all public authorities, when carrying out their functions, to have due regard to the need: (1) to eliminate unlawful discrimination and harassment; and (2) to promote equal- ity of opportunity between men and women. This is known as \u2018the general duty\u2019 and will come into effect on 6 April 2007. The general duty is enforced by judicial review. In addition, from 2007, the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) will have the power to issue compliance notices in connection with a breach of the general duty and these are enforceable in the courts.

The lat- est figures on the basis of SES data (which cover only the private sector) indicate that in 2002 women earn on average 25% less than men. The largest gap is found in the UK (30%), the smallest in Slovenia (11%). Analysing the development of the gender pay gap over time is a complicated affair, primarily because of data problems. Yet, the gender pay gap at the level of the EU-25 seems to be fairly stable over the last decade. Over a longer period of time, though, most countries seem to indicate a decrease in the extent of the gender pay gap. Traditionally, within the context of human cap- ital theory, the gender pay gap is explained by differences in individual characteristics, such as age, education and experience. Evidence sug- gests, however, that these differences play a rel- atively minor part in the persistence of the gen- der pay gap. The improved educational situ- ation and the increased female participation rate have diminished gender-specific differ- ences in individual characteristics, although in some countries gender differences in experi- ence are still important. Instead, the gender pay gap seems more related to the level of occupa- tional segregation and the impact of the wage structure. Women tend to work in different occupations and industries than men and are penalised because of that. The extent of the penalty may differ, though, depending on the wage structure; a more compressed wage struc- ture is likely to diminish the gender pay gap. The current trend towards a more decentralised and individualised system of wage setting should therefore be assessed as a rather worry- ing development. In fact women seem to be swimming upstream: women with an improved educational background, fewer children and shorter periods of employment interruption are confronted with a labour market with growing wage differentials and a reduced share of col- lectively agreed wages and wage components. The persistence of the gender pay gap empha- sises the need for multi-faceted policies target- ed both on increasing the female labour market participation rate as well as on institutional fac- tors such as wage formation systems and the overall level of wage inequality. In fact, the EU countries display a broad spectrum of policy initiatives targeted on closing the gender pay gap. In principle these policy responses may be organised along three lines: (1) equal pay poli- cies aimed at tackling direct or indirect gender wage discrimination; (2) equal opportunities policy aimed at encouraging women to have continuous employment patterns, and at desegregation of employment by gender; and (3) wage policies aimed at reducing wage inequality and improving the remuneration of low-paid and/or female-dominated jobs. The legal framework of the EU with regard to equal pay is quite extensive. The impact, however, depends on the effectiveness of the enforce- ment, which may be problematic. Moreover, rules of procedures for application may be missing. This seems especially the case with respect to the principle of equal pay for jobs of equal value (i.e. how to compare jobs in an objective manner). Childcare, as part of equal opportunities policy, is an important arrange- ment to enable women to have more continu- ous employment patterns. Yet, the availability and affordability varies extensively across Europe. Leave arrangements are another important part of equal opportunities policy. Available evidence, however, suggests that the leave should not be too long, as this might lower the female participation rate and dam- age future career paths and earnings. In addi- tion, there is a risk that the costs are passed on to the employee, which might result in an increase of the gender pay gap. In order to avoid this, the leave should be equally divided between men and women. This implies that the leave should be paid, whereas reserving weeks for the father might also be extremely helpful. The third policy line refers to pay policies such 6. Conclusions T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 51 ",
        "as the introduction of a mandatory minimum wage and the revaluing of low-paid, female- dominated sectors. Given the current emphasis on decentralised or even individualised sys- tems of wage setting, the prospect for such a strategy does not, however, seem to be very promising. The ultimate policy mix may depend on nation- al particularities and the prevailing analysis of the origins of the gender pay gap. The empha- sis on deregulation and voluntary action by employers may in some countries restrict national policy options, especially with regard to wages. Employers on the other hand \u2014 fear- ing increases in the wage bill \u2014 might be reluc- tant to commit themselves to reduce the gen- der pay gap. In these circumstances social part- ners (especially trade unions) may take over and actively campaign for a more gender equal wage structure. Yet, the national reports indi- cate that in several European countries the gender pay gap has a low profile both in the public debate and in the policy agenda. Sum- marising, one of the main problems is that there is no real owner of the problem, as nobody really feels responsible for closing the gender pay gap. Organising political support for closing the gap seems to be an important challenge for the near future. The best practices again indicate a wide varia- tion of policy responses. There is quite a heavy emphasis on policies directed at the availability and dissemination of information among rele- vant actors such as employees and employers. Most \u2018visible\u2019 initiatives refer to the establish- ment of an Equal Pay Day; equally important are policies targeted towards education and training of employers\u2019 organisations, trade unions, lawyers and judges. Best practices also refer to the development or strengthening of the infrastructure with respect to equal pay. Examples in this respect refer to the establish- ment of an equal opportunities ombudsperson in Lithuania and to the creation of equal pay task forces in the Netherlands, Finland and Norway. A third cluster of best practices aims at the provision of a more integrated system of wage setting. Examples refer to the develop- ment and application of gender-neutral sys- tems of job evaluation (in Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg and Austria) and to good prac- tices with respect to wage setting at the sec- toral level (in France and the UK). Finally, some best practices are mentioned at the legal level, aimed at obliging social partners (or employ- ers) to bargain on equal pay (Luxembourg, France and the UK). The persistence of the gender pay gap, its low profile in a considerable number of European countries and the rather cautious attitude that is implied in the best practices emphasise the need for an effective policy framework at the level of the European Union. Setting targets might be helpful in this respect. As part of the European employment strategy (EES) in 2003, the Member States were called on to formu- late targets to achieve a substantial reduction of the gender pay gap in 2010. In 2005, how- ever, the EES was revised with more emphasis on integrating employment policies with macro-economic and micro-economic policies in order to maximise the synergies and to increase their efficiency. In the new set-up, the reduction of the gender pay gap is no longer formulated as a special target but included in two general guidelines. Moreover an explicit time frame is not stated. As a result, the focus on the gender pay gap seems to be lost in other employment issues. In order to increase the profile of the gender pay gap at the national level, it seems essential to formulate concrete objectives and timetables on the closing of the gender pay gap at the European level. Depending on the national situation these objectives should be implemented in the individual countries along the lines of the open method of coordination.

        "The dummy approach The simplest way to analyse the gender pay gap is to perform a regression analysis, with gender included as a dummy variable, in order to capture the effect of discrimination: (1) W i = \u03b2 X i + \u03b3 sex i + \u03b5 i , where W i represents the log wage and X i the con- trol characteristics (e.g. education, job experience, and job characteristics) of an individual i ; \u03b2 and \u03b3 are parameters. The Oxaca\u2013Blinder decomposition A more sophisticated procedure to investigate the gender pay gap is developed by Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973). In this procedure, wages are esti- mated separately for individuals i of the different groups g, males and females. As a result, this pro- cedure allows that productive characteristics of men and women are rewarded differently: (2) W gi = \u03b2 g X i + \u03b5 gi , where g = (m,f) represents the two sexes; W gi is the log wage, and X gi the control characteristics of an individual i of group g . The total wage differential between men and women can then be decomposed into an explained part due to differences in characteristics and an unexplained residual. The difference in mean wages can be written as: (3) W\u2013 m \u2014 W\u2013 f = ( X\u2013 m \u2014 X\u2013 f ) \u03b2 ^ m + ( \u03b2 ^ m \u2014 \u03b2 ^ f ) X\u2013 f \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 E + U , where W\u2013 g denotes the mean log wages, X\u2013 g repre- sents the control characteristics of group g and \u03b2 ^ g the estimated parameter from equation (2). While the first term stands for the effect of different pro- ductive characteristics (the endowment effect E), the second term represents the unexplained resid- ual U (often referred to as \u2018wage discrimination\u2019) which includes a difference due to unobserved vari- ables that influence productivity and a difference due to a differential reward for equal characteristics. In (3) the difference in male and female character- istics are evaluated using the male wage structure. In principle, it is possible to use the female wage structure as the reference. This will in general lead to different outcomes. The Juhn\u2013Murphy\u2013Pierce decomposition Juhn et al. (1991) offer an alternative to the Oaxa- ca\u2013Blinder decomposition. The innovative aspect of this approach is that it allows for differences in the overall wage distribution to affect the gender pay gap. As such, the Juhn\u2013Murphy\u2013Pierce approach has the advantage of enabling identifica- tion of four sources of contributing factors to the overall differences in gender pay gaps: cross-coun- try differences in gender differences in productiv- ity characteristics, cross-country differences in the prices of observed productivity characteristics, cross-country differences in the relative wage posi- tion of men and women, and cross-country differ- ences in the prices of unobservable productivity characteristics. More formally (following Blau and Kahn 1996 and Rubery et al. 2002), a wage equa- tion for a male worker i and country j can be expressed as follows: (4) Y ij = X ij B j + \u03c3 j \u03b8 ij , where Y ij is the log of wages; X ij is a vector of explanatory variables; B j is a country- specific vec- tor of coefficients; \u03b8 ij is a standardised residual (i.e. with mean 0 and variance 1 for each country); and \u03c3 j is the country\u2019s residual standard deviation of wages (i.e. its level of residual wage inequality for males). Then, the male-female log wage gap for country j is: (5) D j \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Y mj \u2014 Y fi = \u2206 X j B j + \u03c3 j \u2206\u03b8 j , where the m and f subscripts refer to male and female respectively; and a \u2206 prefix signifies the average male-female difference for the variable immediately following. Equation (5) states that a pay gap in a particular country can be decomposed into differences in measured qualifications \u2206 X j and differences in the standardised residual \u2206\u03b8 j (multi- plied by the money value per unit difference in the standardised residual \u03c3 j ). The final term of (5) cor- responds to the \u2018unexplained residual\u2019 in a standard decomposition of the pay gap when the 61 The gender pay gap \u2014 Origins and policy responses Statistical appendix: Analysing the gender pay gap T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 61 ",
        "contribution of the means is evaluated using the male function, i.e. the term U in equation (3). The gender pay gap difference between two coun- tries j and k can then be decomposed, using (2): (6) D j \u2014 D k = ( \u2206 X j \u2014 \u2206 X k ) B k + \u2206 X j ( B j \u2014 B k ) + ( \u2206\u03b8 j \u2014 \u2206\u03b8 k ) \u03c3 k + \u2206\u03b8 j ( \u03c3 j \u2014 \u03c3 k ). The first term in (6) reflects the contribution of inter-country differences in observed differences in characteristic ( X ) to the cross-country differences in the gender pay gap. The second term reflects the impact of inter-country differences in returns to observed characteristics. The third term measures the effect of international differences in the relative wage positions of men and women after control- ling for measured characteristics, and finally the fourth term reflects the inter-country differences in residual inequality. According to (6), the impact of gender-specific fac- tors is reflected in the sum of the first and third terms, the effect of gender differences in observed characteristics and of gender differences in wage rankings at a given level of observed characteris- tics. Labour market structure is reflected in the sum of the second and fourth terms, the impact of inter- country differences in returns to measured and unmeasured characteristics. Within the framework of a traditional decomposition, the sum of the third and fourth terms represents the impact of inter- country differences in the unexplained differential, which in most cases is interpreted as an estimate of discrimination. 62 Statistical appendix: Analysing the gender pay gap T612923int:T612923int 8/01/07 15:32 Page 62 ",
