        "Summary This Occasional Paper explores the features and implications of an \u2018Asian\u2019 approach to peacebuilding and seeks to define what is distinctive about this approach. In attempting to answer this question, the author aims to establish what characterises peacebuilding activities undertaken by Asian countries and how their attitudes to peacebuilding differ from Western- dominated mainstream views of peacebuilding. It is argued here that in an Asian context peacebuilding is conditioned by a Westphalian vision of the world as opposed to the post-Westphalian views of liberal interven- tionists. Thus, for Asian countries peacebuilding does not imply conflict resolution activities along the lines of peacemaking. Instead, peacebuild- ing practice in Asia is exercised through peacekeeping and economic as- sistance flows. Official involvement in a country\u2019s internal political af- fairs, including humanitarian interventions that involve the use of force, or in domestic peace processes is commonly avoided. Yet, as in Western contexts, there is a growing niche for civil society in Asian peacebuilding activities as well as in the domain of non-traditional security issues. This development is explored in this paper. As a way of structuring the analysis, a distinction is made between peace- building within and beyond the Asian region, a key factor in influencing different actors\u2019 approach. In the context of peacebuilding activities un- dertaken within Asia, the emphasis is on the nurturing of bilateral rela- tionships and on \u2018limited\u2019 multilateral peacebuilding. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is examined as a case study in order to explore this last aspect further. When looking into Asian actors\u2019 peace- building activities beyond the region, the cases of China, India and Japan are addressed. With the exception of Japan, the other countries under scrutiny in this paper have focused the bulk of their peacebuilding activi- ties outside the region to contributing troops to UN Peacekeeping Opera- tions (UNPKO), hence the emphasis on the latter. In the conclusion, the existence of common features that distinguish a cautious Asian engagement in mainstream peacebuilding activities is con- 5 ",
        "firmed; however, caution is different from complete refutation. Indeed, the Westphalian nature of Asian actors\u2019 approach to peacebuilding per- vades both the regional and the global spheres, although the challenges are inevitably bigger at a global level. This further explains differences in motivation as well as in attitudes to the purpose of peacebuilding among Asian actors at different levels of analysis as addressed in this paper. ",

This paper aims to explore what characterises an \u2018Asian\u2019 approach to peace- building. In doing so, it further aims to discern to what extent Western- dominated mainstream views of peacebuilding are applicable to Asian countries. Thus, how does an Asian approach, seen as Westphalian in es- sence, differ from a post-Westphalian approach to peacebuilding? 1 For this purpose, this paper begins by providing a working definition of peacebuild- ing (see pages 8-9). A distinction is made between peacebuilding within and beyond the Asian region, a factor seen as having a key influence on different actors\u2019 approach. As far as providing examples of peacebuilding within Asia is concerned, the focus is on the nurturing of bilateral relationships among Asian countries, as well as on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 2 In order to explore Asian actors\u2019 peacebuilding activities beyond the region, the cases of China, India and Japan are analysed individually. In the conclusion an attempt is made to answer the question as to whether there is a distinctive \u2018Asian\u2019 approach to peacebuilding, what it consists of and how the cases under study here relate to it. Global views on peacebuilding have evolved in tandem with an expanded notion of collective security which includes economic, political, environ- mental and health-oriented issues. 3 Moreover, this new security paradigm 1. See James Sperling, \u2018National Security Cultures: Technologies of Public Goods Supply and Security Govern- ance\u2019 in Emil J. Kirchner and James Sperling (eds.) National Security Cultures: Patterns of Global Governance (Oxford: Routledge, 2010), p. 2. Sperling defines Westphalian states as promoters of territoriality and as constituting a \u2018hard shell\u2019 protecting states and societies from the external environment; in their view, unwanted external encroachments reflect disparities in relative power. These states are mostly located in the global South. Sperling further defines post-Westphalian states as having \u2018largely abandoned their gate-keeper role owing to the network of interdependencies formed by economic openness, the political imperative of welfare maximization, and demo- cratic political principles.\u2019 They are also much more vulnerable to the influence of non-state actors. 2. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok, Thai- land, with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) by the founding fathers of ASEAN, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Brunei Darussalam then joined in 1984, Vietnam in 1995, Lao PDR and Burma/Myanmar in1997 and Cambodia in 1999, making up what are today the ten Member States of ASEAN. The ASEAN Declaration outlined a number of aims and purposes, among them \u2018to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region\u2019, as well as \u2018to promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries of the region\u2019.

As noted by Oliver Ramsbotham, Tom Woodhouse and Hugh Miall, Contemporary Conflict Resolution: The Prevention, Management and Transformation of Deadly Conflicts (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2008), p. 147: \u2018the 2000 Millennium Report was organised around the themes of the quest for freedom from fear (through conflict management and resolution), freedom from want (through economic development and growth) and sustaining the future (through careful husbanding of the earth\u2019s resources and ecosystem).\u2019 ",
        "8 Peacebuilding in Asia: refutation or cautious engagement? has implied the shift from a state-centric view of security to the promo- tion of \u2018human security\u2019; 4 this implies the inclusion of \u2018soft\u2019 security is- sues, not just \u2018hard\u2019 ones, on the agenda. 5 International organisations have made post-conflict peacebuilding a core part of their mandate in line with this expanded view of collective security: their views are based on a standardised model which entails economic recovery, restoration of order, reforming or strengthening governmental institutions, monitor- ing elections, demobilisation and reintegration of ex-combatants and hu- man rights protection, among other elements. 6 In a recent Presidential Statement by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) of April 2010 on Post-conflict Peacebuilding, \u2018the Security Council recognises that sus- tainable peacebuilding requires an integrated approach, which strength- ens coherence between political, security, development, human rights and rule-of-law activities ...\u2019 7 Mainstream views on peacebuilding define it as: \u2018comprehensive efforts to identify and support structures which will tend to consolidate peace and advance a sense of confidence and well-being among people.\u2019 8 It is em- phasised here that in order to consolidate peace, peacebuilding must be a long-term sustainable process which addresses the root causes of con- flict. Peacebuilding is a widely used term in the field of conflict resolution which overlaps with peacemaking and peacekeeping; in fact, mainstream views of peacebuilding integrate both of the latter, and the boundaries are blurred. Notwithstanding, in this paper it is argued that in an Asian context peacebuilding does not prioritise conflict resolution activities along the lines of peacemaking. Instead, peacebuilding practice in Asia is 4. From a global perspective, \u2018human security\u2019 refers to a notion of security which has been broadened to in- clude people as well as states. It implies the security of civilians \u2013 physical safety, economic and social well-being, respect for their dignity and worth as human beings, and the protection of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. For more, see the website of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) at http://www.iciss.ca/. 5. The idea of \u2018soft\u2019 and \u2018hard\u2019 security is analogous to the conceptualisation of international power as being influential both by coercion (hard power \u2013 tangible resources) and by attraction (soft power).

        "9 1. Introduction: Is there an \u2018Asian\u2019 approach to peacebuilding exercised through peacekeeping and economic assistance flows: involve- ment in controversial internal political situations, including humanitar- ian interventions that involve the use of force, as well as in domestic peace processes, are commonly avoided. Yet, \u2018second generation peacekeeping operations\u2019 as epitomised in the UN \u2018Agenda for Peace\u2019 of 1992 are increasingly being merged with peace- building. 9 The current operations have become multi-dimensional, aim- ing to link civil-military relations more closely: they include \u2018setting the conditions for political participation leading to elections, disarmament and demobilisation, promotion of human rights, security sector reform and human protection\u2019. 10 The fact that UN peacekeeping operations are spilling over into state-building and political processes has not prevented the leading Asian countries from becoming increasingly involved in them. Notwithstanding, China and India continue to emphasise their preference for traditional peacekeeping at the rhetorical level, although this does not always translate into practice: they fear that current UN operations will become \u2018coalitions of the willing\u2019 and have spill-over effects on their own domestic affairs. 11 Thus, wary of what they see as \u2018new interventionism\u2019 in Kosovo and Iraq, both countries highlight the need for UN Peacekeeping Operations (UNPKO) to be carried out under the authorisation of the Security Council. In contrast, they have provided support to the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) and NATO\u2019s ISAF mission in the country. 12 This shows how both countries have become more pragmatic in their foreign policy approach as future \u2018responsible great powers\u2019. 9. Traditional peacekeeping included the monitoring of ceasefire agreements, assisting with troop withdrawals, providing buffer zones between warring forces or helping in the implementation of a political settlement.

        "10 Peacebuilding in Asia: refutation or cautious engagement? In addition, this paper aims to highlight the emerging role for Asian civil society in peacebuilding activities as well as in the realm of non-tradition- al security issues, particularly within a multilateral arrangement such as ASEAN. A wide range of conflict scenarios are addressed which vary from situations of inter-state tensions \u2013 without armed confrontation \u2013 to situations of intra-state armed conflicts both within Asia and beyond the region. These can range from security and border agreements between neighbours to the deployment of peace monitors or peacekeepers in situa- tions of civil conflict. John Paul Lederach\u2019s comprehensive framework for peacebuilding which refers to three levels of agency \u2013 top, middle-range and grassroots leadership \u2013 is helpful in order to include the civil soci- ety level. Lederach identifies each level of leadership with a set of specific approaches to peace, ranging from high-level negotiations to problem- solving workshops and local peace commissions. 13 This is also applicable in non-Western contexts, despite Asian actors\u2019 traditional emphasis on the top and middle leadership; the growing influence of the grassroots level as a result of mainstream views of peacebuilding is tackled here too. The following section seeks to analyse what precisely is meant by an \u2018Asian\u2019 approach to peacebuilding. In this perspective, Asian actors\u2019 moti- vations for becoming involved in peacebuilding both within and beyond the region are addressed. Thereafter, aspects of a Westphalian approach by Asian countries towards outside interference and its implications for peacebuilding are explored. Actors\u2019 differing motivations for involvement in peacebuilding The four case studies under scrutiny here show that Asian actors have varying reasons for becoming engaged in peacebuilding depending on the geographical location and the nature of the activities. Thus, India\u2019s con- tribution to UN peacekeeping forces, reflecting its aspirations to become a global player, and the deployment of peace monitors by ASEAN mem- bers in Aceh in 2002, can be ascribed different interests and motivations. 13. John Paul Lederach, Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies (Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace, 1997). Lederach identifies level 1 \u2013 top leadership \u2013 as the military/political/religious leaders; level 2 \u2013 middle-range leadership \u2013 as leaders respected in various sectors: ethnic/religious leaders, academics/in- tellectuals, humanitarians (Non-Governmental Organisations - NGOs); level 3 \u2013 grassroots leadership \u2013 as local leaders, leaders of indigenous NGOs, community developers, local health officials and refugee camp leaders. ",
        "11 Therefore, a first key distinction has to be made between peacebuilding activities undertaken in the region as opposed to those undertaken be- yond Asia: the geopolitical stakes will vary substantially. At a regional level, power dynamics will strongly influence Asian actors\u2019 decision to become engaged, as well as the way in which they do so. This is particularly true of three regional powers, i.e. China, India and Japan: their engagement will foster apprehension among their smaller neighbours. All three countries have a history of interference in the internal affairs of their weaker neigh- bours, sometimes extending to military occupation and the deployment of peacekeepers: China\u2019s invasion of Vietnam in the late 1970s and India\u2019s peacekeeping force in Sri Lanka during the late 1980s are examples of this. Thus, the three Asian powers will be extremely cautious in the way in which they engage in the region: they all need regional stability as a means to achieve global power status. Both Chinese and Indian foreign policy are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence: i.e. mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other\u2019s inter- nal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence. 14 This shows how Westphalian principles of non-interference, sovereignty and territorial integrity remain at the core of engagement between countries in the Asian region, in contrast to post-Westphalian states. It further explains the historical preference for bilateral relationships, as opposed to multilat- eral arrangements, particularly at regional level; hence, the exceptionality of ASEAN. The use of rhetoric based on a shared identity and civilisational linkages discourse is key in the quest for good bilateral relations at a re- gional level. Increasingly, China and India have emphasised economic co- operation and aid assistance flows as a means to strengthen relationships with their neighbours and downgrade their threat perceptions. 15 In Japan\u2019s case, its official development assistance (ODA) flows have been historically intertwined with peacebuilding activities both within and outside the re- gion: this constitutes a key pillar of its foreign policy. ASEAN constitutes a different case altogether, considering the multilat- eral and regional nature of the arrangement. The main objective of its 14.

        "12 Peacebuilding in Asia: refutation or cautious engagement? members is to maintain peaceful co-existence internally \u2013 which can, in addition, provide a counterbalance to external threats from the broader Asian region. Thus, ASEAN members are not only seeking economic co- operation and integration; they are also aiming to build a political and se- curity community through functional institutional building 16 Collective decisions are taken by consensus, but in a way that is not legally binding, which allows for its members\u2019 domestic agendas not to be disrupted. The regional organisation has, so far, been successful in preventing any out- break of war between its members based on this consensus-based model of decision-making as well as on the independence of ASEAN member states. 17 Non-interference did result in controversy, in particular instances of internal civil strife within ASEAN members, such as the case of East Timor in Indonesia. 18 Notwithstanding, national sovereignty and the principle of non-interference have prevailed. ASEAN has had additional positive side-effects in Asia by bringing Southeast and East Asia (Japan, China and South Korea) together \u2013 ASEAN + 3 (APT) \u2013 via economic link- ages. Moreover, ASEAN has encouraged economic and security engage- ment with its dialogue partners, among them India and the U.S, via the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), as explored in more detail later on. 19 The motivations of Asian actors to become engaged in peacebuilding ac- tivities beyond the region are very different. The quest for global status and political clout will dominate over regional geopolitical dynamics and power relationships. China and India are keen to project themselves as \u2018responsible world powers\u2019, as well as leaders of the global South: this in- cludes providing less powerful countries with a platform to voice their concerns, be it as a permanent UN Security Council member in the case of China or as members of the G-20. Not surprisingly, their approach to peacebuilding activities outside Asia will have to comply with certain crite- ria of the global governance agenda despite their self-imposed limits, such as the use of military force or political interference in another country\u2019s 16.

        "13 1. Introduction: Is there an \u2018Asian\u2019 approach to peacebuilding domestic affairs. Notwithstanding, China, India and Japan have shown increasing interest in contributing to the deployment of peacekeeping forces by the UN: China and India, in particular, have contributed an in- creasing number of troops to UNPKO in recent years. 20 In addition to Asian countries\u2019 own motivations, there has been pressure from the West \u2013 particularly from the US and the EU \u2013 on Asian countries to contribute to global peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations; this is especially clear in the case of Japan due to its security alliance with the US. A Westphalian versus a post-Westphalian approach: implications for peacebuilding Part of the emphasis on peacekeeping activities embedded as peacebuild- ing in an Asian context is related to the existing tension between Asian countries\u2019 adherence to a Westphalian vision of territoriality and sover- eignty and a global approach to peacebuilding: this is particularly the case in intra-state conflicts. Issues of good governance, demobilisation, recon- struction and human rights are very much part of the post-Westphalian discourse which permeates a global governance regime and transcends nation-state boundaries. 21 However, Westphalian states \u2013 including Asian countries \u2013 continue to be highly sensitive towards officially interfering in other country\u2019s \u2018internal affairs\u2019, particularly at a regional level. Notwith- standing, global power dynamics and the emergence of Asian countries as \u2018responsible world powers\u2019 is pushing them to become increasingly in- volved in peacebuilding activities world-wide. China and India\u2019s increased participation in UN peacekeeping missions shows a growing flexibility from both in terms of the nature and degree of involvement in multilat- eral coalitions, although this does not extend to the use of force. 22 20.

        "14 Peacebuilding in Asia: refutation or cautious engagement? The apprehension of some of these countries towards outside \u2013 seen as Western \u2013 interference is often linked to historical and domestic factors, despite their invoking the distinctiveness of their respective cultures in a rhetorical way to justify their resistance to interventionism; this is prev- alent in the foreign policy discourses of China and India. However, ac- cording to Seng Tan, 23 some ASEAN countries such as Thailand favour a less diplomatic interpretation of non-interference in contrast to mem- bers such as Indonesia, Burma/Myanmar and Vietnam who are strongly against outside involvement. In recent times, both China and India have shown more flexibility towards an extended sovereignty principle, even if this was not reflected in their votes in a UN General Assembly hearing on the \u2018Responsibility to Protect\u2019 held in June 2005: positions ranged from an outright \u2018no\u2019 from China and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to a \u2018no comment\u2019 by India. 24 The international order is increasingly dominated by a global govern- ance-oriented West in pursuit of an ethical and responsible form of di- plomacy. 25 Former UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook noted with refer- ence to British foreign policy: \u2018our foreign policy must have an ethical dimension and must support the demands of other peoples for the democratic rights on which we insist for ourselves\u2019. 26 This can be extrap- olated to the nature of external intervention in domestic peacebuild- ing activities by Western states supportive of a liberal \u2018solidarist\u2019 and liberal interventionist approach, along the lines of a post-Westphalian approach to security co-operation. 27 The notion of \u2018liberal peace\u2019 which currently dominates mainstream views on international peacebuild- ing is related to liberal interventionism based on the body of theory 23.

Liberal interventionism justifies international intervention in instances when the state, expected to act responsibly vis-\u00e0-vis its citizens, has been rendered incapable of providing the minimum degree of security and order. In these instances, sovereignty is also redefined to include the notion of responsibility. In contrast, pluralists support international society\u2019s norm of non-intervention. ",
        "15 1. Introduction: Is there an \u2018Asian\u2019 approach to peacebuilding on \u2018democratic peace\u2019. 28 Liberal peacebuilding further translates into a growing involvement in state-building activities through development assistance flows by international non-governmental organisations op- erating in conflict scenarios. 29 A \u2018liberal peace\u2019 further shares the liberal internationalist component of the \u2018Responsibility to Protect\u2019 doctrine on humanitarian intervention but differs from it in that it is not im- posed but requested by the host countries instead. 30 This trend towards liberal interventionism and involvement in domestic state-building as part of peacebuilding contrasts with the views of post-colonial Third World countries \u2013 including Asian states. 31 Asian countries have further proven to have common views on the human rights regime at the core of peacebuilding initiatives world-wide, views which are often at odds with Western perspectives. 32 The growing involvement of NGOs in the provision of human rights ad- vocacy, as well as conflict prevention and resolution, constitutes an ad- ditional source of concern for governments in the global South. In the case of Asian states, there has been a historical suspicion towards NGO activism since they have traditionally been perceived as subversive ele- ments in state-centric societies. Civil society activists working on human rights and peacebuilding activities in Asia face strong governmental pres- sure, often relying exclusively on foreign support for their activities. Many Asian governments see outside support given to NGO activists in their country as yet another form of outside interference in their internal af- 28. The concept of \u2018democratic peace\u2019 was originally conceived in the framework of maintaining a \u2018zone of peace\u2019 among Western liberal states during the 1980s/90s: democracy would account for democratic peace following cultural/normative and structural/institutional models. For a comprehensive collection of different viewpoints see Michael Brown et al. (eds), Debating Democratic Peace (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996). 29. See Roger Mac Ginty, \u2018Indigenous peace-making versus the liberal peace\u2019, C ooperation and Conflict , vol. 43, no. 2, 2008, pp. 139-63. The author notes that liberal peacebuilding emphasises neo-liberal economic principles, good governance and adequate security concerns as a means of solving intra-state conflicts in developing coun- tries: the basic premise is that a liberal market democracy is the ideal model of domestic governance with a view to maintaining sustainable peace. 30. For more on the Responsibility to Protect see the website of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) at www.iciss.ca/about-en.asp.. The ICISS aims to provide a legal and ethical basis for humanitarian intervention by external actors (preferably international actors through the UN) in a state that is unwilling or unable to fight genocide, mass killings and other massive human rights violations. 31. This has been proven in numerous instances, such as in critical statements made by the Non-Aligned Move- ment referring to foreign occupation, interference in internal affairs and sanctions inconsistent with international law. As an example, see the Final Document of the NAM XIII Ministerial Conference held in Cartagena, Colom- bia, in the year 2000, available at http://www.nam.gov.za/xiiiminconf/final1.htm#international%20context. 32. The Final Declaration of the Regional Meeting for Asia of the World Conference on Human Rights which took place during the lead-up to the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 expresses this view very suc- cinctly.

        "17 2. Peacebuilding within the region 2. Peacebuilding within the region The motivations underlying and the nature of Asian actors\u2019 approach to peacebuilding will change depending on whether it is applied within or beyond Asia. As examples of different forms of peacebuilding within the region, this chapter focuses on bilateral relations between countries as well as on multilateral peacebuilding using ASEAN as a case study. In both instances, the existence of a shared cultural identity and values is emphasised: the aim is to enhance these in order to build national unity and consolidate inter-state relations. This has reinforced the view that there are unique and distinctive Asian decision-making norms, as ex- plored below. The importance of bilateral relations China and India have historically favoured dealing with their neighbours at a bilateral level, as opposed to using multilateral arrangements. Not coincidentally, Chinese and Indian foreign policy rhetoric relies heavily on both tangible and moral variables. 34 Thus, despite the fact that both countries will often exercise realpolitik in their regional foreign policy, they will rely heavily on moralpolitik at a rhetorical level. In real life terms, this translates into informal negotiations behind the scenes as the effec- tive means to resolve disputes and exercise leverage, meaning that official negotiations are a symbolic gesture rather than a real attempt at conflict resolution. This is prevalent in multilateral fora everywhere but in the case of Asian multilateral arrangements saving face will be prioritised over reaching a tangible outcome. In fact, the Asian mode of diplomacy is typically characterised by maintaining personal relationships and a tra- ditionally reactive style which is gradually evolving in a more proactive direction in line with public diplomacy objectives. 35 Thus, no measures that openly degrade the other party will be taken, particularly at a bilat- 34.

Japan\u2019s approach to peacebuilding in Asia stands out from the other cases under scrutiny here. The reason is its progressiveness, both in its intrinsic nature and in the scope of its implementation. Compared to other Asian actors, Japan has shown unprecedented initiative in becoming involved in the domestic peace process in Asia. Unlike China and India which have favoured a bilateral approach, Japan has agreed to be part of Western-led multilateral peace initiatives within the region as was the case in Aceh, East Timor and Sri Lanka. Participating as a co-chair in multi-party peacebuilding has entailed the acceptance of certain aspects of a liberal peacebuilding approach such as the use of peace conditionalities and an emphasis on human rights. However, despite agreeing to these measures officially, Japan has shown reluctance to accept peace conditionalities, even at a rhetorical level: Tokyo has traditionally pressured for positive instead of negative linkage, in contrast to Western countries. In fact, as noted by a Japanese diplomat posted in Sri Lanka, Japanese aid is 80 percent bilateral versus 20 percent multilateral. 36 The Japanese example shows how peace conditionalities and human rights remain controversial issues in an Asian context where they are perceived as tools of foreign in- terference in \u2018internal affairs\u2019. The case of India\u2019s reconstruction activities in Afghanistan is highlighted below. India\u2019s activities do not fit into mainstream views on peacebuilding since their political component is limited, certainly officially. Instead, the bulk of activities are focused on technical and economic assistance. In- dia\u2019s unprecedented reconstruction role in Afghanistan cannot be under- stood without taking into account the nature of Indo-Pakistani relations combined with the high degree of non-regional military engagement in the country, including by the global powers. The fact that Afghanistan is in the neighbourhood and has become the main theatre of the US \u2018war on terror\u2019 has raised Delhi\u2019s geostrategic stakes beyond regional power dynamics: this further explains the unique nature of its involvement in the country. 36.

Peacebuilding within the region India in Afghanistan Despite the polarised political environment in Afghanistan, India cur- rently enjoys good relations with both the Afghan government and the opposition. It recently established the Afghanistan-India Partnership Council, having previously sponsored Afghanistan\u2019s entry into SAARC in 2005 (see Kumar, op. cit. in note 12). India is today one of the six larg- est donors to Afghanistan, having contributed substantially to recon- struction efforts in the country since 2007-08. Proof of this is that ever since Afghanistan has ranked as the second largest individual recipient of Indian aid after Bhutan, an amount which supersedes India\u2019s aid to its other neighbours combined (excluding Bhutan).* The bulk of India\u00b4s reconstruction projects in Afghanistan are focused on providing technical assistance in infrastructure building and the pro- vision of basic services, categorised in India as \u2018Technical & Economic Co-operation\u2019.

In addition, India has undertaken community-level small development projects in the field of agricul- ture, rural development, education and health through Afghanistan that have a direct and visible impact on community life and with a focus on local ownership and management. ** In addition, India supports NATO\u2019s ISAF mission in Afghanistan and the \u2018Af-Pak\u2019 policy of the Obama Administration.

        "20 The uniquely Asian ASeAN way ASEAN\u2019s success is based on the principle of unity in diversity: the inde- pendence and sovereignty of its member states is respected when the or- ganisation takes collective decisions. In fact, one of its core objectives has been to foster cultural co-operation as a way of overcoming its members\u2019 existing misconceptions of each other. 37 In principle, this idea extends to the principle of equality among its members; in reality, however, a degree of hierarchy exists within the organisation depending on the power and influence of each country: stronger members such as Indonesia and Ma- laysia will dominate over weaker members like Singapore and Brunei. 38 This is, however, a common feature in regional and multilateral organisa- tions. Another one of ASEAN\u2019s core objectives has been to preserve internal se- curity and regional order both vis-\u00e0-vis external powers \u2013 including China and Japan \u2013 as well as among its members. For this purpose, they have used multilateral treaties to prevent future conflicts. In the case of ongo- ing conflicts, ASEAN has used informal consultations internally and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for arbitration at the request of indi- vidual states. Thus, while there is a space for formal declarations, there is no proper regional mechanism of conflict management for domestic conflicts. Only recently, a more official Troika formula was established as part of \u2018rapid diplomatic response\u2019 to address situations of conflicts between its members: the foreign ministers of present, past and future chairs of the ASEAN Standing Committee will form an ad hoc committee to tackle issues of regional peace and stability. 39 This aims to replicate the European Union (EU) \u2018Troika\u2019 which represents the EU in external rela- tions that fall within the scope of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). The particular nature of ASEAN\u2019s conflict mechanism is based on the organisation\u2019s lack of formal institutionalisation, ASEAN having opted for functional co-operation as a means to achieve regional reconciliation 37.

Peacebuilding within the region gradually. 40 \u2018Soft\u2019 institutionalisation relies on confidence-building, pre- ventive diplomacy and informal conflict management rather than on the threat of punishment (collective security) or denial (collective defence). 41 Thus, musyawarah \u2013 rigorous consultation and negotiation processes on conflict issues that might affect relations between member countries \u2013 is used prior to the actual decision-making. It is very much a tool for peaceful settlement of disputes between member countries since it provides a plat- form for consultation and negotiation of issues prior to consensus-based decisions. 42 ASEAN\u2019s strategy of consensus-based diplomacy reflects an Asian way of managing problems but not actually resolving them, certain- ly not via official channels. However, consensus-based decision-making combined with the principle of non-interference often leads to stagna- tion, as noted by one writer in reference to clashes between ASEAN and non-Asian members of the ARF. 43 As argued at the beginning of this paper, peacekeeping is very much em- bedded in an Asian approach to peacebuilding, primarily at a global level and increasingly so regionally too. In fact, Indonesia has proposed the creation of an ASEAN peacekeeping force as part of the ASEAN Security Community (ASC), in existence since 2003: this was meant to provide an ASEAN framework to handle security issues and disputes, as opposed to handling them bilaterally or using other international fora. 44 Indonesia\u2019s initiative is striking given that it comes from the member that has the highest number of internal conflicts and has vociferously opposed outside interference in its domestic affairs. ASEAN members have already indi- vidually participated in peacekeeping operations in the region: Thailand, Malaysia and Philippines participated in peacekeeping in Cambodia and East Timor while Thai and Philippine observers were deployed to Aceh in 2002. Malaysia, for its part, sent a peacekeeping team in 2004 composed 40. Yunling, op. cit. in note 16. 41.

ASEAN members have also sought to expand their multilateral linkages to include other countries in the Pacific through the ARF, as well as the East Asia Summit (EAS), (see page 23). The establishment of the ARF was strongly supported by Beijing. It is the first region-wide inter-governmen- tal forum on regional security co-operation in the Asia Pacific and is cur- rently the only multilateral security institution in Asia. It emphasises con- fidence-building measures as a first step towards security enhancement which should evolve towards preventive diplomacy and conflict resolu- tion. The meetings are not held at heads-of-state level but at ministerial level instead; the consensus principle also dominates ARF decisions. The main obstacle to move beyond confidence-building has been China\u2019s con- cern that a green light on mainstream conflict resolution activities could result in the ARF\u2019s interference in members\u2019 domestic affairs: this led to the mechanism being renamed \u2018elaboration of approaches to conflict. 47 Despite existing resistance to preventive diplomacy, there is an agreement to resolve disputes peacefully among all of its members. Recently, the ARF has shifted its focus to non-traditional security issues such as health pandemics, disaster relief, maritime security and counter-terrorism; intra- state conflicts are not part of the agenda. Transboundary issues have be- come particularly susceptible to ARF consideration since they are seen as less politically sensitive, thus less challenging for state sovereignty and non-interference. This has, in turn, opened the door for Track II organisa- tions to become involved: their meetings are often held on the margins of ARF high-level meetings. 48 Notwithstanding, security dialogues have been held on sensitive topics such as human rights issues in Burma/My- anmar, problems in the Korean Peninsula, the South China Sea Islands, 45.

Peacebuilding within the region 23 non-proliferation issues and anti-terrorist co-operation. 49 The ARF provides a good example of how there has been an increasing recognition of the utility of NGOs as positive social forces rather than dangerous anti-government elements; the suspicion has traditionally been reciprocal, nonetheless, with NGOs in Southeast Asia reluctant to engage with regional intergovernmental organisations. 50 Regional co-operation in ASEAN continues to be state-centred and elite-driven with minimal civil society engagement despite the proliferation of Track II processes. Notwithstanding, some examples are emerging such as interfaith infor- mal dialogue activities between religious organisations in Southeast Asia following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US as part of the Council for Security Co-operation in the Asia-Pacific (CSCAP). Another example is the ASEAN People\u2019s Assembly (APA) which brings together Tracks II and III to engage in dialogue over social and security issues towards \u2018participa- tory regionalism\u2019. 51 The establishment of an ASEAN Security Community is also seen as a means of formalising enhanced participation by civilian actors in conflict management. Along similar lines to the ARF, the EAS came into existence in 2005. It was originally a Malaysian initiative backed by China which aims to move beyond a multilateral economic agenda in order to address issues of secu- rity, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. Its meetings are also hosted by ASEAN; additional members include China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and India. The US has not been keen to join the organisa- tion since, according to one commentator, 52 Washington prefers ad hoc multilateral security alliances as opposed to consensus-based decision- making as a means to deal with regional problems. Moreover, the same writer notes that the US favours APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Co-opera- tion) and the ARF as the lead organisations in economics and security in the Asia-Pacific. 49.

Peacebuilding beyond the region The countries featured in the case studies under scrutiny here have, with the exception of Japan, focused the bulk of their peacebuilding activities outside the region to contributing forces to UNPKO. Not surprisingly, much of the deployment of Asian UN peacekeepers has taken place out- side the region, with the exception of Timor-Leste in the Chinese and Japa- nese cases. 53 In all three cases, participating in UN peacekeeping missions is seen as a means to achieve an expanded role in world affairs, as well as a way of fulfilling their international responsibility towards international security co-operation. In the cases of India and Japan, participating in UN peacekeeping operations is seen as a minimum pre-condition to obtain a permanent seat at the UN Security Council. One expert 54 further argues that for China and Japan, participating in peacekeeping operations pro- vides both countries with an image of \u2018legitimate world powers\u2019 whose use of military force is sanctioned multilaterally and symbolises the interna- tional collective will rather than their national interest; this protects them from being accused of \u2018revisionist\u2019 intentions. China\u2019s strategic dialogue with NATO, which included recognising NATO\u2019s role in the operations in Afghanistan, was seen as a vital first step. 55 In the Japanese case, its con- tribution to the UNPKO has helped downplay \u2018anti-militarist\u2019 attitudes towards Japan among Asia-Pacific states, especially among ASEAN mem- bers, South Korea and China. It has also provided a strategic balance for Japan vis-\u00e0-vis its historical security alliance with the United States. 56 In fact, all three countries\u2019 peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities are in- fluenced by US pressure and its web of security alliances throughout Asia.

China constitutes an \u2018emerged\u2019 power and is on its way to become the leading global power, potentially surpassing the US in the decades ahead. Not surprisingly, its economic potential and size have led many to fear the rise of the Asian giant despite its \u2018peaceful rise\u2019 discourse which has evolved into \u2018harmonious development\u2019 as of late. The predominant view in China is that the country can enjoy a peaceful rise since existing condi- tions are conducive to it: any form of military conflict would adversely affect its economic development. 57 Part of China\u2019s strategy to avoid being perceived as a threat has consisted in promoting an \u2018independent foreign policy of peace\u2019 since Xiaoping\u2019s reform and opening-up policy from the late 1970s. One commentator 58 describes it as a pragmatic strategy that is ideologically agnostic, goal-fulfilling and driven by national interest: this includes avoiding confrontational relations with the US and other West- ern powers while simultaneously diffusing tensions along its borders. As noted by China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \u2018the fundamental goals of this policy are to preserve China\u2019s independence, sovereignty and territo- rial integrity, create a favourable international environment for China\u2019s reform and opening up and modernisation construction, maintain world peace and propel common development.\u2019 59 The emphasis on peaceful co- existence in Chinese foreign policy is not new, as the historical emphasis on the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence proves. China has also conducted a \u2018good neighbour policy\u2019 since the 1950s which has led to a shift in its relationship with its Southeast Asian neighbours, particularly ASEAN members. Yet, Suisheng Zhao 60 argues that Beijing only managed to have an integrated regional policy known as zhoubian zhengce (periphery policy) with its neighbouring countries, termed zhoubi- an guojia (periphery countries), after the early 1980s. From then onwards, in keeping with its overall foreign policy goals, Beijing has aimed to ex- 57. Andrew Scobell, \u2018China\u2019s Rise: How Peaceful?\u2019 in Sumit Ganguly et al .

        "27 3. Peacebuilding beyond the region plore common ground in the economic and security fields with its periph- ery: the ultimate purpose is to portray itself as a responsible power that contributes to stability and co-operation in the region. 61 China\u2019s partner status to ASEAN based on regional economic ties, as well as its participa- tion in the ARF and the EAS, further proves Beijing\u2019s keenness to become engaged in regional arrangements. What has changed is the fact that Bei- jing has ensured that it became ASEAN\u2019s largest trading partner \u2013 beyond the US \u2013 as a guarantee that its neighbours do not undermine their \u2018mu- tual prosperity\u2019. 62 This has borne fruit since, according to the expert just quoted, ASEAN members have become increasingly weary of subscribing to US-led regional security efforts as a result of China\u2019s proactive engage- ment in the region. Simultaneously, Chinese policymakers have realised that thinking local- ly demands acting globally: in order to ensure domestic security China has no choice but to ramp up its activities and efforts overseas, as it has to manage and meet the rising expectations of the Chinese people. 63 For this purpose, Beijing is currently focusing its efforts on participating in UNPKO, providing foreign development assistance as a form of \u2018soft pow- er\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis the global South while engaging in regional security arrange- ments. Aside from fulfilling its requirements as a \u2018responsible world pow- er\u2019, these are ways for China to strategically rebalance vis-\u00e0-vis the US and Western global hegemony. 64 One expert 65 terms it \u2018contingent multilater- alism\u2019 or \u2018counter-multilateralism\u2019: it is a means of establishing Chinese autonomy in the global sphere based on the logic of complementarity and reflexivity. From a Chinese standpoint the global system is imbalanced, which is reflected in the unipolarity of American dominance. 66 61. Ibid, p. 18. Zhao further notes how, economically, Beijing\u2019s good-neighbour policy is tightly linked to its aim to achieve economic modernisation and its share of rapid economic growth in the Asian region. Security-wise, China wants to avoid its neighbours becoming military security threats by settling border disputes \u2018through consultations and negotiations\u2019. 62.

        "28 Peacebuilding in Asia: refutation or cautious engagement? China has further shown a strong interest in ensuring stability, includ- ing its attempt to resolve its territorial disputes amicably, particularly inland frontier disputes which are not considered as important as coast- al and maritime territories; Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are still con- sidered vital for its national security. 67 In fact, Taiwan is China\u2019s Achilles heel: the way in which Beijing handles the Taiwan issue will have key im- plications for its own foreign and domestic policy, as well as for global perceptions of China. It is not coincidental that China has exerted its UN veto power most prevalently in matters related to Taiwan, Tibet and human rights. 68 In addition, China has sought other means of engage- ment through military co-operation and its own multilateral security mechanisms such as the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) and the Six Party Talks on North Korea. 69 Notwithstanding, its empha- sis on the principle of non-interference in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs has provided China with an ideal pretext to support so-called \u2018problem regimes\u2019 in the global South; this has often created concerns among the target country\u2019s neighbours. One such example would be the Chinese economic and military support for the regimes in Islamabad and Colombo which has tilted the regional power balance against India, raising eyebrows in Delhi. Similarly, Chinese support for rogue regimes such as those of Burma/Myanmar and North Korea leads to suspicions in the \u2018political club\u2019 of the Western elite, despite Beijing\u2019s quest to be- come a \u2018legitimate world power\u2019. 70 Leaving its global power aspirations aside, China is also keen to be seen as a leader of the developing world. Thus, it has emphasised its aid programme since the 1950s: total Chinese ODA in 2006-7 is esti- mated between USD 1.5 and 2 billion. 71 Of this, approximately 40 per- cent of China\u2019s ODA budget is granted to Africa and, specifically, to 67.

Peacebuilding beyond the region conflict-affected countries. 72 What makes Chinese aid most attractive to many developing countries, particularly those termed as \u2018post-con- flict\u2019, is the fact that it bypasses good governance and environmental standards, making a point of not interfering in the domestic political affairs of aid recipient countries. Instead, it highlights its anti-colonial and anti-imperialist solidarity with them. 73 This is particularly tempt- ing for governments experiencing internal civil conflicts which will of- ten face strong pressure from Western lobbies to implement good gov- ernance policies and pursue certain forms of economic development as a means to achieving sustainable peace. However, there is growing recognition in Chinese policy circles that human rights issues in re- cipient countries need to be considered when providing development assistance. 74 China\u2019s reticence to take an official political stance despite its lever- age in countries facing conflict situations has sometimes led to crit- icism and apprehension in the West: Sudan and Sri Lanka come to mind. 75 On the flip side, this provides China with valuable political capital which can be used to the advantage of UN peacekeeping efforts if Beijing wishes to engage in them, as was the case in Sudan. 76 Not sur- prisingly, many countries in the global South have supported China\u2019s \u2018hands-off\u2019 stance which they claim is more coherent than Western \u2018double standards\u2019 and selectivity towards certain regimes. Neverthe- less, China is increasingly facing a dilemma between its aspiring role as a \u2018responsible power\u2019, seeking to uphold the core norms of interna- tional legitimacy \u2013 which entail propagating democratic governance and respect for human rights \u2013 and its claim to be a voice for the coun- 72. Ibid, p. 224. Coates further provides a comprehensive account of China\u2019s shift towards weak multilateral- ism towards Africa which started with the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in 2000. This would eventually translate into the cancellation of debts of some African countries to China ac- companied by up to USD 500 million in development grants to the continent. This figure was doubled to USD 1 billion in 2009. 73. Giles Mohan and Marcus Power, \u2018New African Choices?

Senior Colo- nel Zhang Ping (Zhang), Deputy Director General, Peacekeeping Affairs Office, Chinese Ministry of National Defence, highlights how \u2018Chinese peacekeeping operations must be guided by three basic principles: consent of the parties, impartiality and no use of force except in self-defence\u2019. 78 Yet, China has recently established the largest training centre for peacekeep- ing and civilian police in Asia. 79 Unofficially, however, Chinese support to countries in conflict has sometimes entailed arms supplies to regimes in power. This has led to controversial situations such as the case of the AU-UN Hybrid Operation in Darfur (Sudan) where the rebels accused the Chinese of supplying arms to the Sudanese government, putting the lives of Chinese peacekeepers in jeopardy. In terms of the engagement of Chinese civil society in \u2018community building\u2019, this continues to be a sensitive topic for the regime in Beijing. While China has officially recognised non-governmental efforts as an indispensable part of China\u2019s economic and social development, suspi- cion towards NGO activities prevails. 80 Indeed, the blossoming of social organisations (SOs) and non-governmental non-commercial enterprises (NGNCEs) in China does point to a rise of the non-governmental and non-profit sector in the country as a result of the withdrawal of the state. However, one commentator 81 states that China only has a handful of NGOs; many Chinese foundations, trade associations, and professional 77. Suzuki, op. cit. in note 11. 78. Zhang further noted: \u2018Since its first participation in 1990, the PLA has contributed a total of over 15,000 military personnel to 18 UN peacekeeping missions. At present, we have deployed military units to the UN Mis- sion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the UN Mission in Liberia, the UN Mission in Sudan, the UN In- terim Force in Lebanon, and the AU-UN Hybrid Operation in Darfur (Sudan). These units are mainly tasked with constructing and maintaining roads, bridges and airports, delivering supplies and providing medical treatment.\u2019 Quoted in \u2018Chinese Soldiers Hone Skills on Frontlines of Peace\u2019, Global Times , 10 May 2010, available online at: http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/commentary/2010-05/530295.html. 79.

        "31 3. Peacebuilding beyond the region associations are in fact government-organised NGOs (GONGOs). Bei- jing feels particularly uneasy about the engagement of Chinese NGOs in the international arena; the Chinese regime particularly fears NGO activities that highlight China\u2019s shortcomings in the field of domestic human rights. However, \u2018over the past three years, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun to promote the involvement of Chinese NGOs in the UN\u2019. 82 According to one writer, this is also happening at a regional level. 83 Coates highlights China\u2019s support for several non-governmental initiatives in the region as part of the EAS: this includes co-founding the Network of East Asian Think-Tanks (NEAT) in 2003 together with their regional counterparts. India: a global peacekeeper but still a regional hegemon Very much like China, India too has since the 1950s highlighted the Prin- ciples of Peaceful Co-existence as a key cornerstone of its foreign policy. This is part of the so-called \u2018Gujral doctrine\u2019 of the 1990s whereby India acknowledged the value of establishing non-frictional and normal-to- cordial relations with its neighbours. 84 In recent times, Delhi has become even more aware of the importance of maintaining regional stability in order to achieve its global political aspirations. Thus, the regional power has sought a more stable and legitimate form of regional domination in South Asia through regional integration as opposed to unilateral he- gemony. 85 However, the leading regional organisation in South Asia \u2013 the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) established in 1985 \u2013 has progressed very slowly. This can be explained by the Indo- Pakistani tensions, as well as the widespread fear among India\u2019s smaller 82. Lin Cotterrell and Adele Harmer, \u2018Diversity in Donorship.

Particularly relevant to this paper are the following: (1) Agreements shall be between equal partners with equal sharing of benefits, with perhaps some concessions to the weaker and smaller neighbours: this will mean taking fully into account the sensitivities of the smaller neighbour; (2) India must remove from its own mind threat perceptions from neighbours except in the case of Pakistan. The perceptions of China owing to its friendship with Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are dismissed as absurd, as well as the fear that India\u2019s neighbours will \u2018gang up\u2019 against it and invade it.

        "32 Peacebuilding in Asia: refutation or cautious engagement? neighbours of its hegemonic role in the region. 86 Historically, much like other Asian countries, India has traditionally emphasised bilateral rela- tionships over multilateral ones at the regional level. 87 Yet, transnational civil society initiatives are increasingly contributing to normalising rela- tions among SAARC members, particularly between India and Pakistan: one such example is the \u2018Aman ki Asha\u2019 initiative following the 2008 Mumbai attacks. 88 Thus, Delhi\u2019s shift towards multilateralism, particularly regionally, is noteworthy. At a global level, India\u2019s engagement in non-controversial international security initiatives is epitomised by its contribution to UN peacekeeping forces as the third largest contingent of military and po- lice to UN operations in recent times and financial contributor to the UN Peacebuilding Fund (PBF). 89 It is noteworthy that two other South Asian countries \u2013 Pakistan and Bangladesh \u2013 rank as top contributors to UNPKOs despite not having the economic potential or global agenda that India has. 90 In fact, Pakistan and India have participated in joint UNPKOs. There exists additional scope for co-operation with Delhi\u2019s smaller neighbours, including with a view to using multilateral initia- tives to improve regional dynamics. Additional proof of India\u2019s increas- ing peacekeeping reputation is the fact that it has become a member of the Organisational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission as one of the top five providers of military personnel and civilian police to the UN peacekeeping operations. 91 Kumar 92 argues that this indicates Delhi\u2019s inclusion of its peacemaking capabilities in its foreign policy doctrine. Some experts 93 further note how India sees a role for itself in promoting democracy in the world without using military intervention, in contrast 86. Kishore C.

Peacebuilding beyond the region to the US: it is keen to become engaged in providing training to bureau- crats and sharing knowledge on constitutional, judicial and electoral procedures. Much like Taiwan for China, Kashmir is India\u2019s \u2018elephant in the room\u2019 in its quest for regional and global stability. Delhi is apprehensive about internationalising the Kashmir issue, largely due to historical resentment towards outside interference in the region, and even more so because of the importance of such a critical issue for its national security. Indeed, while India is keen to become a prestigious member of the global govern- ance club and actively pursues this goal, it will not take any risks when it comes to Kashmir nor vis-\u00e0-vis internal conflicts within its smaller neigh- bours. The official peace process which took place between 2003 and 2006 did not bear the necessary fruits at Track I level on the Kashmir conflict; this had a lot to do with other actors\u2019 interference in Indo-Pakistani rela- tions \u2013 Afghanistan, China and the US, among others. Yet, as argued by Radha Kumar, 94 the initiative did lower the degree of cross-border vio- lence in Jammu and Kashmir. Moreover, it enhanced informal dialogue among representatives of civil society: this, however, does not imply that civil society in Kashmir is strong. In fact, one commentator 95 notes how weakly developed it is, largely due to the highly politicised environment. 96 Notwithstanding, think tanks and policy experts working on Kashmir have mushroomed throughout India which has led to increased Track II initiatives \u2013 informal dialogues and secret talks \u2013 with their Pakistani and Kashmiri counterparts. Reflecting the Asian style of diplomacy, most progress is achieved informally using backchannels which allow for sub- tler means of exercising leverage. This is also how Delhi has chosen to engage as external third party in domestic peace processes in the region as attested for example by the Sri Lankan and Nepalese cases, particularly after its fiasco in Sri Lanka during the late 1980s. In fact, Delhi will cur- rently take great pains not to be seen as officially interfering in the inter- nal affairs of its smaller neighbours. 94. Kumar, op. cit. in note 12. 95.

        "34 Peacebuilding in Asia: refutation or cautious engagement? India also sees foreign economic assistance to other countries as a means to achieve certain political and economic goals. Nonetheless, Delhi is keen to present its foreign aid as \u2018technical and economic co-operation with other countries\u2019 and as an example of South-South co-operation in the case of developing countries. In Delhi\u2019s view, the wrong kind of aid, such as conditional or tied aid, can have counter-productive effects. 97 Indian di- plomacy has a long history of using \u2018soft power\u2019, having traditionally seen itself as a \u2018champion of the world\u2019s poor and dispossessed\u2019: it strongly advocates the interests of the developing countries, somewhat reminis- cent of its oppositional historical legacy in the international arena. 98 Not coincidentally, the bulk of Indian aid goes to Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal which shows its focus on its neighbours despite a large increase to Africa in recent times, both for economic and political imperatives. The 2004 Asian tsunami further constituted a watershed event: it transformed India\u2019s status from a traditional aid recipient to an emergent global donor country. 99 In line with its \u2018Look East\u2019 policy, India has sought to expand its rela- tionships with its Southeast Asian neighbours and Japan. 100 In doing so, Delhi also wishes to establish a strategic balance to Chinese influ- ence in key locations such as Burma/Myanmar and Southeast Asia. 101 Furthermore, it has also sought to counterbalance China\u2019s sense of su- periority as Asia\u2019s sole superpower which has traditionally played the Pakistani card to curb India\u2019s hegemony in South Asia. The nature of India\u2019s involvement in Asia focuses on economic partnerships with its neighbours, as opposed to the traditional forms of military hard power or political means of coercive bargaining. Thus, economic linkages are being prioritised as a new means of establishing regional security as- surances: Delhi sees economic assistance to other countries as a means to improve relations between countries, despite the prevailing \u2018Marwari 97.

Peacebuilding beyond the region psyche\u2019. 102 The ratification of the South Asian Preferential Trading Ar- rangement (SAFTA) within the SAARC framework, as well as economi- cally successful Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with Sri Lanka and Sin- gapore are proof of this. 103 In addition, new regional and sub-regional economic blocs, of which India is an integral part, are flourishing across Asia, such as: the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), 104 a Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Co-operation between India and ASEAN, 105 Joint Study Groups to explore comprehensive economic agreements with China, Japan, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand, Japan and Singapore and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Techni- cal and Economic Co-operation (BIMSTEC). 106 Nonetheless, Kumar 107 notes how India is increasingly engaged in maritime co-operation with Southeast Asian countries and Japan within the framework of the ARF and EAS, respectively: the idea is to protect commercial sea lanes in the Indian Ocean and East Asian straits through which over 60 percent of the region\u2019s energy imports are shipped. Japan: Asia\u2019s exception to the rule in peacebuilding Japan\u2019s involvement in peacebuilding is very different to that of China and India, as explained here: it has a much longer tradition of involvement in the conflict resolution component of peacebuilding, as opposed to peace- keeping operations. Japan has been actively involved in the peace proc- esses in Aceh, Afghanistan, East Timor, Mindanao and Sri Lanka. This is partly the result of the Fukuda Doctrine from 2002, as a result of which Tokyo has sought a higher political profile in Southeast Asia through its 102. See S.D.

It further has to do with its long-standing status as a leading global economy and G-8 founding member, albeit one that retains a distinctive Asian identity. As noted by one writer, 109 this allows the Japanese elite\u2019s security culture to display \u2018institutionalised and reflexive multilateralism\u2019, although not to the point of China\u2019s \u2018contingent co-operation\u2019. As an active participant in multilateral peacebuilding initiatives throughout the world, Japan has always highlighted the importance of territorial integrity. With its West- phalian mindset, Japan is reluctant to apply peace conditionalities while opting for a less vocal stance than its Western peacebuilding partners on human rights, particularly when it comes to condemning regimes in pow- er on the basis of human rights violations. This was reflected both in the case of the regimes in Jakarta and Colombo during the Acehnese and Sri Lankan peace processes, respectively. 110 Traditionally, Japan\u2019s security policies have been economically focused and broadly defined so as to include comprehensive issues such as energy security and \u2018human security\u2019, despite its recent shift back to a focus on more traditional security issues such as counter-terrorism. 111 For decades, Japanese security policy abroad was regarded as \u2018chequebook diplomacy\u2019 due to its extensive financial contributions but refusal to engage in any hands-on intervention. This was very much the case until the 1991 Gulf War which constituted a turning point: Japan\u2019s stance sparked strong criticism both domestically and abroad, including from its traditional se- curity ally, the US; Tokyo\u2019s global security policy was seen as \u2018clearly too 108.

Japan\u2019s views on \u2018human security\u2019 differ somewhat from this main- stream view in that it is based on the idea of \u2018freedom from want\u2019, also seen as an alternative to humanitarian intervention, as opposed to a justification for it, as argued by liberal interventionists. Then Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi made a speech in Hanoi in 1998 that called for the establishment of a trust fund for human security in the UN which came along with a substantial donation.

Peacebuilding beyond the region narrow\u2019. 112 As a result, an International Peace Co-operation Bill \u2013 PKO Bill \u2013 was voted into law in 1992 which included a set of \u2018Five Principles\u2019 as pre-conditions for the participation of Japanese contingents in peace- keeping operations. 113 The PKO Bill paved the way for the participation of a limited number of Japanese personnel in peacekeeping, humanitarian, election-monitoring and other non-military missions abroad under the auspices of the UN or a regional group. 114 Since then, the bulk of Japanese contributions to UNPKO have been financial and material, with minimal troop contributions to UN-sponsored peacekeeping operations in Syria and East Timor. 115 Japan\u2019s deployment of election monitors to Cambodia in 1998 and Indonesia in 1999 marked a significant departure from this policy. 116 It was during the late 1990s that the Japanese government made peace- building activities an essential part of its formal diplomacy. This brought with it an increasing role for non-diplomatic resources and non-govern- mental organisations in the field, away from Track I diplomacy. Nobuhiko Suto 117 notes that many NGOs were formed during the 1980s, mostly in the field of humanitarian assistance. However, the Japanese government continued to keep tight control on the financing of NGOs, particularly those which aimed to undertake politically-sensitive activities beyond humanitarian assistance: democratisation, disarmament and capacity- building were not recognised as legitimate fields of NGO activity then. 118 Some years later, Tokyo\u2019s signing of the Ottawa Treaty, banning landmines in 1997, was considered a major breakthrough by the NGO community in Japan and showed the government\u2019s increasing support for the concept of \u2018human security\u2019. This would eventually result in Tokyo\u2019s concern for 112. This view was expressed by then US Secretary of State James Baker during a speech to the Japan Institute for International Affairs in Tokyo in November 1991. See Ishizuka, op. cit. in note 56, p. 57. According to Suto, op. cit. in note 111, p. 155, there emerged a kind of consensus among the population in Japan following its failure to contribute militarily to the Gulf War that Japan should contribute more in the military domain and in the provi- sion of human resources to solve global problems; that too despite having contributed almost one quarter of the military expenditures of the military operation in the Gulf. 113. Among these were the existence of a ceasefire agreement among the parties to the conflict and local gov- ernments\u2019 approval of the deployment of the peacekeeping force.

Simultaneously, Japan would become aware of the advantages of its neutral position, unique location and financial means to become engaged in reconstruction and reconciliation efforts in conflict- affected countries. Suto 119 refers to Japan\u2019s crucial use of Track II diplo- macy, including roundtables and economic incentives to bring about de- mocratisation in Burma/Myanmar and support the peace processes in Sri Lanka and Aceh, respectively. In a landmark speech from January 2008, then Prime Minister Fukuda an- nounced that Japan would be a \u2018peace fostering nation\u2019 which contributes to peace and development. He advocated for a more active role for Japan in peacebuilding beyond the provision of economic development assist- ance. This entailed an active participation in peacekeeping operations and other international peace initiatives which included development projects focused on disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration and peacekeeping training in their own right. 120 This new approach is meant to go beyond the traditional emphasis of ODA on economic infrastructure and the em- powerment of local actors, shifting towards post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction projects. In fact, this has been a prominent feature of recent Japanese development assistance to Africa. 121 119. Ibid, p. 160. 120.

        "39 3. Peacebuilding beyond the region Japan in Sri Lanka Japan was actively engaged in the 2002 peace process in Sri Lanka as a member of the Sri Lanka Donor Co-Chairs Group together with Norway, the EU and the US. Japan\u2019s traditional alignment with the Sri Lankan government and its Asian identity made its stance unique among the Co- Chairs. Japan has held a special status as leading foreign bilateral donor to Sri Lanka for decades till recently. Yet, despite Japan ranking as one of Sri Lanka\u2019s top foreign donors, the island nation receives only 2.5 per- cent of Japan\u2019s total ODA.* Both countries share religious and historical ties, nonetheless. Japan\u2019s recent involvement in Sri Lanka epitomises its growing interest in reconstruction and reconciliation efforts in peacebuilding, not only in a bilateral way but also by embracing multilateral engagement. Tokyo made it clear from the beginning that it was willing to play a significant political role in the recent Sri Lankan peace process beyond its traditional \u2018chequebook diplomacy\u2019 posture. The appointment of Akashi \u2013 a senior diplomat with experience in UN missions in Cambodia and Bosnia \u2013 as Special Envoy to Sri Lanka in October 2002 confirmed this.** Japan\u2019s participation as a co-chair in multi-party peacebuilding has en- tailed the acceptance of certain aspects of a \u2018liberal peacebuilding\u2019 ap- proach such as the use of peace conditionalities and an emphasis on hu- man rights. However, despite agreeing to these measures officially, Japan did not in fact follow them through in practice in the Sri Lankan case. This goes to show how peace conditionalities and human rights remain controversial issues in an Asian context where Westphalian principles still dominate peacebuilding. * See Japanese MFA, \u2018Summary of the 2002 White Paper on Development Assistance\u2019, available online at http:// www.mofa.go.jp/policy/oda/white/2002/summary.html. ** See interview given by Akashi: \u2018Text of Yasuhi Akashi\u2019s interview\u2019, Hindustan Times , 25 July 2006.

        "41 Conclusion Conclusion This paper has sought to explore whether there is such a thing as a dis- tinctively \u2018Asian\u2019 approach to peacebuilding and how this is coloured by the Westphalian views and mindset of Asian countries. The picture that emerges is of certain common features that do indeed characterise an Asian engagement in mainstream peacebuilding activities, marked by caution but not by complete refutation of the principles that under- lie international peacebuilding. Furthermore, the Westphalian nature of Asian actors\u2019 approach to peacebuilding pervades both the regional and the global spheres, although it is more strongly challenged at a glo- bal level: this has to do with the liberal interventionist and solidarist undercurrents that permeate liberal peacebuilding. This is epitomised by the multidimensional character of both global peacemaking and peacekeeping initiatives which increasingly integrate state-building ob- jectives. Asian countries have shown an interest in becoming engaged in UNPKO as a means to fulfil their \u2018global requirements\u2019 as \u2018responsi- ble world powers\u2019, showing reluctance to engage in the traditional con- flict resolution element of peacebuilding, such as in the form of exter- nal third parties in domestic peace processes. In fact, the emphasis on achieving global power status particularly applies to the cases of China and India, in contrast to Japan: despite its differences with the West- ern conceptualisation of \u2018human security\u2019, unlike its neighbours Japan has historically addressed comprehensive security issues. The Japanese government has also adopted a much more proactive role in other coun- tries\u2019 domestic peace initiatives and reconstruction efforts compared to other Asian countries. Certain ASEAN members have also demonstrat- ed a similarly hybrid approach. Yet, China and India remain traditional in their defence of the Westphalian order, especially regionally, despite their contribution to reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan; this shows their growing pragmatism and geo-strategic considerations. Thus, ten- sion prevails between so-called Westphalian and non-Westphalian states in peacebuilding initiatives as is palpable in Asia with regard to the is- sue of interference in the \u2018internal affairs\u2019 of other countries, as well as the use of force. This constitutes a key feature of an Asian approach to peacebuilding. ",
        "42 Peacebuilding in Asia: refutation or cautious engagement? The paper confirms one of the key assumptions identified at the begin- ning: the fact that the motivations and purposes of peacebuilding by Asian actors differ substantially at the global and the regional levels. This is related to varying power and normative dynamics at play at these dif- ferent levels-of-analysis: Asian diplomacy will prioritise relationships be- tween countries, certainly at the level of official rhetoric; this constitutes another key feature of an Asian approach to peacebuilding. In fact, the exclusive use of consensus-based decision-making is a way of guarantee- ing that no decisions are taken that will put any country in a compro- mising situation: maintaining healthy bilateral relationships and \u2018saving face\u2019 remain the priority. Thus, the use of peace conditionalities and open criticism of other regimes\u2019 handling of their internal affairs, particularly if in the region, is avoided altogether: this is seen as degrading and counter- productive. Regionally, the priority is to maintain stability through mu- tually beneficial relationships with neighbours: this implies a fundamen- tal respect for the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of neighbouring countries, particularly within the framework of a multilat- eral arrangement such as ASEAN. The resolution of intra-state conflicts is considered as too politically sensitive, despite a growing interest in non- traditional security issues such as health pandemics and climate change. Emphasis is placed on economic co-operation and \u2018soft institutionalism\u2019 instead, which ensures that national interest dominates over collective commitments. Simultaneously, technical and economic assistance are seen as much more effective tools than \u2018hard\u2019 security arrangements for building long-lasting relationships; technical and economic assistance is based on the idea of creating interdependence which is seen as the ideal way to achieve regional stability and peace. In an Asian context, there tends to be great dissonance between rhetoric and actual practice. Political pressure is usually exerted behind the scenes through informal channels: the use of backchannels to exercise leverage over other countries is characteristic of an \u2018Asian\u2019 form of peacebuilding. India\u2019s recent engagement in Nepal and Sri Lanka\u2019s internal conflicts, as well as China\u2019s involvement in Burma/Myanmar and North Korea, demonstrates this clearly. ASEAN is a different case altogether due to its multilateral and regional character: it has played a constructive role as \u2018peacebuilder\u2019 in the region without direct involvement in the domestic affairs of its own members. An additional positive side-effect is the fact ",
        "43 Conclusion that ASEAN has become the catalyst for an improved rapport with other countries in Asia \u2013 particularly China and Japan \u2013 as well as with countries in South Asia and the Pacific through the ARF and the EAS initiatives, respectively. Moreover, in recent years the organisation has shown a grow- ing trend towards formalised regionalism. This could eventually lead to a stronger ASEAN collective identity and a higher degree of regional inte- gration, although it would also mean that individual countries\u2019 national interests might be compromised. The most rapidly changing variable when aiming to gauge what an Asian approach to peacebuilding consists of is the emerging view among state elites that civil society groups can have a positive effect and do not neces- sarily constitute a threat to the state: this mostly applies to NGOs that provide economic and social services. However, it remains a controversial topic when linked to NGOs dealing with politically sensitive issues such as democratisation, rule of law and human rights, which are embedded in a post-Westphalian approach to peacebuilding and reconciliation. Sig- nificantly, there are still those that argue both in Asia and abroad that the notion of \u2018civil society\u2019 is in itself a Western concept. Thus, developments regarding the accommodation of social organisations and non-govern- mental bodies in Asia, particularly in the area of peacebuilding, are hard to forecast. Nonetheless, the growing prevalence of non-governmental or- ganisations in informal and Track II negotiation channels does point to a growing tolerance among Asian political elites towards NGO activism, partly out of conviction and partly out of the urge to comply as \u2018responsi- ble world powers\u2019. This applies most strongly to China, in contrast to In- dia, Japan and ASEAN which have a longer tradition of state recognition of the role that civil society can play in informal peacebuilding activities.
